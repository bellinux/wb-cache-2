However, upon her return, she discovers that her room is being occupied by Edna and Harry, her parents’ so-called best friends. In her attempts {{to regain control of}} her bedroom, Julia makes everyone confront the issues of the play, namely, defining relationships, wants, needs, and rights.

According to Hamilton's recount, Maria approached him at his house in Philadelphia, claiming that her husband, James Reynolds, had abandoned her and she wished to return to her relatives in New York but lacked the means. Hamilton retrieved her address and delivered her $30 personally at her boarding house where she led him into <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> [...] "Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable". The two began an illicit affair that lasted, with varying frequency, approximately until June 1792.|$|E
500|$|When {{the trio}} arrive in New Harmony, they {{discover}} that Lilith is possessing {{a young girl}} (McCormick) and terrorizing her family.

500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as using}} {{existing}} music, {{such as the}} themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed {{a piece of music}} for Rose's farewell entitled [...] "Doomsday", which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies {{and the rest of the}} production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, [...] "I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> locked herself in her room and had a good old cry, really." [...] The piece uses the same vocal work from [...] "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the [...] "Song for Ten" [...] from [...] "The Christmas Invasion", that the [...] was released several months later.|$|E
500|$|On {{the ninth}} {{birthday}} of the severely ill Tamsin, parents Graham and Jan struggle with a camcorder and blow up balloons. A charity called WishmakerUK has arranged for pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, {{much to the}} excitement of Jan, accompanied by his personal assistant Si and WishmakerUK representative Sally. Frankie visits Tamsin in <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> <b>and</b> blows up a purple balloon for her. He begins to struggle for breath and then collapses from an intracranial aneurysm. Later, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is upset about Frankie's death. Si says {{that no one can}} touch anything or call an ambulance until Frankie's manager arrives. Tamsin, sitting in her wheelchair, holds the balloon; and Graham and Si realise that it may be valuable. Si takes the balloon from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally takes a call from her boss, but does not mention Frankie's death. She makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at the house. Graham and Si argue over the balloon, and Graham gives it to Sally, as he considers her [...] "a neutral". He looks online to work out how much the balloon and accompanying footage may be worth.|$|E

500|$|While Cox {{was working}} with Deerhunter to produce Cryptograms, it was {{considered}} Kranky policy to not print the lyrics of an album in its liner notes. [...] This was a rule enforced by label owner Joel Leoschke, who believed the practice [...] "demystifi {{the experience of a}} rock record." [...] Despite largely agreeing with this sentiment, Cox chose to print the lyrics of Let the Blind Lead, in part because he wanted to [...] "see what they looked like," [...] having ad-libbed the words of every song on their first take. [...] In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Cox described the lyrical origins of each song on Let the Blind Lead; they are largely autobiographical in nature, reflecting life experiences of his. The song [...] "Recent Bedroom" [...] conveys an experience Cox had when his aunt died: [...] "She was in <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> <b>and</b> everybody knew she was about to pass away, and she went out, she faded out, and everybody just started crying." [...] Although he was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by her death, it did not bring him to tears like the rest of his family. This event is expressed in the song by the lines [...] "I walked outside, I could not cry / I don’t know, I don’t know why". [...] Cox’s inability to cry stemmed from his having been [...] "very involved in drugs" [...] at the time, which he believes eliminated his [...] "childhood instinct…to cry." [...] The song attempts to communicate an emotional vacancy and sense of detachment characterized by [...] "moving from childhood to adolescence".|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{was born}} on January 7, 1881, in Tillsonburg, Ontario, a town named for his {{great-grandfather}} George. His grandfather, Edwin Delevan Tillson, was the builder {{of what is now}} the Annandale National Historic Site. As a child, Harrison was considered a troublemaker. On one occasion he locked his grandmother in <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> <b>and</b> on another became a local newspaper sensation after his attempt to travel to Cuba was discovered. In 1894, he was enrolled at the Upper Canada College in Toronto, but left the next year. At the age of 14, he ran away to join the 22nd Oxford Rifles militia, headquartered in Oxford County, but was returned home when it was discovered that he was underage. Soon after, he moved to New York City to join the United States Army Engineers and serve as part of the peacekeeping force in the Philippines after the defeat of Spain in 1898, and for a brief period to help put down the Boxer Rebellion in China. Mostly involved in the running of labor gangs building supply roads to remote areas, Harrison was involved in only one firefight. However, when his maternal grandfather, Edwin [...] "E.D." [...] Tillson (whose company evolved into Quaker Oats), discovered what the 20-year-old was doing, he used his connections to influence General Adna Chaffee into issuing a general order for the recall of Harrison from the field. While serving with the US Army, Harrison contracted cholera and returned to Canada. Using the inheritance he had received from his recently deceased grandfather, Harrison began attending the University of Toronto medical school before marrying Sybil Wilkin, a lawyer's daughter, in 1905.|$|E

[...] She was forced to drop out of that production {{a few days before the}} opening, due to “chronic, debilitating insomnia”. She then returned to New York, and started a program of cognitive behaviour therapy to train herself to be able to sleep better.
