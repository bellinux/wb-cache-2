5000|$|Confabulation {{is central}} to a theory of {{cognition}} and consciousness by S. L. Thaler in which thoughts and <b>ideas</b> <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> both biological and synthetic neural networks as false or degraded memories nucleate upon various forms of neuronal and synaptic fluctuations and damage. Such novel patterns of neural activation are promoted to ideas as other neural nets perceive utility or value to them (i.e., the thalamo-cortical loop). The exploitation of these false memories by other artificial neural networks forms the basis of inventive artificial intelligence systems currently utilized in product design, materials discovery and improvisational military robots. Compound, confabulatory systems of this kind {{have been used as}} sensemaking systems for military intelligence and planning, self-organizing control systems for robots and space vehicles, and entertainment. [...] The concept of such opportunistic confabulation grew out of experiments with artificial neural networks that simulated brain cell apoptosis. It was discovered that novel perception, ideation, and motor planning could arise from either reversible or irreversible neurobiological damage.|$|E

40|$|We {{write with}} a voice of the marginalised in mind, as both marginalised women {{scholars}} writing from a critical perspective on human organisation and as privileged human beings with concern for those more dangerously excluded from The Master’s House. The voice we raise does not plead for assimilation into circumstances as they are. It calls for radical change. Our <b>ideas</b> <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> research with Māori women accountants employed in organisations expressing commitment to Māori involvement. From that research we learned that aspiring to bicultural ways {{of being in a}} context prematurely deemed post-colonial is fraught with risks of co-option and unintentional collusion. Accordingly we are committed to further exposing neo-colonialism and to experiment with The Subaltern Voice (TSV) as a heuristic for this work. Asking what might be said in TSV that is different from what can be said in more commonly heard voices calling for inclusion has brought us to new thoughts about our own engagement with ‘The Empire’. Not only as it continues to colonise Māori locally and indigenous peoples globally, but from the myriad of places we take our positions to speak, sometimes ‘from the margins’ and other times from within the relative comforts of The Master’s House...|$|E

40|$|Theories of {{intellectual}} property take the individual inventor or the firm as the unit of innovation. But studies in economic sociology show that in complex fields where knowledge is rapidly advancing and widely dispersed among different firms, the locus of innovation is neither an individual nor a single firm. Rather, innovative <b>ideas</b> <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> the informal networks of learning and collaboration that cut across firms. Understanding innovation in this subset of industries as emerging out of networks of informal information-sharing across firms challenges traditional utilitarian theories of trade secret law—which assume trade secret protection is needed to prevent excessive private, self-help efforts to preserve secrecy. Doctrinally, knowledge network {{research suggests that the}} scope of trade secret protection in these industries should be narrow. In these industries, strong trade secret rights that grant managers tight control over employee-inventors’ informal information-sharing practices are bad innovation policy. Rather, optimizing trade secret law requires tailoring the strength of protection to match industry characteristics, narrowing trade secret scope in those industries where informal information-sharing networks are predicted to enhance innovative output. In turn, because industry types tend to cluster around geographic centers, the importance of tailoring cautions against current trends towards uniformity by federalizing trade secret law and favors state experimentalism in designing trade secret law and policy...|$|E
40|$|Continuous and quasi-continuous modules M are {{characterized}} {{in terms of}} lifting homomorphisms qo: N- • M to M, for certain submod-ules N of M. Throughout this note, R is a ring with identity and M a unital right R-module. Let N be a submodule of M. By Zorn's Lemma, the collection of submodules L of M such that N n L = 0 contains a maximal member K. Such a submodule K is called a complement of N in M. Note that if K is a complement of N in M then N © K is an essential submodule of M. A submodule K of M is called a complement in M provided there exists a submodule N of M such that K is a complement of N in M. It is well known (and easy to check) that a submodule K is a complement in M {{if and only if}} K has no proper essential extension in M. The module M is called continuous if it satisfies the following two conditions: (C 1) Every complement in M is a direct summand of M. (C 2) Every submodule of M is isomorphic to a direct summand of M is itself a direct summand of M. It is proved in [15, Theorem 1. 2] (see also [9, Proposition 2. 2] that any module satisfying (C 2) also satisfies: (Ca) For any direct summands K • and K 2 of M such that K•qK 2 = O, the submodule K • © K 2 is also a direct summand of M. The module M is called quasi-continuous if it satisfies (C 1) and (Ca). Thus, continuous modules axe quasi-continuous. These <b>ideas</b> <b>originate</b> <b>in</b> work of von Neumann [16], [17], [18]. They were developed by Utumi [131, [14], [15] for rings, were extended to modules by Jeremy [21, [a], and have been investigated byOshiro [10], and others. For a good general account, see [9]...|$|E
