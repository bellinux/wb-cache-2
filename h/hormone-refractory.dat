25|$|Antiandrogens {{that are}} {{currently}} on the market are particularly useful {{for the treatment of}} prostate cancer during the early stages. However, prostate cancer often progresses to a <b>hormone-refractory</b> state in which the cancer progresses in the presence of continued androgen ablation or antiandrogen therapy. This suggests that long term use of these antiandrogens during prostate cancer can lead to the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells or the ability of adrenal androgens to support tumor growth. This phenomenon is called antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AWS) {{and is one of the}} major drawbacks of existing antiandrogens. AWS is defined as tumor regression or symptomatic relief observed upon discontinuation of the antiandrogen therapy. The mechanism for this is not fully understood but current theories include alterations of the AR gene, coregulator proteins and/or signal transduction pathways. This antiandrogen resistance may also be linked to the relative weakness of current antiandrogens as they have an affinity 50 times or more lower than that of DHT for the AR. This may also explain why compensatory AR overexpression is often observed.|$|E

50|$|ERG can fuse with TMPRSS2 protein {{to form an}} oncogenic {{fusion gene}} that is {{commonly}} found in human prostate cancer, especially in <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer. This suggests that ERG overexpression may contribute to development of androgen-independence in prostate cancer through disruption of androgen receptor signaling. The fusion gene {{is critical to the}} progression of cancer because it inhibits the androgen receptor expression and it binds and inhibits androgen receptors already present in the cell. Essentially TMPRSS2-ERG fusion disrupts the ability of the cells to differentiate into proper prostate cells creating unregulated and unorganized tissue. In 90% of prostate cancers overexpressing ERG, they also possess a fusion TMPRSS2-ERG protein, suggesting that this fusion is the predominant subtype in prostate cancer.|$|E

40|$|The {{main cause}} of {{prostate}} cancer-related mortality {{is the development of}} <b>hormone-refractory</b> disease. Circulating serum levels of IL- 6 are raised in <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer patients and evidence from cell line studies suggests that the IL- 6 R/JAK/STAT 3 pathway may be involved in development of this disease. In the current study we investigate if expression levels of these family members are implicated in the development of <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry using IL- 6 R, JAK 1, STAT 3, pSTAT 3 Tyr 705 and pSTAT 3 Ser 727 antibodies was performed on 50 matched hormone-sensitive and <b>hormone-refractory</b> tumours pairs. An increase in expression of cytoplasmic IL- 6 receptor, with the development of <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer was associated with reduced time to relapse (P = 0. 0074) while an increase in expression of cytoplasmic pSTAT 3 Tyr 705 was associated with reduced patient survival (P = 0. 0003).

In this study, we investigate the role of PTEN deletion and protein expression {{in the development of}} <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer using matched hormone-sensitive and <b>hormone-refractory</b> tumours. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry was carried out to investigate PTEN gene deletion and PTEN protein expression in the transition from hormone-sensitive to <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer utilising 68 matched hormone sensitive and <b>hormone-refractory</b> tumour pairs (one before and one after hormone relapse). Heterogeneous PTEN gene deletion was observed in 23 % of hormone sensitive tumours. This increased significantly to 52 % in <b>hormone-refractory</b> tumours (P = 0. 044).

As case series, twelve patients suffering from <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer continuously on LHRH agonist underwent surgical castration. Additionally, one hundred and thirty-nine prostate cancer patients on LHRH agonist or surgical castration were tested for serum total testosterone levels. Results. Surgical castration caused decrease in serum PSA in one out of 12 <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer {{patients with}} PSA reduction rate 74 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} progression of prostate cancer during hormonal therapy have remained poorly understood. In this study, we developed a new strategy for the identification of differentially expressed genes in <b>hormone-refractory</b> human prostate cancer by use {{of a combination of}} complementary DNA (cDNA) and tissue microarray technologies. METHODS: Differences in gene expression between <b>hormone-refractory</b> CWR 22 R prostate cancer xenografts (human prostate cancer transplanted into nude mice) and a xenograft of the parental, hormone-sensitive CWR 22 strain were analyzed by use of cDNA microarray technology. To validate the data from cDNA microarrays on clinical prostate cancer specimens, a tissue microarray of specimens from 26 prostates with benign prostatic hyperplasia, 208 primary prostate cancers, and 30 <b>hormone-refractory</b> local recurrences was constructed and used for immunohistochemical detection of protein expression. RESULTS: Among 5184 genes surveyed with cDNA microarray technology, expression of 37 (0. 7 %) was increased more than twofold in the <b>hormone-refractory</b> CWR 22 R xenografts compared with the CWR 22 xenograft; expression of 135 (2. 6 %) genes was reduced by more than 50 %. The genes encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP 2) and 27 -kd heat-shock protein (HSP 27) were among the most consistently overexpressed genes in the CWR 22 R tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays demonstrated high expression of IGFBP 2 protein in 100 % of the <b>hormone-refractory</b> clinical tumors, in 36 % of the primary tumors, and in 0 % of the benign prostatic specimens (two-sided P =. 0001). Overexpression of HSP 27 protein was demonstrated in 31 % of the <b>hormone-refractory</b> tumors, in 5 % of the primary tumors, and in 0 % of the benign prostatic specimens (two-sided P =. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cDNA and tissue microarray technologies enables rapid identification of genes associated with progression of prostate cancer to the <b>hormone-refractory</b> state and may facilitate analysis {{of the role of the}} encoded gene products in the pathogenesis of human prostate cance...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the growth}} of {{prostate}} cancer is androgen-sensitive, metastatic disease has been treated by hormonal therapy. Almost all prostate cancer patients initially respond to hormonal therapy, but the majority gradually develop resistance. The mechanism {{of the change in}} tumors from being androgen-responsive to androgen-unresponsive is generally explained by clonal selection, adaptation, an alternative pathway of signal transduction and androgen receptor (AR) involvement. Since androgen action is mediated by ARs, abnormalities in ARs are believed {{to play an important role}} in the progression of prostate cancer. Hyperactivated AR gene mutations have been detected in 20 – 30 % of <b>hormone-refractory</b> tumors and functional analyses have demonstrated a wide responsiveness to estrogens, progesterone and anti-androgens as well as to androgens. The AR is highly amplified in 30 % of patients with <b>hormone-refractory</b> prostate cancer that has been treated by castration without anti-androgens.
