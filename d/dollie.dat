5|$|Odell Waller {{was born}} in 1917 to <b>Dollie</b> Jones and an unknown father, who died shortly after his birth. Jones gave the boy to her sister Annie Waller and Annie's husband, Willis Waller, to adopt, and Odell {{considered}} Annie his mother. Odell completed three years of high school, but was later forced to leave school {{to work on the}} farm. From 1935 to 1938, he was convicted of seven offenses, including assault, reckless driving, bootlegging, and carrying a concealed razor. In January 1939, he married a woman named Mollie.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her <b>dollie.</b> So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked <b>Dollie</b> and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and <b>Dollie</b> and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and <b>Dollie</b> must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Landis {{presided over}} the [...] "Ryan Baby" [...] or [...] "Baby Iraene" [...] case. The recent widow of a {{prominent}} Chicago banker, Anna <b>Dollie</b> Ledgerwood Matters, had brought a baby girl home from a visit to Canada and claimed {{that the child was}} her late husband's posthumous heir. Matters had left an estate of $250,000. [...] However, a shop girl from Ontario, Margaret Ryan, claimed the baby was hers, and brought a writ of habeas corpus in Landis's court. Ryan stated that she had given birth to the girl in an Ottawa hospital, but had been told her baby had died. In the era before blood and DNA testing, Landis relied on witness testimony and awarded the child to Ryan. The case brought comparisons between Landis and King Solomon, who had judged a similar case. Landis was reversed by the Supreme Court, which held he had no jurisdiction in the matter. A Canadian court later awarded the child to Ryan.|$|E
500|$|The {{localization}} of Trials and Tribulations {{was directed}} by Janet Hsu, with editing help from fellow localization director Andrew Alfonso. They changed several character names for the localization: Dahlia Hawthorne's English name came from the X Japan album Dahlia (1996), which Hsu was listening to {{at the time of}} the localization, as well as the short story [...] "Rappaccini's Daughter". Her nickname, <b>Dollie,</b> was a reference to an attempted fan translation of Trials and Tribulations, in which she was named Dolly. Among the initial ideas for Diego Armando's name were Joseph Cuppa, Xavier Barstucks, and William Havamug. Luke Atmey's catchphrase, rendered as [...] in the Japanese version, was going to be changed to [...] "Schwing!" [...] at one point; Hsu eventually changed it to [...] "Zvarri!", as she found it [...] "catchy and eccentric like Atmey himself". Because Alfonso, who is from Canada, wanted to [...] "show his Maple Pride", it was decided to make the judge's brother a Canadian.|$|E

Patterson treated Lizzie as a slave and left her to run the farm with Ned, a young Indian hand, {{while he was on}} business in Olympia. Lizzie and Ned eloped to Sumas (then the site of another Indian encampment), leaving behind Patterson's two young daughters, <b>Dollie</b> and Nellie. Patterson refused to allow Lizzie see her children again, but was unable to keep up the farm or take care of the children on his own. He convinced the Judsons to foster his daughters and executed a quitclaim deed in favor of Judson for his [...] and 20 cattle.|$|E
2500|$|Director D.W. Griffith joined Biograph in 1908 as {{a writer}} and actor, but within months became its {{principal}} director. In 1908 the company's head director Wallace McCutcheon grew ill, and his son Wallace McCutcheon Jr. took his place but was not able to make a successful film for the company. As a result of these failed productions, studio head Henry Marvin gave the position of head director to Griffith, whose first film was The Adventures of <b>Dollie.</b> Griffith helped establish many of the conventions of narrative film, including cross-cutting to show events occurring simultaneously in different places, the flashback, the fade-in/fade-out, the interposition of closeups within a scene, and a moderated acting style more suitable for film. Although Griffith did not invent these techniques, he made them a regular part of the film vocabulary. His prolific output--often one new film a week--and willingness to experiment in many different genres helped the company become a major commercial success. Many early movie stars were Biograph performers, including Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore, Lillian Gish, Dorothy Gish, Robert Harron, Florence Auer, Robert G. Vignola, Alan Hale, Sr., Blanche Sweet, Harry Carey, Mabel Normand, Henry B. Walthall, Mae Marsh, and Dorothy Davenport. Mack Sennett honed his craft as an actor and director of comedies at Biograph. After debuting at Biograph, Mary Pickford also became a top star at the studio and would soon be known to audiences as [...] "The Biograph Girl".|$|E
