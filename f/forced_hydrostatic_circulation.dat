40|$|Rapid {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} saline {{is known to}} suppress reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal tubule. It has previously been shown that this suppression is accompanied by two changes which in combination might account for the over-all decrease in reabsorption: {{a reduction in the}} intrinsic reabsorptive capacity of the tubular epithelium (C/πr 2) and a reduction in the ratio between tubular volume and GFR (πr 2 d/Vo). The present micropuncture experiments were carried out in order to study the possible role of altered peritubular physical <b>forces</b> (<b>hydrostatic</b> and colloid oncotic pressure) in mediating these two changes. Proximal tubular reabsorptive capacity, transit time, fractional reabsorption of sodium and water, πr 2 d/Vo, and intratubular hydrostatic pressure were measured in saline-loaded rats during acute changes in renal perfusion pressure induced by intermittent constriction of the abdominal aorta...|$|R
40|$|The {{underwater}} swimming manipulator (USM) is a {{new class}} of robots that combines the underwater snake robot's biologically inspired shape with the thruster actuators typical of other underwater robots. This combination makes USMs highly flexible and facilitates for inspection, maintenance, and repair in otherwise inaccessible environments. However, because the USM floats freely in the water, any motion of the manipulator will cause a reaction that affects the position and orientation of the base, and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> will cause rotations of the entire vehicle. This thesis proposes a USM control scheme that accounts for reaction <b>forces</b> and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces.</b> The approach is based on a method originally developed for robots in space, using the generalized Jacobian matrix. The generalized Jacobian takes base-manipulator coupling into account and allows manipulation without actuating the base coordinates. Applying this to a USM differs from previous USM control methods, which actively control the base link to allow fixed-base control of the end-effector. The previous methods require many thrusters, and the power to drive them. This thesis investigates if USM control with the generalized Jacobian is feasible, despite the differences between underwater and space robots. The complete control system is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and verified in the Vortex Studio real-time hydrodynamic simulator. Without <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces,</b> the system is found to be useful even without sensor feedback, with small tracking errors. With nonzero <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces,</b> sensor feedback is required for acceptable accuracy, and position feedback was found to give significantly better precision than velocity feedback. The thesis demonstrates that the generalized Jacobian can be used for efficient USM control, and is applicable to any underwater vehicle manipulator system, including underwater snake robots without thrusters. For USMs, this means that longer missions on battery power are possible and that the thrusters are freed to other tasks...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{qualities of}} water are well established and include buoyancy, water drag <b>force,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure and thermal conductivity. The large difference in these physical qualities, compared to land-based activities, affect {{the human body}} in both physiologic and biomechanical aspects. An {{example of this is}} buoyancy, which acts vertically against gravity on the immersed object thus decreasing weight of the human body. The buoyancy level is equal to the mass of water displaced by the immersed object and is based on the accepted Archimedean principle. When a human is immersed in water up to the level of pubis around 40 % of weight is accounted for, 50 % at umbilical, 60 % at xiphoid, and almost 80 % at the level of axillary. When immersed to their lower limb joint and waist in a water environment, humans can easily move, without gravitational overload, due to the buoyancy effect...|$|R

25|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The balance that develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational <b>force,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> balance occurs.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{theoretical}} background and a numerical solution procedure {{for a time}} domain hydroelastic code are presented in this paper. The code combines a VOF-based free surface flow solver with a flexible body motion solver where the body linear elastic deformation is described by a modal superposition of dry mode shapes expressed in a local floating frame of reference. These mode shapes {{can be obtained from}} any finite element code. The floating frame undergoes a pseudo rigid-body motion which allows for a large rigid body translation and rotation and fully preserves the coupling with the local structural deformation. The formulation relies on the ability of the flow solver to provide the total fluid action on the body including e. g. the viscous <b>forces,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> and hydrodynamic <b>forces,</b> slamming forces and the fluid damping. A numerical simulation of a flexible barge is provided and compared to experiments to show that the VOF-based flow solver has this ability and the code has the potential to predict the global hydroelastic responses accurately...|$|R

The mathematical model was {{developed from the}} equations of motion, assuming a homogeneous lake, negligible nonlinear accelerations, con-stant Coriolis <b>force,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure distribution, negligible horizontal turbulent shear stresses, and constant vertical eddy viscosity.

Water surface slopes were obtained from a numerical solution to the vertically integrated equations of motion, {{expressed in terms of}} a mass transport stream function and subject to appropriate wind stress and inflow-outflow conditions. Two- and three-dimensional velocity fields were obtained for uniform and curl wind stress distributions, for constant (average) and actual (variable) depth conditions, and for slip and no-slip on bottom.

40|$|Prior to an {{assessment}} of the role of aquaporins in root water uptake, the main path of water movement in different types of root and driving forces during day and night need to be known. In the present study on hydroponically grown barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) the two main root types of 14 - to 17 -d-old plants were analysed for hydraulic conductivity in dependence of the main driving <b>force</b> (<b>hydrostatic,</b> osmotic). Seminal roots contributed 92 % and adventitious roots 8 % to plant water uptake. The lower contribution of adventitious compared with seminal roots was associated with a smaller surface area and number of roots per plant and a lower axial hydraulic conductance, and occurred despite a less-developed endodermis. The radial hydraulic conductivity of the two types of root was similar and depended little on the prevailing driving force, suggesting that water uptake occurred along a pathway that involved crossing of membrane(s). Exudation experiments showed that osmotic forces were sufficient to support night-time transpiration, yet transpiration experiments and cuticle permeance data questioned the significance of osmotic forces. During the day, 90 % of water uptake was driven by a tension of about – 0. 15 MPa...|$|R
40|$|Fiber grating laser sensors {{have been}} {{attracting}} great interest {{because of their}} high signal-to-noise ratio and narrow linewidth that permit high resolution sensing. According to the working principle, fiber grating laser sensors can be classified into two types: wavelength encoding sensor and polarimetric heterodyning sensor. The former responds to external perturbations in terms of shift in the operation wavelength of the fiber laser, {{which is similar to}} that of fiber grating sensor. The latter converts measurand into change in beat frequency between the two orthogonal polarization modes from the fiber laser. The polarimetric fiber grating laser sensor not only has almost all advantages of passive fiber grating sensors, but also has a distinctive advantage of ease of interrogation. This is because the beat frequency is in the RF domain, which avoids the employment of expensive wavelength measurement devices. This type of sensor has been demonstrated for measurement of temperature, axial strain, lateral <b>force,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure, bending, displacement, acceleration, electric current, and acoustic and ultrasonic signal.

40|$|Proper {{design of}} seawall in {{earthquake}} prone region {{is one of}} the major concerns in geotechnical earthquake engineering. This paper presents the stability analysis of seawall under the combined action of earthquake forces, non-breaking wave <b>force,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> and hydrodynamic <b>forces</b> and uplift force. Stability of seawall is assessed in terms of its factor of safety against landward sliding and landward overturning modes of failures. Seismic passive earth resistance has been calculated using pseudo-static approach. A detailed parametric study has been conducted to study the effect of non-breaking wave height, depth of water on seaward and land ward sides, soil and wall friction angles, and horizontal and vertical seismic accelerations. The factor of safety against overturning mode of failure decreases by about 52 %, for a change in the ratio of non-breaking wave height to the depth of water on seaward side from 0 to 0. 60. Present study shows that the seismic stability of seawall is more sensitive to non-breaking wave height, soil friction angle, wall friction angle and horizontal seismic acceleration. Proposed closed form solutions and design charts can be used for the seismic design of seawall for passive case under the combined action of earthquake and non-breaking wave forces.

The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the <b>forces</b> that <b>hydrostatic</b> uplift can exert on a structure when it is subjected to a high water table using a flow net approach.

40|$|Abstract. The solute-solvent {{interface}} {{that separates}} biological molecules from their surround-ing aqueous solvent characterizes the conformation and dynamics of such molecules. In this work, we construct a solvent fluid dielectric boundary {{model for the}} solvation of charged molecules {{and apply it to}} study the stability of a model cylindrical solute-solvent interface. The motion of the solute-solvent interface is defined to be {{the same as that of}} solvent fluid at the interface. The solvent fluid is as-sumed to be incompressible and is described by the Stokes equation. The solute is modeled simply by the ideal-gas law. The viscous <b>force,</b> <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure, solute-solvent van der Waals interaction, surface tension, and electrostatic force are all balanced at the solute-solvent interface. We model the electrostatics by Poisson’s equation in which the solute-solvent interface is treated as a dielectric boundary that separates the low-dielectric solute from the high-dielectric solvent. For a cylindrical geometry, we find multiple cylindrically shaped equilibrium interfaces that describe polymodal (e. g., dry and wet) states of hydration of an underlying molecular system. These steady-state solutions exhibit bifurcation behavior with respect to the charge density. For their linearized systems, we use the projection method to solve the fluid equation and find the dispersion relation. Our asymptotic analysis shows that, for large wavenumbers, the decay rate is proportional to the wavenumber whose proportionality is half of the ratio of surface tension to solvent viscosity, indicating that the solvent viscosity does affect the stability of a solute-solvent interface. Consequences of our analysis in the context of biomolecular interactions are discussed...|$|R
