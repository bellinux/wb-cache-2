5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with the Sun or a planet or else be <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} {{match between}} Daivari and Tommy Dreamer followed with The Great Khali accompanying Daivari {{to the ring}} but was <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> ringside early on for interfering. After Daivari won the match using a roll-up, Khali came {{back out to the}} ring and gave Dreamer a chokebomb. EMTs came out to help Dreamer get up, but he ended up getting up on his own and headed backstage.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is that as Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E

50|$|In Armstrong’s {{biography}} First Man, astronaut Bill Anders {{is quoted}} as describing the LLTV as “a much unsung hero of the Apollo Program”. Although Armstrong had to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> the LLRV, no astronaut ever had to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> the LLTV, and every Lunar Module pilot through the final Apollo 17 mission trained in the LLTV and flew to a landing on the Moon successfully.|$|R

5|$|Bresnahan {{was known}} for baiting umpires. He and McGraw were often <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> games, suspended, and on a few {{occasions}} escorted from the field by police. A 1911 directive by NL president Thomas Lynch, compelling umpires to prevent catchers from antagonizing batters with verbal abuse, mentioned only Bresnahan by name.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} game of the tournament, Canada and the Soviet Union became engaged in a violent bench-clearing brawl while Canada was leading 4–2. Consequently, the game was {{declared}} null and void, and both teams were <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the tournament; while the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal and were guaranteed at least a bronze.|$|E

5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, {{but they can also}} use distraction with an ink cloud <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} bills were introduced, Social Credit MLAs were {{subjected}} to a new loyalty pledge, this one shifting the target of their loyalty from the Social Credit Board to the cabinet. Six MLAs—including former cabinet ministers Chant, Cockroft, and Ross—refused to sign, and were <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> caucus.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters. Secondary craters form when large blocks <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter {{on the side of the}} crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.|$|E

5|$|The {{main and}} halo rings consist of dust <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the moons Metis, Adrastea, and other unobserved parent bodies {{as the result}} of {{high-velocity}} impacts. High-resolution images obtained in February and March 2007 by the New Horizons spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> {{the volcano}} mainly consisted of water vapor, along with smaller amounts {{of carbon dioxide}} and sulfur dioxide. Further study by airborne monitors suggests that the materials were not oxidized much, and little of the concentration contained sulfates, less than 20%.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Thebe lies near {{the outer edge}} of the Thebe gossamer ring, which is {{composed}} of the dust <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> the satellite. After ejection the dust drifts in the direction of the planet under the action of Poynting–Robertson drag forming a ring inward of the moon.|$|E
