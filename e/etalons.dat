500|$|Fabry-Pérot {{thin-film}} <b>etalons</b> {{are used}} in narrow bandpass filters capable of selecting a single spectral line for imaging; for example, the H-alpha line or the Ca-K line of the Sun or stars. Fig.10 shows an Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) image of the Sun at 195Ångströms, corresponding to a spectral line of multiply-ionized iron atoms. EIT used multilayer coated reflective mirrors that were coated with alternate layers of a light [...] "spacer" [...] element (such as silicon), and a heavy [...] "scatterer" [...] element (such as molybdenum). Approximately 100 layers of each type were placed on each mirror, with a thickness of around 10nm each. The layer thicknesses were tightly controlled so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer interfered constructively.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line filters can be {{considered}} the optical equivalent of lock-in amplifiers; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal (almost always laser light) {{that would otherwise be}} obscured by broadband sources, such as daylight. [...] They are used regularly in Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems. Atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as interference filters and Lyot filters, but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background-limited detection, where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background. [...] Compared to <b>etalons,</b> another high-end optical filter, Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around US$15,000 per unit.|$|E
30|$|We {{believe that}} this {{distortion}} of the optics {{does not affect the}} parallelism of the two <b>etalon</b> plates, because the <b>etalon</b> plates are not directly connected to the <b>etalon</b> mount, and the <b>etalon</b> cell is a shield cell to avoid effects of the atmospheric pressure variation. The <b>etalon</b> cell is mounted in the optics using adjustable screws from the bottom, and thus, the weight of the sky scanner head does not come to the <b>etalon</b> itself.|$|R

[...] The optical filtering devices used have conventionally been <b>etalons</b> (stable solid-state single-frequency Fabry–Pérot interferometers in the form of thin-film-coated optical glass).

60|$|In {{regard to}} horses, Mr. Blenkiron, the {{greatest}} breeder of race-horses in the world, informs me that stallions are so frequently capricious in their choice, rejecting one mare {{and without any}} apparent cause taking to another, that various artifices have to be habitually used. The famous Monarque, for instance, would never consciously look at the dam of Gladiateur, and a trick had to be practised. We can partly see the reason why valuable race-horse stallions, which are in such demand, should be so particular in their choice. Mr. Blenkiron has never known a mare to reject a horse; but this has occurred in Mr. Wright’s stable, so that the mare had to be cheated. Prosper Lucas[330] quotes various statements from French authorities, and remarks, “On voit des <b>étalons</b> qui s’éprennent d’une jument, et négligent toutes les autres.” He gives, on the authority of Baëlen, similar facts in regard to bulls. Hoffberg, in describing the domesticated reindeer of Lapland, says, “Fœmina majores et fortiores mares præ cæteris admittunt, ad eos confugiunt, a junioribus agitatæ, qui hos in fugam conjiciunt.”[331] A clergyman, who has bred many pigs, assures me that sows often reject one boar and immediately accept another.|$|E

5000|$|In optics, a Fabry-Pérot {{interferometer}} (FPI) or <b>etalon</b> {{is typically}} {{made of a}} transparent plate with two reflecting surfaces, or two parallel highly reflecting mirrors. (Precisely, the former is an <b>etalon</b> and the latter is an interferometer, but the terminology is often used inconsistently.) Its transmission spectrum {{as a function of}} wavelength exhibits peaks of large transmission corresponding to resonances of the <b>etalon.</b> It is named after Charles Fabry and Alfred Perot, who developed the instrument in 1899. <b>Etalon</b> is from the French <b>étalon,</b> meaning [...] "measuring gauge" [...] or [...] "standard".|$|R
40|$|The dual-beam {{diode laser}} {{spectrometer}} described by Jennings (1980) {{is adapted to}} use a 50 -cm confocal <b>etalon</b> for frequency calibration.

An aperture is placed before the <b>etalon</b> in order to limit the entrance beam diameter to approximately 5 mm. Both ends of the <b>etalon</b> are furnished with two-axis adjustments. Initial alignment is achieved using an He-Ne laser, and final optimization involves adjustment of the cavity length as well as the <b>etalon</b> pitch and yaw. The 50 -cm confocal <b>etalon</b> produces fringes separated by 150 MHz (0. 005 /cm). With the aid of a CO 2 laser, it is found to have fringe widths (FWHM) of 2 MHz.

5000|$|Telecommunications {{networks}} employing {{wavelength division multiplexing}} have add-drop multiplexers with {{banks of}} miniature tuned fused silica or diamond <b>etalons.</b> These are small iridescent cubes about 2 mm on a side, mounted in small high-precision racks. The materials are chosen to maintain stable mirror-to-mirror distances, and to keep stable frequencies even when the temperature varies. Diamond is preferred because it has greater heat conduction and still has a low coefficient of expansion. In 2005, some telecommunications equipment companies began using solid <b>etalons</b> that are themselves optical fibers. This eliminates most mounting, alignment and cooling difficulties.|$|E
40|$|Several {{large-scale}} interferometric gravitational-wave detectors use resonant arm cavities {{to enhance}} the light power in the interferometer arms. These cavities are based on different optical designs: One design uses wedged input mirrors to create additional optical pick-off ports for deriving control signals. The second design employs input mirrors without wedge and thus offers {{the possibility of using}} the <b>etalon</b> effect inside the input mirrors for tuning the finesse of the arm cavities. In this paper, we introduce a concept of maximum flexibility that combines both of these options, by featuring wedges at the input mirrors and using the <b>etalon</b> effect instead in the end mirrors. We present a design for the arm cavities of Advanced Virgo. The paper focusses on evaluating the influence of <b>etalon</b> imperfections onto the overall Advanced Virgo performance. We use numerical simulations to derive requirements for the manufacturing accuracy of an end mirror <b>etalon</b> for Advanced Virgo. Furthermore, we give analytical approximations for the achievable tuning range of an imperfect <b>etalon</b> depending on the curvature and orientation mismatch of the two <b>etalon</b> surfaces.

The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig. 14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

50|$|The varying {{transmission}} {{function of}} an <b>etalon</b> {{is caused by}} interference between the multiple reflections of light between the two reflecting surfaces. Constructive interference occurs if the transmitted beams are in phase, and this corresponds to a high-transmission peak of the <b>etalon.</b> If the transmitted beams are out-of-phase, destructive interference occurs and this corresponds to a transmission minimum. Whether the multiply reflected beams are in phase or not depends on the wavelength (λ) of the light (in vacuum), the angle the light travels through the <b>etalon</b> (θ), {{the thickness of the}} <b>etalon</b> (ℓ) and the refractive index of the material between the reflecting surfaces (n).|$|R
