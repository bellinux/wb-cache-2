We outline our view of an integrated management frame and explain how our QoS management architecture fits into this framework.

40|$|The use of <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> {{applications}} {{is growing}} rapidly on the Internet. These applications are generating a huge volume of network traffic, {{which has a}} great impact on network performance and planning. For various purposes, obtaining information on <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic is important. However, traditional analysis methods based on well-known ports cannot be used to analyze such traffic. Because the majority of <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> applications use dynamically allocated port numbers, the traditional methods misidentify <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic as unknown traffic. This paper presents a method for monitoring and analyzing <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic. Our method detects transport protocol and port numbers for dynamically created sessions during a control session. We then use such information to analyze traffic generated by the most popular <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> applications, namely Windows Media, RealMedia, Quicktime, SIP and H. 323. We also present a system architecture that uses our method to monitor and analyze <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic voltage and {{frequency}} scaling (DVFS) in mobile <b>multimedia</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> that consume {{a large amount of}} energy cannot be continuously used in mobile devices because of battery limitation. The DVFS has been applied to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> in previous studies. However, they have only addressed the issue of power saving and overlooked the fact that mobile <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are sensitive to delays. The proposed method is intended to apply DVFS to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> considering potential delays. Another problem with previous studies is that either separate devices have been employed or appropriate frequency scaling values have been determined through complicated calculation processes to apply DVFS to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services.</b> On the contrary, the proposed method determines appropriate frequency scaling values using the characteristics of multimedia contents without employing any separate devices or undergoing complicated calculation processes. This has the advantage of allowing DVFS to be applied to real-time multimedia content. The present paper proposes a DVFS application method that divides <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> into video conferences, which are real-time services, and video streaming, which is a non-real-time service, and that reduces energy consumption in a simple manner while considering the constraints of service delays.|$|R

However, clients of a <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> may vary significantly in their processing capability and network connectivity. In addition, even between the same <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> provider and client, there may be dynamic variation in end-to-end resource availability. In such a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, the challenge in <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> is to provide each client with satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS), under the constraint of current end-to-end resource availability.

40|$|With GPRS and UMTS {{networks}} lunched, wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are commercially {{becoming the}} most attractive applications next to voice. Because {{of the nature of}} bursty, packet-switched schemes and multiple data rates, the traditional Erlang approach and Poisson models for characterising voice-centric services traffic are not suitable for studying wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic. Therefore, research on the characterisation of wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic is very challenging.

In order to provide QoS-guaranteed realtime <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> on IP-based networks, tightly integrated session and connection management is essential. SIP and RSVP-TE have been proposed as practical implementation solutions for the session signaling and the network connection managements. The current research works on the QoS-guaranteed realtime <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> provisioning have not studied the detailed integration of SIP, RSVP-TE, CAC and hierarchical traffic grooming of transport networks.
