40|$|This chapter {{examines}} how representations of Britain’s ‘imperial’ history continue {{to form an}} important part of contemporary mediated constructions of Britain. Specifically, this is explored in English national newspaper coverage of the 2012 London Olympic Ceremonies. Accordingly, while the English press served to frame Britain in relation to its imperial decline, the subsequent success of the Games revealed discourses that reflected, reinvented and reimagined Britain’s past within the present. Indeed, such findings are particularly relevant for exploring how <b>historical</b> <b>significances</b> are embedded in mediated constructions and (re) constructions of the nation during sporting mega-events...|$|R

5|$|In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, {{under the}} urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the {{spending}} of $8 million to study the collection and {{to begin the process}} of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of $66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study. Aside from providing concise histories of the equipment, the report also made recommendations as to whether or not each piece belonged in the now government-funded collection. <b>Historical</b> <b>significance</b> to the United States was a criterion of the recommendations. Many of the pieces of equipment that did not meet the report's recommendations were sold or traded for pieces that had <b>historical</b> <b>significance</b> to the DL grounds on which the site is located.|$|E

5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million.

The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September.

5|$|After the war, {{the walls}} of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were {{forgotten}} until its rediscovery in 1958. Due to their <b>historical</b> <b>significance,</b> an international search was conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. He made three trips to Singapore between 1963 and 1988 to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals were fully restored. In the 1990s, the former site of the murals was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|During the {{administration}} of Ferdinand Marcos, the region of Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7, 1975.

On the 405th anniversary of the city's foundation on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by Marcos as {{the capital of the}} Philippines for its <b>historical</b> <b>significance</b> as the seat of government since the Spanish Period.

5|$|For centuries, Taiwan's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants experienced economic {{competition and}} military conflict {{with a series}} of colonising newcomers. Centralised government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade, intermarriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity. For example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique <b>historical</b> <b>significance,</b> since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Andriamasinavalona is {{credited}} with founding Ambohimanga, a site of spiritual and <b>historical</b> <b>significance</b> that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001.

Andriamasinavalona gave the hill its current name, and when he divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants in 1710, he gave the eastern quadrant of Avaradrano to Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, who transformed his rova at Ambohimanga into its capital.|$|E
