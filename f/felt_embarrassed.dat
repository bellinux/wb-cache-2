25|$|In 1937, Maria Pavlovna {{visited her}} son Lennart {{and his family}} in Mainau. They bonded over their shared {{interest}} in photography and she got along with his wife, even though the grand duchess had been disappointed when her son renounced his royal status in order to marry a commoner in 1932. Maria Pavlovna, who had little maternal feelings, took no interest in her two grand daughters: Birgitta, then four years old and Marie Louise age two. She asked Lennart to call her by her name as she <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> {{to have such a}} grown up son. Thanks to Lennart, the King of Sweden, who sympathized with Maria Pavlovna, arranged a Swedish diplomatic passport for her to replace her old Nansen passport. This gave her a broader freedom of movement.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{reflected}} in 2004 {{that during the}} recording of the group's second album Doolittle he <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by [...] "Here Comes Your Man", but since producer Gil Norton really liked the song, the songwriter [...] "threw him a bone". Norton recorded the band performing the song's backing track when Black Francis was not available. The song featured a different arrangement from previous recordings of the track, and Black Francis added another verse to it.|$|E

60|$|Stephen was {{too well}} bred not to seem {{unaware that the}} {{previous}} conversation could have been <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> and at once began to talk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was at length to take place, so {{that there might be}} some hope of seeing her rain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those worsted flowers that were growing under her fingers.|$|R
2500|$|Though the Carpenters had mass popular {{appeal and}} were {{recognized}} as being musically talented, people <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> and stigmatised about liking their records. In later interviews, Richard stressed repeatedly {{how much he}} disliked the A executives for making their image [...] "squeaky-clean", and the critics for criticizing them for their image rather than their music.|$|E
2500|$|Guo Tu <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> {{after seeing}} that his {{suggestion}} {{had resulted in}} his lord's defeat, so he attempted to divert attention away from himself by accusing Zhang He of displaying schadenfreude upon learning of their defeat. Zhang He became afraid {{when he heard about}} this, so he defected to Cao Cao's side. Cao Cao was very pleased when Zhang He came to join him and he told Zhang, [...] "In the past, Wu Zixu failed to realise and met his downfall. What if he had abandoned Yin like Weizi and defected to Han like Han Xin?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1883 Otechestvennye Zapiski {{published}} {{two more}} of Merezhkovsky's poems. [...] "Sakya Muni", {{the best known}} of his earlier works, entered popular poetry recital compilations of the time and made the author almost famous. By 1896 Merezhkovsky was rated as [...] "a well known poet" [...] by the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. Years later, having gained fame as a novelist, he <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by his poetry and, while compiling his first Complete series in the late 1900s, cut the poetry section down to several pieces. Nevertheless, Merezhkovsky's poems remained popular, and some major Russian composers, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky among them, have set dozens of them to music.|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{signed a}} five-year deal with League Two side Notts County in August 2009. Campbell said that County, who had {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} a takeover by a Middle Eastern consortium, were the best club for [...] "where I am at the moment in my life", and that the recent appointment of ex-England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson as director of football played a [...] "big role" [...] in his decision. He made his debut for County in a 2–1 defeat to Morecambe at Christie Park on 19 September. He walked out on the club three days later, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 24 September. He later admitted he <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> and that [...] "I was being a mug" [...] in believing the club's owner's were ambitious billionaires who intended to take the club into the Premier League.|$|E
2500|$|Knightley {{appeared}} alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury's 2008 wartime drama The Edge of Love. The film had {{her play}} the role of Vera Williams, a childhood friend of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin Macnamara. Sharman Macdonald, wrote the screenplay with Knightley (her daughter) as Macnamara in her mind. After Knightley was signed to portray Williams, the character's role was increased with the film focusing on her romance and marriage with a British soldier. She based her performance on Marlene Dietrich, and was to mime to her prerecorded voice, prior to being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> while singing live: [...] "I was shaking like a leaf", but eventually went through with the plan. Upon release, the film became a moderate critical and commercial success. Knightley's performance and singing abilities were praised by such film citics as Ray Bennett who wrote; [...] "the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{third day}} brought {{frustration}} for all players alike and the spectators too, {{as the weather}} proved to be extremely unkind, delaying {{the start of the}} day's play and hastening its end. The 9,136 spectators who had assembled to witness whether their home team could inspire a fightback of the sort the Indians produced the previous day, but it was treated to long hours of waiting, and when the play did begin it seemed like a farcical proceeding, for the day's play began only at 3:18 pm and ended just 37 minutes later, at 3:55 pm. The day's play however, was not shorn of its drama and excitement. In the 38 balls that were sent down on the third day, one was enough to clean up the Australian tail. Ajit Agarkar bowling the first over of the day, bowled the first delivery of the day short and wide of off-stump. Stuart MacGill, the batsman played an ugly [...] shot, a clumsy sweep, which only succeeded in procuring an edge which ballooned to Akash Chopra at point. Perhaps MacGill <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by his own shot selection as he was seen grinning sheepishly to Nathan Bracken, the non-striker after his dismissal.|$|E

60|$|Herbert <b>felt</b> very <b>embarrassed.</b> If {{the mysterious}} missile came from these {{objectionable}} young persons, it was evidently {{because they thought}} they had detected a more accessible and sympathizing individual in the stranger who now occupied the room. He concluded he had better not say anything about it.|$|R
2500|$|After {{finishing}} the recording sessions for [...] "Eureka", {{he returned to}} the recording studio to work on the rest of [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion". During these sessions, Yamaguchi improvised an entirely different song, purely using musical techniques that he personally wanted to explore. The composition, [...] "Good-Bye", reminded Yamaguchi of the period when he first started making music. Originally he saw the song as an album track or a B-side, but found the melody had consumed him, and his confidence in the song grew. Yamaguchi felt distressed that he could not complete [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] during his sickness and exhaustion, and instead developed a strong desire to release [...] "Good-Bye" [...] in its place. Yamaguchi <b>felt</b> <b>embarrassed</b> at this, seeing it as selfishness as a musician. While talking to Tatsuya Nomura (the band's executive producer) about the situation, Nomura reassured him that although suddenly changing plans were not a good thing, it was necessary for him to address his feelings about releasing [...] "Good-Bye". Yamaguchi asked Victor Entertainment's management to liaise with Tōshin High School, to see if they would accept [...] "Good-Bye" [...] in the place of the already submitted chorus of [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion". Though they liked the song, the commercial had already been completed, so they were unable to replace the song, and began airing the commercials with the original song in September 2013.|$|E
