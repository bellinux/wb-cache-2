5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters can also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> in rocky areas {{that tend to}} be dominated by mussel beds. They remove mussels from rocks, liberating space for competitive species and thereby increasing the diversity of species in the area.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This resonance was later found to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the geologies of the three moons.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Moore won {{a six-month}} {{travelling}} scholarship which {{he spent in}} Northern Italy studying the great works of Michelangelo, Giotto di Bondone, Giovanni Pisano and several other Old Masters. During this period he also visited Paris, {{took advantage of the}} timed-sketching classes at the Académie Colarossi, and viewed, in the Trocadero, a plaster cast of a Toltec-Maya sculptural form, the Chac Mool, which he had previously seen in book illustrations. The reclining figure was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> upon Moore's work, becoming the primary motif of his sculpture.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E

5|$|De la Colonie {{was one of}} the few to escape, but the Elector of Bavaria {{had lost}} many of his best troops which was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the ability of the Franco-Bavarian forces to face the Allies in the rest of the campaign. Very few of the men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector's and Marsin's army. Included amongst this number, however, were the Comte d'Arco and his second-in-command, the Marquis de Maffei, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the Battle of Blenheim. Of the 22,000 Allied troops engaged, over 5,000 had become casualties, {{overwhelming}} the hospitals that Marlborough had set up in Nördlingen. Amongst the Allied fatalities were six lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, and 28 brigadiers, colonels and lieutenant-colonels, reflecting the exposed positions of senior officers as they led their men forward in the assaults. No other action in the War of the Spanish Succession claimed so many lives of senior officers.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators {{throughout}} their global distribution, and can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> {{on the behavior}} and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves {{may be responsible for}} annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had {{the keys to the}} chapel, let Raphael in to examine the {{paintings}} in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points out that even earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E

25|$|Several {{steps in}} the gene {{expression}} process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and {{is the basis for}} cellular differentiation, morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Also it depends on the state of activator RNA. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.|$|E
25|$|Diarrhea {{can cause}} {{electrolyte}} imbalances, renal impairment, dehydration, and defective immune system responses. When oral drugs are administered, {{the efficiency of}} the drug is to produce a therapeutic effect and the lack of this effect {{may be due to the}} medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>profound</b> <b>effect</b> on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults in long term care facilities (nursing homes).|$|E
