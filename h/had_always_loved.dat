25|$|The 1992 Stephen E. Ambrose book Band of Brothers claimed Speirs' English {{wife had}} left him and {{returned}} to her first husband whom she thought had died during the war. Speirs denied this claim. In a 1992 letter written to Richard Winters, Speirs wrote that his first wife simply did not want to move to America with him and be away from her family in England. He also stated his wife was never a widow to begin with and that he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> her.|$|E
25|$|Assisted by Lucifer, {{ruler of}} the demons who loves Alexiel, Rosiel unseals the Tower of Etenamenki, where God rests, with Alexiel's body. Intent on {{restoring}} the Earth, Setsuna follows him, with Kurai and the archangels of fire and earth; along the way, he aids an injured Katan, who hopes to save Rosiel before he loses his free will to do so. At the tower, Rosiel kills Katan, only {{to realize that he}} had killed the one he loved and tried to protect from himself; he then goes into a state of destructive despair. Awakening in her own body with Setsuna's help, Alexiel reveals to him that she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> him: because he had been born the opposite of his healthy sister, she bargained with God to save his life in exchange for her imprisonment, from which she later escaped with Lucifer, and an agreement to never show him any compassion. She then kills him, and absorbs him into her womb so that they will never be apart again. Before dying, Rosiel passes along his power to Setsuna.|$|E

Smith told Cook [...] "I don't know whether Daphne actually needs {{a man in}} her life but she's certainly got two men there. It's a triangle that's developed, but to try and give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she {{had a great deal of}} love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times and stood up once by Daphne, Des <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Ray of Light" [...] was among these tracks. It {{is based on the}} track [...] "Sepheryn" [...] (1971), by English folk music duo Curtiss Maldoon (consisting of Dave Curtiss and Clive Maldoon). In 1996, English singer and songwriter Christine Leach, Maldoon's niece, had recorded her version of the track.

The couple, happy in poverty, are now rapidly drifting on the shoals of matrimonial disaster, but the child saves them. She is weeping one day when Miss Brent, the society woman, enters the room. Miss Brent, who has never seen the child before, asks the cause of her sorrow, and tries to comfort her. The child tells her, and Julia's heart is touched. Though she has contemptously ignored the wife, she feels that she cannot ruin {{the life of the}} helpless child, even to win the artist's love. On the spur of the moment, she writes a farewell note to Jack, and gives it to the child, saying that it will cure all her sorrow. Then she goes out of their lives forever. Jack realizes, when he sees that his child is the messenger, why Julia has broken with him. An outsider had made a sacrifice to save the future of little Marie, when he, her father, who <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> her, had selfishly forgotten his duty. Remorsefully, he tears up the letter, and destroys the painting, not angrily, but as a symbol that he had cast the original out of his life. Then he makes peace with his wife and daughter, who are joyfully ready to forgive, and tells them that their love will keep him [...] the right path {{for the rest of his}} life, and that the lesson he has been taught will never be forgotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eszterhas came up {{with the}} idea for Showgirls while on {{vacation}} at his home in Maui, Hawaii. During lunch in Beverly Hills, Verhoeven told Eszterhas that he <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> [...] "big MGM musicals", and wanted to make one; Eszterhas suggested the setting of Las Vegas. Based on the idea he scribbled on a napkin, Eszterhas was advanced $2 million to write the script and picked up an additional $1.7 million when the studio produced it into a film. This, along with the scripts for both Verhoeven's previous film Basic Instinct (1992) and Sliver (1993; also an erotic thriller starring Sharon Stone), made Eszterhas the highest paid screenwriter in Hollywood history. Verhoeven deferred 70% of his $6 million director's fee depending on if the film turned a profit.|$|E
