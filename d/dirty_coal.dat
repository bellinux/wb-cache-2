40|$|Coal in {{the finer}} {{particle}} size ranges (below 1 mm) has always suffered from poor cleaning efficiencies. This {{problem has been}} exacerbated in recent years with the increased amount of high ash fines due to continuous mining machines and the mining of <b>dirtier</b> <b>coal</b> seams. In the present work, it is proposed to improve overall plant efficiencies by processing coarser coal in column flotation than is now commonly treated by that method. Column flotation for coarse coal is supported by actual lab and plant test data that result in a full-scale column plant installation. The fundamentals of coarse particle detachment from bubbles are reviewed and a new simplified model is developed which better handles cubical and rectangular coal particles. Much of the lower efficiency of fine coal cleaning is due to poor size separation of the fine-sized raw coal which results in misplaced high ash fines reporting to the coarser size streams. By sending coarser material to column flotation, the finest size separation {{that takes place in}} a plant can be as coarse as 0. 5 mm or greater. The proper use of wash water in a flotation column then becomes the best mechanism for desliming of the high ash clays. This work quantifies the benefits of removing the high ash fines from the plant product and increasing overall plant yield by increasing the amount of near-gravity coarse material. The resulting yield gain is greater than that obtained from only the increased fine coal recovery. Methods of column operation for improved coarse coal recovery are also evaluated. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Great appreciation is expressed to my advisor, Dr. Roe-Hoan Yoon, for his encouragement and guidance throughout the duration of this investigation.

40|$|Optimal climate {{policy is}} studied. Coal, the {{abundant}} resource, contributes more CO 2 {{per unit of}} energy than the exhaustible resource, oil. We characterize the optimal sequencing oil and coal and departures from the Herfindahl rule. "Preference reversal" can take place. If <b>coal</b> is very <b>dirty</b> compared to oil, there is no simultaneous use. Else, the optimal outcome starts with oil, before using oil and coal together, and finally coal on its own, The "laissez-faire" outcome uses coal forever or starts with oil until {{it is no longer}} profitable to do so and then switches to coal. The optimum requires a steeply rising CO 2 tax during the oil-only phase and a less steeply rising CO 2 tax during the subsequent oil-coal and coal-only phases to avoid the abrupt switch from oil to coal thus leaving a lot of oil in situ. Finally, we analyze the effects on the opitamal transition times and carbon tax of a carbon-free, albeit expensive backstop (solar or wind). Without a carbon tax, a prohibitive coal tax leads to less oil in situ, substantially delays introduction of renewable, and thus curbs global warming substantially. Subsidizing renewables to just below the cost of coal does not affect the oil-only phase. The gain in green welfare dominates the welfare cost of the subsidy if the subsidy gap is small and the global warming challenge is acute.

40|$|There is {{a rather}} {{remarkable}} and surprisingly uncontroversial result in economic theory known as the Second Welfare Theorem: under certain idealized conditions, a competi-tive free-market economy will achieve Pareto optimality. Pareto optimality is a widely-accepted, weak condition for a well-functioning economy: there are no changes that can improve one person’s welfare without harming {{at least one other}} person. All undisputable welfare improvements have been made. However, the conditions required for competitive markets to have this property are far from the conditions of real economies. The cen-tral tasks of environmental economics are to identify market failures that prevent Pareto optimality, and to design remedies for these failures. Externalities are the most pervasive type of market failure. An externality is present when the activity of one person has an inadvertent impact on the well-being of another person. Environmental externalities are common because the use of many resources im-poses costs on society, but the user of the resource is not charged a price equal to the cost imposed. For example, the smoke emitted by a factory unintentionally worsens air quality for nearby residents. The factory owner pays for the steel and oil used in production, but not for the use of clean air. 1 Externalities prevent the achievement of Pareto optimality because the polluter does not equate his or her incremental benefit of generating a bit more pollution to the incre-mental social cost of that pollution. To see this, suppose a factory can lower its production cost by buying much dirtier but slightly cheaper coal. The benefit to the factory is a small cost savings. The cost to society is the greater air pollution. If the factory owner keeps the cost savings and doesn’t bear the cost of dirty air, even the smallest cost savings will be pursued, no matter how <b>dirty</b> the <b>coal.</b> Suppose the cost savings is $ 1, but the social cost o...|$|R

As the economy tries to maximise output per unit of emissions {{it is not only}} carbon content that matters: productivity matters as well. With an announced constraint the economy first substitutes towards the less productive input such that more of the productive input is available when constrained.

40|$|Using a {{standard}} Hotelling model of resource exploitation, we determine the optimal consumption paths of three energy resources: <b>dirty</b> <b>coal,</b> which is depletable and carbon-emitting; clean coal, {{which is also}} depletable but carbon-free thanks to an abatement technology (CCS: Carbon Capture and Storage), and solar energy which is renewable and carbon-free. Carbon emissions are released into the atmosphere and {{we assume that the}} atmospheric carbon stock cannot exceed a given ceiling. We consider learning-by-doing in the abatement technology, implying that the marginal CCS cost is decreasing in the cumulative consumption of clean coal. We show the following results. i) Learning-by-doing does not imply "early" capture, i. e. the clean coal exploitation must begin at the earliest once the carbon cap is reached. ii) The energy price path can evolve non-monotonically over time. iii) When the solar cost is low enough, there may exist unusual energy consumption sequence along which solar energy is interrupted for some time and replaced by clean coal...|$|E
40|$|As {{addressing}} {{climate change}} becomes {{a high priority}} {{it seems likely that}} there will be a surge in interest in deploying nuclear power. Other fuel bases are too <b>dirty</b> (<b>coal),</b> too expensive (oil, natural gas) or too speculative (solar, wind) to completely supply the energy needs of the global economy. To the extent that the global society does in fact choose to expand nuclear power there will be a need for additional production. That increase in demand for nuclear power will inevitably lead to an increase in demand for uranium. While some of the increased demand for uranium will be satisfied by expanding production from existing deposits, there will undoubtedly be pressure to find and develop new deposits, perhaps quite rapidly. Looking forward, it is important that policies be put in place that encourage an optimal allocation of future resources towards exploration. In particular, I argue there is a valid concern that privately optimal levels of industrial activity will fail to fully capture all potential social gains; these sub-optimal exploration levels are linked to a departure between the private and social values of exploration information...|$|E

40|$|The best {{evidence}} of an adverse human health effect is a properly conducted epidemiological study. But human beings {{should not be the}} sole test animal. Properly conducted animal studies {{have been shown to be}} predictive for carcinogenicity and toxicologic responses in human populations. We need to develop more efficient predictive animal tests for all the common serious toxic effects caused by chemicals. One particularly important use of epidemiolgical studies is to validate (or invalidate) the laboratory animal experiments. There is no more powerful tool than the combination of well conducted animal experiments and well conducted epidemiobgical experiments. The whole issue of the relevance of the results of laboratory animal toxicology studies to the human experience is a difficult, yet important problem. It is even more difficult when one looks at it in the light of our nation's need for energy from coal. Shy has described most eloquently the complex problems of extracting, transporting, and combusting an intrinsically <b>dirty</b> material like <b>coal</b> (1). There are hundreds of potentially toxic compounds involved, although the ones that we think about most commonly in terms of air pollutants affecting the general population are SO, and NO,, the trace and heavy metals, oxidants, particulates, etc. There are, in addition, the large number of benzpyrene type compounds which are likely to be hazardous. We also must be concerned about synergistic effects with such a large mixture of compounds. The art and science of predicting synergistic toxic effects of two or more compounds and extrapolating such effects from laboratory animal systems to human populations is primitive. Let me note the studies by Laskin and the New York University group (2) in which concentrations of benzpyrene that do not normally cause broncogenic carcinoma in rats will cause broncogenic carcinoma with the addition of inhaled S 02.

40|$|For APO Barney Foran reviews Urban Consumption, {{edited by}} Peter Newton, CSIRO Publishing   	  Following on {{from his book}} on Urban Transitions, also {{published}} by CSIRO, Peter Newton’s new collection musters eighteen data rich chapters by leading Australian and international researchers. Several compelling take home messages emerge. The first is that policy must focus on direct and indirect effects of spending patterns. Spending volume drives total environmental impact and also GDP, (thus setting up a Sophie’s Choice for sustainability policy wonks who might get this book in their Christmas stocking). For example, dense cities with light rail are terrific for local air pollution and pedestrian access but they don’t solve global greenhouse because we shop till we drop, and the emissions savings from our non-car gets released through other production chains. Our yearly direct energy use through dietary intake is 4. 5 gigajoules (GJ) but the food system of production, processing and delivery uses 40 GJ, a ten-fold difference. Increasing numbers of people per household certainly reduces direct energy use through the sharing of cooking and household appliances, but these savings are countered by increased purchases. Thus environmental savings are difficult to achieve solely through the personal choice route. Probably {{they have to be}} imposed top-down through urban structural change and constraining our shop and spend lifestyle. Most insightful to this physical scientist’s views were the chapters on the evolution of the Australian household (Bourke and Ralston), the psychological drivers of consumption (Kyrios), consumer sentiment (Chua and Claus) and a consumerist life (Corrigan). The evolution of Australian households brings wry amusement at our urban plight. The wrap-around urban block with detached house allows us to aspire to everything; swimming pools, triple garages and most importantly the home theatre. The downside for the risk averse is debt, now 160 % of disposable household income, a quadrupling since 1977. Intervention points are difficult to determine, so pervasive is the requirement for everything that moves in the ‘new normal’ household. Compulsive buying is facilitated by two to three cards per person each providing credit of $ 3, 000 or more. This in turn provides super profits for the big four banks further entrenching the dependencies, particularly if one’s portfolio sports blue chip shares. Manipulation is central to maintaining the consumer rage and although I studiously avoid the constancy of a digitally linked device on the cappuccino journey, I find that my Panama hat and farmers market purchases are as much an expression of ‘me’, as those I believe are captured by the status quo. For 35 years we’ve diligently surveyed consumerist sentiment and thus our willingness to spend. Minister’s and CEOs watch little else it appears, and if sentiment’s on a downer then the Reserve Bank uses interest rates or quantitative easing to revitalise our optimism. Trouble is the more we spend the more we impact environmentally through all the items in our full shopping trolleys. One wonders whether this sentiment science could be subverted to effectively ‘kick them when they are down’, so burrowing through to lower spending, lower debt and lower impact all round. Turner’s systems chapter provides the comprehensive integration and robust modelling of a ‘big Australia’ that Immigration Ministers get their bureaucrats to shaft at every opportunity. Turner compares the ABS population projections of 40 million people, 34, 29 and 21 million people by 2050 under integrated policy settings of ‘business as usual’, ‘lifestyle change’ and ‘technological investment’. The higher rates of population growth, combined with expected labour force efficiencies, produce alarming outcomes for headline indicators of such as oil imports, international debt, pollution levels, water availability and unemployment. The only way out of unemployment tensions is to double consumption, so blowing the lid of Treasury’s carefully crafted low carbon transition plan. To transition to an Australia that is even vaguely sustainable requires a low and stabilised population number, a 1970 ’s level of consumption, aggressive implementation of the best technologies we have today and for everyone to transition to a three day working week over a ten year period. The challenge of doing these things simultaneously, and perhaps {{out of step with the}} rest of our trading partners, is immense. Turner views our capacity to think this, let alone do this, as highly improbable. The book needs a supplementary ‘dummies guide’ to highlight the collection’s many insights. Did you know that green voters talk big, but consume water and energy at similar rates to their conservative-voting neighbours? That our household waste has the same emissions volume as Hazelwood power station, our <b>dirtiest</b> brown <b>coal</b> generator? Or that stopping waste would knock $ 500 million off our retailers’ bottom line and possibly put the sector on the skids? The idea that dense cities will save us is just another urban myth. Over a third of Sydney’s high-density housing stock is held under strata title, fuelled by negative gearing and superannuation investments. Owner’s have little incentive to help tenants lower their energy and water use. High rise apartments have the largest direct greenhouse emissions per capita due to lifts, communal hot water and electricity-only energy sources. Most data-rich chapters dissect impacts by income levels and demographic class, a vital requirement for sensitive and equitable policy intervention. One criticism of this collection of hard environmental insights is that it fails to join the obvious dots and to craft a compelling narrative of where Australia is headed. This reviewer’s attempt, from a bottom up perspective, is that we live in the largest houses in the world, over 50 % of us are gluttons, we surround our insecurities with gadgets which we finance from high levels of personal debt, and thus generate among the highest levels of environmental impact globally. From a top down perspective, shopping and debt drives our GDP, our urban structures are oil-dependent and health sapping, transformational attempts are meagre, while enabling infrastructure such as electricity generators are greenhouse intensive. As Chapter 2 concludes, “The consequence has been the creation of a materially comfortable (if financially vulnerable) but psychologically insecure citizens [...] . ”. Well done Australia! Joining the dots suggests that Australia’s urban consumption system needs a complete collapse and a hard landing to shake its complacency. If society could emerge with half the spending power we’d ramp down environmental impacts, eat less and probably be fitter and happier. It’s about time that science states the bleeding obvious instead of just leaving us with options, should we choose to desist from 24 / 7 shopping. I hope there’s a third book in this series that can grasp the intellectual freedom to escape the shackles of the thought police and the shadowy ministerial minders and give us the full picture.
