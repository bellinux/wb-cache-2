40|$|Several recent {{papers have}} {{described}} probability models which used graph and hypergraphs to represent {{relationships among the}} variables. Two related computing algorithms are commonly used to manipulate such models: the peeling algorithm which eliminates variables {{one at a time}} to find the marginal distribution of a single variable, and the <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>propagation</b> algorithm which simultaneously solves for many marginal distributions by passing messages in a Tree of Cliques whose nodes correspond to subsets of variables. The peeling algorithm requires an elimination order. As demonstrated in this paper, the elimination order can in turn be used to construct a Tree of Cliques for propagation and fusion. This paper addresses three computational issues: 1) The choice of elimination order determines the size of the largest node of the Tree of Cliques, which dominates the computational cost for the probability model using either peeling or <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>propagation.</b> We review heuristics for choosing an elimination order. (2) Inserting intersection nodes into the tree of cliques produces a junction tree which has a lower computational cost. We present an algorithm which produces a junction trees with a high computational efficiency. (3) Augmenting the tree of cliques with additional nodes can lead to a new tree structure which more clearly expresses the relationship between the original graphical model and the tree model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the main issues of Uncertainty Analysis (UA) {{in general and}} also argues and illustrates its particular relevance to structural dynamics. Brief descriptions are given of the most prevalent of the many frameworks for uncertainty representation. The three main uncertainty-related problems of relevance to structural dynamics are then discussed, namely quantification, <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>propagation.</b> In order to illustrate the application of ideas of UA in a realistic scenario, there then follows a case study conducted on an aerospace structure, namely the wing of a Gnat trainer aircraft. The case study considers evidence-based classifiers {{as an alternative to}} probabilistic classifiers for the problem of damage location within the context of Structural Health Monitoring.

40|$|Wide employments {{of large}} scale digital metrologies have {{promoted}} {{the development of}} digital aircraft assembly technologies, which are changing traditional processes of wing-fuselage alignment to high precision and more efficient digital alignment based on measurement assisted assembly (MAA). MAA is a systematic technique and relies on the integration of digital measurement with assembly process, which {{is not only the}} integration of operations, but also data <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> <b>propagation</b> from product design, through digital inspection to components assembly. In order to direct and support the applications of advanced approaches in MAA for wing-fuselage alignment, a novel framework of measurement assisted assembly methodology is proposed to realise the process integration and data fusion based on key measurement characteristics (KMCs). Firstly, definition, classification and mathematical model of KMCs are presented; then, the framework is constructed on the basis of integrated process model, measurement data model and data process kernel. Finally, a case of wing-fuselage alignment simulation is carried out to illuminate the application of measurement assisted assembly technique with the framework...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} a {{chemically}} agnostic approach {{to explore the}} origin of life, using an automated recursive platform based on droplet microfluidics, {{could be used to}} induce artificial chemical evolution by iterations of growth, speciation, selection, and propagation. To explore this, we set about designing an open source prototype of a fully automated evolution machine, comprising seven modules. These modules are a droplet generator, droplet transfer, passive and active size sorting, splitter, incubation chamber, reservoir, and injectors, all run together via a LabVIEW TM program integration system. Together we aim for the system to be used to drive cycles of droplet birth, selection, <b>fusion,</b> <b>and</b> <b>propagation.</b> As a proof of principle, in addition to the working individual modules, we present data showing the osmotic exchange of glycylglycine containing and pure aqueous droplets, showing that the fittest droplets exhibit higher osomolarity relative to their neighbours, and increase in size compared to their neighbours. This demonstrates the ability of our platform to explore some different physicochemical conditions, combining the efficiency and unbiased nature of automation with our ability to select droplets as functional units based on simple criteria...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mitochondrial}} {{life cycle}} consists of frequent <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> fission events. Ample experimental and clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of either fusion or fission results in deterioration of mitochondrial bioenergetics. While fusion may benefit mitochondrial function {{by allowing the}} spreading of metabolites, protein and DNA throughout the network, the functional benefit of fission is not as intuitive. Remarkably, studies that track individual mitochondria through <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> fission found that the two events are paired <b>and</b> that <b>fusion</b> triggers fission. On average each mitochondrion would go though ~ 5 fusion:fission cycles every hour. Measurement of Δψm during single <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> fission events demonstrates that fission may yield uneven daughter mitochondria where the depolarized daughter {{is less likely to}} become involved in a subsequent <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> {{is more likely to be}} targeted by autophagy. Based on these observations we propose a mechanism by which the integration of mitochondrial <b>fusion,</b> fission <b>and</b> autophagy forms a quality maintenance mechanism. According to this hypothesis pairs of <b>fusion</b> <b>and</b> fission allow for the reorganization and sequestration of damaged mitochondrial components into daughter mitochondria that are segregated from the networking pool and then becoming eliminated by autophagy...|$|R

Here we investigated the amino acid sequence of the Mimivirus R 555 gene product, originally annotated as a Rad 50 homolog, and later shown to have close homologs in marine microbial metagenomes. Results Our bioinformatics analysis revealed that R 555 protein sequence is constituted from the fusion of an N-terminal Mre 11 -like domain with a C-terminal Rad 50 -like domain. A systematic database search revealed twelve additional cases of Mre 11 /Rad 50 (or SbcD/SbcC) fusions {{in a wide variety}} of unrelated organisms including unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, the megaplasmid of a bacterium associated to deep-sea hydrothermal vents (Deferribacter desulfuricans) and the plasmid of Clostridium kluyveri. We also showed that R 555 homologs are abundant in the metagenomes from different aquatic environments and that they most likely belong to aquatic viruses. The observed phyletic distribution of these fusion proteins suggests their recurrent creation and lateral gene transfers across organisms. Conclusions The existence of the fused version of protein sequences is consistent with known functional interactions between Mre 11 and Rad 50, <b>and</b> the gene <b>fusion</b> probably enhanced the opportunity for lateral transfer. The abundance of the Mre 11 /Rad 50 fusion genes in viral metagenomes and their sporadic phyletic distribution in cellular organisms suggest that viruses, plasmids and transposons played a crucial role in the formation of the <b>fusion</b> proteins <b>and</b> their <b>propagation</b> into cellular genomes. </p...|$|R
