We {{show that the}} generalized Aicardi's invariant is the universal type one invariant, and we show that the generalized Aicardi's invariant restricted to n-component links <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus with zero winding number for each component is equal to an invariant we define using the universal cover of <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus. We also define and study a geometric invariant for n-component links <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus. We give a lower bound on this invariant using the type one invariants, which are easy to calculate, which helps in computing this geometric invariant, which is usually hard to calculate...|$|R
40|$|We define {{some new}} {{numerical}} invariants for knots with zero winding number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus. These invariants explore some geometric features of knots embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus. We characterize these invariants and interpret {{them on the}} level of the knot projection. We also find some relations among some of these invariants. Moreover, we give lower bounds for some of these invariants using Vassiliev invariants of type one. We connect our invariants to <b>the</b> bridge number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus. We give a lower bound and an upper bound of the wrap of a knot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> torus <b>in</b> terms of our new invariants...|$|R

40|$|A {{previous}} study of C 70 in deuterated benzenes generated evidence suggesting C 70 exhibited unique reorientational behavior depending on its environment. We present {{a comparison of}} the dynamic behavior of this fullerene, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> and solution phases, to explore any unique features between these two phases. The effective correlation times, τCeff, of C 70 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state are 2 to 3 times longer than <b>in</b> solution. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state, a noticeable decrease <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> carbons' correlation times is seen between 293 [*]K to 303 [*]K; suggesting a transition from isotropic to anisotropic reorientational behavior at this temperature change. Although C 70 in solution experiences van der Waals type interactions, these interactions are not strong enough to slow the solution-state motion below what is observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state. All observed differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diffusion constants, DX and DZ, in solution are smaller than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state suggesting a lower energy of activation between these two modes of reorientation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> liquid phase. A small-step diffusion “like” condition appears to be thermally generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> phase at 323 [*]K...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} current interest in solid state luminescence of organic molecules and their stimuli responsive fluorescence switching behavior. Although small organic derivatives with olefinic, acetylenic, phenylenevinylenic, phenyleneethynylenic spacers are widely documented as <b>solid</b> state emitters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature, <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state photophysics of organic derivatives with "butadiyne" spacer still remains unexplored. We provide detailed investigation on <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state fluorescence properties of a series of butadiynyl fluorophores. Replacement of a phenyl ring, which is at periphery of the butadiyne bridge, with a large moiety such as pyrenyl group furnishes contrasting emissions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state. While <b>the</b> butadiyne bridged phenyl derivatives show a blue shift of emission maxima <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> powder with respect to monomer spectra <b>in</b> solution state, <b>the</b> butadiyne bridged pyrenyl derivatives exhibit a red shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state. <b>The</b> blue shift of the emission maxima of the butadiyne bridged phenyl derivatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> powder is attributed to allowed transition in aggregates with nearly parallel transition dipoles. On the other hand, formation of pyrenyl excimer accounts for the excitonic red shift of the butadiyne bridged pyrenyl derivatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> powder. <b>In</b> addition to that, <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> state fluorescence of the pyrenyl analogues is reversibly switched between two aggregate forms through external heating and rubbing stimuli...|$|R
