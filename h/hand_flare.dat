40|$|In 1985, an intrepid British sailor {{made his}} fourth {{attempt at a}} solo {{crossing}} of the Atlantic. According to a Los Angeles Times news item (“Sailor Is No Match, ” 1985), the 65 -year-old man set out from Campbletown, Scotland, in a five-foot boat, the Marmaduke Jinks IV. Almost immediately, his outboard engine lost power. So he hoisted sail, but his boat drifted backward and he fell asleep. When he woke up, he didn’t know where he was. He used an emergency <b>hand</b> <b>flare</b> and was rescued by the Coast Guard after having traveled four miles – the wrong way! As an aside, the article states {{that one of his}} previous attempts to cross the Atlantic was in 1984, when he set out from England in a barrel. When he boarded it, it capsized! Who knows what the sailor’s dreams consisted of. Does it matter, though whether he was motivated by a dream of innovation and accomplishment, or one of simple notoriety? In either event, he certainly did not surround himself with a high-technology system. How universal it is for humans early in life to dream many marvelous things. Not only are our nocturnal dreams so often filled with hopes and happy times, but in those years our waking state is also replete with aspirations to be someone heroic, or courageous, inventive, artistic, of high stature and recognition, of great wealth, with great wisdom, or some combination thereof...|$|E

40|$|We {{have found}} {{a large number of}} very strong flares in the {{available}} XTE PCA data of Cyg X- 1 (also seen in available HEXTE and BATSE data) with 13 flares satisfying our chosen threshold criterion, occuring both in the hard and the soft states. We analyze here in detail two of them. The strongest one took place in the soft state, with the 3 - 30 keV energy flux increasing 30 times with respect to the preceding 16 -s average. The e-folding time is ~ 7 ms for the main flare and ~ 1 ms for its precursor. The spectrum strongly hardens during the flare. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>flares</b> in the hard state have generally lower amplitudes and longer e-folding times, and their spectra soften during the flare, with the hardness of the spectrum at the flare peak similar for both types of the flares. The presence of the flares shows unusually dramatic events taking place in the accretion flow of Cyg X- 1. On the other hand, the rate of occurence of hard-state flares shows they may represent a high-flux end of the distribution of shots present in usual lightcurves of Cyg X- 1.

40|$|Aerosol {{particles}} from several anthropogenic sources associated with football stadia including cooking, cigarette smoking, burning of color smoke bombs and <b>hand</b> <b>flares</b> {{were analyzed by}} high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry. The physical and chemical characteristics of these different aerosols, in particular the organic fraction, were explored in laboratory studies to obtain robust references. These data were compared with field campaign results from a Bundesliga (German football league) match in the Coface Arena (Mainz, Germany) on 20 th April 2012. The field measurement revealed a strongly elevated mass concentration of organic aerosols (OA) compared to background levels showing a temporal structure clearly related to the match. PMF analysis established that during the football match event cigarette smoke was the predominant component of submicron organic aerosol (67 % of total OA). Cooking emissions from food outlets within the stadium correlated well with the sales figures of the catering stations and were also found to be of relevance (24 % of total OA) especially in the period before kickoff. Pyrotechnics were not observed during this football match and no signatures of these sources {{were found in the}} mass spectra from the stadium measurements. All species that were elevated during the football match returned to their initial background levels within one hour after the match had finished. This demonstrates a good ventilation capacity of the open-topped Coface Arena. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Although these methods were effective for ground crews, they offered no way for pilots to communicate back. As wireless telegraphy technologies developed alongside the growth of aviation during {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, wireless telegraph systems were used to send messages in Morse code, first from ground-to-air and later air-to-ground. With this technology, planes were able to call in accurate artillery fire and act as forward observers in warfare.|$|R
40|$|According to the magnetospheric {{accretion}} scenario, young low-mass {{stars are}} surrounded by circumstellar disks which they interact with through accretion of mass. The accretion builds up the star to its final mass and is also believed to power the mass outflows, which may in turn have {{a significant role in}} removing the excess angular momentum from the star-disk system. Although the process of mass accretion is a critical aspect of star formation, some of its mechanisms are still to be fully understood. On the other <b>hand,</b> strong <b>flaring</b> activity is a common feature of young stellar objects (YSOs). In the Sun, such events give rise to perturbations of the interplanetary medium. Similar but more energetic phenomena occur in YSOs and may influence the circumstellar environment. In fact, a recent study has shown that an intense flaring activity close to the disk may strongly perturb the stability of circumstellar disks, thus inducing mass accretion episodes (Orlando et al. 2011). Here we review the main results obtained in the field and the future perspectives.

40|$|Abstract. Using a {{non-linear}} Monte-Carlo code {{we investigate}} the radiative response of an accretion disk corona system to static homogeneous flares. We model a flare by a rapid (comparable {{to the light}} crossing time) energy dissipation in the corona or the disk. If the flares originate from the disk, the coronal response to the soft photon shots produces a strongly non-linear Comptonised radiation output, with complex correlation/anticorrelations between energy bands. This behavior strongly differs from those found with usual linear calculations. Thus any model for the rapid aperiodic variability of X-ray binaries invoking a varying soft photon input {{as a source for}} the hard X-ray variability has {{to take into account the}} coronal temperature response. On the other <b>hand,</b> if the <b>flare</b> is due to a violent heating of the corona, when the perturbation time scale is of the order of a few corona light crossing times, the shot spectrum evolves from hard to soft. This general trend is independent of the shot profile and geometry. We show that for short dissipation time, the time averaged spectra are generally harder than in steady state situation. In addition, annihilation line and high energy tails can be produced without need for non-thermal processes. Key words: accretion, accretion disks – radiation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a simple}} set of poloidal field coils, one {{can reach the}} {{situation}} where the null of the poloidal magnetic field in the divertor region is of a second order, not of the first order as in the usual X-point divertor. Then, the separatrix {{in the vicinity of}} the null-point splits the poloidal plane not into four sectors, but into six sectors, making the whole structure looking like a snow-flake (whence a name, [1]). This arrangement allows one to spread the heat load over much broader area than in the case of a standard divertor. A disadvantage of this configuration is in that it is topologically unstable, and, with the current in the plasma varying with time, it would switch either to the standard X-point mode, or to the mode with two X-points close to each other. To avoid this problem, it is suggested to have a current in the divertor coils by roughly 5 % higher than in an 'optimum' regime (the one where a snow-flake separatrix is formed). In this mode, the configuration becomes stable and can be controlled by varying the current in the divertor coils in concert with the plasma current; on the other <b>hand,</b> a strong <b>flaring</b> of the scrape-off layer still remains in force. Geometrical properties of this configurations are analyzed for a simple model. Potential advantages and disadvantages of this scheme are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results from a multiwavelength {{campaign}} of GRS 1915 + 105 performed from 2000 April 16 to 25. This {{is one of the}} largest coordinated set of observations ever performed for this source, covering the wide energy band in radio (13. 3 - 0. 3 cm), near-infrared (J-H-K), X-rays and Gamma-rays (from 1 keV to 10 MeV). During the campaign GRS 1915 + 105 was predominantly in the "plateau" (or low/hard) state but sometimes showed soft X-ray oscillations: before April 20. 3, rapid, quasi-periodic (~= 45 min) flare-dip cycles were observed. The radio flares observed on April 17 shows frequency- dependent peak delay, consistent with an expansion of synchrotron-emitting region starting at the transition from the hard-dip to the soft-flare states in X-rays. On the other <b>hand,</b> infrared <b>flares</b> on April 20 appear to follow (or precede) the beginning of X-ray oscillations with an inconstant time delay of ~= 5 - 30 min. This implies that the infrared emitting region is located far from the black hole by >~ 10 E 13 cm, while its size is <~ 10 E 12 cm constrained from the time variability. We find a good correlation between the quasi-steady flux level in the near-infrared band and in the X-ray band. From this we estimate that the reprocessing of X-rays, probably occurring in the outer parts of the accretion disk, accounts for about 20 - 30 % of the observed K magnitude in the plateau state. The OSSE spectrum in the 0. 05 - 10 MeV band is represented by a single power law with a photon index of 3. 1 extending to ~ 1 MeV with no cutoff. The power-law slope above ~ 30 keV is found to be very similar between different states in spite of large flux variations in soft X-rays, implying that the electron energy distribution is not affected by the change of the state in the accretion disk.

40|$|As {{part of our}} {{on-going}} {{investigation of}} magnetic activity in ultracool dwarfs we present simultaneous radio, X-ray, UV, and optical observations of LSR 1835 + 32 (M 8. 5), and simultaneous X-ray and UV observations of VB 10 (M 8), both {{with a duration of}} about 9 hours. LSR 1835 + 32 exhibits persistent radio emission and Hα variability on timescales of ∼ 0. 5 − 2 hr. The detected UV flux is consistent with photospheric emission, and no X-ray emission is detected to a deep limit of LX/Lbol � 10 − 5. 7. The Hα and radio emission are temporally uncorrelated, and the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity exceeds the correlation seen in F–M 6 stars by � 2 × 10 4. Similarly, LHα/LX � 10 is at least 30 times larger than in early M dwarfs, and eliminates coronal emission as the source of chromospheric heating. The lack of radio variability during four rotations of LSR 1835 + 32 requires a uniform stellar-scale field of ∼ 10 G, and indicates that the Hα variability is dominated by much smaller scales, � 10 % of the chromospheric volume. VB 10, on the other <b>hand,</b> shows correlated <b>flaring</b> and quiescent X-ray and UV emission, similar to the behavior of early M dwarfs. Delayed and densely-sampled optical spectra exhibit a similar range of variability amplitudes and timescales to those seen in the X-rays and UV, with LHα/LX ∼ 1.

On the basis of this dataset, statistics on temporal properties e. g. duration, rise and decay times of H-alpha, SXR and HXR flare with regard to the flare classes is presented. The duration, rise and decay time for H-alpha flares increases with increasing importance and brightness classes. The increase is more pronounced for the duration and decay time. The same relation is valid with regard to the brightness class. On the other <b>hand</b> for SXR <b>flares,</b> the duration, rise and decay also increase with the flare class being more pronounced for the duration and rise time. We have also analysed the event asymmetry (EA) of H-alpha, SXR and HXR flares for the same period. The EA indices are predominantly positive for H-alpha but for SXR and HXR this shows symmetrical distribution on both sides of zero asymmetry. Our study also presents the result of the Neupert effect (NE) in solar flares for the same period. We investigate the time difference (Δ t) between the maximum of SXR emission {{and the end of the}} HXR emission for many flares during the period of our investigation. Our study shows that distribution of the time difference reveals a peak at. Out of 236 events, only 48 (20. 34 per cent) events satisfy the NE whereas there is also a significant fraction of flares 62 (26. 27 per cent) which shows strong deviation form. The period of investigation is focused on the descending phase of solar cycle 23. Study of this period is significant because in this decay phase activity exhibits a sudden increase.

30|$|Solar flares are eruptive {{events in}} the solar {{atmosphere}} caused by the magnetic reconnection (e.g., Shibata and Magara 2011). The occurrence frequency of solar flares decreases as the flare energy increases. The frequency-energy distribution of solar flares can be fitted by a simple power-law function with an index of − 1.5 to − 1.9 in the flare energy range between 1024 and 1032 erg (e.g., Aschwanden et al. 2000; Shimizu 1995; Crosby et al. 1993). The total bolometric energy released by the largest solar flares {{is estimated to be}} the order of 1032 erg (Emslie et al. 2012), and the occurrence frequency of such flare is about once in 10 years. On the other <b>hand,</b> much larger <b>flares</b> called ‘superflares’ have been observed {{on a wide variety of}} stars including solar-type stars (Landini et al. 1986; Schaefer 1989; Schaefer et al. 2000). Recently, many superflares on solar-type stars (G-type main sequence stars) have been discovered by the Kepler space telescope (Maehara et al. 2012; Shibayama et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2015). The bolometric energy released by the superflare ranges from 1033 to 1036 erg which is 10 to 104 times larger than that of the largest solar flares (1032 erg). Although most of G-type main sequence stars exhibiting superflares are rapidly rotating stars, the temperature and rotation period of some superflare stars are close to those of the Sun. For example, (Nogami et al. 2014) reported that the rotational velocities of two superflare stars, KIC 9766237 and KIC 9944137, are comparable to that of our Sun, and no hint of binarity was detected. The average strength of the magnetic field on the surface of these stars, by using the absorption line of Ca II at λ 8, 542 Å, are estimated to be 1 to 20 G which is comparable to or 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the Sun (approximately 2 G). On the other hand, (Wichmann et al. 2014) reported that some superflare stars with a photometric period of 10 to 20 days have large rotational velocities of v sini∼ 10 to 20 km/s. This suggests that these stars are either sub-giant stars or binary systems, not main sequence stars like our Sun.|$|R
