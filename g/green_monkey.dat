25|$|To be able {{to perform}} a proper {{diagnosis}} of this pathogen is it important to take samples from the suspected infected individuals such as a stool, throat, or nasopharyngeal sample. There are various tests that can be done on these samples to see if a person is infected. Viral antigen can be detected by performing an assay. A serological assay can also be performed on the sample to look for virus-specific antibodies present in the sample, thus showing that the person is trying to combat the virus. The virus can be isolated in culture through the use of mouse-L fibroblasts, <b>green</b> <b>monkey</b> kidney cells, as well as HeLa cells.|$|E
40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses {{have been}} isolated from African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> originating from Ethiopia. A molecular clone, termed SIVagm 3, {{was found to}} be highly divergent from SIVagmTYO- 1 in terms of its restriction map and partial nucleotide sequence. A premature stop codon present in the transmembrane protein of SIVagm TYO- 1 was absent in SIVagm 3. SIVagm 3 was biologically active in vitro and in vivo and displayed characteristics reminiscent of the wild-type virus. Biological activity was demonstrated by seroconversion of juvenile African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> and Macaca nemestrina after inoculation. In contrast to antibody reactivity mainly directed against env proteins in naturally infected African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys.</b> African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> and M. nemestrina infected with the cloned virus showed antibody reactivity directed against all major proteins as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis. The availability of a biologically fully competent molecular clone of SIVagm allows us now to address various pertinent questions in an animal model system which should help to understand features of human immunodeficiency virus infection in human beings...|$|R

500|$|The highest {{price paid}} at auction for a Thoroughbred {{was set in}} 2006 at $16,000,000 for a two-year-old colt named The <b>Green</b> <b>Monkey.</b> [...] Record prices at auction often grab headlines, though they do not {{necessarily}} reflect the animal's future success; in the case of The <b>Green</b> <b>Monkey,</b> injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008, and he never won a race. Conversely, even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a few hundred dollars to become horsemeat.

500|$|Sturgeon wrote {{many stories}} during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that {{emphasised}} {{the importance of}} love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story [...] "The World Well Lost" [...] (1953), first published in Universe magazine, homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the Universe cover was [...] " [...] most daring story"; its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time, {{and it is now}} regarded as a milestone in science fiction's portrayal of homosexuality. [...] According to an anecdote related by Samuel R. Delany, when Sturgeon first submitted the story, the editor (John W. Campbell) not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well. Sturgeon would later write Affair with a <b>Green</b> <b>Monkey,</b> which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published Venus Plus X, in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist's homophobia portrayed unfavourably.|$|E

2500|$|Specific archaeological {{findings}} {{have confirmed that}} pets were mummified. The most famous {{example of this is}} the Theban Queen Makare’s adult <b>Green</b> <b>Monkey</b> (Chlorocebus aethiops). [...] When her tomb was discovered, there was a small, mummified bundle present at her feet, which was initially believed to be her child. This puzzled archaeologists because Queen Makare was a High Priestess who had taken a serious vow of celibacy. If this had been her child, it would have meant that she had, at some point, broken the oath she had taken as High Priestess, raising a slew of other questions regarding her life. Finally, in 1968, an x-ray was done on the small mummy, and it was determined to be an adult <b>Green</b> <b>Monkey</b> (Chlorocebus aethiops), not a child. Similarly, Makare’s half sister, Esemkhet, was discovered buried with a mummified pet—she had a mummified gazelle in her tomb. Prince Tuthmosis of the Dynasty XVIII was also buried with a beloved animal—his pet cat was mummified and placed in a stone coffin in his tomb. Another Egyptian, named Hapymen, had his pet dog mummified, wrapped in cloth, and placed at the side of his coffin. At the tomb KV 50 in the Valley of Kings, a mummified dog and baboon were discovered buried together, though the owner is unknown.|$|E

40|$|Acute lung injury (ALI) {{and acute}} {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS), caused by influenza A virus H 5 N 1 and {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} coronavirus (SARS-CoV), supposedly depend on activation of the oxidative-stress machinery that is coupled with innate immunity, resulting in a strong proinflammatory host response. Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 8, and IL- 6, {{play a major role in}} mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS by stimulating chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. To obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-associated ALI, we compared SARS-CoV infections in two different nonhuman primate species, cynomolgus macaques and African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Viral titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract were not significantly different in SARS-CoV-infected macaques and African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Inflammatory cytokines that play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS or have neutrophil chemoattractant activity, such as IL- 6, IL- 8, CXCL 1, and CXCL 2, were, however, induced only in macaques. In contrast, other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including osteopontin and CCL 3, were upregulated in the lungs of African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> to a significantly greater extent than in macaques. Because African <b>green</b> <b>monkeys</b> developed more severe ALI than macaques, with hyaline membrane formation, some of these differentially expressed proinflammatory genes may be critically involved in development of the observed pathological changes. Induction of distinct proinflammatory genes after SARS-CoV infection in different nonhuman primate species needs to be taken into account when analyzing outcomes of intervention strategies in these species...|$|R
