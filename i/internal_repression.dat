2500|$|Nixon had {{supported}} {{a concerted effort}} to undermine the Chilean economy, saying he wanted [...] "to make the economy scream" [...] with up to [...] "$10,000,000 available, more if necessary" [...] for covert activities. The White House effort, ordered by Nixon and carried out through Kissinger and the 40 Committee, finally succeeded when General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in a violent coup d'état on September 11, 1973. During the coup, the deposed president died under disputed circumstances, and there were allegations of American involvement. These allegations were proven in 2000, when more than 24,000 formerly classified papers from the White House, NSC, CIA, FBI, US Embassy, and DIA were released as part of the Chilean Declassification Project. The papers documented extensive evidence of the covert activities engineered by Nixon and Kissinger designed to overthrow Allende. The Nixon administration later provided covert US support for Augusto Pinochet, despite knowledge of his record of extensive torture, <b>internal</b> <b>repression,</b> and state-supported international terrorism carried out by DINA, the Chilean secret police, through its Operation Condor program. American casualties of Nixon's policies include Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, who were executed in the National Stadium after the Pinochet coup; Boris Weisfeiler, who disappeared near a Chilean interrogation camp called Colonia Dignitad; Rodrigo Rojas, who was burned to death by Chilean Army soldiers; and Ronni Moffitt, who was killed when Orlando Letelier was assassinated by a car bomb planted by DINA, in Washington, D.C.|$|E

50|$|The Council on African Affairs (CAA): {{founded in}} 1937 by Max Yergan and Paul Robeson, the CAA {{was the first}} major U.S. {{organization}} whose focus was on providing pertinent and up-to-date information about Pan-Africanism across the United States, particularly to African Americans. Probably the most successful campaign of the Council was for South African famine relief in 1946. The CAA was hopeful that, following World War II, there would be a move towards Third World independence under the trusteeship of the United Nations. To the CAA's dismay, the proposals introduced by the U.S. government to the conference in April/May 1945 set no clear limits on the duration of colonialism and no motions towards allowing territorial possessions to move towards self-government. Liberal supporters abandoned the CAA, and the federal government cracked down on its operations. In 1953 the CAA was charged with subversion under the McCarran Act. Its principal leaders, including Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Alphaeus Hunton (1903-70), were subjected to harassment, indictments, {{and in the case of}} Hunton, imprisonment.

40|$|Endothelial PAS protein 1 (EPAS 1) {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix Per-AHR-ARNT-Sim {{transcription}} factor related to hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha). To analyze EPAS 1 domains responsible for transactivation and oxygen-regulated function, we constructed chimeric fusions of EPAS 1 with a GAL 4 DNA binding domain, plus or minus the VP 16 activation domain. Two transactivation domains were defined in EPAS 1; a C-terminal domain (amino acids 828 - 870), and a larger internal domain (amino acids 517 - 682). These activation domains were interspersed by functionally repressive sequences, several of which independently conveyed oxygen-regulated activity. Two types of activity were defined. Sequences lying N-terminal to and overlapping the internal transactivation domain conferred regulated repression on the VP 16 transactivator. Sequences lying C-terminal to this <b>internal</b> domain conveyed <b>repression</b> and oxygen-regulated activity on the native EPAS 1 C-terminal activation domain, but not the Gal/VP 16 fusion. Fusions containing internal but not C-terminal regulatory domains manifested regulation of fusion protein level. Comparison of EPAS 1 with HIF- 1 alpha demonstrated a similar organization for both proteins, and for the C terminus defined a conserved RLL motif critical for inducibility. Overall, EPAS 1 sequences were less inducible than those of HIF- 1 alpha, and inducibility was strikingly reduced as their expression level was increased. Despite these quantitative differences, EPAS 1 regulation appeared similar to HIF- 1 alpha, conforming to a model involving the modulation of both protein level and activity, through distinct internal and C-terminal domains...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the non-democratic regimes unveils an apparent paradox, because it happens notwithstanding {{that they do not}} have to confront any legal and public contestation (obviously, thanks to the extension of <b>internal</b> control and <b>repression</b> of any opposition), and that the free access to the political power is denied. The non-democratic regimes consolidate and stabilize quickly once those two conditions are guaranteed (internal control over any potential opposition, no open access to the political power) but they eventually breakdown, Why? The article aims at exploring theoretically the conditions of political stability, in search of an interpretation. Firstly, the non-democratic regimes are negatively identified through a conceptual sketch of the democracy as opposite regime. Secondly, three main approaches to the study of the political stability are identified: the political culture approach addressed to the investigation of the dominant beliefs and sources of legitimacy of a given regime; the socio-centered approach drew attention to the distribution of the social and economic resources; finally, the institutional approach focused on the institutional and organizational control of the social and political mobilization. Assuming that the stabilizing factors underlined by the three approaches may be combined in a multi-dimensional interpretation of the democratic political stability, it is argued a contrario that their absence could be an explanation of the instability of the non-democratic regimes and of their breakdown in the long run. The political culture and the socio-centered approaches point out the «social factors», while the «institutional» approach focuses on «regime factors» which may stabilize a non-democracy. A hypothetical model is developed and applied to the recent cases of the authoritarian breakdown in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt, and it is argued that although the «social factors» do have a role in the political crises, the «regime factors» are the key variables explaining the durability of the non-democratic regimes and their capacity to delay the breakdown...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{time after}} the start of Gheorghe Tătărescu's premiership and Ion Inculeț's {{leadership}} of the <b>Internal</b> Affairs Ministry, <b>repression</b> of the Legion ceased, a measure which reflected Carol's hope to ensure a new period of stability. In 1936, during a youth congress in Târgu Mureș, Codreanu agreed to the formation of a permanent Death Squad, which immediately showed its goals with the killing of Mihai Stelescu by a group deemed Decemviri (led by Ion Caratănase), neutralizing the Crusades campaign of exposing the Guard's weaknesses, and silencing Stelescu's claims that Codreanu was hypocritical in his official display of ascetism, politically corrupt, uncultured, and a plagiarist. In 1936, Codreanu published an essay entitled [...] "The Resurrection of the Race", where he wrote:"I will under underline this once again: we are not up against a few pathetic individuals who have landed here by chance and who now seek protection and shelter. We are up against a fully-fledged Jewish state, an entire army which has come here with its sights set on conquest. The movement of the Jewish population and its penetration into Romania are being carried out in accordance with precise plans. In all probability, the 'Great Jewish Council' is planning {{the creation of a new}} Palestine on a strip of land, starting out on the Baltic Sea, embraces a part of Poland and Czechoslovakia and half of Romania right across to the Black Sea...The worse thing that Jews and politicians have done to us, the greatest danger that they have exposed our people to, is not the way they are seizing the riches and possessions of our country, destroying the Romanian middle class, the way they swamp our schools and liberal professions, or the pernicious influence they are having on our whole political life, although these already constitute mortal dangers for a people. The greatest danger they pose to the people is rather that they are undermining us racially, that they are destroying the racial, Romano-Dacian structure of our people and call into being a type of human being that is nothing, but a racial wreck." [...] The year was also marked by the deaths and ostentatious funerals of Moța (by then, the movement's vice president) and Vasile Marin, who had volunteered on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War and had been killed in the Majadahonda battle.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a new {{theoretical}} framework by which to understand family organisation and the processes of family therapy from a political perspective - a framework that will highlight (changing) power relationships rather than assume some notion of functional order. In constructing and evaluating such a theoretical framework, I will draw upon the traditions of critical theory and qualitative research. My starting points are an overview of existing critical understandings of 'the family', and an examination of how 'power' itself may be theorised in a rigorous manner. I will review how such perspectives may expose specific relations of oppression or recognition that underpin particular forms of organisation, from the scale of the social formation as a whole to that of 'the individual'. Psychoanalysis and discourse theory have provided concepts whereby to deconstruct the dynamics of 'the individual' - in particular the concept of 'subjectivity' - which I will develop further so as to encompass participation, not just in discursive structures, but also in structures of emotional and material relations. In a critical appraisal of the various theoretical and practice traditions within family therapy, I will look at how the hegemony of systems theory has begun to be questioned and alternative metaphors for familial organisation proposed. However, as I will argue, none of these provide a satisfactory basis for understanding power relations in the family. I will therefore go on to apply a new conceptualisation of family organisation - that of 'subjectivity' - which is developed out of the theoretical traditions discussed earlier. I will theorise 'the family', not just as the context in which individual subjectivity may be constructed, but as an entity that may be seen to participate in the social formation as a subjectivity in its own right. Instead of understanding familial organisation as a natural outcome of self-regulating processes (as in systems theory), it may thus be seen to reflect the ways in which a family may have been constructed as a subjectivity in and by an oppressive social formation - its coherence only being maintained by a degree of <b>internal</b> violence and <b>repression.</b> Building on this, I will develop a theoretical framework by which to analyse, from a political perspective, the breakdown of family functioning and the specific ways in which the organisation of family life may be reconstructed through the processes of family therapy. Following on from this, I will test out the value of the theoretical framework in an analysis of three examples of family therapy practice. My source material is transcripts taken from videotapes of actual family sessions, and these are analysed in terms of the evidence they provide of minute-by-minute changes in power relations within family organisation (often in response to particular interventions by the therapist). Out of this in-depth study of a small number of case examples, my primary aim will be to assess the practical value of the various elements of the theoretical framework in exposing how familial power relations have been structured and how (and whether) they may be modified during the course of family therapy. In turn, this may enable me to reach some preliminary conclusions as to how specific family therapy interventions may affect family organisation in ways that are either oppressive or empowering...|$|R
