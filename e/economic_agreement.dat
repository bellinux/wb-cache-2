5|$|Tătărescu {{remained}} in office {{throughout the rest}} of the Phony War, until the fall of France, and his cabinet signed an <b>economic</b> <b>agreement</b> with Nazi Germany (through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country) and saw the crumbling of Romania's alliance with the United Kingdom and France. The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), as well as by Carol's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing Tătărescu with Ion Gigurtu, and recreating the Front as the totalitarian Party of the Nation.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Croatia and the RSK made an <b>economic</b> <b>{{agreement}}</b> {{to restore}} road and rail links, water and gas supplies, {{and use of}} {{a part of the}} Adria oil pipeline. Even though some of the agreement was never implemented, a section of the ZagrebBelgrade motorway passing through RSK territory near Okučani and the pipeline were both opened. Following a deadly incident that occurred in late April 1995 on the recently opened motorway, Croatia reclaimed all of the RSK's territory in western Slavonia during Operation Flash, taking full control of the territory by 4 May, three days after the battle began. In response, the ARSK attacked Zagreb using M-87 Orkan missiles with cluster munitions. Subsequently, Milošević sent a senior Yugoslav Army officer to command the ARSK, along with arms, field officers and thousands of Serbs born in the RSK area who had been forcibly conscripted by the ARSK.|$|E

5|$|In late July {{and early}} August, {{there were two}} more {{attempts}} at resurrecting the Z-4 Plan and the 1994 <b>economic</b> <b>agreement.</b> Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in Geneva on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by Thorvald Stoltenberg, a Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed to endorse the Z-4 Plan once again. The talks were used by Croatia to prepare diplomatic ground for the imminent Operation Storm, whose planning was completed during the Brijuni Islands meeting between Tuđman and military commanders on 31 July. The HV started large-scale mobilization in late July, soon after General Zvonimir Červenko became its new Chief of General Staff on 15 July.|$|E

25|$|As Germany {{scheduled}} its {{invasion of}} Poland for August 25 {{and prepared for}} war with France, German war planners in August estimated that, because of massive oil, food and rubber shortfalls, {{in the face of}} an expected British blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only supplier for many items. Every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality. By August 10, the countries worked out the last minor technical details, but the Soviets delayed signing the <b>economic</b> <b>agreement</b> for almost ten days until they were sure that they had also reached a political agreement.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, German {{officials}} secretly hinted to Soviet diplomats {{for months}} {{that it could}} offer better terms for a political agreement than Britain and France. The Soviet Union began discussions with Nazi Germany regarding {{the establishment of an}} <b>economic</b> <b>agreement</b> while concurrently negotiating with those of the tripartite group. In late July and early August 1939, Soviet and German officials agreed on most of the details for a planned <b>economic</b> <b>agreement,</b> and specifically addressed a potential political agreement. On 19 August 1939, German and Soviet officials concluded the 1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement, an economic mutual understanding that exchanged Soviet Union raw materials with Germany in exchange for weapons, military technology and civilian machinery. Two days later, the Soviets suspended the tripartite military talks. On 24 August, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the political and military deal that accompanied the trade agreement, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. This pact was an agreement of mutual non-aggression that contained secret protocols dividing the states of northern and eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The Soviet sphere initially included Latvia, Estonia and Finland. Germany and the Soviet Union would partition Poland; the areas east of the Pisa, Narev, Vistula, and San rivers going to the Soviet Union. The pact provided the Soviets with the chance of taking part in the invasion, and offered an opportunity to regain territories ceded in the Peace of Riga of 1921. The Soviets would enlarge the Ukrainian and Belarusian republics to include the entire eastern half of Poland without the threat of disagreement with Adolf Hitler.|$|E
40|$|<b>Economic</b> {{integration}} <b>agreements</b> – {{also called}} preferential trade agreements or regional trade agreements – have dramatically expanded in scope since World War II. While the proximate goal of economic integration {{is to increase}} commercial exchange between member states, there are strong reasons to believe integration influences relations across <b>economic</b> <b>agreements</b> as well. I argue that <b>economic</b> <b>agreements</b> foster enclaves of regional interdependence {{at the expense of}} multilateral, global interdependence. As a result, highly central <b>economic</b> <b>agreements</b> are partially insulated from the ill-effects of militarized conflict with other agreement areas. Furthermore, the coveted markets of highly central trade blocs afford them a degree of economic leverage that increases the effectiveness of non-violent conflict resolution mechanisms. Ultimately, these dynamics suggest highly central agreements will tend to engage in conflict with other central agreements due to the mutual isolation of said agreements. Relations between central and marginalized agreements, however, will be more peaceful given the latter’s dependence on access to central agreement markets. Using eigenvector centrality scores as my primary measure of agreement centrality, I test my theory using a large-N statistical analysis. I ultimately find support for the notion that dyads with more central agreements are more conflict prone other types of dyads...|$|R

Luevano used his speed to employ a constant jab during the second round, working on counter-punches, which left him open to a combination to end that stage. López began pursuing the offensive during the third round, employing combinations and pursuing Luevano, who attempted to counter. This pattern persisted during the following two rounds. By the sixth round López's offensive had damaged Luevano's left eye, which began to swell. In the seventh round López scored a knockdown following a combination. Luevano was {{able to stand up}} but was still injured, which prompted the referee to stop the fight by technical knockout.|$|E
25|$|After the October Revolution and the Kiev Bolshevik Uprising {{many of his}} {{secretaries}} resigned {{after the}} Central Rada disapproved the Bolsheviks actions in Petrograd with the ongoing confrontations in Moscow {{as well as the}} other cities in the country. On January 22, 1918, the Ukrainian People's Republic has proclaimed its independents due to the Bolshevik intervention headed by Antonov-Ovseyenko. The country was squeezed between the abandoned German-Russian front-lines to its western border and the advancing Bolshevik forces of Muravyov along the eastern border. Within days, Mikhail Muravyov manage to invade Kiev forcing the government to evacuate to Zhytomyr whose retreat was secured by the great efforts of the Yevhen Konovalets Sich Riflemen. During the evacuation the Ukrainian government managed to secure military assistance in the face of the Central Powers. The government of the Ukrainian People's Republic signed a highly criticized treaty with Germans to repel the Bolshevik forces in exchange for a right to expropriate food supplies. That treaty also required for the Russian SFSR to recognize the Ukrainian People's Republic. Around that time the Vynnychenko's government established an <b>economic</b> <b>agreement</b> with the government of Belarus People's Republic through the Belarus Chamber of Commerce in Kiev.
