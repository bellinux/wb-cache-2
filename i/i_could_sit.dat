500|$|Dylan has cited [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] {{as one of}} {{his songs}} that means the most to him. In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, and they just give me a sense of awe. Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E

2500|$|Scarborough's most {{high-profile}} {{case was}} briefly representing Michael F. Griffin, {{the killer of}} doctor David Gunn, in 1993. He made several court appearances representing Griffin, before removing himself from the case, later saying: [...] "There was no way in hell <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> in at a civil trial, let alone a capital trial", referring to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty against Griffin. Scarborough assisted Griffin in choosing other counsel from the many who offered their services, however, and helped shield the family from the media exposure, pro bono.|$|E
2500|$|Mangan {{has said}} that he did not attend any AA {{meetings}} as part of research saying, [...] "I didn't feel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> there and pretend to be an alcoholic, I thought that would be wrong. I also didn't want {{to stand up and say}} 'Hi, my name's Stephen, I'm an actor in a sitcom.' These are places where people are trying to work out really difficult stuff. We do touch on some controversial subjects in the series; there's a lad with Down syndrome in one episode. There's all sorts of topics that you wouldn't initially think are comic issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cameron {{enrolled}} at Fullerton College, a two-year community college, in 1973 to study physics. He switched to English, then dropped {{out before the}} start of the fall 1974 semester. Next, he worked several jobs, including as a truck driver, writing when he had time. During this period he taught himself about special effects: [...] "I'd go down to the USC library and pull any thesis that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology. That way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> down and read it, and if they'd let me photocopy it, I would. If not, I'd make notes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that is too}} much!" [...] O'Sullivan said. [...] "That ledge is {{so narrow}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>sit</b> there, even holding on by the bars; and as to {{stopping}} there half an hour, I would almost as soon be on the rack." ...|$|R

2500|$|On 5 September 2006, Steve McManaman {{was named}} #22 in the {{official}} Liverpool website's [...] "100 Players Who Shook The Kop" [...] list, in which Jamie Carragher described McManaman as [...] "the best midfield player {{in the country for}} three or four years" [...] running. Both Rob Jones and Robbie Fowler gave two interviews in 2012–13 in which they stated McManaman was the greatest player they ever played alongside, with Fowler saying, [...] "I've played with many, many great players. Paul Gascoigne was fantastic and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> here all day and talk about Liverpool players – John Barnes, Ian Rush, Jan Molby, Ronnie Whelan and Steven Gerrard, who is an unbelievable player. He would probably be my number two. The best player I've ever played with is Steve McManaman... he really was that good." [...] In 2013, McManaman was named #20 {{in the official}} Liverpool website's second [...] "100 Players Who Shook the Kop" [...] list, rising up by two positions.|$|E
2500|$|Afterward, during {{qualifying}}, forty-nine {{cars were}} entered, but only forty-three was able because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Sadler clinched his eighth pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 27.363, his first since May, 2006 at Talladega Superspeedway. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Biffle. Edwards qualified third, Montoya took fourth, and David Ragan started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified seventeenth, while Hamlin was scored thirtieth. The six drivers that failed to qualify for the race were J. J. Yeley, Scott Riggs, Michael McDowell, Jeff Green, Josh Wise, [...] and Brian Keselowski. Once the qualifying session completed, Sadler commented, [...] "I’m feeling Superman today! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> here and say it is me, or this or that, but [...] Todd Parrott is the man. He can do so much as a crew chief. He is good for me from the mental side and we have been qualifying so much better here the last six weeks or so... that is a really fast lap for me. I got all I can get out of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gimme Shelter DVD {{contains}} extensive {{excerpts from}} that broadcast. A Hells Angels member who {{identified himself as}} [...] "Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco" [...] (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says [...] "they offered us $500 worth of beer (to) go there {{and take care of}} the stage ... we took this $500 worth of beer to do it." [...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They told me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>sit</b> on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Our age,' he said, 'has been so far {{an age of}} scene-shifting. We {{have been}} {{preparing}} a stage, clearing away the setting of a drama that was played out and growing tiresome.... If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>sit</b> out the first few scenes of the new spectacle....|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{think of}} nothing else. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not study, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>sit</b> and stare {{out of the window}} with tears running down my cheeks, until at last, the teacher observing my distress, inquired, [...] "What is the matter?" [...] And I, not knowing how to enter upon so terrible a tale, whined out, [...] "I'm sick, I want to go home." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not eat, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> still, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{continue}} steadfast to anything.

Yet, in all the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea,--the storm, and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore-ground.|$|R

6000|$|March 22.--Went to-day at {{nine o'clock}} to the meeting. A great number present, with a tribune full of Reformers, who showed their sense of propriety by hissing, hooting, and making all sorts of noises; and these {{unwashed}} artificers are from henceforth to select our legislators. There was some speaking, but not good. I said something, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>sit</b> quiet.[438] ...|$|R

6000|$|She flushed, and {{was struck}} dumb for some moments; but she forgave his unreasoning anger, knowing {{so well in}} what it had its root.
