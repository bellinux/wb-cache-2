50|$|Most of the {{eicosanoid}} receptors {{are integral}} membrane protein G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind {{and respond to}} <b>eicosanoid</b> signaling <b>molecules.</b> <b>Eicosanoids</b> are rapidly metabolized to inactive products and therefore are short-lived. Accordingly, the eicosanoid-receptor interaction is typically limited to a local interaction: cells, upon stimulation, metabolize arachidonic acid to an eicosanoid which then binds cognate receptors on either its parent cell (acting as an Autocrine signalling molecule) or on nearby cells (acting as a Paracrine signalling molecule) to trigger functional responses within a restricted tissue area, e.g. an inflammatory response to an invading pathogen. In some cases, however, the synthesized eicosanoid travels through the blood (acting as a hormone-like messenger) to trigger systemic or coordinated tissue responses, e.g. prostaglandin (PG) E2 released locally travels to the hypothalamus to trigger a febrile reaction (see Fever#PGE2 release). An example of a non-GPCR receptor that binds many eicosanoids is the PPAR-γ nuclear receptor.|$|R

These CYPs possess cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylase and/or epoxygenase enzyme activity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eicosanoids</b> are {{signalling}} <b>molecules</b> {{derived from}} the essential fatty acids (EFA); they are a major pathway by which the EFAs act in the body.

5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are <b>eicosanoids,</b> signaling <b>molecules</b> made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|R
2500|$|<b>Eicosanoids</b> are {{signaling}} <b>molecules</b> {{made by the}} enzymatic or non-enzymatic oxidation of {{arachidonic acid}} or other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are, similar to arachidonic acid, 20 carbon units in length. Eicosanoids are a sub-category of oxylipins, i.e. oxidized fatty acids of diverse carbon units in length, and are distinguished from other oxylipins by their overwhelming importance as cell signaling <b>molecules.</b> <b>Eicosanoids</b> function in diverse physiological systems and pathological processes such as: mounting or inhibiting inflammation, allergy, fever and other immune responses; regulating the abortion of pregnancy and normal childbirth; contributing to the perception of pain; regulating cell growth; controlling blood pressure; and modulating the regional flow of blood to tissues. In performing these roles, eicosanoids most often act as autocrine signaling agents to impact their cells of origin or as paracrine signaling agents to impact cells in the proximity of their cells of origin. [...] Eicosanoids may also act as endocrine agents to control the function of distant cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} glomerular self-defense. The balance between local offense factors and defense {{machinery}} determines {{the fate of}} tissue injury: progression or resolution. In glomerular research, the most interest {{has been on the}} offensive side, for example, the roles of leukocytes, platelets, complement, cytokines, eicosanoids, and oxygen radical intermediates. There has been little focus on the defensive side, which is responsible for the attenuation and resolution of disease. The aim of this review is to address possible mechanisms of local defense that may be exerted during glomerular injury. Cytokine inhibitors, proteinase inhibitors, complement regulatory proteins, anti-inflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory <b>eicosanoids,</b> antithrombotic <b>molecules,</b> and extracellular matrix proteins can participate in the extracellular and/or cell surface defense. Heat shock proteins, antioxidants, protein phosphatases, and cyclin kinase inhibitors may contribute to the intracellular defense. This article outlines how the glomerulus, when faced with injurious cells or exposed to pathogenic mediators, defends itself via the intrinsic machinery that is brought into play in resident glomerular cells...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{deprivation}} {{followed by}} reoxygenation causes pathological responses in many disorders, including ischemic stroke, heart attacks, and reperfusion injury. Key aspects of ischemia-reperfusion can be modeled by a Caenorhabditis elegans behavior, the O 2 -ON response, which is suppressed by hypoxic preconditioning or inactivation of the O[subscript 2]-sensing HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) hydroxylase EGL- 9. From a genetic screen, {{we found that}} the cytochrome P 450 oxygenase CYP- 13 A 12 acts in response to the EGL- 9 –HIF- 1 pathway to facilitate the O 2 -ON response. CYP- 13 A 12 promotes oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into <b>eicosanoids,</b> signaling <b>molecules</b> that can strongly affect inflammatory pain and ischemia-reperfusion injury responses in mammals. We propose that roles of the EGL- 9 –HIF- 1 pathway and cytochrome P 450 in controlling responses to reoxygenation after anoxia are evolutionarily conserved. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

These <b>eicosanoid</b> signaling <b>molecules</b> {{are involved in a}} number of physiologic responses such as platelet aggregation, inflammation, and cell proliferation. Our group has taken a particular interest in platelet-type 12 -(S) -LOX (12 -LOX) because of its demonstrated role in skin diseases, diabetes, platelet hemostasis, thrombosis, and cancer. We previously reported the discovery of ML 127, a potent and selective 12 -LOX inhibitor which {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool compound for researchers in the field. However, the limited tolerance for structural modification and modest PK profile for this chemotype prompted us to continue our discovery efforts toward novel 12 -LOX inhibitors. Herein, we report the identification and medicinal chemistry optimization of a 4 -((2 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzyl) amino) benzenesulfonamide-based scaffold. Top compounds, exemplified by 35 (ML 355) and 36, display nM potency against 12 - LOX and excellent selectivity over related lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases. In addition to possessing favorable ADME properties, 35 and 36 inhibit PAR- 4 induced aggregation and calcium mobilization in human platelets, and reduce 12 -HETE in mouse/human beta cells...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{hosts and}} parasites can be {{substantially}} modulated by host nutrition. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential dietary nutrients; they are indispensable as structural components of cell membranes and as precursors for <b>eicosanoids,</b> signalling <b>molecules</b> which act on reproduction and immunity. Here, we explored {{the potential of}} dietary PUFAs to affect the course of parasitic infections using a well-established invertebrate host [...] parasite system, the freshwater herbivore Daphnia magna and its bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa.; Using natural food sources differing in their PUFA composition and by experimentally modifying the availability of dietary arachidonic acid (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) we examined PUFA-mediated effects resulting from direct consumption as well as maternal effects on offspring of treated mothers. We found that both host and parasite were affected by food quality. Feeding on C 20 PUFA-containing food sources resulted in higher offspring production of hosts and these effects were conveyed {{to a great extent}} to the next generation. While feeding on a diet containing high PUFA concentrations significantly reduced the likelihood of becoming infected, the infection success in the next generation increased whenever the maternal diet contained PUFAs. We suggest that this opposing effect was caused by a trade-off between reproduction and immunity in the second generation.; Considering the direct and maternal effects of dietary PUFAs on host and parasite we propose that host [...] parasite interactions and thus disease dynamics under natural conditions are subject to the availability of dietary PUFAs...|$|R
2500|$|HxA3, HxB3, {{and their}} isomers are {{distinguished}} from most other <b>eicosanoids</b> (i.e. signaling <b>molecules</b> made by oxidation of 20-carbon fatty acids) {{in that they}} contain both epoxide and hydroxyl residues; they are structurally differentiated in particular from two other classes of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, the leukotrienes and lipoxins, in that they lack conjugated double bonds. HxA4 and HxB4 are distinguished from HxA3 and HxB3 by possessing four rather than three double bonds. The 14,15-HxA3 and 14,15-HxB3 non-classical eicosanoids are distinguished from the aforementioned hepoxilins {{in that they are}} formed by a different metabolic pathway and differ in the positioning of their epoxide and hydroxyl residues. [...] Two other classes of epoxyalcohol fatty acids, those derived from the 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and the 18-carbon fatty acid, linoleic acid, are distinguished from the aforementioned hepoxilins by their carbon chain length; they are termed hepoxilin-like rather than hepoxilins. A hepoxilin-like derivative of linoleic acid is formed on linoleic acid that is esterified to a sphingosine in a complex lipid termed esterified omega-hydroxylacyl-sphingosin (EOS).|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths in women all over the world. Epidemiological {{studies suggest that the}} {{consumption}} of high-fat diets can promote the incidence of breast cancers in both developed and developing countries. In particular, the lipid-rich diet contains arachidonic acid (AA, a C 20 : 4 polyunsaturated fatty acid), which {{has been shown to be}} associated with tumor formation in breast tissues. Nevertheless, the actual mechanism by which AA induces the metastatic transformation and malignancy is not well understood. The goal of my dissertation, therefore, is to identify the molecules and unravel the pathways that participate in AA-induced carcinogenesis. In this investigation, two different breast cancer cells were used—MDA-MB- 231 and MCF 7. Although both cells were derived from the cancerous tissues of the human breast, they display different phenotypes. For example, the estrogen-receptor-negative MDA-MB- 231 cells are highly invasive, with typical fibroblast structures, whereas MCF 7 cells are estrogen receptor positive and are weakly invasive, luminal epithelial cells. Briefly, both MDA-MB- 231 and MCF 7 cells were treated with AA (100 µM) and a lipoxygenase inhibitor (nordihydroguaiarectin acid or NDGA, 10 µM), followed by the isolation and characterization of the AA metabolites (i. e., <b>eicosanoid</b> <b>molecules)</b> by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Immunoblot and confocal microscopy were performed to elucidate the protein expression and intracellular targeting of 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LOX), the enzyme that utilizes AA to synthesize LTB 4 and other leukotrienes (LTs). Metastatic migration was analyzed by wound-healing and matrigel-mediated invasion assays. The involvement of lipid rafts (LRs) in inducing migration/invasion of MDA-MB- 231 cells was evaluated by treating the cells with an LR disruptor, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD). The analysis of LR components (i. e., caveolin- 1, flotilin and cholesterol) was also monitored. ^ The results suggest that while MDA-MB- 231 cells produced high levels of prostaglandins (i. e., PGE 2 and PGD 2), MCF 7 cells synthesized excess hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETEs) compounds. Interestingly, MDA-MB- 231 cells when stimulated with AA showed increased synthesis of LTB 4 (∼ 4 -fold) and decreased the production of PGE 2 and PGD 2 (∼ 2 -fold). In contrast, AA suppressed the synthesis of PGE 2, PGD 2, LTB 4, and HETE compounds in MCF 7 cells, suggesting that AA affects the eicosanoid synthesis in MDA-MB- 231 and MCF 7 cells differently. Furthermore, I found that the AA treatment stimulated the expression of 5 -LOX and promoted the migration and invasion by MDA-MB- 231 cells. Interestingly, NDGA significantly blocked the AA-induced 5 -LOX activation and cellular migration/invasion. AA also increased the phosphorylation of NFκB and produced excess IL- 6 and IL- 8. Again, AA showed minimal or no effects on 5 -LOX, cytokines, and NFκB activation in MCF 7 cells, which suggests that AA activates the different sets of molecules/pathways in non-invasive and invasive breast cancer cells, respectively. Because AA stimulated the synthesis of LTB 4 in MDA-MB- 231 cells, I propose that the autocrine and paracrine signaling caused by LTB 4 activates NFκB-mediated cytokine release, which promotes cellular inflammation and malignancy in invasive breast cancers. The results with MBCD that blocked the invasion and migration of MDA-MB- 231 cells, along with the increased synthesis of caveolin- 1 and flotilin under the influence of AA, further supports the idea that the involvement of LRs is essential in AA-mediated migration and invasion of MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells. ^ Finally, my results point out that the LTB 4, which is synthesized by AA, activates the inflammatory pathways that are critical for causing the metastatic invasion of breast cancer cells. In my opinion, this is a novel finding in the field of breast cancer, and it is likely that 5 -LOX pathway could be an ideal target for developing new chemotherapies to treat the patients with metastatic breast cancers. ...|$|R
40|$|Cyclooxygenase (COX) and {{lipoxygenase}} (LOX) catalyze the {{rate-determining step}} {{in the production of}} arachidonic acid- derived signaling <b>molecules</b> (<b>eicosanoids)</b> within the body. COX has been extensively investigated, which has enabled the design of non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, acetaminophen (ApAP) and ibuprofen. However, there are still fundamental questions surrounding the LOX family of enzymes, which has limited the development of isoform specific inhibitors. The structural basis and regio- and stereoselectivity of the LOX isoforms are not known. Herein, we describe two strategies to develop isoform-specific inhibitors of lipoxygenase. Efforts were focused on the synthesis of unnatural lipid derivatives, in which the methylene hydrogen atoms on the substrate were replaced with a moiety lacking a labile hydrogen atom, such as fluorine. This would allow the LOX enzyme to remain in an active form, while preventing enzyme turnover. This preliminary work will enable the assessment of their activity as inhibitors and attempts at their co-crystallization might provide the first insight into the binding mode of these fatty acid substrates. The preparation of a small library of acylated 2 -aminopyrimidines and their efficacy as inhibitors of soybean lipoxygenase- 1 was explored. Preliminary studies suggest the mode of action occurs through a bi-dentate coordination of the ferric iron atom. Modifications of the acylated 2 -aminopyrimidines to make it more substrate-like and to increase its lipophilicity, yielded inhibitors with low micromolar IC 50 values. With further optimization, acyl 2 -aminopyrimidines could serve as a useful platform for the discovery of safe and efficient isoform specific inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|In {{isolated}} perfused rat liver, adenosine infusion (50 microM) led to {{increases in}} glucose output and portal pressure and a net K+ release of 3. 7 +/- 0. 21 mumol/g, which was followed by an equivalent net K+ uptake after cessation of the nucleoside infusion. These effects were accompanied by a transient stimulation of hepatic prostaglandin D 2 and thromboxane B 2 release. The Ca 2 + release observed upon adenosine infusion (50 microM) was 23. 5 +/- 5. 2 nmol/g, i. e. 10 - 20 % of the Ca 2 + release observed with extracellular ATP (50 microM). Indomethacin (10 microM) prevented the adenosine-induced stimulation of glucose output {{and the increase in}} portal pressure by 79 and 63 % respectively, and completely abolished the stimulation of prostaglandin D 2 release. The thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist BM 13. 177 (20 microM), the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor 4 -bromophenacyl bromide (20 microM) and the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (50 microM) also decreased the glycogenolytic and vasoconstrictive responses of the perfused rat liver upon adenosine infusion by 50 - 80 %. When the indomethacin inhibition of adenosine-induced prostaglandin D 2 release was titrated, a close correlation between prostaglandin D 2 release and the metabolic and vascular responses to adenosine was observed. These findings suggest an important role for eicosanoids in mediating the nucleoside responses in the perfused rat liver. Since eicosanoids are known to be formed by non-parenchymal cells in rat liver [Decker (1985) Semin. Liver Dis. 5, 175 - 190], the present study gives further evidence for an important role of <b>eicosanoids</b> as signal <b>molecules</b> between the different liver cell populations...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of Pyrido[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 4 -one {{derivatives}} as COX inhibitors During {{recent years}} {{it became clear}} that atherosclerosis is a complex condition and that different factors contribute to trigger and sustain vessel wall damage. Actually recent studies showed that not only blood lipid concentration plays an important role but also inflammatory processes contribute to the development and rupture of the vulnerable plaque 1. On the basis of these considerations we decided to develop a novel class of molecules showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A natural class of compounds able to act with pleiotropic effects is represented by flavonoids (the most abundant polyphenols present in human diet), that showed anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiplatelet, antihemorragic and antiallergic properties, as well as antioxidant effects being able to scavenge hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions and lipid peroxyl radicals. Flavonoids are based on the structure of 2 -phenylchroman, differing one from each other in the orientation of hydroxyl or methyl groups, the position of the phenyl substituent, the degree of unsaturation and the types of sugar attached. Structure-activity studies indicate that the presence of 3 -hydroxyl group on the heterocyclic ring and the catechol moiety in position 2 favors antioxidant activity, in particular the hydroxyl group on the ring in position 2 appears to be crucial for antioxidant activity. The anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids, showed in vitro or in cellular models, involves the inhibition of different pro-inflammatory mediators synthesis, such as <b>eicosanoids,</b> cytokines, adhesion <b>molecules</b> and C-reactive protein 2, 3. However the flavonoids possess an inadequate therapeutic index. On the basis of this previously considerations the research group where I did my thesis decided to focus attention on a class of derivatives, with 2 -phenyl-pyrido[1, 2 -a]pyrimidin- 4 -one scaffold, with antioxidant properties 4. So we considered that a good starting point to develop a class of molecules able to act also as anti-inflammatory compounds. For these reasons I brought suitable modifications on the heterocyclic core in order to obtain structural similarity to well-known therapeutic selective COX- 2 inhibitors. References 1. Michos, E.
