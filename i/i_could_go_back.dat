500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much {{it might as well have}} been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron was {{an atheist}} {{in his early}} teens. When he was 17, {{during the height of}} his career on Growing Pains, he became a born-again Christian. After {{converting}} to Christianity, he began to insist that storylines be edited to remove anything he thought too adult or inappropriate in Growing Pains. After the series was cancelled, Cameron did not maintain contact with his former co-stars, and did not speak to Tracey Gold for eight years. Cameron has stated that this was not due to any animosity on his part toward any of his former cast-members, but an outgrowth of his desire {{to start a new life}} away from the entertainment industry, and the life he had been in for the previous seven years. Prior to the premiere of The Growing Pains Movie in 2000, for which the entire main cast reunited, Cameron described his regrets over how his relationship with his castmates changed after his religious conversion during production of the series, saying, [...] "I definitely kind of made an about-face, going toward another aspect of my life", admits Cameron. [...] "I shifted my focus from 100% on the show, to 100% on , and left 0% on the show—and even the friendships that were a part of that show. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> I think I could make decisions that were less inadvertently hurtful to the cast—like talking and explaining to them why I just wanted to have my family at my wedding." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, Scorsese {{was interviewed}} about {{combining}} {{his passion for}} 3D as a new medium with the legacy of older films, and said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in time, I'd shoot Taxi Driver in 3D. Robert De Niro in the mirror as Travis Bickle. Imagine how intimidating. 'You talking to me? You talking to me?' Amazing possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Daly {{was raised}} in a deeply {{religious}} family in the farming communities of Wellington, Ohio and Oberlin, Ohio. He has been quoted as saying that his artistic personality made him a misfit. [...] "I want something that I believe in and I almost want to be frightened by what I'm doing. If I'm not frightened, I don't know if it's even good enough or worth it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and work at the gas station or farm in Ohio. That would be an easier thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Kane {{acknowledged}} Finger as [...] "a contributing force" [...] in the character's creation, and wrote, [...] "Now that my long-time {{friend and}} collaborator is gone, I {{must admit that}} Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put {{your name on it}} now. You deserve it.'" [...] Comics historian Ron Goulart has referred to Batman as the [...] "creation of artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{afterward}} {{about his}} one-day presidency, Carmona told The Miami Herald {{that he had}} been [...] "misunderstood because ... the opposition wasted too much time forming a cabinet and naming the high military command," [...] whereas if the coup had [...] "been hatched in advance, those key decisions would have already been made." [...] He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint [...] "a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation" [...] and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly [...] "because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party." [...] He also denied any link to Carlos Andrés Pérez. [...] "There is no connection between me and him," [...] Carmona said. [...] "I did not receive one cent from him. I am not manipulated." [...] "There was no rebellion or coup" [...] Carmona told The New York Times after the counter-coup. [...] "There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president." [...] Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. [...] "I was called by them to fill that role," [...] he said. [...] "I was called by officers and others to take over. And I had the courage to take that step." [...] He told The Guardian that he took [...] "full responsibility" [...] for the actions he made, emphasizing that [...] "there was no premeditation, no conspiracy" [...] behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the April 11 march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. [...] "Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made," [...] Carmona said. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick." [...] When asked if he had been [...] "used by the military," [...] he replied: [...] "There might have been people who used me, you never {{know what is going on}} underground," [...] but he insisted that he [...] "acted purely in the higher interests of the country." [...] One Western diplomat told The Miami Herald that during Carmona's brief presidency [...] "everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical" [...] but that after his ouster [...] "everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope." [...] Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a [...] "civic activist" [...] but would leave politics: [...] "I have never been a politician; that is not my world," [...] Carmona said. [...] "As for Venezuela, we will continue the struggle." ...|$|E

5000|$|Currington {{explained}} the recording behind Enjoy Yourself, saying [...] "This record was about recording songwriter’s songs, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> and recorded {{a bunch of}} mine that I’ve written, {{but there were a}} lot of writers I wanted to record, like Shawn and Troy.

6000|$|She {{sank into}} her seat again, {{and looked at}} the evening sky as she went on: [...] "I repented. It was a resolve taken in desperation.

5000|$|Vernhes {{was raised}} in Paris, France, {{before moving to the}} United States at a young age: [...] "I grew up in Paris and moved to the states when I was 12.
