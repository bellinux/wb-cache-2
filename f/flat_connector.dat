50|$|In Germany, Perilex {{connectors}} {{have been}} standardised by DIN. The 16-ampere version is DIN 49445 (socket) and DIN 49446 (plug) and the 25-ampere version is DIN 49447 (socket) and DIN 49448 (plug). It did replace an earlier flat 4-pin connector (3 phases and neutral) that was standardized in DIN 49450 / DIN 49451. The earlier <b>flat</b> <b>connector</b> did {{continue to exist}} in East Germany - after German reunification, all machinery was required to be rebuilt to round connectors until 1998.|$|E

40|$|Military {{specifications}} {{with general}} purpose parameters and termination data covering <b>flat</b> <b>connectors</b> and <b>flat</b> cables are proposed. The material, design, coating, and insulation are discussed, and drafts of specifications for flat cables including quality assurance provisions, and inspection are presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original modular plug-in type assembly approach {{for a single}} phase-inverter. The main focus here is, indicatively, on the power range 1 - 20 kW, but the methodology can be transferred to higher power levels, too. At {{the core of the}} inverter lies a power-dense double-sided-cooled half-bridge power switch architecture with integrated cooler, which is interconnected to filter elements, gate-driver and control circuitry by means of compact <b>flat</b> <b>connectors.</b> The integration exercise targets, on the one hand, the optimization of the power switch performance and reliability, as well as the reduction of circuit parasitic elements; on the other, the production of a system compatible with maintenance and repairing, featuring minimized impact of single component failure on the system maintenance and repair cost and thus on its availability. Preliminary experimental tests demonstrate the nominal functionality of the inverter...|$|R
5000|$|A D-Terminal or D-tanshi (...) {{is a type}} of analog video {{connector}} {{found on}} Japanese consumer electronics, typically HDTV, DVD, Blu-ray, D-VHS and HD DVD devices. It was developed by the EIAJ (Electronic Industry Association of Japan) in its standard, RC-5237, for use in digital satellite broadcast tuners. In appearance it is a small <b>flat</b> trapezic <b>connector,</b> the same connector as the AAUI connector used by Apple Computer for some time to connect to ethernet.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{automatic}} optical inspection system for checking {{the sequence of}} colored wires in electric cable is presented. The system is able to inspect cables with <b>flat</b> <b>connectors</b> differing in the type and number of wires. This variability is managed in {{an automatic}} way {{by means of a}} self-learning subsystem and does not require manual input from the operator or loading new data to the machine. The system is coupled to a connector crimping machine and once the model of a correct cable is learned, it can automatically inspect each cable assembled by the machine. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) the self-learning system; (ii) a robust segmentation algorithm for extracting wires from images even if they are strongly bent and partially overlapped; (iii) a color recognition algorithm able to cope with highlights and different finishing of the wire insulation. We report the system evaluation {{over a period of several}} months during the actual production of large batches of different cables; tests demonstrated a high level of accuracy and the absence of false negatives, which is a key point in order to guarantee defect-free productions...|$|R
50|$|The 8 {{position}} 8 contact (8P8C) connector is a modular connector {{commonly used}} to terminate twisted pair and multi-conductor <b>flat</b> cable. These <b>connectors</b> are commonly used for Ethernet over twisted pair, registered jacks and other telephone applications, RS-232 serial using the EIA/TIA-561 and Yost standards, and other applications involving unshielded twisted pair, shielded twisted pair, and multi-conductor flat cable.|$|R
5000|$|SCSI {{is derived}} from [...] "SASI", the [...] "Shugart Associates System Interface", {{developed}} circa 1978 and publicly disclosed in 1981. A SASI controller provided a bridge between a hard disk drive's low-level interface and a host computer, which needed to read blocks of data. SASI controller boards were typically {{the size of a}} hard disk drive and were usually physically mounted to the drive's chassis. SASI, which was used in mini- and early microcomputers, defined the interface as using a 50-pin <b>flat</b> ribbon <b>connector</b> which was adopted as the first-generation SCSI (SCSI-1) connector. SASI is a fully compliant subset of SCSI-1 so that many, if not all, of the then-existing SASI controllers were SCSI-1 compatible.|$|R
50|$|SMA {{connectors}} {{are rated}} {{for up to}} 500 mating cycles, but to achieve this {{it is necessary to}} properly torque the connector when making the connection. A 5/16-inch torque wrench is required for this, set to 3-5 in·lbf (0.3 to 0.6 N·m) for brass, and 7-10 in·lbf (0.8 to 1.1 N·m) for stainless steel <b>connectors.</b> <b>Flats</b> are sometimes also provided on the cable side of the connector assembly so that a second wrench can be used to prevent it from rotating and damaging the joint to the cable. It is also advisable to inspect and clean out loose debris from the internal surfaces with compressed air or a gas duster can before mating.|$|R
5000|$|PCB pins are {{soldered}} {{directly to}} {{a printed circuit board}} and not to a wire. Traditionally through hole plated (THP) board style pins were used (print) but increasingly gull wing surface mount (SMD) connections are used, although the latter frequently exhibit solder pad contact problems when exposed to mechanical stress. These connectors are frequently mounted at a right angle to the PCB, allowing a cable to be plugged into the edge of the PCB assembly. While angled connectors traditionally occupied significant room on the PCB, <b>flat</b> SMD <b>connector</b> variants are produced by various manufacturers. Electrical/mechanical anchor points (often soldered) for the connector shell and locking screws are also provided, but significantly differ in their position between US and EU connector variants, so that the correct type must be used unless the PCB was designed to accept them both. The PCB connectors are available in variants with either inch or metric pitch of the soldered contacts. Tolerances are typically large enough to allow the mounting of the smaller connectors regardless of the pitch variant used, but this does not hold true for the larger connectors.|$|R
40|$|Consumer comfort {{is a top}} {{priority}} in today’s vehicle design. Reduction of noise and vibration enhances comfort and improves {{the overall quality of}} the vehicle. Linear elastic vibration isolation mounts are traditionally applied within complex structures to combat noise and vibration. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) is becoming an established and tested noise and vibration modeling methodology that is frequently used to model the flow of noise and vibration in complex structures. A SEA model of a linear elastic vibration isolation mount is developed here which enables SEA analysis of elastically isolated systems for the first time. A vibration isolation mount model has been absent from SEA models {{because of the lack of}} an SEA formulation. Linear elastic vibration isolation mount SEA equations are developed here for the first time. The basis of SEA theory is energy sharing among vibrational mode groups. Traditionally, vibration isolation mounts were thought of as compliant elements with no modes suitable to SEA analysis. An example mount is defined and the number of energy storage modes computed. The results show that a linear elastic vibration isolation mount should be modeled in SEA analysis and provide the equations for a SEA isolation mount model. Also included is the analysis for three unique SEA connectors, a mount to acoustic volume connector, a beam to mount connector, and a mount to <b>flat</b> plate <b>connector...</b>|$|R

The system is implanted on a cockroach. Abstract—The present day technology falls short in offering centimeter scale mobile robots that can function effectively under unknown and dynamic environmental conditions. Insects, {{on the other}} hand, exhibit an unmatched ability to navigate through {{a wide variety of}} environments and overcome perturbations by successfully maintaining control and stability. In this study, we use neural stimulation systems to wirelessly navigate cockroaches to follow lines to enable terrestrial insect biobots. We also propose a system-on-chip based ZigBee enabled wireless neurostimulation backpack system with on-board tissue-electrode bioelectrical coupling verification. Such a capability ensures an electrochemically safe stimulation and avoids irreversible damage to the interface which is often misinterpreted as habituation of the insect to the applied stimulation...|$|R
