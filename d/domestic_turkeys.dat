25|$|The great {{majority}} of <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys</b> are bred to have white feathers because their pin feathers are less visible when the carcass is dressed, although brown or bronze-feathered varieties are also raised.

25|$|It is {{believed}} Coronado's expedition {{were the first}} Europeans to encounter the Acoma. (Estevan was a native Moroccan.) Alvarado reported that first the Acoma refused entry even after persuasions but after Alvarado showed threats of an attack the Acoma guards welcomed the Spaniards peacefully noting that they and their horses were tired. The encounter shows that the Acoma had clothing made of deerskin, buffalohide, and woven cotton as well as turquoise jewelry, <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys,</b> bread, pine nuts, and maize. The village seemed to contain about 200 men.|$|E
25|$|A study {{examining}} {{birds in}} northwestern Colombia for blood parasites found the Muscovy duck {{to be more}} frequently infected with Haemoproteus and malaria (Plasmodium) parasites than chickens, domestic pigeons, <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys</b> and in fact almost all wild bird species studied also. It was noted that {{in other parts of}} the world, chickens were more susceptible to such infections than in the study area, but it may well be that Muscovy ducks are generally more often infected with such parasites (which might not cause pronounced disease though, and are harmless to humans).|$|E
25|$|A {{heritage}} {{turkey is}} one of a variety of strains of domestic turkey which retains historic characteristics that are no longer present in the majority of turkeys raised for consumption since the mid-20th century. Heritage turkeys can be differentiated from other <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys</b> in that they are biologically capable of being raised in a manner that more closely matches the natural behavior and life cycle of wild turkeys. Heritage turkeys have a relatively long lifespan and a much slower growth rate than turkeys bred for industrial agriculture, and unlike industrially-bred turkeys, can reproduce without artificial insemination.|$|E

25|$|The Adena Indians used {{ceremonial}} pipes {{that were}} exceptional works of art. They lived in round shaped (double post method) wicker sided and bark sheet roofed houses (McMichael 1968:21). Little {{is known about}} the housing of Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods, but Woodland Indians lived in wigwams. They grew sunflowers, tubers, gourds, squash and several seeds such as lambsquarter, may grass, sumpweed, smartweed and little barley cereals. In the Fort Ancient period, Indians lived in much larger poled rectangular shaped houses with walls hide covered (McMichael 1968:38). They were farmers who cultivated large fields around their villages, concentrating on corn, beans, tubers, sunflowers, gourds and many types of squash including the pumpkin. They also raised <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys</b> and kept dogs as pets. Their neighbors in the northerly of the state, the Monongahelan houses were generally circular in shape often with nook or storage appendage. Their living characteristics were more of a heritage from the Woodland Indians (McMichael 1968:49).|$|E
2500|$|Wild turkeys, while {{technically}} {{the same}} species as <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys,</b> {{have a very different}} taste from farm-raised turkeys. In contrast to <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys,</b> almost all wild turkey meat is [...] "dark" [...] (even the breast) and more intensely flavored. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild turkey meat with a gamier flavor in late summer due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkey that has fed predominantly on grass and grain has a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.|$|E

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of turkeys are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings {{of which there are}} many types. [...] Some types have slatted walls to allow ventilation, but many have solid walls and no windows to allow artificial lighting manipulations to optimise production. [...] The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a microbial flora requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys</b> are usually maintained between 18 and 21°C. High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities. [...] Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth. [...] Light intensity is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather pecking.|$|E
2500|$|Young <b>domestic</b> <b>turkeys</b> readily fly short distances, perch and roost. [...] These {{behaviours}} {{become less}} frequent as the birds mature, but adults will readily climb on objects such as bales of straw. Young birds perform spontaneous, frivolous running ('frolicking') which has all the appearance of play. Commercial turkeys show a wide diversity of behaviours including 'comfort' behaviours such as wing-flapping, feather ruffling, leg stretching and dust-bathing. Turkeys are highly social and become very distressed when isolated. [...] Many of their behaviours are socially facilitated i.e. expression of a behaviour by one animal increases the tendency for this behaviour to be performed by others. Adults can recognise 'strangers' and placing any alien turkey into an established group will almost certainly result in that individual being attacked, sometimes fatally. Turkeys are highly vocal, and 'social tension' within the group can be monitored by the birds’ vocalisations. A high-pitched trill indicates the birds are becoming aggressive which can develop into intense sparring where opponents leap {{at each other with}} the large, sharp talons, and try to peck or grasp the head of each other. [...] Aggression increases in frequency and severity as the birds mature.|$|E
