500|$|On December 14, 1962, the Bills outbid the Green Bay Packers for Notre Dame quarterback Daryle Lamonica. In 1963, a four-season {{starting}} quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica {{left for the}} Raiders. Lamonica felt he [...] "...learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills." [...] In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record. Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns. The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in [...] weather. [...] During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the next}} night's Raw in Ottawa, Michaels {{appeared}} carrying the WWF title belt and performing a segment where he boasted before {{the audience of}} how he beat Hart with his own trademark move in his own country. McMahon gave a televised interview to commentator Jim Ross, explaining his version of events and making the now-infamous statement [...] "Vince McMahon didn't screw Bret Hart. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Bret Hart... screwed Bret Hart." [...] Michaels continued his mocking of Hart in the coming weeks, performed a skit badgering a midget dressed up as Hart.|$|E
2500|$|Germany, {{which is}} {{involved}} in the UN-mandated International Security Assistance force in Afghanistan and also heads an international effort improving Afghanistan's police force, has suggested that Afghanistan could potentially lose aid or technical support for reconstruction efforts depending on the outcome of Abdul Rahman's case. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has stated [...] "I highly support the idea that we make it clear to Afghanistan, in every way possible, that abiding by and protecting human rights, which Afghanistan is obliged to, includes [...] freedom of religion." [...] Schäuble also said, [...] "We contribute a lot to rebuilding Afghanistan and towards its stability, so <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Afghanistan must realize that we insist upon the freedom of religion. You cannot punish people because they change their religion." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> in {{our village}} I should find {{sensible}} {{people who would}} be glad to hear about interesting things which they never had seen. Many of them had not traveled, and a returned tourist was a comparative rarity in the place. I went down there on purpose to talk about Europe. It was too early for my grandmother's return to the country. I proposed to spend a week with my village friends, and, before their bright firesides, charm and delight them with accounts of those things which had so charmed and delighted me. The lives of city people are so filled with every sort of material that it is useless to try to crowd anything more into them. Here, however, were people with excellent intellects, whose craving for mental pabulum, especially in the winter, could be but partially satisfied.|$|R

"There {{are plenty}} of the {{servants}} there," [...] Littleson answered, [...] "whom she must know very well, and through whom she could get in, especially if Phineas is really up in his room.

2500|$|Pulis {{began his}} career at Bristol Rovers where he joined their school of {{football}} excellence in Eastville from Newport YMCA. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers team mate and friend Ian Holloway also making it in football management. [...] "We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values," [...] <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it's {{because of the way}} we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. [...] "The basic principles were drilled into us, {{both on and off the}} pitch. Nothing was given to us and we had to work very, very hard for everything we got." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama's win in Iowa {{was seen}} as a boost to his already-improving chances in New Hampshire. On January 4, he told {{supporters}} in New Hampshire, [...] "If you give me the same chance that Iowa gave me last night <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I will be the president of the United States of America." [...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ... We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E

40|$|To be honest, I {{never thought}} I {{would get to}} write this section. The last time I {{actively}} worked on it {{was five years ago}} and at that time I cared deeply about school and the educational process. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> my college degree would define who I would be. Some time has passed since then, too much time, if you ask my original committee (however, that isn’t hardly possible since all but one of them have retired). But in the five years away from the academic classroom, I enrolled in the classrooms of life. During that time <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> learned about the process of socialization within the prison setting. I’ve spent the last six years knee deep in the daily on-goings and problems associated with life in the correctional setting. In my previous jobs as a correctional officer, correctional case manger, correctional housing unit manager, and quality assurance manager, I’ve been able to listen to stories about what brought men to prison and what has kept them there. It was through first-hand observations that the fire of yearning to understand prisonization and the preparations for release was kept alive. Although many people thought I was insane leaving the cushioned environment of college life to work full-time in a prison, I knew it was a calling. I didn’t want to eve...|$|R

6000|$|I took a carving-knife {{from off}} the table, and {{standing}} over her I brought it down gently {{on top of}} her head. [...] "Rise, Sir Jane Puddle," [...] said I, to which the maid gave a smothered gasp, and--would you believe it, madam?--she crept out of the room on her hands and knees. The cook waited on us at breakfast, and <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the landlord and his wife {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when we left the Ship Inn, for their sordid souls had never heard of knighthood, but knew all about assassination.|$|E
60|$|Such was my {{notion of}} a pirate's life. I would kill nobody; the very sight of my black flag would be {{sufficient}} {{to put an end}} to all thought of resistance on the part of my victims, who would no more think of fighting me, than a fat bishop would have thought of lifting his hand against Robin Hood and his merry men; and <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I expected my conscience to have a great deal more to do in the way of approval of my actions, than it had found necessary in the course of my ordinary school-boy life.|$|E

After {{fourteen years}} of misery, Sicily sang her angry vespers, and a Calabrian admiral burnt the fleet of Charles before his eyes, where Scylla rules her barking Salamis. But the French king died in prayerful peace, receiving the sacrament {{with these words}} of perfectly honest faith, as he reviewed his past life: [...] "Lord God, as <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are my Saviour, so I pray you to have mercy on my soul; and as I truly made the conquest of Sicily more to serve the Holy Church than for my own covetousness, so I pray you to pardon my sins." ...|$|E

In a valley {{outside of the}} house, Chaucer sees a large, rapidly {{spinning}} wicker house that he guesses {{to be at least}} miles in length. The house makes incredibly loud noises as it spins, and Chaucer remarks that “if the house had stood upon the Oise, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>truly</b> <b>that</b> it might easily have been heard it as far as Rome.” ...|$|R
60|$|Then for {{the second}} time that day my quick blood boiled in me, and {{snatching}} up the Spaniard's sword that lay upon the grass beside me, I held it at the point, for the game was changed, and I who had fought with cudgel against sword, must now fight with sword against cudgel. And had it not been that Lily with a quick cry of fear struck my arm from beneath, causing the point of the sword to pass over his shoulder, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>truly</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should then and there have pierced her father through, and ended my days early with a noose about my neck.|$|R

He has peas this year ahead of {{everybody else in the}} neighborhood, and it was only day before yesterday that he took me out to look at them. He has been watching them ever since they first came up out of the ground, and when he showed me the nice big pods and told me they would be ready to pick in a day or two, he looked so proud and happy that you might have thought his peas were little living people. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> even at prayer-time he could not help thinking how good those peas would taste.|$|E

She was full of maternal affection for me, and I think, for I will conceal naught that <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> apprehension of thy powers to please, Luis, may have induced her to apprehend that an orphan girl, like myself, might possibly consult her fancy more than her prudence, and wed one who seemed to love the uttermost limits of the earth {{so much better than}} his own noble castles and his proper home." ...|$|E
60|$|Winter came, and passed--somehow. I cannot dwell {{here on the}} tediousness of it, and the {{one bright}} spot it has left in my memory {{concerns}} Polly Ann. Did man, woman, or child fall sick, it was Polly Ann who nursed them. She had by nature the God-given gift of healing, knew by heart all the simple remedies that backwoods lore had inherited from the north of Ireland or borrowed from the Indians. Her sympathy and loving-kindness did more than these, her never tiring and ever cheerful watchfulness. She was deft, too, was Polly Ann, and spun from nettle bark many a cut of linen that could scarce be told from flax. Before the sap began to run again in the maples {{there was not a}} soul in Harrodstown who did not love her, and <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> most of them would have risked their lives to do her bidding.|$|E

Unquestionably his best course, if he considers, as we may be sure he does, that the force under his command is strong enough to crush us here, would be to push across the desert, and fall upon us before reinforcements arrive. But it is reported, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>truly,</b> <b>that</b> the Khalifa, his father, has positively refused to let him do so; still, sons have disobeyed their fathers before now.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{were the}} poetical exclamations that rose all around me, showing how deeply tinged with {{imagination}} becomes {{the language of}} the Arab under the influence of strong passion or religious enthusiasm.

[...] In al[l] the fair view before us nothing was more striking, after the desolation through which we had passed, than the gardens and orchards about the town. It was impossible not to enter into the spirit of my companions, and <b>truly</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> for some minutes my enthusiasm rose as high as theirs. But presently when we remounted,[FN#23] the traveller returned strong upon me: I made a rough sketch of the town, put questions about the principal buildings, and in fact collected materials for the next chapter.|$|R
6000|$|All I {{have to say}} {{in regard}} to Dr. Molony {{is that he was}} the {{regularly}} nominated Democratic candidate for Congress in his district; was elected at that time; {{at the end of his}} term was appointed to a land-office at Danville. (I never heard anything of Judge Douglas's instrumentality in this.) He held this office a considerable time, and when we were at Freeport the other day there were handbills scattered about notifying the public that after our debate was over R. S. Molony would make a Democratic speech in favor of Judge Douglas. That is all I know of my own personal knowledge. It is added here to this resolution, and <b>truly</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> among those who participated in the Joliet Convention, and who supported its nominee, with his platform as laid down in the resolution of the Convention and in his reply as above given, we call at random the following names, all of which are recognized at this day as leading Democrats: ...|$|R

The hope and whole idea of a show like this is to find a worldwide star, and <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> we've found <b>that</b> in you". Lambert was announced as the runner-up for the eighth season of American Idol. Upon winning, Kris Allen stated: [...] "Adam deserved this", later explaining he thought Lambert deserved to win as much as he did, and that Lambert [...] "was the most consistent person all year. He was seriously one of the most gifted performers that I've ever met". Lambert's version of the winner's single was released alongside Allen's.
