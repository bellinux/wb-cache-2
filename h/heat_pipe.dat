25|$|When it is {{desirable}} to maintain junction temperatures below 125-150°C, copper/water heat pipes are typically used. Copper/methanol heat pipes are used if the application requires <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operations below 0°C.|$|E
40|$|Flexible <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> of an {{improved}} type are fabricated as layers of different materials laminated together into vacuum- tight sheets or tapes. In comparison with prior flexible <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> these flexible <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are {{less susceptible to}} leakage. Other advantages of these flexible <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> relative to prior flexible <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> include high reliability and greater ease and lower cost of fabrication. Because these <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are very thin, they are highly flexible. When coated on outside surfaces with adhesives, these flexible <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> can be applied, like common adhesive tapes, to the surfaces of heat sinks and objects to be cooled, even if those surfaces are curved...|$|R

25|$|Various {{types of}} solar {{collectors}} for residential applications {{are available with}} either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems. In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains {{a small amount of}} thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.|$|E
25|$|The orbit {{will have}} a higher {{inclination}} than previous missions, to further expand the X-37B's orbital envelope. While the complete payload for OTV-5 is unknown, the Air Force announced that one experiment flying is the Advanced Structurally Embedded Thermal Spreader II (ASETS-II), which will measure the performance of an oscillating <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> A number of small satellites will also share the ride.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) {{in combination with the}} heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system.|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} {{presented in}} this paper focus on a new approach to provide passive regulation of the electronic unit thermal regime of the MASCOT lander (DLR) onboard the NEA sample return mission Hayabusa 2 (JAXA), by using <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> It provides information on the development and testing of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> with variable thermal conductance in a predetermined temperature range. Such <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> acts as thermal switches, but their construction does not include additional elements inherent to gas loaded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> (GLHP) and thermal diode <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> (TDHP). Copper <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> with metal fibrous wick were chosen as baseline design. We have obtained positive results by choosing heat carrier and structural parameters of wick (i. e. pore diameter, porosity and permeability). A rising of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> thermal conductivity from 0. 04 to 2. 1 W/K was observed in the temperature range between - 20 °C…+ 55 °C. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> transferred predetermined power not less than 10 W within the temperature range of + 20 °C… + 55 °C. These <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are in flight since December 2014 and the telemetric data obtained in September 2015 showed normal operation of the thermal control system...|$|R
40|$|New complex {{mathematical}} model of heat transfer processes in conditions of evaporation-condensation systems (miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> thermosyphons and pulsating <b>heat</b> <b>pipes)</b> inner space decreasing was developed. Criterial relation {{for evaluation of}} miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> <b>heat</b> transfer ability was obtained {{as a result of}} differential equations system and conditions of uniqueness analysis. Significant change of vapor flow regimes was shown based on theoretical investigation of vapor flow hydraulic characteristics in miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> at commensurate capillary structure thickness and vapor space diameter. It was shown that transition from laminar to turbulent flow regime occurs at reduced Reynolds number. Influence of layer displacement thickness, vapor space diameter and capillary structure thickness on heat transfer in heating zone of miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> was determined. New data on hydraulic characteristics of processes which take place at period of heat transfer between heating and condensation zones were obtained as a result of visualization investigations of thermosyphons and pulsating <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> with different <b>heat</b> carriers (common heat carriers and nanofluids). Provided life tests of miniature thermosyphons and <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were shown the ability of these devices to work in difficult temperature conditions. New dependencies between heat transfer coefficients in heat transfer zones and heat flux were obtained as a result of heat transfer characteristics of miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> thermosyphons and pulsating <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> researches. Criterial relations for evaluation of heat transfer intensity in heating zones of miniature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> and thermosyphons were determined.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to standard, Constant Conductance <b>Heat</b> <b>Pipes</b> (CCHPs), {{there are a}} number of other types of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> including: ...|$|R
25|$|A <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} a sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. Heat pipes utilize evaporative cooling to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude {{greater than that of}} the equivalent solid conductor.|$|E

The FIR will enable detailed study of how liquids behave in microgravity, a crucial detail for many chemical reactions. One experiment, for instance, will examine how mixtures known as colloids behave without being stirred by sedimentation and convection. Another using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) will examine how an ideal <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> works without the distortions of gravity.|$|E
25|$|The SIMD vector {{processor}} (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox {{to include a}} dot-product instruction. The dot-product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions. The VMX128 was also modified {{by the addition of}} direct 3D (D3D) compressed data format. This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2GFLOPS, being capable of 9.6 billion dot products per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of simultaneous multithreading and was clocked at 3.2GHz. However, to reduce CPU die size, complexity, cost, and power demands, the processor used in-order execution in contrast to the Intel Coppermine 128-based Pentium III used in the original Xbox, which used more complex out of order execution. The original chip used a 90nm process, although a newer 65nm process SOI revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6GB/s front side bus, aggregated 10.8GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/northbridge. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1MB Level 2 cache on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores. Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of aluminum fins with a copper base, and a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70mm fans {{at the rear of the}} console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 S consoles. There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by Nidec, Sunon and Delta Electronics.|$|E

40|$|This article {{utilizes}} {{the experimental}} method {{to investigate the}} thermal performance of heat sinks with one and two pairs of embedded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> A <b>heat</b> sink with embedded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> transfers the total heat capacity from the heat source to both the base plate and <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> and then disperses heat into the surrounding air via the forced convection. The heat transference from base plate to fins can be conducted through the examined results of the heat sink with and without the function of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> The <b>heat</b> capacity from <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> to fins {{is equal to the}} total heat minus the heat from base plate to fins. Therefore, the heat carried by embedded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> can be found using the thermal resistance analytical approach stated in this article. The results show that two and four <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> embedded in the base plate carry 36 % and 48 % of the total dissipated heat respectively; in addition, when the total heating power of the heat sink with two embedded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> is 140 W, the total thermal resistance reaches its minimum value of 0. 27 ºC/W, while for the heat sink with four embedded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> when the total heating power is between 40 W and 240 W, the total thermal resistance is 0. 24 ºC/W, meaning that the thermal performance is better than that of heat sink with two embedded <b>heat</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R

Complete listings of two computer programs for high- and low-temperature <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> respectively are appended.

500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a heat {{transfer}} fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another {{heat transfer}} application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> to cool the valves.|$|E

40|$|Thermotechnical {{characteristics}} of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are considered as high-efficient heat-transfer devices, which can provide energy-saving technologies for heat supply and ventilating systems and for different branches of industry. Thermotechnical and working (”performance capability”) {{characteristics of}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are investigated. By ”performance capability” of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> and heat-transfer devices on <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> we mean the system state, {{where it can}} perform set functions and keep parameter values (thermal power, conductivity, thermal resistance, heat-transfer coefficient, temperature level and differential, etc.) within the regulations of standardized specifications.

2500|$|Rotor sealing. This {{is still}} a minor problem as the engine housing has vastly {{different}} temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials leads to imperfect sealing. Additionally, {{both sides of the}} seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is being exposed to fuel, allowing for oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase. To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of engine. The [...] "heat pipes" [...] effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine, with resulting decreases in efficiency and performance. In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from 231°C to 129°C, and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of engine from 159°C to 18°C.|$|E

50|$|A loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> (LHP) is {{a passive}} {{two-phase}} transfer device {{related to the}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> It can carry higher power over longer distances by having co-current liquid and vapor flow, {{in contrast to the}} counter-current flow in a <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> This allows the wick in a loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> to be required only in the evaporator and compensation chamber. Micro loop heat pipes have been developed and successfully employed in a wide sphere of applications both on the ground and in space.|$|E

50|$|A typical <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> {{consists}} of a sealed pipe or tube made of a material that {{is compatible with the}} working fluid such as copper for water heat pipes, or aluminium for ammonia heat pipes. Typically, a vacuum pump is used to remove the air from the empty <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is partially filled with a working fluid and then sealed. The working fluid mass is chosen so that the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> contains both vapor and liquid over the operating temperature range.|$|E
50|$|VCHPs {{have two}} {{additions}} {{compared to a}} standard heat pipe: 1. A reservoir, and 2. A Non-Condensable Gas (NCG) added to the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{in addition to the}} working fluid; see the picture in the Spacecraft section below. This NCG is typically argon for standard VCHPs, and helium for thermosyphons. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is not operating, the NCG and working fluid vapor are mixed throughout the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> vapor space. When the VCHP is operating, the NCG is swept toward the condenser end of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> by the flow of the working fluid vapor. Most of the NCG is located in the reservoir, while the remainder blocks a portion of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> condenser. The VCHP works by varying the active length of the condenser. When the power or heat sink temperature is increased, the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> vapor temperature and pressure increase. The increased vapor pressure forces more of the NCG into the reservoir, increasing the active condenser length and the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> conductance. Conversely, when the power or heat sink temperature is decreased, the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> vapor temperature and pressure decrease, and the NCG expands, reducing the active condenser length and <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> conductance. The addition of a small heater on the reservoir, with the power controlled by the evaporator temperature, will allow thermal control of roughly ±1-2 °C. In one example, the evaporator temperature was maintained in a ±1.65 °C control band, as power was varied from 72 to 150 W, and heat sink temperature varied from +15 °C to -65 °C.|$|E
