Cohort study nested within 4 weekly surveillance of all women of reproductive age to identify pregnancies and collect data on births and deaths. Rural/periurban communities within the Kintampo Health Research Centre study area of the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. 16, 560 mothers who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>live</b> singleton birth <b>reported</b> between 24 March 2008 and 11 July 2009, who were screened for probable postnatal depression (pPND) between 4 and 12 weeks post partum (some of whom had also had depression assessed at pregnancy), and whose infants survived to this point. All-cause early infant mortality expressed per 1000 infant-months of follow-up from the time of postnatal assessment to 6 months of age. The secondary outcomes were (1) all-cause infant mortality from the time of postnatal assessment to 12 months of age and (2) reported infant morbidity {{from the time of the}} postnatal assessment to 12 months of age. 130 infant deaths were recorded and singletons were followed for 67, 457. 4 infant-months from the time of their mothers' postnatal depression assessment. pPND was associated with an almost threefold increased risk of mortality up to 6 months (adjusted rate ratio (RR), 2. 86 (1. 58 to 5. 19); p= 0. 001). The RR up to 12 months was 1. 88 (1. 09 to 3. 24; p= 0. 023). pPND was also associated with increased risk of infant morbidity. There is new evidence for the association between maternal pPND and infant mortality in low-income and middle-income countries.
