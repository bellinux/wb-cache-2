Rigorous field studies informed Gehl’s conclusion that city spaces perform best when they encourage the use of public spaces. Gehl observed that the quality of life between buildings is diminished when substandard architecture, poor safety and overwhelming car infrastructure limit human engagement in public places. Gehl therefore commenced the replanning of Copenhagen in 1962 by pedestrianising Strøget: the city’s main <b>interior</b> <b>transit</b> artery.|$|E

These centers provided shelter, medical care, education, and rehabilitation services, as well as psychosocial services to educate victims on asserting their rights. The government provided temporary de facto resident status for trafficking victims, and refrained from deporting them. The government also began rehabilitation of two more centers, and opened more child protection centers in Franceville, Moanda and Tchibanga.

The old municipality (concelho) was created in 1843 by the Portuguese administration. The town was also founded in 1843 by order of Maria II of Portugal, and its harbour works were begun in 1903. Large developments, however, were not stimulated until the completion in 1928 of the important Benguela Railway, which connected Portuguese Angola with the Belgian Congo. Under Portuguese rule, the port was one of Angola’s busiest, exporting agricultural produce from the <b>interior</b> and handling <b>transit</b> trade from the mines of southeastern Belgian Congo and of Northern Rhodesia. Fishing, tourism and services were also important. The carnival in Lobito {{was also one of}} the most renowned and popular in Portuguese Angola.

Ozone concentrations were measured in outdoor air and within the interior galleries of five institutions that house cultural properties in Krakow. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the degree of penetration of outdoor ozone into these museums, {{and in the case of}} the National Museum to determine the effectiveness of the existing ozone removal system at that site. It was found that those museums that are rapidly ventilated through many open doors and windows experienced indoor ozone concentrations about 42 – 44 % as high as those outdoors. The Senator's Hall at Wawel Castle, which houses important tapestries, experiences indoor ozone concentrations that are 17 – 19 % of those outdoors due to ozone removal at <b>interior</b> surfaces during <b>transit</b> through the building from distant air intake points.

Tidally driven pore water exchange within offshore intertidal sandbanks: Part I Field measurements. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 79, pp. 121 - 132. ] revealed a tidally driven pore water flow system within an offshore intertidal sandbank in Moreton Bay, Australia. The field data {{suggested that this}} flow system might be capable of delivering nutrients, and in particular bio-available iron, across the sediment-water interface. Bio-available iron has been implicated as a key nutrient {{in the growth of}} the toxic marine cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula and therefore this pore water exchange process is of interest at sites where L majuscula blooms have been observed. In this study two-dimensional numerical simulations were used in conjunction with hydraulic data from field measurements to further investigate the tidally induced pore water flow patterns. Simulation results generally showed good agreement with the field data and revealed a more complex residual pore water flow system in the sandbank than shown by the field data. The flow system, strongly influenced by the geometry of the sandbank, was characterized by two circulation cells which resulted in pore water discharge at the bank edge and also to a permanently ponded area within the sandbank interior. Simulated discharge volumes in these two zones were in the order of 0. 813 m(3) and 0. 143 m(3) per meter width (along shore) of sandbank per tidal cycle at the bank edge and sandbank <b>interior</b> respectively. <b>Transit</b> times of pore water circulating through these cells were found to range from approximate to 17 days to > 60 years with an average time of 780 days. The results suggest that the tidally driven flow systems might provide a mechanism for transport of bio-available iron across the sediment-water interface. This flow could constitute a previously unrecognized source of bio-available iron for L. majuscula blooms in the Bay. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Several transiting super-Earths are {{expected}} to be discovered in the coming few years. While tools to model the <b>interior</b> structure of <b>transiting</b> planets exist, inferences about the composition are fraught with ambiguities. We present a framework to quantify how much we can robustly infer about super-Earth and Neptune-size exoplanet interiors from radius and mass measurements. We introduce quaternary diagrams to illustrate the range of possible interior compositions for planets with four layers (iron core, silicate mantles, water layers, and H/He envelopes). We apply our model to CoRoT- 7 b, GJ 436 b, and HAT-P- 11 b. Interpretation of planets with H/He envelopes is limited by the model uncertainty in the interior temperature, while for CoRoT- 7 b observational uncertainties dominate. We further find that our planet interior model sharpens the observational constraints on CoRoT- 7 b's mass and radius, assuming the planet does not contain significant amounts of water or gas. We show that the strength of the limits that can be placed on a super-Earth's composition depends on the planet's density; for similar observational uncertainties, high-density super-Mercuries allow the tightest composition constraints. Finally, we describe how techniques from Bayesian statistics can be used to take into account in a formal way the combined contributions of both theoretical and observational uncertainties to ambiguities in a planet's interior composition. On the whole, with only a mass and radius measurement an exact interior composition cannot be inferred for an exoplanet because the problem is highly underconstrained. Detailed quantitative ranges of plausible compositions, however, can be found. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures, published in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the <b>interior</b> {{structure}} of <b>transiting</b> exoplanets {{have shown that the}} heavy element content of gas giants increases with host star metallicity. Since metal-poor planets are less dense and have larger radii than metal-rich planets of the same mass, one might expect that metal-poor stars host a higher proportion of gas giants with large radii than metal-rich stars. Here I present evidence for a negative correlation at the 2. 3 -sigma level between eclipse depth and stellar metallicity in the Kepler gas giant candidates. Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse depth depends on star metallicity is 0. 981. The correlation is consistent with planets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison with their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars. Furthermore, since metal-rich stars have smaller radii than metal-poor stars of the same mass and age, a uniform population of planets should show a rise in median eclipse depth with [M/H]. The fact that I find the opposite trend indicates that substantial changes in gas giant interior structure must accompany increasing [M/H]. I investigate whether the known scarcity of giant planets orbiting low-mass stars could masquerade as an eclipse depth-metallicity correlation, given the degeneracy between metallicity and temperature for cool stars in the Kepler Input Catalog. While the eclise depth-metallicity correlation is not yet on firm statistical footing and will require spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements for validation, it is an intriguing window into how the interior structure of planets and even the planet formation mechanism may be changing with Galactic chemical evolution.

40|$|Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 83 - 86) Mass {{transportation systems}} and specifically bus systems {{are a key}} element of the national transportation network. Buses are one of the safest forms of transportation. Nonetheless, bus crashes resulting in occupant injuries and fatalities do occur. Each year, more than 5, 800 children die, nearly 120, 000 are permanently disabled, and more than 14 million are hurt seriously enough to require emergency medical care due to unintentional injury. Therefore, effort is needed to improve the performance of bus interior and structure. Child Safety is a continuing effort to improve the safety of children in mass transit buses. This project provides an overview of the implementation of two types of attachment systems Child Restraint Systems (CRS) in a mass transit buses. A series of sled tests were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the Child Restraint Systems for typical frontal, side and rear crash scenarios. The results of the test indicate that the implementation of ISOFIX or LATCH attachments in transit bus seats mitigates the risk of severe injuries to the 12 month-old, and 3 year-old occupants; while not increasing the risk of severe injuries due to CRS interactions to other unrestraint adult passengers. In the next phase of this research, results from these sled tests were validated using the multibody analysis tool MADYMO to evaluate the performance of child safety in mass transit buses using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS 208) injury criteria. The Kinematics of sled tests are closely matching with that of simulations. Injury values for sled tests and simulations are well below injury criteria. The results from this study show the 20 % variation in injury signals. This study concludes that <b>interior</b> for mass <b>transit</b> bus with child seats and restraint can be utilized in mass transit buses to improve the safety performance of children...|$|R
