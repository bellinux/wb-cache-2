Often, it {{takes the form of a}} screwdriver with the lamp connected between the tip of the screwdriver and a single lead that projects out the back of the screwdriver. By connecting the flying lead to an earth (ground) reference and touching the screwdriver tip to various points in the circuit, the presence or absence of voltage at each point can be determined, allowing simple faults to be detected and traced to their root cause. For higher voltages, a statiscope consisting of a neon <b>glow</b> <b>tube</b> mounted on a long insulating handle can be used to detect AC voltages of 2000 volts or more.|$|E

Radio waves {{generated by the}} Hertzian spark-gap oscillator at right travel down the parallel wires. The wires are short-circuited together at the left end, reflecting the waves back up the wires toward the oscillator, creating a standing wave of voltage along the line. The voltage goes to zero at nodes located at multiples of a half-wavelength from the end. The nodes were found by sliding a Geissler <b>tube,</b> a small <b>glow</b> discharge <b>tube</b> like a neon light, {{up and down the}} line (two are shown on the line). The high voltage on the line makes the <b>tube</b> <b>glow.</b> When the <b>tube</b> reaches a node, the voltage goes to zero and the tube goes out.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} consequences of Geissler tube technology was the discovery of the electron and the invention of electronic vacuum tubes. By the 1870s better vacuum pumps enabled scientists to evacuate Geissler tubes to a higher vacuum; these were called Crookes tubes after William Crookes. When current was applied, {{it was found that the}} glass envelope of these <b>tubes</b> would <b>glow</b> at the end opposite to the cathode. Observing that sharp-edged shadows were cast on the <b>glowing</b> <b>tube</b> wall by obstructions in the tube in front of the cathode, Johann Hittorf realized that the glow was caused by some type of ray travelling in straight lines through the tube from the cathode. These were named cathode rays. In 1897 J. J. Thomson showed that cathode rays consisted of a previously unknown particle, which was named the electron. The technology of controlling electron beams resulted in the invention of the amplifying vacuum tube in 1907, which created the field of electronics and dominated it for 50 years, and the cathode ray tube which was used in radar and television displays.|$|R
