40|$|Abstract. The {{researches}} were undergone on the Danube scomber, {{species that}} cumulates the natural microbian contamination from the fresh {{water of the}} Danube and from the salty water of the Black Sea. For the eviscerated fish, the aerobic putrefaction takes place prioritarily, placed both on the skin surface and on that which was eviscerated. For the whole fish, the putrefaction is conditioned by the aggression of the intestinal bacterial flora. The value of the peroxide index {{and the intensity of}} the Kreiss reaction increase proportionally with the evolution of the rancidity. Between fat hydrolization and oxidation, there is no mutual conditioning, thus, the estimation of the two <b>freshness</b> <b>indices</b> must be made independently one from each other...|$|R

At day 33 of storage, {{none of the}} lots were rejected {{on the basis of}} the target biochemical indices (pH, trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N), total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) and histamine) or the tasting panel scores. However, the control and the controlled atmosphere-stored lots were rejected upon inspection at 13 and 22 days, respectively. Scores for the various target biochemical parameters were highest (p< 0. 05) in the control, followed by the lot stored in gas mix two, which had the lower CO 2 concentration. There were changes (p< 0. 05) in the levels of biogenic amines (tyramine, histamine, cadaverine and agmatine) in the course of storage, but pH, TMA-N and TVB-N remained constant. Histamine levels exceeded 100 μg/g for the control fish and in gas mix one towards the end of storage.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to clarify the initial point of rigor mortis that {{plays an important role}} in the delay of rigor mortis in a fish muscle from physical and biochemical viewpoints. The Bitou 2 ̆ 7 s rigor index is used conventionally to evaluate the degree of rigor mortis in a fish body. But, this index did not necessarily agree with the rigor mortis in a fillet. The stress-relaxation test was applied to evaluate the rigor-mortis phenomenon in the fillet Theologically. On the other hand, K value, as biochemical <b>freshness</b> <b>index,</b> increased slowly in the muscle of fish which were killed immediately. Therefore, it was difficult to determine the accurate initial point of the rigor mortis.

In a pilot study, a new hollow fiber nanofilter (HFNF) has been tested. Water from four raw water sources were treated in membrane pilot plants, and three full-scale conventional plants were sampled. Three established fluorescence indices, humification index (HIX), fluorescence index (FI) and <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> (β:α), were used for characterization, and were related to NOM removal by the two treatment methods Although the NOM removal in the treatment processes were related to SUVA, HIX has only a weak correlation to the total organic carbon (TOC) reduction of the HFNF, and none for the conventional treatment. FI and β:α are both correlated to the TOC reduction of the HFNF. Water hardness has a logarithmical correlation to the TOC reduction by the HFNF, plausibly due to moderation of the membrane surface.

After pressurization, the fillets were stored at normal condition (1 atm [1 atm = 101. 29 kPa] and 25 degreesC) for 12 h to evaluate the changes of microbes and K value. The fillets stored at 2, 000 atm for 12 h still kept the K value, a <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> that represents putrefaction with the value beyond 60 %, still below 40 %, and the K value of the meat without pressurization was up to 92 %.

40|$|Optical {{properties}} are easy-to-measure proxies for {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) composition, source and reactivity. However, the molecular signature of DOM associated with such optical parameters remains poorly defined. The Florida coastal Everglades is a subtropical wetland with diverse vegetation (e. g., sawgrass prairies, mangrove forests, seagrass meadows) and DOM sources (e. g., terrestrial, microbial and marine). As such, the Everglades is an excellent model system from which to draw samples of diverse origin and composition to allow classically-defined optical properties {{to be linked to}} molecular properties of the DOM pool. We characterized a suite of seasonally- and spatially-collected DOM samples using optical measurements (EEM-PARAFAC, SUVA 254, S 275 - 295, S 350 - 400, SR, FI, <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> and HIX) and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Spearman’s rank correlations between FTICR-MS signal intensities of individual molecular formulae and optical properties determined which molecular formulae were associated with each PARAFAC component and optical index. The molecular families that tracked with the optical indices were generally in agreement with conventional biogeochemical interpretations. Therefore, although they represent {{only a small portion of}} the bulk DOM pool, absorbance and fluorescence measurements appear to be appropriate proxies for the aquatic cycling of both optically-active and associated optically-inactive DOM in coastal wetlands...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{contents}} of ATP related compounds in the gonad of sea urchin Strongylocentrotus nudus stored in artificial seawater were investigated. A gradual decrease of ATP content was followed by an accumulation of HxR and Hx during storage, while total nucleotide content decreased from 2. 6 to 1. 2 mu mol/g in 8 days indicating a leaking of the compounds from the gonad. The ATP content relative to the sum of ATP related compounds was used to show the ATP content of the gonad. Turbidity of seawater used for storage, a commercial sensory <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> of gonad of sea urchin, also increased during storage. The increase in turbidity seemed to correspond to the decrease in relative ATP content. The effect of oxygen volume filled in the storage bag on {{the change in the}} relative ATP content of gonad and on the turbidity increase of seawater was studied. Decrease in the relative ATP content and turbidity development were both suppressed by an increase in filled oxygen volume.

30|$|In {{comparison}} with tillage effect, farming practices {{are the main}} factor that influenced the quality of WEOM. Increased values of SUVA and HIX in organic farming {{in the present study}} implied that WEOM in organic farming is more aromatic and condensed compared with that in integrated farming. This might be because of the altered diverse microbial community’s structure in organic farming [69], which might promote the degradation of WEOM in {{comparison with}} integrated farming. What’s more, the different crop rotations which affected WEOM by crop root exudates, and the return of crop residues might be another reason to explain the different SUVA and HIX values of WEOM. Our result suggested that complex crop rotations release WEOM with higher aromaticity and humification. This is opposite to that of Xu et al. [18] who reported the inclusion of a perennial crop alfalfa in a crop rotation, which releases WEOM with lower aromaticity and lower extent of humification. This may be attributed to simpler crop rotations in their study and different crop species they planted compared with our study. Although FI values of WEOM at upper and deeper soils were statistically different, according to McKnight et al. [23], FI value of WEOM around 1.4 indicates WEOM derives from terrestrial source, while FI around 1.9 indicates WEOM derives from microbial source. Therefore, FI values {{in the present study were}} around 1.6 indicating the influence of both terrestrial and microbial source on WEOM. The lower BIX (<b>freshness</b> <b>index)</b> in organic farming indicated that less recently microbial-derived organic matter contributed to WEOM in organic farming, while the higher BIX in MT implied that more freshly derived WEOM contributed to WEOM in MT.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Querying over cached indexes of Linked Data often {{suffers from}} stale or missing results due to {{infrequent}} updates and partial coverage of sources.

We thus propose a hybrid query approach that improves upon both paradigms, offering fresher results from {{a broader range of}} sources than Linked Data caches while offering faster results than live querying. Our hybrid query engine takes a cached and live query engine as black boxes, where a hybrid query planner splits an input query and delegates the appropriate sub-queries to each interface. In this paper, we discuss query planning alternatives and their main strengths and weaknesses. We also present coherence measures to quantify the coverage and <b>freshness</b> for cached <b>indexes</b> of Linked Data, and show how these measures can be used for hybrid query planning to optimise the trade-off between fresh results and fast runtimes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fluorescent}} {{properties of}} {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from groundwater in the coastal Dagu River watershed, North China were determined using excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) analysis. Surface water DOM samples were also investigated for comparison. Two humic-like components (C 1 : 250, 355 / 472 nm; C 2 : < 240, 325 / 400 nm) and one protein-like component (C 3 : < 240, 280 / 340 nm) were identified using parallel factor analysis. Low intensities for all components were observed in groundwater DOM from {{the upper and lower}} reaches of the study area. However, higher abundances of these components occurred in the middle reaches, reflecting the combined effect of seepage of surface water with strong anthropogenic pollution and the alteration of groundwater circulation due to cutoff {{as a result of the}} construction of a cutoff wall since the late 1990 s. The humic-like components were dominant in groundwater DOM, with the average percentage of the protein-like component being only 15 %, which was less than half of the corresponding percentage in surface water DOM. The <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> in groundwater DOM was lower than the surface water samples, while the fluorescence index and humification index were higher than in the latter. These indices demonstrated the much higher degree of humification for groundwater DOM, which may be related to the longer residence time of groundwater and greater contribution of microbial degradation in the aquifer environment. This study demonstrated that EEMs could distinguish between the effects of natural background and human activities on the quantity and characteristics of the groundwater DOM, and thus could be a useful tool for studing the carbon dynamics and the controlling factors in groundwater systems...|$|E
40|$|Membrane hybrid processes-coagulation {{coupled with}} {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) -have become a common method {{to comply with}} the legal, chemical, and microbiological requirements for drinking water. The main advantages of integrating coagulation with membrane filtration are the enhanced removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and reduced membrane fouling. With in-line coagulation, coagulants are patched into the feed stream directly prior to the membrane process, without removing the coagulated solids. Compared with conventional coagulation/sedimentation, in-line coagulation/membrane reduces the treatment time and footprint. Coagulant dosing could be challenging in raw water of varying quality; however, with relatively stable specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), dosing can be controlled. Recent studies indicate that UV absorbance correlates well with humic substances (HS), the major fraction to be removed during coagulation. This paper describes and evaluates a 30 -month UF pilot trial on the surface water of Lake Neden (Sweden), providing drinking water to 60, 000 residents. In this study, automatic coagulant dosing based on online measurement was successfully applied. Online sensor data were used to identify the current optimal aluminium coagulation conditions (0. 5 - 0. 7 mg L- 1) and the potential boundaries (0. 9 - 1. 2 mg L- 1) for efficient future (2040) NOM removal. The potential increase in NOM could affect the Al dose and drinking water quality significantly within 20 years, should the current trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) prevail. UV absorbance, the <b>freshness</b> <b>index,</b> and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) measurements were used to optimise the process.

The essential {{free amino acids}} in the highest concentrations were threonine, leucine, valine, lysine and arginine, all over 40 mg/ 100 g. Threonine, valine, lysine and arginine concentrations decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) during storage. These decreases were more pronounced in the lots kept in the CO 2 -rich mix (1) than the lots kept in the O 2 -rich mix (2) and this was independent of whether the storage was under controlled (C) or modified (M) atmosphere. The dipeptide anserine showed decreases with the same trend. The most abundant non-essential FAAs were glycine, alanine and glutamic acid (57. 9, 57. 2 and 31. 2 mg/ 100 g, respectively), along with the dipeptide anserine (52. 9 mg/ 100 g). The non-essential FAAs presented differences attributable to the gas mixes used.

40|$|Freshness {{quality is}} {{considered}} {{as an important}} factor in determining overall quality of particular fish product items. The degree to which the freshness quality of the items meets the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s expectation concerning freshness quality will greatly affect whether the fisheries product item will be purchased again or not. Considering the importance of fish freshness quality, many methods have been proposed to evaluate fish freshness including physical, chemical and sensory methods. The K value is one of the chemical methods widely used, especially in Japan, as a fish <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> to evaluate the quality change of raw fish. Tuna has been regarded as a palatable and valuable fish species and its freshness is the concern of many researchers. This study is aimed at investigating the freshness change of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) during storage at low temperatures (10 oC, 5 oC and 0 oC) by measuring the K value of the fish. Observation on the changes of ATP and its related compounds during storage was also carried out. The result of the study shows that the freshness of yellowfin tuna as measured by K value, changed in different patterns depending on the storage temperatures. The higher the temperature of storage the faster was the decrease in freshness of yellowfin tuna. It was also observed that yellowfin tuna could be eaten raw up to 1 day, 2 days and 4 days storage at temperature of 10 º C, 5 º C and 0 º C, respectively. Storage temperature of 0 º C is recommended for its preservation in chilled state. The use of HPLC allows for each of ATP-related compounds to be determined quantitatively. The Ki value is more appropriate for measuring fish freshness obtained more than 24 hours after deat...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to screen out the suitable fresh-keeping agent for fresh cut flowers of Gladiolus hybridus. Cut flowers of Gladiolus occupy a major share in floriculture industry. For a viable cut flower business {{it is very important to}} maintain high quality of the produce. The qualitative and quantitative post harvest losses of gladiolus can be reduced by adopting improved technologies like harvesting at proper stage, use of floral preservatives and bud opening solution, pulsing, precooking, improved storage techniques such as low temperature storage, proper packaging methods etc (Yoram et al., 1981). The effects of 6 pretreatment on the <b>freshness</b> <b>index</b> of cut Gladinlous showerd an increased of the Gladiolus vase life (Reid and Award 1980). Gladiolus flowers were obtained from freshly cut in the morning from experimental collection of USAMV Cluj, department of Floriculture and kept at 5 oC until were nutritive solutions treated later in the same day. 8 cultivars of G. hybridus (‘Corula’, ‘Priscilla’, ‘Candida Ali’, ‘Cipriana’, ‘Nova Lux’, ‘White Prosperity’, ‘Peter Pears’ and ‘Jester’) were treated with the next four solutions: Flower Food, Spring, Native and sucrose 3 % + citric acid 0, 015 % to determine the best solution for preservation and the vase life of cut flowers. All flowers were introduced solutions and kept at about 25 oC in room conditions. Control flowers were kept in water. Gladiolus hybridus cultivars treated with sucrose 3 % + citric acid 0, 015 % showed a few increasing comparatively with water control and the other treatments showed positively values statically (Tab. 1). The best results at preservation in vase life of cut gladiolus flowers in this experiment were obtained at ‘White Prosperity ” and ‘Priscilla’...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Soil {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) is a small but {{crucial part of the}} forest carbon cycle. Characterizing the relationship between detrital inputs and soil DOC chemistry is crucial to understanding the ultimate fate of root carbon, fallen wood and needles. Chemical differences in the DOC pool may help to explain whether fractions are sorbed to mineral surfaces and contribute to accumulation of soil organic carbon, respired as CO₂, or exported to nearby catchments. Soil solution DOC was sampled from the detrital input and removal treatment (DIRT) plots located in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR to determine whether detrital inputs impart a detectable signal on DOC in mineral soil. Multiple types of fresh litter extracts, along with lysimeter and soil extracts from DIRT treatment plots were characterized using UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with the Cory and McKnight (2005) parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model. Principal component analysis of 13 unique fluorophores distinguished using PARAFAC show that litter and soil extracts (Douglas-fir needles, wood of decomposition Class 1, Class 3 and Class 5, O-horizon, and 0 - 5 cm A-horizon) each have distinct fluorescence signatures. However, while litter-leached DOC chemistry varies by litter type, neither lysimeter-collected DOC or soil extracts show statistically significant differences in fluorescence signatures among treatments, even after 17 years of litter manipulations. The lack of observed differences among DIRT treatments suggests an exchange hypothesis whereby both abiotic and biotic mechanisms effectively homogenize organic carbon constituents within the dissolved pool. Change in PARAFAC components and optical indices with soil depth and during a 1 -month biodegradation incubation of litter and soil extracts provided insight into the characteristics of PARAFAC components and the application of the Redox Index in soils. Patterns in the <b>Freshness</b> <b>Index</b> and Fluorescence Index as a result of incubation varied widely among replicates, indicating the indices may not be suitable in these soils. The results of this work emphasize the ability of sorption and biodegradation to homogenize soil DOC and demonstrate that fluorescence can be an effective fingerprinting technique for soil DOC composition...|$|E
40|$|A meta-search engine acts as {{an agent}} for the {{participant}} search engines. It receives queries from users and redirects them {{to one or more}} of the participant search engines for processing. A meta-search engine incorporating many participant search engines is better than a single global search engine in terms of the number of pages <b>indexed</b> and the <b>freshness</b> of the <b>indexes.</b> The meta-search engine stores descriptive data (i. e., descriptors) about the index maintained by each participant search engine so that it can estimate the relevance of each search engine when a query is received. The ability for the meta-search engine to select the most relevant search engines determines the quality of the final result. To facilitate the selection process, the document space covered by each search engine must be described not only concisely but also precisely. Existing methods tend to focus on the conciseness of the descriptors by keeping a descriptor for a search engine 's entire index. This paper proposes to cluster a search engine's document space into clusters and keep a descriptor for each cluster. We show that cluster descriptors can provide a finer and more accurate representation of the document space, and hence enable the meta-search engine to improve the selection of relevant search engines. Two cluster-based search engine selection scenarios (i. e., independent and high-correlation) are discussed in this paper. Experiments verify that the cluster-based search engine selection can effectively identify the most relevant search engines and improve the quality of the search results consequently. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{explores the}} problem of {{substring}} search in a dynamic document set. The operations supported are document inclusion, document removal and queries. This is a well explored field for word indexes, but not for substring indexes. The contributions of this report is the exploration of a multi-document dynamic suffix tree (MDST), which is compared with using a hierarchy of static indexes using suffix arrays. Only memory resident data structures are explored. The concept of a ``generalised suffix tree'', indexing a static set of strings, is used in bioinformatics. The implemented data structure adds online document inclusion, update and removal, linear on the single document size. Various models for the hierarchy of static indexes is explored, some which of give faster update, and some faster search. For the static suffix arrays, the BPR cite{SS 05 } construction algorithm is used, which is the fastest known. This algorithm is about 3 - 4 {{times faster than the}} implemented suffix tree construction. Two tricks for speeding up search and hit reporting in the suffix array are also explored: Using a start index for the binary search, and a direct map of global addresses to document IDs and local addresses. The tests show that the MDST is much faster than the hierarchic indexes when the <b>index</b> <b>freshness</b> requirement is absolute, and the documents are small. The tree uses about three times as much memory as the suffix arrays. When there is a large number of hits, the suffix arrays are slightly faster on reporting hits, as there they have better memory locality. If you have enough primary memory, the MDST seems to be the best choice in general. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{traceability}} of {{fishery products}} imposes a precise identification of fish species to trade. The morphological identification of fishery products is generally practiced on whole fish applying the identification keys proposed by FAO. Scope The {{objective of this}} paper is describe the characteristics of freshness common to the species of the family "Carangidae" and those specific to certain species in particular. Also I want to give accurate information on how to recognize and morphological identification of different species and different genres that make up the family "Carangidae" emphasizing some of the features that allow to investigate potential fraud replacement. Materials and methods The camera used is a camera "Canon EOS 20 " with 18 - 55 mm lens. I performed a radiographic study for the highlight of the spine and other bony structures. Results Carangidae have 2 dorsal fins and the ventral fin in thoracic position. The body shape is extremely variable, present the caudal peduncle depending on the species or a lateral fairing moderately showy and dorsal and ventral grooves. The lateral line is more or less curved anteriorly and posteriorly straight up the base of the caudal fin. Some species have prominent badges that are bigger chips, thick and sometimes sharp on the lateral line. In this work I evidence that a radiologic image of spine can identify a Seriola dumerili (total vertebral number: 24) from Seriola lalandi (25) : it is a non-invasive technique. The official method for the sensory evaluation of freshness of fish products is governed by EC Regulation 2406 / 96 that divides the fish into 4 categories (Extra, A, B and unsuitable) according to their degree of <b>freshness.</b> With Quality <b>Index</b> Method (QIM) you can get an estimate of the remaining shelf-life because it is linearly related to the storage time of fresh fish on ice...|$|R
