After the prolongation of the release date for territories outside Japan and Europe, drummer Charlie Benante posted an explanation on the band's official website: [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> this but... the record got pushed back to April 15.

[...] It was later announced that the release date for Europe would be also pushed back to March 3, 2003, eventually setting it on May 6. The problems occurred after a breakdown in negotiations between Beyond Records and Sanctuary Records over a buy-out of the band's contract. According to Blabbermouth, Beyond Records {{was in the process}} of selling their entire catalog to Sanctuary, but the arrangement have fallen through. However, the problems were resolved and the record was successfully distributed through Sanctuary in North America and Nuclear Blast in Europe.|$|E

If he thinks he has wit enough to manage his own matters, let him try it--let him try it.

And so, Mr. Mowbray, you see what sort of an odd fellow I am, and you can satisfy me at once whether you mean to come into my measures--only speak out at once, sir, for I abhor hesitation." ...|$|R
