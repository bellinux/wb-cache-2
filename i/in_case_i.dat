500|$|Mary {{became a}} {{domiciliary}} health visitor and midwife, and was on-call day or night, [...] {{where she was}} needed as a midwife. Her eldest son, Paul, said his first memory was watching her cycling away when it was snowing heavily. After she {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer, Mary still carried on cycling to work, but often doubled up in pain and had trouble breathing. The day Mary was due to have a mastectomy operation, she cleaned the McCartney house and laid her two sons' school clothes out, ready for the next day. She said to Dill Mohin, her sister-in-law, [...] "Now everything's ready for them <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>I</b> don't come back." [...] Mary died of an embolism on 31 October 1956, after an operation {{to stop the spread of}} breast cancer. Her last words to Dill Mohin were [...] "I would love to have seen the boys growing up." [...] Mary was buried on 3 November 1956 at Yew Tree Cemetery, Finch Lane, Liverpool. Paul later named his daughter Mary after his mother, and Michael released an album entitled Woman in 1972, including the song, [...] "Woman," [...] with a photo of Mary on the front cover.|$|E

He never {{supported}} a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire [...] "to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort." [...] One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into pneumonia. Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family. His last words were [...] "May God grant me these last wishes—peace and prosperity for Brazil". While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: [...] "It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>I</b> die away from my fatherland." ...|$|E

Outnumbered but undaunted, Custer rode {{to the head}} of the regiment, [...] "drew his saber, threw off his hat so they could see his long yellow hair" [...] and shouted...

[...] "So sudden was the collision that many of the horses were turned end over end and crushed their riders beneath them...." [...] As the Confederate advance stopped, their right flank was struck by troopers of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Michigan.

[...] On At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Ebert, Siskel began his review by saying [...] "it's physically ugly, it contains at least a dozen gory gross-out scenes, some of its special effects are cheap—surprisingly cheap because this film cost a reported $40–45 million—and its story is confusing beyond belief. <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>I</b> haven't made myself clear, I hated watching this film." [...] The film was later listed as the worst film of 1984 and the [...] "biggest disappointment of the year" [...] in their [...] "Stinkers of 1984" [...] episode.

Despite initial opposition from the medical profession she underwent several treatments of artificial insemination at a Cambridge clinic, and gave birth to son Milo Roberto Andrea sixteen months later, on 10 July 1977. She said at the time: [...] "Roberto and I were very anxious to provide a brother or sister to our two sons. Now, thanks to the care and patience of the doctors, it has been made possible for me to have another reminder of my wonderful husband." [...] British newspapers called Milo the [...] "miracle baby". The birth announcement consisted of a simple card drawn by Casali with the Love is... girl pushing a pram on the front, with the inscription inside: [...] "Proudly presenting Milo Roberto. Parents: Kim and the late Roberto (posthumously by artificial insemination)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{agreement}} {{regarding the}} Conteo Rápido was as follows: Using {{the results that}} had been obtained by 10:00 pm on July 2, the technical committee would perform a statistical analysis (described below). Once it was finished, the committee would give Luis Carlos Ugalde, {{the president of the}} IFE, a report with one of four recommendations/conclusions: (i) that there was sufficient clarity and assurances as to which political party would get the most votes; (ii) that more time was needed to obtain further data that would clarify the conclusions; (iii) that the race was too close to call; or (iv) that there was an insufficient scientific basis to apply the tests on the samples obtained. Ugalde would then make the conclusions of the report public; again, as per prior agreement, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> (<b>i)</b> the winner would be announced; in case (ii), an announcement would be made to that effect and the announcement of the conclusion postponed for no more than two hours; and in case (iii) the race would be labeled [...] "too close to call" [...] and the precise results (i.e., who was ahead according to the analysis) would not be revealed.

Next came two Chief Eunuchs advancing crabwise {{on either side of the}} path; ten paces behind them came the centre of the procession. If I was being carried in a chair there would be two junior eunuchs walking beside me to attend to my wants at any moment; if I was walking they would be supporting me. Next came an eunuch with a large silk canopy followed by a large group of eunuchs, some empty-handed, others holding all sorts of things: a seat <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>I</b> wanted to rest, changes of clothing, umbrellas and parasols. After these eunuchs of the Imperial Presence came eunuchs of the Imperial tea bureau with boxes of various kinds of cakes and delicacies ... They were followed by eunuchs of the Imperial dispensary ... at the end of the procession came the eunuchs who carried commodes and chamberpots. If I was walking, a sedan-chair, open or covered according to the season, would bring up the rear. This motley procession of several dozen people would proceed in perfect silence and order".Puyi never had any privacy and had all his needs attended to at all times, having eunuchs open doors for him, dress him, wash him, and even blow air into his soup to cool it. Puyi delighted in humiliating his eunuchs, at one point, saying that as the [...] "Lord of TenThousand Years" [...] it was his right to order an eunuch to eat dirt, recalling: [...] "‘Eat that for me’ I ordered, and he knelt down and ate it". At his meals, Puyi was always presented with a huge buffet containing every conceivable dish, the vast majority of which he did not eat, and everyday Puyi wore new clothing as Chinese emperors never reused their clothing. The eunuchs had their own reasons for presenting Puyi with buffet meals and new clothing every day, as Puyi's used clothes made from the finest silk were sold on the black market while the food that Puyi did not eat was either sold or eaten by the eunuchs themselves.|$|E
