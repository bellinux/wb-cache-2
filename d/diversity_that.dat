5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} of conserving B.brownii in its present disease-exposed locations, it is an especially suitable candidate for ex situ conservation measures, such as the cold-storage of seed, and the translocation of plants to disease-free locations. Seed of B.brownii has been collected by Western Australia's Threatened Flora Seed Centre, and placed in cold-storage both in Perth and at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. This includes seed collected from populations that have since become extinct. In 2008, some of this seed was germinated, and seedlings were planted at a location near Albany. Genetic analysis of the seedlings revealed some genetic <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> was not present in any extant population. The conservation of these seeds had thus preserved some of the species' genetic <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> would otherwise have been lost through population extinction, providing a powerful example of the importance of seed banking to conservation efforts. A seed orchard was planted in 2007, and by 2010 this had yielded over 400 disease-free, healthy plants, some of which had grown {{more than three times the}} rate of those in the wild. A 2007 seedling flowered for the first time at Wakehurst Place in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, giant lemurs {{existed on}} Madagascar. Now {{represented}} only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms {{that were once}} part of the rich lemur <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives. All 17extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200kg (440lb), and {{are thought to have}} been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.|$|E

50|$|Field {{experiments}} {{to test the}} degree to which diversity affects community productivity have had variable results, but many long term studies in grassland ecosystems have found <b>that</b> <b>diversity</b> does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems. Additionally, evidence of this relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. The differing results between studies may partially be attributable to their reliance on samples with equal species diversities rather than species <b>diversities</b> <b>that</b> mirror those observed in the environment. A 2006 experiment utilizing a realistic variation in species composition for its grassland samples found a positive correlation between increased diversity and increased production.|$|R

25|$|The {{planting}} programme of the 1940s was principally of oak, {{but also}} larch, Scots pine and Corsican pine. Unlike in a coppice-with-standards rotation, Bedford Purlieus woodland {{is much more}} even in age. However, when an ancient woodland is cleared and planted the result {{is not just a}} monoculture of the newly planted trees. The canopy is now a mix of the planted trees, self-sown trees and shrubs, and regrowth of coppice stools, some probably of more recent origin, other stools clearly dating back to antiquity. The species <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> characterises the woods was thus retained, and oak, lime, large-leaved elm, hazel, ash, field maple, English elm, sycamore, chestnut and birch are all to be found in substantial quantities.|$|E

25|$|In Capitalism and Freedom (1962), Friedman further {{developed}} Friedrich Hayek's {{argument that}} economic freedom, while itself {{an extremely important}} component of total freedom, is also {{a necessary condition for}} political freedom. He commented that centralized control of economic activities was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is especially important to minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.|$|E
25|$|Daytime {{programming}} alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, {{and court}} shows {{cost up to}} 50% less to produce than scripted dramas, making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a timeslot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, {{as was the case}} with Sunset Beach and Port Charles. Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes. In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as cliched plots, a lack of <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.|$|E
25|$|Gamergate {{supporters}} were {{critical of the}} wave of articles calling for <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose {{from a list of}} target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser. Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.|$|E

25|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks. A conventional single hop system uses direct transmission where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as contribution. That is, cooperative diversity decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative {{diversity is}} an antenna <b>diversity</b> <b>that</b> uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity. User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E
