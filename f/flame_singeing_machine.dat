It so flounced about, half on earth and partly in the air, that it was {{impossible}} to say which element it rested upon. It opened its snake-jaws to such an abominable width, that Pegasus might almost, I was going to say, have flown right down its throat, wings outspread, rider and all! At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of <b>flame,</b> <b>singeing</b> the wings of Pegasus, scorching off one whole side of the young man's golden ringlets, and making them both far hotter than was comfortable, from head to foot.|$|R

5000|$|Mercerising {{results in}} the {{swelling}} of the cell wall of the cotton fibre. This causes {{an increase in the}} surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel. An optional last step in the process is passing the thread over an open <b>flame,</b> or <b>singeing.</b> This incinerates stray fibers, improving the fabric's appearance. This is known as [...] "gassing the thread" [...] because of the gas burner that is typically used.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling multi-operation jobs on a <b>singe</b> <b>machine</b> to minimize the total completion time. Each job consists of several operations that belong to different families. In a schedule each family of job operations may be processed as batches with each batch incurring a set-up time. A job is completed when all of its operations have been processed. We first show {{that the problem is}} strongly NP-hard even when the set-up times are common and each operation is not missing. When the operations have identical processing times and either the maximum set-up time is sufficiently small or the minimum set-up time is sufficiently large, the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then {{consider the}} problem under the job-batch restriction in which the operations of each batch is partitioned into operation batches according to a partition of the jobs. We show that this case of the problem can be solved in polynomial time under a certain condition. ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one market-age swine {{slaughtered}} in the University of Kentucky abattoir were inoculated with fecal slurry containing two {{strains of}} nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella typhimurium on the ham, belly, and jowl regions {{on each side}} of the carcass. Trial 1 revealed that a 10 s hot water spray was just as effective as the 20 s spray in removing S. typhimurium, as there was no distinguishable difference in population. The shorter <b>flame</b> <b>singe</b> (10 s) was as effective as the 20 s application and the two chlorine solutions (100, 200 ppm) had similar results. The 2 % lactic acid spray reduced S. typhimurium populations significantly more than the 1 % treatment. Trial 2 compared the four most efficient levels of each intervention method. Efficacy of the intervention methods was observed in the following order: Hot water (10 s) > Chlorine (50 ppm) = Lactic acid (2 %) > Flame (10 s). The effect of carcass area was significant following the post treatment hot water rinse. The jowl area was least accessible by the high pressure water spray. However after the treatment applications, hot water rinse, and 24 h chill (2 ºC) there was no significant difference between treated and untreated carcasses or between carcass areas...|$|R
40|$|During {{heat-setting}} {{of textiles}} in stenting frames the emission of vaporable substances from fibre accompanying agents {{and parts of}} the liquor composition can occur. Organic emissions have been detected by a flame-ionisation-detector (FID) and by the adsorption of the substances on silicagel (Coulometrie). An indication to the composition of the emissions can be derived from non-constant proportionalities of the results from FID and Coulometrie. During the project not only the emissions of stenter-frame processes were detected, but also from drying-, thermosol- and <b>singeing</b> <b>machine</b> processes. Vaporable substances on textiles can in principle be detected by head-space-gaschromatographie or thermogravimetry. But it is impossible to give a forecast on the effective emissions from this knowledge. Therefore the development of an apparatus is described which allows the determination of the emissions in dependence on process parameters in laboratory and also, the development of finishing recipes for minimized emissionsAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 94 B 74 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R

40|$|Control of {{the warp}} and weft yarn tension is an {{important}} factor. In this research, effect of warp yarn tension variations {{on the quality of}} greige and dyed woven fabrics was investigated. Six fabric samples (three Plain and three Twill weaves) were woven on shuttle loom at varied warp yarn tension. The fabric samples were then pre-treated and dyed (Drimarene Red Cl 5 B, 3 % owf) using laboratory <b>singeing</b> <b>machine</b> and HT dyeing machine. Greige fabric quality such as fabric inspection, fabric length, fabric width, GSM (Gram per Square Meter), EPI (Ends per Inch), PPI (Picks per Inch), and dyed fabric quality such as L*, a*, b*, C, h o, (K/S) ?max and fastness properties were assessed according to the standard. It has been observed that fabric samples, both Plain and Twill weave; woven at improper warp yarns tension gives rejected greige fabric quality and 1 - 7 % lower (K/S) 550 nm values as compared to the fabric weave at requisite warp yarn tension such as 38 - 39 cN for Plain fabric and 78 cN for Twill fabric for 42 x 38 and 64 x 36 tex construction. Hence, among other weave faults, warp yarn tension variation has influence on the greige fabric quality as well as caused improper and uneven dyeing behavior...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} impart the {{required}} functional properties to the fiber or fabric, it is customary to subject {{the material to}} different types of physical and chemical treatments. For example, wash and wear finish for a cotton fabric is necessary to make it -free or wrinkle-free. In a similar way, mercerising, <b>singeing,</b> <b>flame</b> retardant, water repellent, waterproof, anti-static and peach finishing achieve various fabric properties desired by consumers.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people bring}} {{clothing}} to special experts who are employed {{to detect the}} presence of shatnez. A linen admixture can be detected {{during the process of}} dyeing cloth, as wool absorbs dye more readily than linen does. Wool can be distinguished from linen by four tests—feeling, burning, tasting, and smelling; linen burns in a <b>flame,</b> while wool <b>singes</b> and creates an unpleasant odor. Linen thread has a gummy consistency if chewed, due to its pectin content; a quality only found in bast fibers.|$|R
60|$|But the horses, meanwhile, were {{in danger}} of being suffocated, and the dry moss under foot was burning so {{fiercely}} that the fire threatened to spread in spite of their exertions. Seeing this, Bunco and Larry--first casting loose the horses--ran with their kettles and mugs to a neighbouring stream for water, which they poured on the moss. By this time they were nearly surrounded by fire and smoke; the flames roared with appalling fury; the horse that had done all the mischief got burnt about the legs, threw himself down in the very midst of the fire and rolled in agony. Axes and kettles were instantly dropped, and all sprang to the rescue; grasped the creature by the head and tail, but could not drag him out. In desperation, Larry seized a stick, and so belaboured him that he leaped up and rushed out of the smoke and <b>flames,</b> terribly <b>singed,</b> indeed, but not much hurt otherwise. After this the fire was again attacked, and gradually its progress was cut off, so that our travellers were ultimately enabled to remove to a place of safety. But the flames had only been checked; they soon spread again, and, away to leeward of them, set the whole region on fire. From their new encampment that night, they could see rolling clouds of smoke mingling with tongues of flame which shot up, ever and anon, above the trees, and brought out in strong relief, or cast into deep shadow, the crags, gorges, and caverns of the mountains--presenting a scene of terrible devastation and indescribable sublimity.|$|R
6000|$|The {{thermometer}} {{showed an}} altitude of 3,350 feet: under the tree's cool shade, the climate reminded me of Southern Italy in winter. I found a butter-cup, and heard a wood-pecker [18] tapping on the hollow trunk, a reminiscence of English glades. The Abban and his men urged an advance in the afternoon. But my health had suffered from the bad water of the coast, and the camels were faint with fatigue: we therefore dismissed the hired beasts, carried our property into a deserted kraal, and, lighting a fire, prepared to [...] "make all snug" [...] for the night. The Bedouins, chattering with cold, stood closer to the comfortable blaze than ever did pater familias in England: they smoked their faces, toasted their hands, broiled their backs with intense enjoyment, and waved their legs to and fro through the <b>flame</b> to <b>singe</b> away the pile, which at this season grows long. The End of Time, who was surly, compared them to demons, and quoted the Arab's saying:--"Allah never bless smooth man, or hairy woman!" [...] On the 8th of December, at 8 A.M., we travelled slowly up the Halimalah Valley, whose clayey surface glistened with mica and quartz pebbles from the hills. All the trees are thorny except the Sycamore and the Asclepias. The Gub, or Jujube, grows luxuriantly in thickets: its dried wood is used by women to fumigate their hair [19]: the Kedi, a tree like the porcupine,--all spikes,--supplies the Bedouins with hatchet-handles. I was shown the Abol with its edible gum, {{and a kind of}} Acacia, here called Galol. Its bark dyes cloth a dull red, and the thorn issues from a bulb which, when young and soft, is eaten by the Somal, when old it becomes woody, and hard as a nut. At 9 A.M. we crossed the Lesser Abbaso, a Fiumara with high banks of stiff clay and filled with large rolled stones: issuing from it, we traversed a thorny path over ascending ground between higher hills, and covered with large boulders and step-like layers of grit. Here appeared several Gudabirsi tombs, heaps of stones or pebbles, surrounded by a fence of thorns, or an enceinte of loose blocks: in the latter, slabs are used to make such houses as children would build in play, to denote the number of establishments left by the deceased. The new grave is known by the conical milk-pails surmounting the stick {{at the head of the}} corpse, upon the neighbouring tree is thrown the mat which bore the dead man to his last home, and hard by are the blackened stones upon which his funeral feast was cooked. At 11 A.M. we reached the Greater Abbaso, a Fiumara about 100 yards wide, fringed with lovely verdure and full of the antelope called Gurnuk: its watershed was, as usual in this region, from west and south-west to east and north-east. About noon we halted, having travelled eight miles from the Holy Tree.|$|R

I leaped into Etna's flaming abyss, and roared with the giants for ten long months, polluting with my groans the Mount's sulphureous mouth--ah! ten long months. The volcano fermented, and in a fiery stream of lava cast me up.
