40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of three knowledge-transfer intervention trial types (postal, group, one-to-one) to promote best practice to treat sheep with footrot. Further aims were to investigate whether farmer behaviour (i. e. management of lameness) before the trial was associated with uptake of best practice and whether the benefits of best practice framed positively or negatively influenced change in behaviour. The intervention was a message developed from evidence and expert opinion. It was entitled “Six steps to sound sheep” and promoted (1) catch sheep within three days of becoming lame, (2) inspect feet without <b>foot</b> <b>trimming,</b> (3) correctly diagnose the cause, (4) treat sheep lame with footrot or interdigital dermatitis with antibiotic injection and spray without <b>foot</b> <b>trimming,</b> (5) record the identity of treated sheep, (6) cull repeatedly lame sheep. In 2013, 4000 randomly-selected English sheep farmers were sent a questionnaire, those who responded were recruited to the postal (1081 farmers) or one-to-one intervention (32 farmers) trials. A random sample of 400 farmers were invited to join the group trial; 78 farmers participated. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to all participants in summer 2014. There were 72 %, 65 % and 91 % useable responses for the postal, group and one-to-one trials respectively. Between 2013 and 2014, the reduction in geometric mean (95 % CI) period prevalence of lameness, proportional between flock reduction in lameness and within flock reduction in lameness was greatest in the one-to-one (7. 6 % (7. 1 – 8. 2 %) to 4. 3 % (3. 6 – 5. 0 %), 35 %, 72 %) followed by the group (4. 5 % (3. 9 – 5. 0 %) to 3. 1 % (2. 4 – 3. 7 %), 27 %, 55 %) and then the postal trial (from 3. 5 % (3. 3 – 3. 7 %) to 3. 2 % (3. 1 – 3. 4 %), 21 %, 43 %). There was a marginally greater reduction in lameness in farmers using most of Six steps but slow to treat lame sheep pre-trial than those not using Six steps at all.

40|$|AbstractFootrot, {{including}} interdigital dermatitis, {{is caused}} by Dichelobacter nodosus cause the majority of lameness in sheep in the UK. Lame sheep often have overgrown hoof horn but recent evidence has indicated that trimming overgrown hoof horn increases recovery time, and that routine <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> of the flock does not reduce the prevalence or incidence of lameness. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the temporal associations between hoof horn length, footrot and climate. Fifty multiparous ewes were monitored for 10 months. On eight occasions hoof horn length, foot lesions and body condition were recorded. At the first examination, ewes were assigned to one of two treatment groups. All ewes that became lame with footrot were treated at one time point per week, either by trimming hoof horn and applying a topical antibiotic spray or with parenteral antibiotic and topical antibiotic spray. Hoof horn length in ewes at pasture varied over the year and was associated with temperature and rainfall. New cases of footrot occurred all year round and were associated with prior prevalence of footrot in the flock and prior temperature and rainfall. Overgrown hoof horn did not precede lameness but occurred once the sheep were lame. One year of prompt treatment of footrot reduced the range in hoof horn length in the sheep in both treatment groups. At {{the end of the study}} the hoof lengths of ewes in both groups were not significantly different. On this farm, hoof horn length was self-regulating in both non-lame and treated lame sheep whether trimming was part of the treatment or not and there would have been no benefit from routine <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> of this flock...|$|E

40|$|A {{positively}} controlled, {{randomised controlled trial}} (RCT) {{was undertaken}} to test recovery of cows with claw horn lesions resulting in lameness of greater than two weeks duration. Cows on seven commercial farms were mobility scored fortnightly and selected by lameness severity and chronicity. Study cows all received a therapeutic trim then random allocation of: no further treatment (trim only (TRM)), plastic shoe (TS) or plastic shoe and NSAID (TSN). Recovery was assessed by mobility score at 42 (± 4) days post treatment by an observer blind to treatment group. Multivariable analysis showed no significant effect of treatment with an almost identical, low response rate to treatment across all groups (Percentage non-lame at outcome: TRM – 15 per cent, TS – 15 per cent, TSN – 16 per cent).

In November 2006, 162 sheep farmers in England responded to a survey on prevalence and management of lameness. The costs of lameness per ewe per year (PEPY) were calculated for 116 flocks. Linear regression was used to model the overall cost of lameness PEPY by management method. Associations between farmer satisfaction and time and money spent managing lameness were investigated. The median prevalence of lameness was 5 % (inter-quartile range, IQR, 4 - 10 %). The overall cost of lameness PEPY in flocks with ≥ 10 % lameness was UK£ 6. 35 versus £ 3. 90 for flocks with < 5 % lameness. Parenteral antibiotic treatment was associated with a significantly lower overall cost of lameness by £ 0. 79 PEPY. Routine <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> and foot bathing were associated with significantly higher overall costs of lameness PEPY of £ 2. 96 and £ 0. 90, respectively. Farmers satisfied with time managing lameness spent significantly less time (1. 46 h PEPY) than unsatisfied farmers (1. 90 h PEPY). Farmers satisfied with money spent managing lameness had significantly lower treatment (£ 2. 94 PEPY) and overall (£ 5. 00 PEPY) costs than dissatisfied farmers (£ 5. 50 and £ 7. 60 PEPY, respectively). If the farmers in this study adopted best practice of parenteral antibiotic treatment with no routine <b>foot</b> <b>trimming,</b> and minimised foot bathing for treatment/prevention of interdigital dermatitis, the financial benefits would be approximately £ 4. 65 PEPY.

Ninety (A), 108 (B) and 41 (C) sheep from the three mentioned breeds were used for the study. In experiment A, sheep were divided into three groups; two received two levels of prepartum supplementation, while the third did not receive supplementary food. The weight of lambs was measured at 100 days after birth. In experiment B, animals were divided into 4 groups; three received different deworming treatments, while the fourth was not dewormed. In this case, the weight of lambs was also measured at 100 days after birth. In experiment C, sheep did not undergo <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> for eight months; once this time was passed, the incidence and level of injury of each hoof was observed. In absence of prepartum supplementation of ewes and deworming treatment in both sheep and lambs, Chilota lambs showed higher weights at 100 days when compared to RM and SD lambs. In the other way, in absence of hoof trimming, Chilota sheep showed a lower incidence of moderate and severe hoof lesions in comparison with RM and SD.

40|$|In 2013, a {{questionnaire}} {{was used to}} gather data on risks for introduction, and factors associated with prevalence, of contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD). There were 1136 (28. 4 %) usable responses from 4000 randomly selected sheep farmers in England. CODD was present in 58 % (662) of flocks, with a reported prevalence of CODD lesions of 2. 3 %. The geometric mean period prevalence of all lameness was 4. 2 % and 2. 8 % in CODD positive and negative flocks respectively. Factors associated with {{a greater risk of}} presence of CODD were purchasing replacement ewes, not always checking the feet of sheep before purchase, not isolating purchased sheep, foot bathing returning ewes, <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> the flock more than twice in the year all compared with not doing these activities and increasing log 10 flock size. Farmers who vaccinated sheep with Footvax™ were less likely to report presence of CODD. Factors associated with increasing prevalence of CODD lesions were not always checking the feet of purchased sheep, flocks that mixed with other flocks and sheep that left the farm for summer grazing and later returned. In addition, flocks where farmers followed the current recommended managements for control of footrot, had a lower prevalence of CODD whilst those who used foot bathing and where feet bled during routine <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> had a higher prevalence of CODD. The prevalence of CODD decreased with each log 10 increase in flock size. We conclude that CODD is an infectious cause of lameness in sheep of increasing importance in GB. Introduction is linked to poor biosecurity with one likely source of the pathogen being introduction of or mixing with infected sheep. As with footrot, prevalence of CODD was lower in flocks where farmers focused on individual treatment to manage lameness and avoided foot bathing and trimming feet. We conclude that most of the currently recommended biosecurity and treatment approaches to control footrot in GB are also effective for control of CODD...|$|E

40|$|Claw horn {{disruption}} lesions (CHDLs: sole haemorrhage, sole ulcer {{and white}} line disease) cause {{a large proportion}} of lameness in dairy cattle and have a high rate of recurrence, yet their aetiopathogenesis remains poorly understood. Untreated CHDLs appear to be associated with trauma within and damage to the internal anatomy of the foot. Chapter 2 explored associations between abnormal bone modelling on the flexor tuberosity of the distal phalanx of cull cows and lameness during life, using a retrospective cohort study design. The hind claws of 72 Holstein dairy cows culled from a research herd were imaged using μ-computed tomography (CT) and lameness and lesion incidence data were available on cows throughout life. Four measures of bone modelling were taken from CT images from the flexor tuberosity of each distal phalanx, in plantar, distal and dorsal planes, and combined within claw. Bone modelling was greater in older cows, in cows with history of CHDL and in cows that had been lame at an increased proportion of locomotion scores during the 12 months preceding slaughter. Further, histological study demonstrated that the bone modelling resembled heterotopic ossification, also termed osteoma, which could have been due to either inappropriate force transfer through the distal phalanx or pathology in the soft tissues with lesion presence. Anatomical damage within the foot does appear to be associated with lameness and CHDLs, and may further predispose lameness. Preventing lameness constitutes a critical component of lameness control, and prophylactic <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> is a common management strategy for maintaining claw structure and function. However, over-trimming can cause damage to the foot architecture and lameness. Step 1 of the widely used Dutch Method of <b>foot</b> <b>trimming</b> states to cut the dorsal wall of the hoof to 75 mm. A vertical 5 mm step is left at the toe, therefore based on these recommendations, dorsal wall length would be 82 mm if the toe were trimmed to a point and the dorsal wall extended to the floor (at a toe angle of 50 °). Chapter 3 used the CT data to assess the minimum dorsal wall length that would be suitable for trimming each claw. The median length was 76 mm (83 if the toe were trimmed to a point) and ranged from 59 to 86 mm; trimming all claws to 75 mm would have over-trimmed 55...|$|E
