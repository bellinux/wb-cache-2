These data are representative of 182 flight hours accumulated during 1414 flights comprised of the separate legs of the total route structure employed. The operating experiences are presented in terms of the time spent within different airspeed brackets, within the classifiable flight conditions of climb, <b>en</b> <b>route,</b> and <b>descent,</b> at various rates of climb and descent, and at different rotor rotational speeds. The results indicated that the helicopter spent a majority of the flight time at airspeeds either below 40 knots or above 100 knots. Rates of climb and descent were concentrated at values below 5. 1 m/s (1000 ft/min) particularly for higher airspeeds. Normal acceleration experiences were low, both in the total number and peak value realized; however, an extremely large number of pitch angular-velocity experiences were noted. Rotor rotational speeds were normal with no occurrences above the upper red-line limit...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{anticipated}} future demand for air travel, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is investigating a new concept of operations known as Distributed Air-Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM). Under the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> Free Maneuvering component of DAG-TM, appropriately equipped autonomous aircraft self separate from other autonomous aircraft and from managed aircraft that continue to fly under today s Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). Controllers provide separation services between IFR aircraft and assign traffic flow management constraints to all aircraft. To address concept feasibility issues pertaining to integrated air/ground operations at various traffic levels, NASA Ames and Langley Research Centers conducted a joint human-in-the-loop experiment. Professional airline pilots and air traffic controllers flew a total of 16 scenarios under four conditions: mixed autonomous/managed operations at three traffic levels and a baseline all-managed condition at the lowest traffic level. These scenarios included <b>en</b> <b>route</b> flights and <b>descents</b> to a terminal area meter fix in airspace modeled after the Dallas Ft. Worth area. Pilots of autonomous aircraft met controller assigned meter fix constraints with high success. Separation violations by subject pilots did not appear to vary with traffic level and were mainly attributable to software errors and procedural lapses. Controller workload was lower for mixed flight conditions, even at higher traffic levels. Pilot workload was deemed acceptable under all conditions. Controllers raised several safety concerns, most of which pertained to the occurrence of near-term conflicts between autonomous and managed aircraft. These issues are being addressed through better compatibility between air and ground systems and refinements to air and ground procedures...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} trajectory optimization for the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> <b>descent</b> {{phase is}} {{studied in the}} presence of both along track and cross winds, which are both modeled as functions of altitude. The flight range covers some portion of a cruise segment and ends at a meter fix. The descent trajectory is assumed as a flight idle descent. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with both mixed state path constraints and pure state constraints. For minimizing environmental impacts, we optimize descent trajectory with respect to two cost functionals: fuel and emissions cost. We analyze both singular arc and boundary arc using the necessary conditions of the optimality. From the analysis result, we propose the optimal trajectory generation method, in which the optimal trajectory is generated by the backward and forward integration. The trajectory from the proposed algorithm is compared to the numerical optimal solution of the original optimal control problem. The result shows that proposed algorithm generates the same solution as the numerical optimal solution. The wind speed, wind shear, and cross wind effects on the optimal trajectory are analyzed with two aircraft type, Boeing 737 - 500 and Boeing 767 - 400.

40|$|The <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> <b>Descent</b> Advisor (EDA) {{is one of}} the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS) {{decision}} support tools under development at the NASA Ames Research Center. EDA generates maneuver advisories for arrival aircraft to meet scheduled arrival times at the arrival meter fix, sometimes 20 – 25 minutes ahead of the aircraft’s scheduled meter fix arrival time. This work determined the sensistivity of the EDA advisories to system uncertainties, including initial condition, environmental, and aircraft performance data errors. Using a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates a Matlab Trajectory Synthesizer (TS) simulation, the sensitivities of the EDA predicted trajectory to these data error sources were obtained. The key metric is the meter fix crossing time error since this metric directly measures the performance of EDA. This performance analysis involved a minimum of 200 Monte Carlo trials per error parameter. In addition to the single aircraft performance analysis, the impact of aircraft prediction errors on conflict detection between closely-spaced aircraft was also explored. These Monte Carlo performance analyses determined how robust the EDA advisories are to input parameter uncertainties.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fundamental design {{and development of}} a new decision-support tool for time-based arrival metering, referred to as the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> <b>Descent</b> Advisor (EDA). This automation is being developed at NASA Ames Research Center as a component of the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS). EDA computes advisories for the air-traffic controller to help deliver aircraft to an arrival-metering fix in conformance with a scheduled time-of-arrival constraint, while preventing separation conflicts with other aircraft along the arrival trajectory. The CTAS Traffic Management Advisor (TMA), fielded at numerous facilities in the United States under the FAA Free Flight Phase 1 initiative, computes the scheduled arrival times at the metering fix that EDA targets for optimal throughput into the terminal airspace. By computing strategic maneuver advisories based on speed, altitude, and heading to meet arrival time {{with a high degree of}} precision, EDA has the potential to significantly extend the capacity, efficiency, and workload benefits already attributed to TMA operations. The paper first {{describes the}} underlying trajectory process, followed by a description of the core meet-time and conflict resolution algorithms employed by EDA. The key aspects of the user interface are then described, which allow controllers to receive, evaluate, and accept EDA advisories at their discretion. Finally, a closed-loop simulation system for evaluating EDA in the laboratory is described, along with key findings obtained during a series of preliminary controller-in-the-loop simulation experiments.

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry is facing many challenges concerning environmental effects associated to an overall increase in air travel. In order to analyse these environmental effects, {{the possibility for}} measurement in the areas connected to the {{aviation industry}} is essential. Metrics measuring progress towards meeting goals, called key performance indicators, are used {{in order to meet}} this requirement. The purpose of the thesis is to map and evaluate the various environmental key performance indicators that are utilised within European Air Traffic Management today, and the development underway for the future. Suggestions to LFV regarding suitable e-KPIs, and how they can be used within their organisation are also provided. Several organisations and initiatives, including the European Union, EUROCONTROL, Single European Sky, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the Civil Air Navigation Service Organisation, as well as the British and French air navigation service providers, in addition to other stakeholders within the industry, have been investigated in terms of their work in the environmental area and which indicators they utilise. The investigation is based on a literature study and interviews conducted with stakeholders within previously mentioned organisations. Out of 39 indicators found during the mapping, seven remain after an initial selection and an analysis based on the utilisation of the SMART-model. In addition {{to the use of the}} SMART-model, the choice of suitable indicators is also based on the fact that the whole spectrum of a flight, meaning all phases, including planning, taxi-out, departure, <b>en</b> <b>route,</b> <b>descent</b> and arrival as well as taxi-in, should be taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} the control of {{terminal}} area traffic to improve productivity, {{referred to as the}} Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS), is being developed at NASA's Ames Research Center under a joint program with the FAA. CTAS consists of a set of integrated tools that provide computer-generated advisories for en-route and terminal area controllers. The premise behind the design of CTAS has been that successful planning of traffic requires accurate trajectory prediction. Data bases consisting of representative aircraft performance models, airline preferred operational procedures and a three dimensional wind model support the trajectory prediction. The research effort has been the design of a set of automation tools that make use of this trajectory prediction capability to assist controllers in overall management of traffic. The first tool, the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA), provides the overall flow management between the en route and terminal areas. A second tool, the Final Approach Spacing Tool (FAST) provides terminal area controllers with sequence and runway advisories to allow optimal use of the runways. The TMA and FAST are now being used in daily operations at Dallas/Ft. Worth airport. Additional activities include the development of several other tools. These include: 1) the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> <b>Descent</b> Advisor that assist the en route controller in issuing conflict free descents and ascents; 2) the extension of FAST to include speed and heading advisories and the Expedite Departure Path (EDP) that assists the terminal controller in management of departures; and 3) the Collaborative Arrival Planner (CAP) that will assist the airlines in operational decision making. The purpose of this presentation is to review the CTAS concept and to present the results of recent field tests. The paper will first discuss the overall concept and then discuss the status of the individual tools...|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{concerns about}} the impact of aircraft noise on people have centered around the takeoff and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity of airport terminals.

40|$|While airport {{congestion}} {{has long}} been viewed as a major air traffic management problem in the United States, congestion in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace is drawing an increasing amount of attention. Sources of <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion, such as severe weather, often cause the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to delay and reroute aircraft {{in order to ensure}} safety. Most current research into methods for managing <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion seeks to reduce delay or aid in aircraft rerouting. However, there has been less attention paid to delay and reroute allocation methods  an area in which {{there appears to be a}} pressing, practical need.

The CDM-inspired research underlying this thesis led to the development of a software tool, the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> Resource Allocation Prototype (ERAP), that supports the analysis of alternative <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace rationing methods.
