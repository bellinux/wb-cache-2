5|$|The direct {{environmental}} and economic impacts of introduced C. mutica populations remain unknown. They provide valuable food sources for larger predators, particularly fish. In New Zealand, for example, they {{have become part of}} the diet of the native big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis). In Europe, wild and <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> like the common dab (Limanda limanda), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), consume large amounts of non-native C. mutica.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and <b>farmed</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|E

5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. <b>Farmed</b> <b>fish</b> are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aquaculture}} industry, sound {{animal husbandry}} translates to keeping fish clean, well fed, healthy, and not overcrowded. One solution to keeping <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> healthy is to contain them in antifouling copper alloy nets and structures.|$|E
25|$|Aquaculture {{involves}} the farming {{of fish in}} captivity. This approach effectively privatizes fish stocks and creates incentives for farmers to conserve their stocks. It also reduces environmental impact. However, farming carnivorous fish, such as salmon, does not always reduce pressure on wild fisheries, since carnivorous <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> are usually fed fishmeal and fish oil extracted from wild forage fish.|$|E
25|$|During winter, when reduced feeds are {{administered}} to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce {{the rate of}} algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.|$|E

25|$|On a dry-dry basis, {{it takes}} 2–4kg of {{wild caught fish}} to produce one kg of salmon. Wild salmon require about 10kg of forage fish to produce a kg of salmon, {{as part of the}} normal trophic level energy transfer. The {{difference}} between the two numbers is related to farmed salmon feed containing other ingredients beyond fish meal and the fact that <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> do not expend energy hunting.|$|E
25|$|Fishing is the {{activity}} of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching <b>farmed</b> <b>fish,</b> or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The report drew {{widespread}} {{criticism from}} the aquaculture industry because it called for the industry to move to ocean based closed containment within five years. According to the report, open net fish farms {{may contribute to the}} decline of wild salmon populations through the spread of parasitic sea lice and diseases from the <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> to migrating salmon fry. The industry claims that moving to closed-containment is tantamount to ending finfish aquaculture off the British Columbia coast.|$|E

25|$|In {{the marine}} environment, the antimicrobial/algaecidal {{properties}} {{of copper alloys}} prevent biofouling, which can briefly {{be described as the}} undesirable accumulation, adhesion, and growth of microorganisms, plants, algae, tube worms, barnacles, mollusks, and other organisms on man-made marine structures. By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture pens avoid the need for costly net changes that are necessary with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> to grow and thrive.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} notable for its soil {{fertility}} land, including the Ganges Delta, Sylhet Division and the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Agriculture {{is the largest}} sector of the economy, making up 18.6 percent of Bangladesh's GDP in November 2010 and employing about 45 percent of the workforce. The agricultural sector impacts employment generation, poverty alleviation, human resources development and food security. More Bangladeshis earn their living from agriculture than from any other sector. The country is among the top producers of rice (fourth), potatoes (seventh), tropical fruits (sixth), jute (second), and <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> (fifth).|$|E
25|$|Several {{scientific}} {{studies have suggested}} that caged farmed salmon harbour lice to a degree that can destroy surrounding wild salmon populations. Other studies have shown that lice from <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> have relatively no effect on wild fish if good husbandry and adequate control measures are carried out (also, see section: Control on salmon farms). Further studies to establish wild–farmed fish interactions are on-going, particularly in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Norway. A reference manual with protocol and guidelines for studying wild/cultured fish interactions with sea lice has been published.|$|E

25|$|The sillaginids {{are some}} of the most {{important}} commercial fishes in the Indo-Pacific region, with a few species making up the bulk of whiting catches. Their high numbers, coupled with their highly regarded flesh are the reason for this, and their inshore nature also has made them popular targets for recreational fishermen in a number of countries. With overfishing rife in some areas, sustainable aquaculture has allowed the commercial farming of a number of sillaginid species, as well as the use of <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> to restock depleted estuaries. At least one species, the Gangetic whiting, has occasionally been used in brackish water aquaria.|$|E
25|$|Most Indigenous {{communities}} have economies {{based primarily on}} traditional agriculture such as the cultivation and processing of corn, beans and coffee as a cash crop {{and in the last}} decade, many have begun producing sugarcane and jatropha for refinement into biodiesel and ethanol for automobile fuel. The raising of livestock, particularly chicken and turkey {{and to a lesser extent}} beef and <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> is also a major economic activity. Many indigenous, in particular the Maya are employed in the production of traditional clothing, fabrics, textiles, wood items, artworks and traditional goods such as jade and amber works. Tourism has provided a number of a these communities with markets for their handcrafts and works, some of which are very profitable.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} the forage fish caught are fed to animals, in large {{part due to the}} high content of {{beneficial}} long chain omega-3 fatty acids in their flesh. Ninety percent is processed into fishmeal and fish oil. Of this, 46 percent was fed to <b>farmed</b> <b>fish,</b> 24 percent to pigs, and 22 percent to poultry (2002). Six times the weight of forage fish is fed to pigs and poultry alone than the entire seafood consumption of the U.S. market. One of the most promising alternatives to fish oil as a source of long chain omega-3 fatty acids and certain amino acids is algal oil from microalgae, the original source of these fatty acids in forage fish.|$|E
