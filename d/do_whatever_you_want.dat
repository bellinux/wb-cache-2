[...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E

50|$|John Flynn {{later said}} working with Jan Michael Vincent was difficult:Jan was a drinker even then. He had Heinekens for breakfast. There {{was a night}} scene where we {{literally}} had to prop him up. Poor Jan. He latched onto Danny Aiello. Jan loved Danny and tried to give him more of his own lines in the picture. I told Jan he couldn’t mess with the script like that. But Jan was a sweet guy. He never believed {{that he was an}} actor, though. He was embarrassed to be an actor. He always thought he was doing an awful job and that people were laughing at him. You had to keep telling him he was wonderful and he would <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> him to <b>do.</b> Jan was like a little kid, but he just didn’t believe in himself. Talk about actors’ egos. He was the opposite. This was an actor with a non-ego.|$|R

2500|$|Reznor was {{considering}} Adrian Belew (who played in several bands, including King Crimson and the live band for David Bowie) exhibited to Le Pig, so Flood made a welcoming {{phone call and}} invited him to the house surrounding the studio (10050 Cielo Drive).

Reznor responded, [...] "Um, I'm not sure. Probably E. See what happens. Don't worry about it. Here's the tape, [...] <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> Go!". Belew eventually recorded what became the odd ending of the song.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "I'll Do It" [...] was {{described}} as Montag getting [...] "racy" [...] due to the song's sexually explicit lyrics stating to [...] "come eat my panties off of me." [...] Montag addressed the issue by stating [...] "I love it. I'm a very sexual person and I'm married, so it's okay. I think every woman ... has an alter ego. We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> but I'm still kind of in charge here.'

5000|$|JDevil is the EDM alter-ego of Jonathan Davis. He {{has been}} DJing since 1987 {{while he was}} still in high school. He began working for Pacific West Sound and spun at high school dances and parties on the {{weekends}} in Bakersfield. He used to spin New York freestyle, Miami bass, old school hip hop, goth, and industrial. In 2009, he began to DJ again and he introduced JDevil to the world in 2011 at Infected Mushroom appearances and as an opening act on Korn's Path of Totality Tour. Jonathan felt a need to use a unique name while making music. As he states in an interview, he has combined initials (JD), and 'evil' into 'JDevil'. He has nicknamed his wife, Deven, Devil, which also is a part of JDevil moniker. Jonathan has always been fascinated by the devil and JDevil's persona embraces the idea of being the [...] "antichrist of EDM". Jonathan says JDevil represents [...] "indulgence and <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to <b>do</b> and not ignoring your instincts, as long as you don't hurt anybody." [...] JDevil's EDM style combines elements of dubstep, jungle, drum and bass, four-on-the-floor, and metal.|$|R

500|$|... "My {{conception}} of punk", Perry told The Rocket, [...] "was <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> the hell <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> {{as long as}} it had vitality and wasn't overly stupid...something exploratory and experimental", citing influence from genre-bending bands such as The Clash and the Meat Puppets. In their earliest incarnation, Mr. Wiggles played punk-inflected funk and soul music, though Perry's songwriting soon grew to draw heavily from a newfound interest in jazz, swing and rhythm and blues, combining punk rock and jazz arrangements in what Perry described was a desire to contemporize American roots music by infusing it with punk energy and using modernist, socially aware lyricism.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimately, both Williamson and Pryor were {{disappointed}} with the results. [...] "I wanted {{to give him an}} idea, a concept, and then just turn the light on him and let him <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> he <b>wanted.</b> <b>You</b> know what they say about comedians - that you can just open the refrigerator door and the light comes on, the jokes roll on out.

6000|$|True, {{there may}} be a higher courage in living than in dying--a moral courage greater than physical. The courage of the suicide, like that of the pirate, is not {{incompatible}} with a selfish disregard of the rights and interests of others--a cruel recreancy to duty and decency. I have been asked: [...] "Do you not think it cowardly when a man leaves his family unprovided for, to end his life, because he is dissatisfied with life in general?" [...] No, I do not; I think it selfish and cruel. Is not that enough to say of it? Must we distort words from their true meaning in order more effectually to damn the act and cover its author with a greater infamy? A word means something; despite the maunderings of the lexicographers, it <b>does</b> not mean <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it to mean. [...] "Cowardice" [...] means the fear of danger, not the shirking of duty. The writer who allows himself as much liberty in the use of words as he is allowed by the dictionary-maker and by popular consent is a bad writer. He can make no impression on his reader, and would do better service at the ribbon-counter.|$|R

You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just...it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe...it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know?
