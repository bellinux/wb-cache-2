40|$|The {{basis of}} this paper is that we have prioritised the city centre and its {{planning}} sometimes to the impoverishment of the “suburbs” or outlying areas, despite {{the fact that most of}} <b>us</b> <b>live</b> there. Away <b>from</b> the headline projects at the city’s core with its appropriation of architecture to the experience economy and the interests of tourism and retail, there is evidence of creativity and innovation in outlying neighbourhoods, estates and suburbs. Using an expanded range of references from urbanism to service design, cultural studies and environmental writing, Glasgow is taken as a case in point because its large-scale post-industrial regeneration through the use of architecture to brand cultural festivals and centres, is perceived to have overshadowed interesting projects at the periphery. A number of case-studies from different suburban contexts are deployed to illuminate key developments, especially in relation to co-design and changes in consumption and to offer exemplars. These are used to indicate the need for more suburban studies – for Suburbanomics...|$|R
