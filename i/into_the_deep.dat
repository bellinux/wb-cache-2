The Muslims took no prisoners in this battle, although they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the season, a {{shift in}} the Hadley Circulation towards the Tasman Sea {{resulted}} in more frequent episodes of strong wind shear and regular pulses of dry air <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> tropics, significantly hindering tropical cyclogenesis. The below-average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms. Only two systems, Trina and Waka, had significant effects on land. The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was {{regarded as one of the}} most damaging storms in the history of Tonga. Approximately $51.3million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality, the only tropical cyclone-related death of the year, due to cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad Shah I retaliated {{by sending}} his son Jafar Khan to {{recapture}} the lost territory. Jafar emerged victorious in the battle fought with Ahmad Shah I Wali. In 1431, Mahim was recaptured by the Sultanate of Gujarat. The Sultanate's patronage led {{to the construction of}} many mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Mahim, built in honour the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431. After the death of Kutb Khan, the Gujarat commandant of Mahim, Ahmad Shah I Wali again despatched a large army to capture Mahim. Ahmad Shah I responded with a large army and navy under Jafar Khan leading to the defeat of Ahmad Shah I Wali. During 1491–1494, the islands suffered sea piracies from Bahadur Khan Gilani, a nobleman of the Bahamani Sultanate. After the end of the Bahamani Sultanate, Bahadur Khan Gilani and Mahmud Gavan (1482–1518) broke out in rebellion at the port of Dabhol and conquered the islands along with the whole of Konkan. Portuguese explorer Francisco de Almeida's ship sailed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> natural harbour of the island in 1508, and he called it Bom baía (Good Bay). However, the Portuguese paid their first visit to the islands on 21 January 1509, when they landed at Mahim after capturing a Gujarat barge in the Mahim creek. After a series of attacks by the Gujarat Sultanate, the islands were recaptured by Sultan Bahadur Shah.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} commercial fisheries <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> sea has {{raised concerns about}} the vulnerability of this and other deepwater shark species to overfishing, as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates. This is exemplified by the rapid stock depletion and collapse of the Azores kitefin shark fishery. This targeted fishery {{began in the early}} 1970s for the production of liver oil. In the early 1980s, the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets, resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed. After 1991, kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which, along with a drop in the global price of liver oil, led to the fishery becoming unprofitable {{by the end of the}} decade. A population assessment has suggested that the northeastern Atlantic stock had fallen to 50% of the pre-exploitation biomass.|$|E

Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization. The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> South as it was developed.|$|E

At Pangim Albuquerque received envoys from the most important figures of Goa, and proposed religious freedom and lower taxes should they refuse to aid the Muslims. Thereafter they declared their full support towards the Portuguese and Albuquerque formally occupied Goa on February 17th 1510 with no resistance.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the Siberian Traps. In that scenario, warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect would reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, causing the concentration of oxygen to decline. Increased weathering of the continents due to warming and the acceleration of the water cycle would increase the riverine flux of phosphate to the ocean. The phosphate would have supported greater primary productivity in the surface oceans. The increase in organic matter production would have caused more organic matter to sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> ocean, where its respiration would further decrease oxygen concentrations. Once anoxia became established, {{it would have been}} sustained by a positive feedback loop because deep water anoxia tends to increase the recycling efficiency of phosphate, leading to even higher productivity.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese army, {{having taken}} heavy losses during these operations, withdrew the {{majority}} of its force <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> interior and to the north and south ends of Bougainville. On 5 April 1944, the Americal Division's 132nd Infantry Regiment, after establishing patrol sweeps along Empress Augusta Bay, successfully launched an attack to capture the Japanese-held village of Mavavia. Two days later, while continuing a sweep for enemy forces, the Regiment encountered prepared enemy defences, where they destroyed about 20 Japanese pillboxes using pole charges and bazookas. Later, the 132nd, together with elements of the Fiji Defence Force, was tasked with securing the heights west of Saua River. The Allied troops captured Hills 155, 165, 500, and 501 in fierce fighting that lasted until 18 April, when the last of the Japanese defenders were killed or driven off.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today.

Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
