In this paper, {{we develop}} {{heuristics}} for finding <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>points</b> when solving large-scale nonlinear constrained optimization problems (COPs) formulated as nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixedinteger NLP (MINLP). By exploiting the localities of constraints, we first partition each problem by parallel decomposition into subproblems {{that are related}} by complicating constraints and complicating variables. We develop heuristics for finding <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>points</b> that are critical for resolving the complicating constraints and variables.

Principal photography rolled for 106 days between June and November 2010, with locations in Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and California. Filming employed 3D cameras similar to those used in the production of the 2009 film Avatar, and ten companies were involved with the film's visual effects. Following inflated production costs it is currently noted as the most expensive film ever made with a net budget of $379 million.|$|E

500|$|Flanders {{argues that}} nonhuman animals could be [...] "below" [...] politics, {{in that they}} do not have {{politically}} considerable interests, or [...] "above" [...] politics, in that they have rights which trump political decision-making processes. Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as John Rawls held, they can be defended on metaphysical grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of comprehensive doctrines, as opposed to the public reasons which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or the animals themselves have rights. Alternatively, the wrongness of animal cruelty may be a [...] "fixed point" [...] in our political reasoning. Flanders concludes that Rawlsianism provides a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> for the inclusion of animals in political decision-making.|$|E

Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was positive overall, despite noting a lack of strategy in a lot of battles and similarity to previous Tales games. Hardcore Gamers Steve Hannley called the game a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> for the series on then-current consoles. RPGFan's Ashton Liu said that, while it stood as perhaps the best entry in the series, he also noted that it had not evolved very much mechanically when compared to other RPG series.

40|$|Abstract: Clustering is a {{data mining}} (machine learning), {{unsupervised}} learning technique used to place data elements into related groups without advance {{knowledge of the}} group definitions. One {{of the most popular}} and widely studied clustering methods that minimize the clustering error for points in Euclidean space is called K-means clustering.

In this research paper, we have introduced and tested an improved algorithm to start the k-means with <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>points</b> (means).

Sam Davies of The Wire wrote, [...] "There are hits and misses: platitudes and cliches, interspersed with bursts of surreal genius.

[...] A positive review in Vice called Lil B [...] "the most revolutionary MC of the last 15 years," [...] but said Rain in England is not a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> for people new to his music because the album is [...] "a bit too raw for most life forms to process". Rating the album a 6 out of 10, Charles Aaron of Spin said {{the album was}} Lil B's [...] "least accessible" [...] release to date and sounded like [...] "a therapy-session testimony that sounds like Soulja Boy having a Damascus moment in the champagne room over a beatless synth tide." ...|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios, the {{developer}} of Silent Hill: Origins, developed Shattered Memories with a development team {{made up of}} more than 55 members and a supporting network of more than 90 artists. With the completion of Origins—for which they had attempted to closely replicate the atmosphere and gameplay elements of the first Silent Hill game (1999)—Climax Studios {{wanted to create a}} different horror game. Because of the tenth anniversary of the first Silent Hill installment, Konami thought the time was ideal [...] "to revisit" [...] the game. Climax Studios saw the then-newly introduced Wii platform as a way to reach a wider range of gamers, especially as outside Japan, no Silent Hill title had been exclusively released on a Nintendo platform. Development costs for the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 and their gamers' [...] "mindset" [...] factored into the decision for the gaming platform. Additionally, {{the developer}}s wanted to use the Wii Remote to incorporate the gameplay elements of the flashlight and radio static. Climax felt that the first game would be a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point,</b> instead of continuing any existing storylines or adding onto the mythology of the town.

[...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E

Javy Gwaltney of Game Informer called the story of Birthright [...] "a surprisingly dark tale", praised the improvements made to the gameplay over Awakening, and was overall positive despite some criticism of its poor tutorial systems. He also liked the game's music and graphics, although he critiqued the latter a little due to low-res battle models. Meghan Sullivan of IGN called the story, music and visuals [...] "great", and greatly enjoyed the gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow online interface. Alexa Ray Corriea of GameSpot greatly enjoyed the changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps, and enjoyed the character interactions while noting that the dialogue became overly melodramatic in places. Kimberley Keller of Nintendo World Report, reviewing all versions of the game, generally praised the game as a whole while calling Birthright the [...] "perfect way to start [...] " [...] due to its traditional Fire Emblem elements. Griffin McElroy and Allegra Frank of Polygon, reviewing all versions of the game, were generally positive about the gameplay and the interplay between versions, while criticizing the overly complicated character class system. They referred to Birthright as a [...] "straightforward march for vengeance, where victory almost always entails defeating an entire platoon or its leader".
