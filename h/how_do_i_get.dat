500|$|Collins first {{performed}} with Sting at Wembley, {{and together they}} performed [...] "In the Air Tonight", [...] "Against All Odds", [...] "Long Long Way to Go" [...] and [...] "Every Breath You Take", accompanied by saxophonist Branford Marsalis. After Collins finished performing, he flew on Concorde to the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. On the plane, he met Cher, and convinced {{her to be a}} part of the event. Once there he met Robert Plant, who had asked him if he would perform with him, Jimmy Page and Tony Thompson in a Led Zeppelin [...] "reunion" [...] of sorts. He first played drums on [...] "Layla", [...] "White Room" [...] and [...] "She's Waiting" [...] for friend Eric Clapton. Then, Collins performed [...] "Against All Odds" [...] and [...] "In the Air Tonight", and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin's aforementioned act. The band has claimed that the performance was unspectacular, and critics place the blame on Collins. However, Collins says that [...] "I would pledge to my dying day that it wasn't me," [...] and that Thompson was racing through some of the performance. Collins later remarked, [...] "... I remember in the middle of the thing, I actually thought, <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out of here?" [...] Stephen Williams of Newsday commented that Collins' performance of [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] in Philadelphia [...] "was one of the more moving moments of the day". Live Aid raised $69 million in its effort. Collins later recalled the event as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make you look so distorted that you don’t recognize yourself and you ask yourself, ‘How did I get here? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out of here?’ But, you think that {{you want to do it}} again. That is the same as love and life. It's a metaphor for being in love and for life." [...] This also shows in the title track [...] "Funhouse" [...] where she tells that it used to be fun. [...] "It's about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one." ...|$|E

6000|$|Early in {{the morning}} Grettel {{had to go out}} and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. [...] "First we'll bake," [...] said the old dame; [...] "I've heated the oven already and kneaded the dough." [...] She pushed Grettel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing. [...] "Creep in," [...] said the witch, [...] "and see if it's {{properly}} heated, so that we can shove in the bread." [...] For when she had got Grettel in she meant to close the oven and let the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Grettel perceived her intention, and said: [...] "I don't know how I'm to do it; <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> in?" [...] "You silly goose!" [...] said the hag, [...] "the opening is big enough; see, I could get in myself," [...] and she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Grettel gave her a shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious! how she yelled, it was quite horrible; but Grettel fled, and the wretched old woman was left to perish miserably.|$|E
