5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has an associated group of <b>globular</b> clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of <b>globular</b> clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated <b>globular</b> clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's <b>globular</b> clusters might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5|$|<b>Globular</b> {{clusters}} {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain considerably more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters, which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. <b>Globular</b> clusters are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known <b>globular</b> clusters in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These <b>globular</b> clusters orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters) such as M87, have as many as 13,000 <b>globular</b> clusters.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to <b>globular</b> clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in <b>globular</b> clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with <b>globular</b> clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the <b>globular</b> clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a <b>globular</b> cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
5|$|M53 (NGC 5024) is a <b>globular</b> cluster {{which was}} {{discovered}} independently by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 and Charles Messier in February 1777; William Herschel {{was the first}} to resolve it into stars. The magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a <b>globular</b> cluster with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any <b>globular</b> cluster. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer <b>globular</b> cluster, with a much-smaller apparent size.|$|E
5|$|No known <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} display {{active star}} formation, {{which is consistent}} with the view that <b>globular</b> clusters are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of star formation known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of <b>globular</b> clusters.|$|E
5|$|Observations of <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} {{show that}} these stellar formations arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation, {{and where the}} interstellar medium is at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. <b>Globular</b> cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies. Research indicates a correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black holes (SMBH) {{and the extent of}} the <b>globular</b> cluster systems of elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's <b>globular</b> clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 <b>globular</b> clusters {{have now been}} discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20. These additional, undiscovered <b>globular</b> clusters {{are believed to be}} hidden behind the gas and dust of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|There are {{approximately}} 460 <b>globular</b> clusters {{associated with the}} Andromeda Galaxy. The most massive of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed <b>Globular</b> One, has a greater luminosity than any other known <b>globular</b> cluster in the Local Group of galaxies. It contains several million stars, and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known <b>globular</b> cluster in the Milky Way. <b>Globular</b> One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary <b>globular.</b> As a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the distant past. The <b>globular</b> with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which {{is located in the}} south-west arm's eastern half.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-compact dwarfs {{resemble}} <b>globular</b> clusters {{but have}} a diameter of 10 parsecs (33 light-years) or more, {{much larger than the}} 3-parsec (10 light-year) maximum of <b>globular</b> clusters. Their nature is unclear as to whether they are dwarf galaxies captured by M87 or a new class of massive <b>globular</b> cluster. Almost a hundred have been identified from the thousands of <b>globular</b> clusters in M87.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these <b>globular</b> clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most <b>globular</b> clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|Almost all <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} have a half-light {{radius of}} less than 10 pc, although there are well-established <b>globular</b> clusters with very large radii (i.e. NGC 2419 (Rh = 18 pc) and Palomar 14 (Rh = 25 pc)).|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} that <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} contain {{some of the first}} stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that <b>globular</b> clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{are searching}} for exoplanets of stars in <b>globular</b> star clusters.|$|E
5|$|Cacti whose stems {{are even}} smaller may be {{described}} as <b>globular</b> (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. <b>Globular</b> cacti may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis <b>globular</b> {{cluster is}} a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old <b>globular</b> cluster {{situated}} around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain <b>globular</b> clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of <b>globular</b> clusters are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain <b>globular</b> clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for <b>globular</b> clusters. While there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, <b>globular</b> clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
5|$|NGC 362 {{is another}} <b>globular</b> cluster in Tucana with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster {{and among the}} brightest <b>globular</b> clusters in the sky. Unusually for a <b>globular</b> cluster, its orbit takes it {{very close to the}} center of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by James Dunlop. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope {{has been}} used to provide convincing {{observational}} evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in <b>globular</b> clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The <b>globular</b> star cluster 47 Tucanae, which is made up of about 1 million stars, is one of the densest <b>globular</b> clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars. Precise velocities were obtained for nearly 15,000 stars in this cluster.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way covers {{much of the}} constellation's area. Of the {{deep-sky objects}} in Apus, there are two {{prominent}} <b>globular</b> clusters—NGC 6101 and IC 4499—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a <b>globular</b> cluster of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 billion years old, it contains {{a high concentration of}} massive bright stars known as blue stragglers, thought {{to be the result of}} two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose <b>globular</b> cluster in the medium-far galactic halo; its apparent magnitude is 10.6.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} <b>globular</b> cluster, now called M22, was {{discovered}} in 1665 by Abraham Ihle, a German amateur astronomer. However, given the small aperture of early telescopes, individual stars within a <b>globular</b> cluster were not resolved until Charles Messier observed M4 in 1764. The first eight <b>globular</b> clusters discovered are shown in the table. Subsequently, Abbé Lacaille would list NGC 104, NGC 4833, M55, M69, and NGC 6397 in his 1751–52 catalogue. The M before a number refers to Charles Messier's catalogue, while NGC is from the New General Catalogue by John Dreyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of <b>globular</b> clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a <b>globular</b> cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many <b>globular</b> clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the <b>globular</b> clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many <b>globular</b> clusters.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} with a retrograde orbit round the Milky Way Galaxy. A hypervelocity <b>globular</b> cluster was discovered around Messier 87 in 2014, having a velocity {{in excess of}} the escape velocity of M87.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} <b>globular</b> cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve. This differs from the HR diagram of stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a <b>globular</b> cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a <b>globular</b> cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a <b>globular</b> cluster are at {{approximately}} the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the <b>globular</b> cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of <b>globular</b> clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in <b>globular</b> clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|<b>Globular</b> {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in <b>globular</b> clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the results}} of a search for giant planets in the <b>globular</b> cluster 47 Tucanae were announced. The lack of any {{successful}} discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in <b>globular</b> clusters means that the member stars have a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including <b>globular</b> cluster members, are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in <b>globular</b> clusters. What distinguishes them from the <b>globular</b> clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E
5|$|Of the <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} {{within the}} Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of <b>globular</b> clusters around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as <b>globular</b> clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: <b>globular</b> proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all <b>globular</b> proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules {{to pass through the}} cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} (like M15) have extremely massive cores {{which may}} harbor black holes, although simulations {{suggest that a}} less massive black hole or central concentration of neutron stars or massive white dwarfs explain observations equally well.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some <b>globular</b> proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are <b>globular</b> and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Globular</b> Amphora {{culture was}} the next major Neolithic culture. It {{originated}} in the Polish lowlands {{during the first half}} of 4th millennium BC, lasted to about 2400 BCE in parallel with the Funnelbeaker culture, and is named after the bulging shape of its representative pottery. They specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi-settled state, seeking optimal pastures and moving as needed. This semi-nomadic lifestyle was probably necessitated by the poor condition of the soils, by that time depleted and rendered infertile because of the preceding centuries of forest burning and extensive exploitation. <b>Globular</b> Amphora were the first culture in Poland known for utilizing the domesticated horse, and swine became important as the source of food. Ritual animal, especially cattle burial sites, often with two or more individuals buried together and supplied with objects as strange as drums have been discovered, but their role is not well understood. <b>Globular</b> Amphora people were involved in the north-south amber trade. Their megalithic burials included ceramics, stone tools and ornamental gifts.|$|E
5|$|The ages of <b>globular</b> {{clusters}} place a bound on the {{age limit}} of the entire universe. This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of <b>globular</b> clusters that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a <b>globular</b> cluster in 1986—a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 <b>globular</b> cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general theory of relativity is accurate to 99.5%.|$|E
