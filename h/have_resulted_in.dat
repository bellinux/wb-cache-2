Evidence suggests that CPAs <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.|$|E

The legend may <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> part from a desire to assert Sappho as heterosexual.|$|E
