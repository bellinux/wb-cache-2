5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam, {{in which the}} object <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> your {{opponent}} on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line. The match {{went back and forth}} before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton, but Orton moved out of the way. Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line. Van Dam, however, managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher. Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win. After the match, Orton attacked Van Dam, executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor. Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher.|$|E
5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognjište {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of European Cornel and several stalks of straw.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E

Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a simulacrum, or artificial vagina.|$|E

These are generally called ok. A typical example of an ok <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> a restriction {{on the type of}} colours used in the family members's clothing, or to forbid the use of some particular type of clothing.|$|E
25|$|Even when visiting Jewish {{graves of}} someone that the visitor never knew, the custom <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> a small stone on the grave using the left hand. This shows that someone visited the gravesite, {{and is also}} a way of {{participating}} in the mitzvah of burial. Leaving flowers is not a traditional Jewish practice. Another reason for leaving stones is to tend the grave. In Biblical times, gravestones were not used; graves were marked with mounds of stones (a kind of cairn), so by placing (or replacing) them, one perpetuated {{the existence of the}} site.|$|E

There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} planting coffee <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> 20 seeds in each hole {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{chemicals}} as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century, but this has mostly been of interest to scientists {{rather than as an}} economically reasonable solution. Attractants studied have been those tsetse might use to find food, like carbon dioxide, octenol, and acetonewhich are given off in animals' breath and distributed downwind in an odor plume. Synthetic versions of these chemicals can create artificial odor plumes. A cheaper approach <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> cattle urine in a half gourd near the trap. For large trapping efforts, additional traps are generally cheaper than expensive artificial attractants.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese {{table setting}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>place</b> {{a bowl of}} rice on your left and to place a bowl of miso soup on your right side at the table.

Based on the standard three okazu formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three okazu; one to far back left, one at far back right, {{and one in the}} center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three okazu. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of the tray near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or hashioki.|$|E
