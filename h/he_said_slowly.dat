6000|$|... "He's small," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "His eyes protrude--so do his teeth--He--he--yes, I {{remember}} now--he has {{a curious}} red mark--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Tredgold {{gazed at}} her in feeble indignation, but the uselessness of denial made truth easier. [...] "Yes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'A black spider monkey,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>slowly.</b> 'Allow me to ask, madam, {{if you are}} {{acquainted with}} the {{character}} of the beast?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>slowly,</b> [...] "it {{would be}} useless {{to expect that}} {{anything}} I could do would ever induce you to once more have any confidence in me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sitka Charley delayed reply {{until he}} had lighted his pipe. He glanced at the Police Gazette {{illustration}} and nodded his head at it familiarly. Then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> speaking <b>slowly</b> and ponderingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Supposing,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>slowly,</b> {{and almost}} as if {{speaking}} to himself, 'supposing Sabathier--and you know he's merely like a friend now one mustn't be seen talking to--supposing he came back; what then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'These,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> 'are indeed my Hills. Thus {{should a}} man abide, perched above the world, {{separated}} from delights, considering vast matters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O' course, there's a difficulty," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>slowly,</b> as Mr. Green {{finished}} a vivid {{picture of the}} joys of carpentering in Australia.|$|E
6000|$|His face {{lost its}} eager, boyish expression. [...] "I'm delighted to think I have amused you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "It makes amends." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{bent his}} head. [...] "I am doing this thing because I feel I have to," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>slowly.</b> [...] "I {{could come and}} see you at Vancouver when I come back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not willing}} to play {{the part of a}} savage," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>slowly</b> in order to give his words due weight. [...] "Neither do I propose that they shall carry the message. We'll take them with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barrington {{thanked him}} with a gesture, {{and glanced at the}} rest. [...] "One would have {{preferred}} to carry out this inquiry more privately," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>slowly,</b> but with hoarse distinctness. [...] "Still, you have already heard so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Smith, still gazing musingly before him, {{appeared}} not to {{hear the}} question. [...] "Nice after the rain, ain't it?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The German volunteer's {{face lit}} up for a second, then fell suspiciously. [...] "Say, Dan, vos dis a choke maype?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Invisible Man {{appeared}} to be regarding Kemp. [...] "Because I've a particular objection to being caught by my fellow-men," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Again {{the care}} crept into Barrington's face, {{and he sat}} silent for almost a minute. Then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>slowly,</b> [...] "I feel that I should resent the question, but I will answer. It is what I hope to do." ...|$|R
60|$|The Assistant Commissioner {{shook his}} {{supported}} head. “The history of your relations with that useful personage {{is the only}} thing that matters just now,” <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> closing <b>slowly</b> his weary, deep-set eyes, and then opening them swiftly with a greatly refreshed glance.|$|R
6000|$|Alton's {{face grew}} almost purple, but the dark hue faded {{and left it}} unusually pale again. [...] "That," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>slowly,</b> [...] "is a damnable lie. The lady alluded to was here once only, and for at the most three minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked in}} my face steadily, and then, instead of {{replying}} to my remark, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> [...] "Your name is Spottiswood, I believe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ostrog stood {{watching}} him {{from under his}} drooping brows. [...] "I am not bringing negroes to London," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "But if--" ...|$|E
6000|$|A little {{gleam of}} {{comprehension}} came into Maccario’s dark eyes. “Still,” <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> “the Sin Verguenza will be remembered, and you with them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton sighed. [...] "Well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>slowly,</b> [...] "perhaps it {{is better}} over, because that and other things {{would have to be}} told; but though I had only an axe against his pistol I can't get that man's face out of my memory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That was awf'ly good of you, I'm sure,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>slowly,</b> {{feeling for}} his words. 'I don't intend {{to go out}} by my own hand at present. I say, Spurstow, that stuff won't work. What shall I do? What shall I do?' And panic terror stood in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} to ask me about what I saw in Pall Mall and {{opposite}} the Hyde Park Hotel?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> speaking <b>slowly</b> and in a voice scarcely raised above a whisper. [...] "I told them all before the operation, but they couldn't send for you then. There wasn't time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> [...] "the terms {{put forward}} by the Socialist Party of Germany to ensure the {{granting}} of an armistice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> [...] "if, {{after all}} this, {{you fail to}} recover my Cheops for me I'll--I'll--By George, I'll skin you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never bet in {{the teeth}} of a pat hand," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> looking at the saloon-keeper. [...] "You-all start her rolling, Mac." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Barrett {{tried to}} think clearly, but the {{circumstances}} were hardly favourable. [...] "Suppose," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> speaking very <b>slowly,</b> [...] "suppose I wanted to get married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{speaking}} <b>slowly</b> in a tense voice, [...] "ever since I {{first saw}} you I longed {{that this should}} come about. It was what I worked for, and nothing {{would have been too}} hard that brought me nearer you, but it's almost a cruelty that I should have succeeded--now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "go <b>slowly</b> on now {{as far as}} the village? It is not yet ten o'clock. Emery cannot {{possibly}} be here before noon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Possession for the moment," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> [...] "is with you. Have you reflected, Mr. Greatson, {{that it may}} {{not always}} be so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I believe Simon Kenton {{read from}} my face the {{thoughts}} which were in my mind, for <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>slowly,</b> as if weighing well each word: ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain’s face darkened. [...] "Peter’s all right," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "He’s {{not treated}} me—quite well," [...] he added, {{after a little}} hesitation.|$|E
6000|$|The frown {{which had}} clouded McLeod's brow {{instantly}} deepened. [...] "Go," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "walk <b>slowly</b> {{back towards the}} hut. I will overtake {{you in a few}} minutes." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{all this}} <b>slowly,</b> {{detaching}} statement from statement {{with a little}} awkward silence, and he kept his kind, foolish eyes fixed on mine. They were full of tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it past four?" [...] she asked, and {{abruptly}} {{they were}} {{face to face}} with parting. That Lewisham had to take [...] "duty" [...] at half-past five seemed a thing utterly trivial. [...] "Surely," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> only <b>slowly</b> realising what this parting meant. [...] "But must you? I--I want to talk to you." ...|$|R
