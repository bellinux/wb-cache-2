40|$|Abstract. The {{two ways}} of {{reducing}} the dispersion of the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>fields</b> in magnetic powders of cobalt alloys have been tested: the isolation of magnetic particles in nonmagnetic matrix and compaction of the powders. The ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the hysteresis loops of the pretreated magnetic powders were investigated. The FMR linewidth is significantly narrowed both with increasing of the nonmagnetic fraction in the samples prepared by the first way and with increasing of relative density of the compacts. The limit case of FMR linewidth in continuous magnetic film there is no dispersion of the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>fields</b> is in good agreement with discussed data. The hysteresis loops of powder with the particles coated by the non-magnetic phase became narrow and easy saturated with increasing of nonmagnetic phase fraction...|$|R

50|$|The <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field,</b> {{also called}} the stray field (outside the magnet), is the {{magnetic}} field (H-field) generated by the magnetization in a magnet. The total magnetic field in a region containing magnets {{is the sum of}} the demagnetizing fields of the magnets and the magnetic field due to any free currents or displacement currents. The term <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> reflects its tendency to act on the magnetization so as to reduce the total magnetic moment. It gives rise to shape anisotropy in ferromagnets with a single magnetic domain and to magnetic domains in larger ferromagnets.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} amplification, {{known as}} apparent permeability '''', {{is the result}} of the magnetization of the ferromagnetic core response to an external magnetic field. The magnetization is reduced by the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{size of a}} {{ferromagnet}} increases, the single-domain state incurs {{an increasing}} energy cost because of the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field.</b> This field tends to rotate the magnetization {{in a way that}} reduces the total moment of the magnet, and in larger magnets the magnetization is organized in magnetic domains. The demagnetizing energy is balanced by the energy of the exchange interaction, which tends to keep spins aligned. There is a critical size at which the balance tips in favor of the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> and the multidomain state is favored. Most calculations of the upper size limit for the single-domain state identify it with this critical size.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of magnetic probe recording into a continuous perpendicular medium is discussed. By applying a current {{from the tip}} to the medium, a very localized area can be heated and bits as small as 80 nm in diameter could be written. This value {{is close to the}} calculated minimum diameter of reversed cylindrical domains in our perpendicular medium. A current can be injected directly from the tip to the medium by means of a current source, or one can use capacitive currents. We prefer the first method, since the current, and therefore the heating process, can be controlled more precisely. The energy required to write a bit is in the order of 1 nJ. Calculations show that most of the heat is dissipated at the tip end. <b>Demagnetizing</b> <b>fields</b> of the surrounding material play an important role and are so strong that bits can be written without applying an external field. By decreasing the film thickness, the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>fields</b> are reduced, and selective overwriting of previously written bits could be demonstrated...|$|R

5000|$|In a ferromagnet, the {{magnetization}} [...] {{can vary}} internally but at each point its magnitude {{is equal to}} the saturation magnetization [...] The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation predicts the rotation of the magnetization in response to torques. An earlier, but equivalent, equation (the Landau-Lifshitz equation) was introduced by :where [...] is the electron gyromagnetic ratio. and [...] is a phenomenological damping parameter, often replaced bywhere [...] is a dimensionless constant called the damping factor. The effective field [...] is a combination of the external magnetic field, the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> (magnetic field due to the magnetization), and some quantum mechanical effects.

50|$|The {{energy of}} the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> favors {{magnetic}} configurations that minimize magnetic charges. In particular, {{on the edges of}} the sample, the magnetization tends to run parallel to the surface. In most cases {{it is not possible to}} minimize this energy term at the same time as the others. The static equilibrium then is a compromise that minimizes the total magnetic energy, although it may not minimize individually any particular term.|$|E

NMR shows that the wires consist of a mixture of fcc and hcp texture with the (0001) texture of the hcp fraction oriented preferentially perpendicular to the wires.

5000|$|The <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> of an {{arbitrarily}} shaped {{object is}} very difficult to calculate even for the simple case of uniform magnetization. For the special case of ellipsoids (which includes spheres) the demagnetization field is linearly related to the magnetization by a geometry dependent constant called the demagnetizing factor. Since the magnetization of a sample at a given location depends on the total magnetic field at that point, the demagnetization factor must be used in order to accurately determine how a magnetic material responds to a magnetic field. (See magnetic hysteresis.) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{tried to}} control the {{distribution}} of the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> inside magnetoimpedance elements fabricated using thin-film to gain higher sensitivity. Elements with quasi-ellipsoidal shape were adopted to modify the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> distribution, because {{it is well known that}} the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> is expected to be uniform in an ellipsoid. The larger impedance change and higher sensitivity were obtained in the ellipsoidal elements compared to those of the conventional rectangular elements. The observed results were analyzed by the calculations on the basis of {{the distribution of the}} <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field</b> and the impedance profile without demagnetizing effect. The calculations well explained the experimental results: the improvement of sensitivity and the performance for the ellipsoidal elements is attributed to the uniform distribution of <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>field.</b> The experimental results demonstrate a potential and the calculation results contribute to optimum design, for a miniaturization of magnetoimpedance element in order to keep the higher sensitivity...|$|E
