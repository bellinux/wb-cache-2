One of them {{challenges}} Wong to a fight and loses, but his friends take Wong hostage in revenge and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Ip and Wong fight their way outside to meet Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist and former bandit, who comes to their rescue with his own gang. The students' master {{and head of the}} coalition of Hong Kong martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-nam, arrives to break up the fight.

5000|$|The first PC game {{based on}} the film was the Casper Brainy Book which was {{developed}} by Knowledge Adventure and was released in May 1996.

Being aimed at younger children some of the darker elements of the story are cut with Carrigan, Dibs and Amelia absent, Dr. Harvey's career {{is to look for}} ghosts and the Lazurus being named simply as the [...] "Machine" [...] and was described as turning a ghost into a person.|$|R
500|$|During {{an episode}} of The Krusty the Clown Show, three Itchy & Scratchy {{cartoons}} are shown. This angers Krusty, {{the host of the}} show, since he thinks he should be the star of the show and not the Itchy and Scratchy characters. Meanwhile, the Simpsons visit a television museum that is soon to be closed. After a while, they come to an exhibit displaying The Adventures of <b>Fatso</b> Flanagan, which is one of Homer's favorite television shows. There, the family is approached by Annie Dubinsky, the agent of the actor who played <b>Fatso</b> Flanagan. They start chatting and become acquainted. At the Channel 6 studios, during a board meeting, Krusty is fired because [...] "Today's children are uncomfortable with a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia", and because Itchy and Scratchy are shown to be more popular with the children. Krusty goes to his current agent, hoping to get a new job, but the agent drops him since he got fired.|$|E
500|$|Donnie <b>Fatso</b> {{was written}} by Chris Cluess and {{directed}} by Ralph Sosa. In July 2010, {{it was announced that}} Jon Hamm would make a guest appearance in the episode as an agent for the FBI. In his interview with Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Al Jean was pleased with Hamm's performance, opining: [...] "You gave him one note and he immediately did twelve great things with it. He was really funny. And handsome. He had it all. Hamm stated that appearing on the show was [...] "an incredible experience". In his interview with Access Hollywood, he continued, [...] "I got to work on The Simpsons, which I watched for 20 years and the show is still fresh and still funny and the characters still resonate. It’s one of the best shows on television. It was an honor to be asked {{to be a part of}} it." [...] Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, and voiced Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Carlos Merigo wrote on Brazilian website B9 that the mascots bring back [...] "the colorful, loving and fun {{atmosphere}} {{that marked the}} Olympic mascots over the decades", calling them a [...] "return to origins" [...] following the [...] "shapelessness" [...] of Wenlock and Mandeville, the mascots of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Neha Prakash, writing on digital media website Mashable, wrote that, compared to the [...] "terror" [...] of the mascots of the 2014 Winter Olympics, Vinicius and Tom [...] "are more nostalgia-inducing than nightmarish". Multiple observers compared the art style of the mascots {{to that of the}} Pokémon franchise, while Stephen Wood, in an article on the history of Olympic mascots published by Paste, likened them to the style of Adventure Time, an American animated television series. In an entry about 2000 Summer Olympics' unofficial mascot <b>Fatso</b> the Wombat on Slate's culture blog Brow Beat, Matthew Dessem wrote that there were no glaring issues with the mascots when compared to previous Olympic mascots: [...] "Like the best Olympic mascots of yore, Vinicius and Tom are well-suited to plush toys and licensing deals and will be completely forgotten within a year." [...] Leila Cobo, in an article published by Billboard, praised the organizers of Rio 2016 for [...] "celebrating music in a most joyful and profound way" [...] by naming the Olympic mascot after Vinicius de Moraes.|$|E

After he dies, Warden assures the guilt-ridden sentry that Prewitt's death was going to happen one way or another. When asked by the other soldiers if Prewitt was a good soldier in his company, Warden replies, [...] "Hell, he was the only soldier." ...|$|R

With blistered lips, reddened face, {{he looked up at}} me from a stretcher. “I’m Dragon Man at the circus, ” he said, “can light my breath with a match, exhale a flame. No alcohol trick this!” “Just minor burns of the lips. Lucky your mouth was spared. So how’d you learn to be a firedrake?” He laughed a deep chuckle. “In junior high, we’d lay fire farts in the men’s room. All us <b>fatsos</b> could, but not the skinny kids. Then, one day, lighting up a smoke, a flash!” Perplexed, I signed him out with prohibitions, precautions. He’d told me the diagnosis, yet, unknowing, I was deaf at the time. Now, I wonder — a fat man from a rural town, water drawn from local wells, methane on his breath: a saboteur in his gut...|$|R

500|$|Several {{references}} to popular culture, including a meta-reference to The Simpsons, {{are included in}} [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution". The three The Itchy & Scratchy cartoons that are shown {{at the beginning of}} the episode as Krusty is hosting his show are all parodies of films released in 2010: the first one, titled The Cat's Speech, is a parody of The King's Speech; the second one, titled The Social Petwork, parodies The Social Network in that the storyline is partially explained through the use of screens containing nothing but text; and the final one, titled Black and Blue Swan, references Black Swan. [...] After the three cartoons are shown, Krusty points out that [...] "It’s like those parodies were written when the movies came out, but it took so long to animate them that we look dated and hacky!" [...] This is a reference to the long time it takes to produce an episode of The Simpsons—hence why cultural references on the show can often be seen as dated. Pop culture allusions at the television museum include a brief appearance by the main characters of the animated series King of the Hill as cardboard cutouts being taken down in a process similar to the opening of the show, an exhibit devoted to the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, and the showing of one of Homer's favorite television shows, <b>Fatso</b> Flanagan, which is a knockoff of the sitcom The Honeymooners.|$|E
500|$|Barker's {{theatrical}} success {{enabled him}} to move into radio work. Barker, who had previously been known by his birth name [...] "Ronald", was now {{referred to as the}} less formal form [...] "Ronnie", after a director changed it in the credits, although he did not tell Barker. His first radio appearance was in 1956, playing Lord Russett in Floggit's. He went on to play multiple characters, but primarily the lookout Able Seaman 'Fatso' Johnson and Lieutenant-Commander Stanton, in The Navy Lark, a navy based sitcom on the BBC Light Programme, which ran from 1959 to 1977, with Barker featuring in some 300 episodes. He also featured in the show's radio spin-off The TV Lark as <b>Fatso</b> Johnson, a camera operator, and as a trainee chef in Crowther's Crowd in 1963, and had roles on Variety Playhouse. Barker soon began working in film and television. His first acting job on television was in Melvyn's show I'm Not Bothered. He appeared in various roles in the comedy series The Seven Faces of Jim from 1962, alongside Jimmy Edwards and June Whitfield, as well as parts in Bold as Brass and Foreign Affairs (as Russian embassy worker Grischa Petrovitch). This was followed with dramatic parts in A Tale of Two Cities as Jerry Cruncher in 1965 as well as single episode roles in The Saint and The Avengers, in which he played Cheshire, a cat lover. In 1964 he appeared in Galton & Simpson's gentle comedy, The Bargee, as Ronnie, the illiterate cousin of Harry H Corbett's rascally Hemmel Pike. Other film work at that time included: Doctor in Distress (1963), Father Came Too! (1963) and A Home of Your Own (1965).|$|E

He also had a cameo in Johnny Dangerously as the Pope and in Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie as a wayward Hollywood talent agent who comes across Kermit the Frog singing [...] "The Rainbow Connection" [...] in the film's opening scene. He also appeared with fellow Brooks regulars Gene Wilder (who directed the film as well), Marty Feldman, and Madeline Kahn in The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, as well as alongside Wilder and Gilda Radner in a later Gene Wilder-directed film, Haunted Honeymoon. He also appeared in Stargate SG-1 as Urgo.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} First Test in Brisbane the tour selectors {{sent back to}} London for the 41-year-old Cowdrey as a replacement batsmen. Cowdrey was highly regarded by the MCC team and in particular by Mike Denness, who had succeeded him as captain of Kent. In his 20-year Test career he had faced the Australian fast bowlers Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Alan Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke and even the young Dennis Lillee. Although the Australian press was aghast at such a recall – Cowdrey had not played a Test in four years – the tourists were keen to have a man with the technique and strength of purpose to play the fastest of bowlers. He arrived in Perth with the wives of the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a practice match, and was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia matching {{the record of the}} Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs. Cowdrey walked to the crease to an ovation from the 16,000 crowd at the WACA, but not from Jeff Thomson. His greeting of [...] "How good to meet you" [...] was rebuffed with [...] "That's not going to help you <b>fatso,</b> piss off." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{his wife}} goes into labor, Ip {{finishes}} training and begins his fight with Twister. Ip exchanges blows with the boxer and seems {{overwhelmed by the}} westerner's sheer muscle at first, but begins to make a comeback using his more diverse techniques and great speed. He receives an illegal punch from Twister after the second round's bell, and is also told that kicks {{would not be allowed}} due to the judges changing the rules during the match. When it looks like the end, Ip remembers Hung's patriotic spirit and is spurred to go on. He changes his strategy and attacks the boxer's arms to disable him. The fight is brought to a climactic finish as Ip Man rains blow after blow into the knocked-down Twister's face, with flashbacks reflecting the latter's killing of Master Hung. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace was finally arrested by his superiors for corruption, as <b>Fatso</b> [...] has secretly reported him before the match. Ip then gives a speech to the audience, stating that despite the differences between their race and culture, he wishes for everyone to respect each other regardless of their status. Both the Western and Chinese audience give him a standing ovation while Twister's manager walks away, unhappy at the defeat. Ip goes home and reunites with his family, including his newborn second son, Ip Ching.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]338 Lapua Magnum case is {{also used}} as the parent case {{for a host of}} {{modified}} variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as wildcats. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the [...]338 Lapua offers a large and exceptionally sturdy, pressure resistant cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times it has become quite popular amongst wildcatters. With the [...]338 Lapua Magnum as the parent case wildcatters have created 7mm (7mm Allen Magnum, 7mm Katzmeier, 7mm <b>Fatso),</b> [...]30 (.30-338 Lapua (Triebel), [...]30 Wolf, 300 Allen Express), 8mm (8mm-338 Lapua (Triebel), LM-101), [...]338 (.338 Yogi, LM-105), [...]343 (.343 Lapua Magnum LM-107), 9.3mm (9,3-338 Lapua Magnum (Triebel)), [...]375 (9.5×70 ELR) and [...]50 calibre (.510 Whisper) variants. The current (2008) benchrest [...] 5-shot group world record holder Tom Sarver used a [...]300 Hulk wildcat cartridge, which is basically a necked-down, blown out, shortened [...]338 Lapua Magnum variant, to achieve a [...] diameter 5-shot group on 7 July 2007.|$|E
5000|$|They also popularised <b>Fatso</b> the Fat-Arsed Wombat {{as their}} mascot, dismissing the {{official}} mascots as [...] "Olly, Millie, and Dickhead". This was emphasised in a satirical diving contest between <b>Fatso,</b> the three official mascots, and the Boxing Kangaroo {{later in the}} Games. Fatso's huge popularity during the series caused consternation with the Australian Olympic Committee, who at first tried to ban the character from Olympic events after Australian athletes appeared carrying <b>Fatso</b> dolls at medal ceremonies. When auctioned for charity {{at the end of}} the series, <b>Fatso</b> was purchased by Seven Network CEO Kerry Stokes for A$80,450.
