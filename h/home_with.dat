40|$|ObjectivesMuch {{scientific}} evidence indicates a positive association between moldy environments and respiratory illnesses and/or symptoms (e. g., asthma). Recently, submicron fungal fragments (< 1. 0 25 m) {{have been suggested}} as a potential contributor to adverse health effects due to their biological composition (e. g., antigens, mycotoxins, and (1, 3) - 2 -d-glucan) {{as well as their}} small size. However, the contribution of exposure to fine fungal particles on adverse health outcomes has been poorly characterized, particularly in <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> asthmatic children. We characterized the airborne level of smaller-sized fungal particles between <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> and without asthmatic children. MethodsWe visited 29 <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> (n = 15) and without (n = 14) an asthmatic child and sampled submicron fungal fragments in a living room and child's bedroom, along with outdoor sampling, using the NIOSH two-stage sampler. (1, 3) - 2 -d-glucan of fungal fragments analyzed by Limulus Amebocyte lysate assay (LAL) was used for quantifying their exposure. ResultsOverall, the geometric mean (GM) concentration of (1, 3) - 2 -d-glucan in submicron fungal fragments in indoor air was two-fold higher in <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> asthmatic children (50. 9 pg/m 3) compared to <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> non-asthmatic children (26. 7 pg/m 3) (P < 0. 001). The GM concentration of these particles in child's bedroom in <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> an asthmatic child (66. 1 pg/m 3) was about three times higher than that in <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> non-asthmatic children (23. 0 pg/m 3) (P < 0. 001). The relative humidity had a negative correlation with the concentration of (1, 3) - 2 -d-glucan in submicron fungal fragments (Pearson coefficient = 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0190. 257, P = 0. 046). ConclusionsOur findings indicate that <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> asthmatic children have a higher concentration of submicron fungal fragments compared to <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> non-asthmatic children. A greater exposure to smaller-sized fungal particles may occur in <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> an asthmatic child as relative humidity decreases. The very careful control of relative humidity in indoor air is necessary for reducing exposure to fine fungal particles and inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> allergic diseases.

METHODS: We analyzed {{data from the}} 1994 National Health Interview Survey and Year 2000 objectives supplement. A multistage sample design was used to represent the civilian noninstitutionalized US population. RESULTS: Respondents from 35 % of the <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> children younger than 18 years (representing more than 22 million children in more than 11 million homes) reported having at least 1 firearm. Among <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> children and firearms, 43 % had at least 1 unlocked firearm (i. e., not in a locked place and not locked with a trigger lock or other locking mechanism). Overall, 9 % kept firearms unlocked and loaded, and 4 % kept them unlocked, unloaded, and stored with ammunition; thus, a total of 13 % of the <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> children and firearms [...] 1. 4 million <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> 2. 6 million children [...] stored firearms in a manner most accessible to children.
