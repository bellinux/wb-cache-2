5|$|Circumstances changed {{suddenly}} when Henry died on 6 June 1217 {{after receiving}} a head wound from a tile which came loose while he was playing with other children at the palace of the Bishop of Palencia. His guardian, Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, tried to hide the fact, taking the king's body to the castle of Tariego, although it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the news would reach Berengaria.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{literary}} and theatrical {{activities of the}} Round Table members, it was perhaps <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> they would write and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff.|$|E
5|$|The {{site has}} a long history of human occupation, from prehistoric farming to its use as a {{prisoner}} of war camp in the Second World War. The reserve attracts large numbers of visitors, contributing significantly to the economy of Cley village. Despite centuries of embankment to reclaim land and protect the village, the marshes have been flooded many times, and the southward march of the coastal shingle bank and encroachment by the sea make it <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the reserve will eventually be lost. New wetlands are being created further inland to compensate for the loss of coastal habitats.|$|E
50|$|My Two Brooks is {{an album}} by the American rock band The <b>Inevitable</b> Backlash <b>that</b> was {{released}} in 2009.|$|R

5000|$|On 23 October 1917, the Bolsheviks' Central Committee voted 10-2 for a {{resolution}} saying that [...] "an armed uprising is <b>inevitable,</b> and <b>that</b> {{the time for}} it is fully ripe".|$|R
5|$|With few teams, but a long history, it is <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> intense rivalries have {{developed}} in Canadian football. Far {{and away the}} greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry {{has been with the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E
5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect. At this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from close range. The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range.|$|E
5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> one person would take charge of each song.|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of stories}} in teacher {{education}} could be powerful in dispelling these beliefs, as they illustrate how deeply experienced teachers feel about the <b>inevitable</b> difficulties <b>that</b> occur in the classroom ...|$|R

25|$|Soft Machine {{having been}} a much loved band since their {{inception}} in the late 1960s and having always been {{at the cutting edge}} of many music genres (including the early progressive and psychedelic rock scene and then the burgeoning jazz rock and fusion scene), it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> former Soft Machine members would reconvene over the years, to continue on their legacy.|$|E
25|$|Headquartered in Calgary, Amoco Canada’s liquids {{marketing}} {{group had}} a great deal of independence in the early years. However, many synergies were possible through cooperation between Chicago and Calgary. As importantly, Amoco and Dome Petroleum formed a number of strategic partnerships in the liquids business during the 1960s. So extensive were those partnerships that, when Dome went on the block in 1986, it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> Amoco would be an aggressive suitor.|$|E
25|$|Corse's men {{survived the}} {{sustained}} two-hour {{attack against the}} main fortification, the Star Fort {{on the western side}} of the railroad cut, but were pinned down and Tourtellotte sent reinforcements from the eastern fort. Under heavy pressure, it seemed <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the Federals would be forced to surrender, but by noon French received a report from his cavalry that a strong Union force was approaching from Acworth, so he withdrew at 2 p.m. More reinforcements from Rome reached Allatoona the next morning.|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Direck {{fell into}} the hands of Hugh, the eldest son, and anticipating the <b>inevitable,</b> said <b>that</b> he liked to walk in the rose garden. So they walked in the rose garden.|$|R

25|$|The {{denial of}} bail for Chung Yik-tin sparked {{controversy}} over the subjective application of the law. Legislator Ronny Tong accused the police of humiliating a suspect by their excessively hasty actions. The police's selectiveness in this case, as compared with previous cases of pornography distribution on the Internet, was also the focus of public attention. The local Chairman of the Internet Society and legislator Regina Ip {{said that it was}} <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> police would apply the law selectively, for it would be impractical to take action against every person who had committed an offence in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine {{government}} has recently opened up their public policy to promote women working abroad since the world's demand for domestic workers and healthcare workers has increased. This {{has led to}} the government reporting a recent increase in women emigrating from the Philippines. A healthcare problem arises as migrating women from the Philippines and other developing countries often create a nursing shortage in the home country. Nurse to patient ratio is down to 1 nurse to between 40 and 60 patients, in the 1990s the ratio was 1 nurse to between 15 and 20 patients. It seems <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the healthcare sector losses experienced nurses as the emigration is increasing.|$|E
25|$|Although, {{as noted}} above, the women {{staffing}} comfort facilities {{were intended to}} be those already involved in the sex trade, in practice there were nowhere near enough prostitutes available, especially in the Tokyo area. The government had cracked down on prostitution late in the war and many women had fled or been evacuated to the countryside following heavy Allied bombing. Tokyo's most famous red light district, Yoshiwara, had been reduced from a prewar population of 2,000 prostitutes to only a few dozen {{by the end of}} the war. Therefore, it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> efforts were made to recruit from the general population, a tactic that was authorized by the police.|$|E
50|$|Green Magi are healers. Dorian Ursuul {{trained with}} the Green Magi {{in an attempt}} to use healing magic to {{possibly}} save him from the <b>inevitable</b> madness <b>that</b> afflicts all prophets, achieving the rank of Hoth'Salar (Brother of Healing).|$|R
5000|$|Professional {{arbitrage}} betting may eat up {{considerable time}} and energy and requires lots of experience and liquidity, as well as sufficient funds to recover from <b>inevitable</b> losses <b>that</b> will happen sooner or later due to the aforementioned reasons.|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{increasingly}} seditious content of Sinn Féin (Griffith attacked the British war effort in every issue) it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> it would be banned. This {{may have been a}} deliberate strategy on his part to separate himself of the debt-ridden SFPP, blame the British authorities and get a new publishing project off the ground. The fact that Griffith had already started editing a new newspaper, Éire-Ireland, for the IRB before Sinn Féin was banned would support this to a certain extent. At the very least, it suggests that Griffith expected to be banned and was not prepared to tone down his language.|$|E
25|$|With {{a declining}} {{military}} role for railways both in Britain {{and the rest}} of the world, it was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the significance of the facilities offered by the LMR would be reduced in later years. Even so, the LMR was still important enough for the tracks of the Bentley to Bordon branch to be left in place when passenger services were withdrawn on 16 September 1957. This line remained in place as, although there was a British Railways connection at Liss, the Bordon branch made it easier to accommodate the movements of military traffic at short notice. In 1966, the movement of goods over the Bordon branch was suspended, and the line was taken up in 1967.|$|E
25|$|With the series' {{popularity}} and W. Awdry's interest in railways, {{it was perhaps}} <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> he would use the books to promote steam railways in the UK. The first instance of this {{was the creation of}} the Skarloey Railway, a railway on Sodor that closely resembled the Talyllyn Railway in Wales, of which W. Awdry was a member. Books focusing on this railway would inevitably include a promotion for the Talyllyn Railway, either in the stories themselves, in a footnote or in the foreword. Many illustrations in the books depict recognisable locations on the Talyllyn Railway, and various incidents and mishaps recorded by Tom Rolt in his book Railway Adventure are also recognisable in their adaptations for the Skarloey Railway stories.|$|E
50|$|For most monarchists, though, {{the impossibility}} of {{restoring}} Isabella II as Queen, and the youth of the future Alfonso XII made the Republic the only, though transitory, viable course of action, particularly given the <b>inevitable</b> failure <b>that</b> awaited it.|$|R
5000|$|IGNs Chris Carabott {{praised the}} {{on-screen}} chemistry of Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond) and Sonya Walger (Penelope), stating that [...] "their on screen chemistry makes the love {{between the two}} characters real and makes their <b>inevitable</b> breakup <b>that</b> much harder to handle.".|$|R
5000|$|Malatesta was a {{committed}} revolutionary: {{he believed that}} the anarchist revolution was <b>inevitable,</b> and <b>that</b> violence would be a necessary part of it since the state rested ultimately on violent coercion. As he wrote in his article [...] "The Revolutionary 'Haste'": ...|$|R
25|$|The Black Death also {{affected}} {{arts and culture}} significantly. It was <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> a catastrophe of such proportions would affect some of the greater building projects, {{as the amount of}} available labour fell sharply. The building of the cathedrals of Ely and Exeter was temporarily halted in the years immediately following the first outbreak of the plague. The shortage of labour also helped advance the transition from the Decorated style of building to the less elaborate Perpendicular style. The Black Death may also have promoted the use of vernacular English, as the number of teachers proficient in French dwindled. This, in turn, would have contributed to the late-fourteenth century flowering of English literature, represented by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower.|$|E
25|$|It is {{virtually}} <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> non-Saccharomyces wild yeast {{will have a}} role in beginning the fermentation of virtually every wine but for the wineries that choose to allow these yeasts to continue fermenting versus minimizing their influence do so with the intent of enhancing complexity through bio-diversity. While these non-Saccharomyces ferment glucose and fructose into alcohol, they also have the potential to create other intermediates that could influence the aroma and flavor profile of the wine. Some of these intermediates could be positive, such as phenylethanol, which can impart a rose-like aroma. However, as with ambient yeasts, the products of these yeasts can be very unpredictable— especially in terms of the types of flavors and aromas that these yeasts can produce.|$|E
25|$|The dog is {{a classic}} example of a {{domestic}} animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. The dog was the first domesticant, and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before cultivation or the domestication of other animals. It may have been <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the first domesticated animal came from the order of carnivores as these are less afraid when approaching other species. Within the carnivores, the first domesticated animal would need to exist without an all-meat diet, possess a running and hunting ability to provide its own food, and be of a controllable size to coexist with humans, indicating the family Canidae, and the right temperament with wolves being among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet.|$|E
5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen {{their position in the}} <b>inevitable</b> battle <b>that</b> would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|R
25|$|Andy Warhol {{during the}} early 1960s {{beginning}} to create films and video, in the mid-60s sponsored the Velvet Underground and staged events and performances in New York, like the Exploding Plastic <b>Inevitable</b> (1966) <b>that</b> featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.|$|R
50|$|David Cameron's {{response}} {{was that the}} Big Society ideology pre-dated the implementation of cuts to public services, that {{the reduction in the}} size of the state had become <b>inevitable,</b> and <b>that</b> Big Society projects are worthwhile whatever the state of the economy.|$|R
