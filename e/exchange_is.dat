25|$|Along {{with the}} more {{traditional}} business transactions the critical intangible <b>exchanges</b> <b>are</b> also mapped. Intangible <b>exchanges</b> <b>are</b> those mostly informal knowledge exchanges and benefits or support that build relationships and keep things running smoothly. These informal <b>exchanges</b> <b>are</b> actually the key to creating trust and opening pathways for innovation and new ideas. Traditional business practices ignore these important intangible <b>exchanges,</b> but they <b>are</b> made visible with a value network analysis.|$|R
5|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} {{with normal}} water {{cannot be used}} for 1H NMR measurements but heavy water, D2O, must be used instead. 13C NMR data, however, {{can be used with}} normal water and 1H NMR spectra can be used with non-aqueous media. The quantities measured with NMR are time-averaged chemical shifts, as proton <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> fast on the NMR time-scale. Other chemical shifts, such as those of 31P can be measured.|$|E
5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's {{never been on}} a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{hydrochloric}} acid {{is used in}} the regeneration of ion exchange resins. Cation <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing demineralized water. The acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins. Na+ is replaced with H+ and Ca2+ with 2 H+.|$|E
5000|$|The Pittsburgh Stock <b>Exchange</b> <b>was</b> {{formed in}} 1864 as the [...] "Oil Exchange."

5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> required to remove the antibodies.|$|E

The firm conducted business as Miller and Pflueger. The building at 350 Bush, a neoclassic design topped with a pediment displaying a sculpture by Jo Mora and later called the San Francisco Mining <b>Exchange,</b> <b>is</b> currently empty; it was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 113 in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Exchange</b> <b>is</b> a Grade I listed {{building}} built in 1741–43 by John Wood the Elder, on Corn Street, near the junction with Broad Street in Bristol, England. It was previously {{used as a}} corn and general trade exchange but is now used as offices and St Nicholas Market.|$|E

Bristol's <b>Exchange</b> <b>is</b> therefore unique, the only surviving 18th-century exchange building in England.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hostage}} <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> agreed, Troilus {{suggests}} elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|Ahmedabad {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} economic and industrial hub in India. It is the second largest producer of cotton in India, and its stock <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> the country's second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad, which houses the 54,000-seat Sardar Patel Stadium. The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction. Ahmedabad's increasing population has resulted {{in an increase in}} the construction and housing industries resulting in recent development of skyscrapers.|$|E

5|$|Long-range atomic <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} {{involving}} an adatom inserting into the surface {{as in the}} normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E

50|$|In 1943, the <b>exchange</b> <b>was</b> {{combined}} with ten other stock exchanges in major Japanese cities {{to form a}} single Japanese Stock Exchange (Nippon Shōken Torihikisho). The combined <b>exchange</b> <b>was</b> shut down and reorganized shortly after the bombing of Nagasaki.|$|R
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire <b>exchange</b> <b>is</b> humorously portrayed.|$|E
