5000|$|A tenant's duty to {{pay rent}} was {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} an <b>independent</b> <b>covenant,</b> meaning that the tenant was required to pay rent {{regardless of whether the}} landlord fulfilled their duties of performance. [...] Now the duty of a tenant to pay rent {{is considered to be a}} dependent covenant, and the tenant can be freed from the duty to pay rent if the landlord breaches the covenant of repair or warranty of habitability.|$|E

5000|$|Horizontal privity {{is found}} if, {{at the time}} the {{original}} parties enter into the agreement, those parties share some interest in the subject land <b>independent</b> of the <b>covenant</b> (e.g., landlord and tenant, mortgagee and mortgagor, or holders of mutual easements). Individual state statutes can alter the requirements of horizontal privity of estate. Privity may be instantaneous and mutual; instantaneous privity is present when the restrictive covenant is within the deed initially conveyed from the grantor to the grantee.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s {{through the early}} 21st century, a need to comply with {{changing}} international laws resulted {{in the creation of}} a number of self-governing United Brethren [...] "national conferences", organized by country. These <b>independent</b> national denominations <b>covenanted</b> together to create an interdependent body called the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, International. They must all agree to follow the Confession of Faith of 1815, as well as a set of seven Core Values. The other international governing documents include a Constitution and By-Laws.|$|R
5000|$|Other commentators, such as Douglas Van Dorn, {{recognize}} a separate priestly <b>covenant,</b> <b>independent</b> of the Mosaic covenant (which he takes as a prophetic covenant). In {{taken with the}} Davidic (kingly) covenant, this represents the three offices of Christ. Van Dorn argues this case {{on the basis of}} Nehemiah 13:29 which refers to [...] "the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites", Malachi 2:8 who speaks of [...] "the covenant of Levi," [...] and Jeremiah 33:21 who points to the [...] "covenant with the Levitical priests." [...] Van Dorn argues that the covenant document for this covenant is the book of Leviticus itself.|$|R
40|$|In May 1856 the EFS (the Swedish Evangelical Mission Society), {{influenced}} by the new evangelism-movement, was established as an “internal mission” within the Church of Sweden. During the same period the “new evangelism” revival movement established regional organizations in order to coordinate the movement {{in different parts of}} the country. These regional organizations consisted of the movement’s local mission societies in a province or part of a province of Sweden. This study will focus on democracy and theological identity in the EFS through an analysis of how the regional organizations acted, what role they played, how the EFS was {{influenced by}} them and how the EFS decided to establish its own regional organization. One result of the earlier tensions between the regional mission organizations and the EFS was the establishment of the <b>independent</b> organizations Mission <b>Covenant</b> Church of Sweden (Svenska Missionsförbundet) (1878 -) and Mission Society of Bible faithful Friends (Missionssällskapet Bibeltrogna Vänner) (1911 -). This investigation looks into 17 of 36 regional mission organizations that existed. The time frame of the investigation is from the establishment of the EFS in 1856 to the establishment of the regional structure of the EFS in 1922. The EFS changed over time. The change of society and wishes from the movement’s local mission societies and regional mission organizations were agents in this transformation. An important result of this research is that this transformation of the EFS proceeded at a slow pace and with the preservation of the EFS’s theological identity. ...|$|R
