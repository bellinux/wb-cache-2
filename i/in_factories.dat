5|$|At its peak, {{the camp}} held 8,000American {{soldiers}} (along {{with a small}} number of soldiers and civilians from other nations including the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands), making it the largest POW camp in the Philippines. This number dropped significantly as able-bodied soldiers were shipped to other areas in the Philippines, Japan, Japanese-occupied Taiwan, and Manchukuo to work in slave labor camps. As Japan had not yet ratified the Geneva Convention, the POWs were transported out of the camp and forced to work <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> to build Japanese weaponry, unload ships, and repair airfields.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic {{women were}} {{discouraged}} from {{working outside the}} home prior to World War II, even more than other American women.

5|$|In {{addition}} to its growing importance as a tourist centre, Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century. It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792, as a cottage industry, using graphite mined locally. This developed on more industrial lines <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> purpose-built by several companies. Pencil making was the town's most important manufacturing industry by the mid-19th century, textiles and leather goods having declined.|$|E
40|$|Two summer {{outbreaks}} of humidifier fever (HF) are described <b>in</b> a microprocessor <b>factory</b> (factory A) and a printing factory (factory B). The air <b>in</b> each <b>factory</b> was humidified intermittently {{and controlled by}} present humidistats operating to maintain a relative humidity of 45 % by an air handler incorporating a spray humidifier <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> A and two ceiling mounted spray humidifiers <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> B. Questionnaire data from each workforce suggested that although symptoms apparently occurred most commonly <b>in</b> both <b>factories</b> on return from holiday (41 / 57, 71. 9 %), many subjects (24 / 40, 60 %) <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> A also had intermittent symptoms of ill defined periodicity for some time before the disorder was recognised. Similar intermittent symptoms with no discernible pattern occurred <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> B <b>in</b> {{a smaller number of}} subjects (4 / 17, 23. 5 %), all of whom were night or rotating shift workers. Both episodes of humidifier fever after return from summer holiday developed when nocturnal air temperatures were unseasonably low; not on the day of return to work but two days later (factory A) and one day later (factory B). Symptoms were most common in most workers who had circulating serum IgG antibody measured by ELISA to humidifier sludge <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> B (14 / 17, 82. 9 %) but were most common in IgG antibody negative subjects <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> A (27 / 40, 67. 5 %). A more classic form of humidifier fever redeveloped <b>in</b> <b>factory</b> B during winter when meteorological recordings suggested that humidification of intake air was more continuous. Humidifier fever in winter may have been the major influence on the formulation of the symptom pattern thought to be relevant for recognition of the disorder. A form of the illness, however, can occur during the summer which is camouflaged by intermittent humidification when the symptoms appear to be more closely associated with cool nocturnal air intake and unrelated to the pattern of attendance at work...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, {{underwent}} significant {{economic and social}} change. To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left the countryside to relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work <b>in</b> <b>factories.</b> Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential corruption.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.

5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased absenteeism as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
5|$|These 18th-century {{improvements}} to the spinning process meant that handloom weavers were in great demand. but as power looms were introduced <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> in Manchester there was less work for them and there was serious unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either {{as the result of}} a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first silk mill in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926.|$|E
5|$|The wartime economy {{relied heavily}} upon the {{large-scale}} employment of forced labourers. Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries to work <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> and on farms (approximately 75 percent were Eastern European). Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection and poor living conditions led to {{high rates of}} sickness, injury and death, as well as sabotage and criminal activity. The wartime economy also relied upon large-scale robbery, initially through the state seizing the property of Jewish citizens and later by also plundering the resources of occupied territories.|$|E

5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service <b>in</b> <b>factories,</b> and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses. With both fortunes and staff depleted many owners of country houses now fought a losing battle to retain them.|$|E
5|$|Work Kommandos {{were very}} variable, but those in {{agriculture}} were generally considered better than ones <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> or mining, where conditions were worse and prisoners were vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In {{rural areas of}} Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came {{to be regarded as}} an unnecessary waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in a country where he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, people who work <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Himmler {{consolidated}} all of {{the offices}} for which Pohl was responsible into one, creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA). The entire concentration camp system was placed {{under the authority of}} the WVHA. The SS owned Sudetenquell GbmH, a mineral water producer in Sudetenland. By 1944, the SS had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly. Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone, bricks, and cement for the SS-owned Deutsche Erd- und Steinwerke (German Earth And Stone Works; DEST). In the occupied Eastern territories, the SS acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks. The DWB also founded the Ost-Deutsche Baustoffwerke (East German Building Supply Works; GmbH or ODBS) and Deutsche Edelmöbel GmbH (German Noble Furniture). These operated <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million <b>in</b> <b>factories,</b> manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning <b>in</b> <b>factories</b> were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
