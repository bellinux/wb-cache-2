5|$|The Vicars' Hall was {{completed}} in 1348 and included a communal dining room, administrative offices and treasury of the Vicars Choral. The houses {{on either side of}} the close were built in the 14th and early 15th centuries. Since then alterations have been made including a unified roof, front gardens and raised chimneys. The final part of the construction of the close was during the 1420s when the Vicars' Chapel and Library was constructed on the wall of the Liberty of St Andrew. The south face includes shields commemorating the bishops of the time. The interior is decorated with 19th century <b>gesso</b> work by Heywood Sumner and the building now used by Wells Cathedral School.|$|E
5|$|To {{the same}} generic type belongs the famous abbots’ chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily {{be taken to}} pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time {{acquired}} arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, {{as well as the}} most, ancient, English chair is that made {{at the end of the}} 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded <b>gesso</b> which long since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Vicars' Chapel is {{rubble masonry}} however the south face {{which can be}} seen from the close is of white Conglomerate quarried locally. The shields on the wall are those of Nicholas Bubwith, {{suggesting}} that construction was started during his reign as bishop between 1407 and 1424, and John Stafford who was bishop from 1424 until 1443 suggesting that construction was completed under his episcopate. The lower floor was a chapel, and a spiral stair led up to the library. The chapel was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Katherine. It is now used by the chaplain of Wells Cathedral School. The interior is decorated with 19th century <b>gesso</b> work by Heywood Sumner.|$|E

5|$|The Mysore {{painting}} {{style is}} {{an offshoot of}} the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. The distinctive feature of these paintings is the <b>gesso</b> work, to which gold foil is applied. Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies. A notable local dessert that traces its history to the kitchen in the Mysore palace is Mysore pak.|$|E

25|$|Bate Tichenor's {{painting}} {{technique was}} based upon 16th-century Italian tempera formulas that artist Paul Cadmus taught her in New York in 1945, where she would prepare an eggshell-finished <b>gesso</b> ground on masonite board and apply (instead of tempera) multiple transparent oil glazes defined through chiaroscuro with sometimes one hair of a #00 sable brush. Bate Tichenor considered her work to be of a spiritual nature, reflecting ancient occult religions, magic, alchemy, and Mesoamerican mythology in her Italian Renaissance style of painting.|$|E
25|$|Most {{surviving}} examples have {{lost much of}} their paintwork, but the colouring of the carvings {{was an integral part}} of the production. Colouring was usually very vivid, with robes being painted in scarlets and blues, hair and accoutrements such as crowns and sceptres were often gilded, and landscapes were decorated with distinctive daisy patterns often against a dark-green ground. Moulded and gilded <b>gesso</b> was also used to give extra richness to the carvings which would need to be brightly coloured, as mostly they would only be seen at a distance by candlelight.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the canvas}} has shown {{that it was a}} type favored by Veronese, with an {{arrangement}} of threads creating a diagonal twill pattern. While he often preferred to paint on lightly colored grounds, for The Family of Darius before Alexander, as with many of his larger paintings, Veronese prepared the canvas only with plain <b>gesso.</b> Though he routinely made numerous preparatory sketches, Veronese made major revisions while working on The Family of Darius before Alexander, including painting out a balcony with figures directly behind the main group, and adding lightly sketched horses and figures to the left background, perhaps as an afterthought.|$|E

25|$|The {{sculpture}} {{collection at}} the V is the most comprehensive holding of post-classical European sculpture in the world. There are approximately 22,000 objects in the collection that cover the period from about 400 AD to 1914. This covers among other periods Byzantine and Anglo Saxon ivory sculptures, British, French and Spanish medieval statues and carvings, the Renaissance, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Victorian and Art Nouveau periods. All uses of sculpture are represented, from tomb and memorial, to portrait, allegorical, religious, mythical, statues for gardens including fountains, as well as architectural decorations. Materials used include, marble, alabaster, stone, terracotta, wood (history of wood carving), ivory, <b>gesso,</b> plaster, bronze, lead and ceramics.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of using reserve heads {{appears to have}} ended sometime during the Sixth dynasty, replaced by the {{practice of}} covering the head or the entire body of the deceased in plaster. These face and body coverings that were created may have the same purpose as the reserve head, working as a substitute location for the spirit if the original head decayed or was otherwise destroyed. It seems likely that both the practice of crafting reserve heads and that of covering the body or face of an individual with plaster overlapped considerably, with an early example of the latter dated {{to the end of}} the Fourth dynasty based on the pottery that was found with it. The practice of covering the body or face with plaster was also short-lived, as improved mummification techniques offered a better chance of preserving the body than covering it with plaster. Plaster masks that were formed directly around the head of the deceased are now thought to represent an early stage in a process that would lead to the full mummification of non-royal bodies. eventually evolving into the practice of creating masks made of cartonnage, consisting of linen layers mixed with <b>gesso.</b>|$|E
25|$|All {{the later}} Commission tablets used {{a design that}} {{differed}} from the prototype tablet in that it brought together elements from all the dominions and India. This standard design, following consultations with the College of Arms, had the Royal Coat of Arms surrounded by the shields of the coats of arms of the five Dominions: the Union of South Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Dominion of Canada and the Dominion of Newfoundland. The Indian Empire was represented by the insignia of the Order of the Star of India and its motto 'Heaven's light our guide'. Some designs of the tablet referred to 'The United Kingdom', while others referred to 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'. The text within the main design includes the mottoes used in the Royal Coat of Arms: Honi soit qui mal y pense and Dieu et mon droit. The material used was gilded and coloured <b>gesso</b> set in a stone surround. Other design elements included a banded laurel-like border with carved roses in each corner and one at bottom centre. Some designs differed in {{the placement of the}} names of the dominions, and some varied in the colours used. The Westminster tablet is 5 feet 10 inches by 2 feet 10 inches (177.8cm by 86.36cm). The Ypres tablet is 266cm by 127cm.|$|E

He also prefers to work from dark value, to light, {{focusing}} on atmosphere before moving to detail. Many of his most well-known pieces, comprise a majority OF white workS with touches of red.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974 the City of Milan {{opened the}} Civico Museo-Studio Francesco Messina {{in the ancient}} former church of [...] "San Sisto al Carrobbio". This will remain the artists {{permanent}} and official studio until his death, also hosting ca. eighty sculptures (<b>gessos,</b> polychrome terracottas, bronzes, waxes) and thirty graphic works (lithographies, pastels, acquarellos, pencil drawings) donated to the Comune di Milano.|$|R
5000|$|The {{thorough}} {{research and}} persistent evolution of Kluz's works {{has brought about}} experimentation and innovation with various media [...] His earlier work explored the material qualities of egg tempera and gum Arabic on <b>gessoed</b> panels. Most recently he has developed a distinctive paper collage technique which makes use of hand coloured papers and mixed media. He also produces screen prints and lino cuts.|$|R
25|$|It {{should always}} be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was {{practically}} universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was {{the effect of these}} old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous vestments, the lights, the crucifix, the banners and incense, the frescoed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of Gothic art, the stained glass, were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate <b>gesso</b> diaper, colored or gilded (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the triptychs or retables of Germany, Flanders or France; carved with scenes from the New Testament in high relief arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic luster.|$|E
25|$|No Carolingian monumental {{sculpture}} survives, although {{perhaps the}} most important patronage of Charlemagne was his commissioning of a life-size gold figure of Christ on a crucifix for his Palatine Chapel in Aachen; this is only known from literary references and was probably gold foil around a wooden base, probably modelled with a <b>gesso</b> layer, like the later and rather crumpled Golden Madonna of Essen. Early Christian art had not featured monumental sculptures of religious figures as opposed to rulers, as these were strongly associated by the Church Fathers with the cult idols of Ancient Roman religion. Byzantine art and modern Eastern Orthodox religious art have maintained the prohibition to the present day, but Western art was apparently decisively influenced by the example of Charlemagne to abandon it. Charlemagne's circle wished to revive the glories of classical style, which they mostly knew in its Late Antique form, and also to compete with Byzantine art, in which they appear to have been helped by refugee artists from the convulsions of the Byzantine iconoclasm. As Charlemagne himself {{does not appear to have}} been very interested in visual art, his political rivalry with the Byzantine Empire, supported by the Papacy, may have contributed to the strong pro-image position expressed in the Libri Carolini, which set out the position on images held with little variation by the Western Church for the rest of the Middle Ages, and beyond.|$|E
500|$|When finished, the {{painting}} was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation, but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as [...] "completely ruined". Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly <b>gesso,</b> resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking. Despite this, {{the painting}} {{remains one of the}} most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in every medium from carpets to cameos.|$|E
50|$|By 1978, {{she stopped}} {{sculpting}} {{to focus on}} painting, particularly of still lifes and simple scenes. Her paintings are often made with layered oil pastel on <b>gessoed,</b> textured masonite. She creates ethereal light by using many thin applications of color in many layers. Her paintings and monotypes are represented in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Carnegie Institute, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden among others.|$|R
50|$|Aldrich often {{works on}} <b>gessoed</b> panels {{with a mixture}} of oil paint, mineral spirits, and wax, which he lays on with a brush or palette knife. The {{combination}} of the resistant ground and viscid alloy registers his short hesitant strokes with tender congealed precision. His larger and breezier canvases have been compared to Philip Guston's transitional pictures from the mid-1960s (and also sometimes evoke Per Kirkeby or Joan Mitchell).|$|R
50|$|To {{create his}} {{finished}} work projects, Struzan starts by sketching out drawings on <b>gessoed</b> illustration board, then tinting the draftsmanship with airbrushed acrylic paint, finishing up the highlights and other details with colored pencils and more airbrush if needed. The <b>gessoed</b> foundation allows Struzan {{the luxury of}} being able to accommodate any requested changes to the work. Preferring to work on a 1 to 1 scale, Struzan's one-sheet work would be approximately 27 x 40 inches, the size of a printed movie poster. Working from reference photographs and live models, Struzan has been known, at times, to include depictions of himself, family members and friends in his work. He is known for working very quickly; typically takes him a week to two weeks to finish a painting. With the theatrical release of the Star Wars special editions, Struzan created the three panel triptych within the limited four-week deadline. The poster artwork for John Carpenter's 1982 remake of The Thing was created overnight, having received that assignment less than a day before the finished poster was needed.|$|R
500|$|A team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the [...] "Laboratario del Restauro" [...] in Florence spent {{ten years}} reapplying paint. They worked {{in an almost}} {{pointillist}} manner, {{with the aid of}} computer modelling. The tiny specks of pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the <b>gesso</b> and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The restorers succeeded in returning the work close to its original appearance, and it was put back on public display in 1976.|$|E
500|$|The chalice {{and plant}} motif on the front, {{of which there}} is no trace from behind, has been built up using some clay-like {{material}} underneath the leather, as shown by CT-scans since the purchase. [...] In the 2015 book, Nicholas Pickwoad suggests that this raised decoration was formed using a matrix which was pressed into the damp leather over the clay-like substance and the wooden board. [...] Previous authors had suggested that the material under the relief decoration might have been built up in <b>gesso</b> as well as cord and leather scraps before applying the cover leather. [...] A broadly similar plant motif in similar technique is found on a later Middle Eastern pouch in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore.|$|E
500|$|Portrait of a Lady [...] {{was painted}} {{on a single}} oak board with a {{vertical}} grain and has an unpainted margin on each side. The panel was prepared with <b>gesso,</b> upon which the figure was then painted in monochrome. Glazes of oil pigment were then added, which allowed for subtle and transparent tonal gradations. Infra-red reflectography reveals that van der Weyden did not sketch {{the work on the}} board before he began to paint, and {{there is no evidence of}} underdrawing. It shows that the lady was portrayed as more slender before changes were made as the work progressed; thickly applied background paint underlies some of the belt, demonstrating that the original silhouette was widened. These changes are also visible in x-ray images. It is in relatively good condition, having been cleaned a number of times, most recently in 1980. There is some loss of paint on the veil, headdress and sleeve, and abrasion on the ear.|$|E
50|$|John (Jean) Pelletier (fl. ca 1681 - 1704) was a French Huguenot carver and gilder, who {{emigrated from}} Paris, {{where he had}} trained, and worked in London. He {{provided}} high-style Baroque furniture for the court of William III and Mary II, specializing in carved, <b>gessoed</b> and gilded furniture of the highest quality. He was also employed in providing carved and gilded picture and looking-glass frames and in gilding the work of other carvers.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{other members}} of the group it is a {{monotype}} produced by printing from a matrix consisting of paint on <b>gessoed</b> millboard, with each impression then finished by hand. By this unusual means Blake could obtain up to three impressions from a single painting. Three such impressions survive of Pity. A fourth, in the British Museum, was an early trial of the design from a different matrix, as it is smaller than the others.|$|R
50|$|His master was Pablo de Roxas. His {{first known}} work, dating to 1597, is the graceful St. Christopher {{in the church}} of El Salvador at Seville. His Boy Christ (dated 1607) is in the sacristy of the cathedral of Seville. His masterpiece, the great altar of St Jerome at San Isidoro del Campo, Santiponce, near Seville, was {{contracted}} in 1609 and completed in 1613. Montañés executed most of his sculpture in wood, which was <b>gessoed,</b> polychromed and gilded.|$|R
