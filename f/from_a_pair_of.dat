The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
5|$|With {{a history}} {{stretching}} {{to the time}} following World War I, Roanoke Regional Airport has evolved <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> dirt runways and a single hangar to a fully equipped, modern airport serving multiple commercial airlines. Today the airport features a terminal building completed in 1989, a pair of asphalt runways, and a control tower completed in 2005 that serves {{the residents of the}} greater Roanoke Valley.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete worms, and likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E

To {{pay for her}} treatments, Hsin attends an {{underground}} lottery in which participants either win money or lose an organ, depending on tiles chosen <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> vases. One man wins the lottery but selects a bad tile, and his body is found later that day. Scully performs an autopsy and finds {{that he had been}} selling body parts, noticing his numerous surgical scars. The agents question Chao, who claims that the local community maintains a code of silence and does not reveal anything to even him.|$|E
5|$|Torosaurus is a ceratopsid genus first {{identified}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> skulls in 1891, {{two years}} after the identification of Triceratops. The Torosaurus genus resembles Triceratops in geological age, distribution, anatomy and physical size and it has been recognised as a close relative. Its distinguishing features are an elongated skull and the presence of two fenestrae, or holes, in the frill. Paleontologists investigating dinosaur ontogeny (growth and development of individuals over the life span) in the Hell Creek Formation, Montana, US, have recently presented evidence that the two represent a single genus.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E

5|$|The {{shipping}} channel {{approaching the}} Fox River in Green Bay was changed {{a number of}} times in order to accommodate vessels of increasing draft. The Army Corps of Engineers also modified the channel in the mid 1920's. The Green Bay Harbor Entrance buoy was established in 1927 to mark this point until the Bureau of Lighthouses could obtain funds for a more permanent solution. The acetylene buoy emitted a flash of 0.3 seconds duration every 3 seconds and had a wave-activated bell. The light {{is one of the few}} on the Great Lakes still powered by submarine cable. It is issued <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 300mm Tideland Signal ML300 acrylic optics mounted on the gallery railing. Because the light is too far out to be seen well from shore, the only good view of it is from a boat.|$|E

25|$|Under {{moderate}} usage, {{a pair of}} pointe shoes will typically last through ten {{to twenty}} hours of wear. For dance students, this often translates into weeks or months of serviceable use <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> pointe shoes. Professional dancers typically wear out pointe shoes much more quickly; a new pair may wear out in a single performance. As a result, most professional ballet companies provide shoe allowances for their dancers to defray the cost of frequent shoe replacement.|$|E
25|$|The Towering Inferno is a 1974 American action drama {{disaster}} film {{produced by}} Irwin Allen featuring an all-star cast led by Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. The picture {{was directed by}} John Guillermin. A co-production between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros., {{it was the first}} film to be a joint venture by two major Hollywood studios. It was adapted by Stirling Silliphant <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> novels, The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson.|$|E

In one scene from No Man's Law, Rex saves the modesty {{of a young woman}} swimming in the nude <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> rowdy villains. Chasing one around in circles, rearing and bucking like a wild mustang, until he finally runs him off of a cliff, he sneaks up behind the other and nudges him with his nose over the ledge and into the watering hole. He then nose prods the now clothed young woman back to her father.|$|E

25|$|Set in New York City, {{the play}} opens {{at the end}} of October 1985, with Louis Ironson, a gay Jew, {{learning}} that his lover, WASP Prior Walter, has AIDS. As Prior's illness progresses, Louis becomes unable to cope and moves out, leaving Prior to deal with his abandonment. Prior begins to receive visits <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> ghosts who claim to be his own ancestors, and hears an angelic voice telling him to prepare for her arrival. Prior does not know if these visitations are caused by an emotional breakdown or if they are real.|$|E
25|$|In {{handwritten}} text, {{the actual}} {{form of the}} extra marking may vary <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> dots {{to a pair of}} short vertical bars, to a single horizontal bar, or to a wavy line resembling a tilde. In practice, almost any diacritic situated above the base glyph (for example, á ā ã) would probably be interpreted as a carelessly written pair of dots (ä). However, in computerized character sets, these alternatives are incorrect. The front-vowel counterpart of u using the glyph y rather than ü is carried over from Swedish, and additionally avoids confusion in cursive script with ii, which is common in Finnish.|$|E
25|$|The Lithobiomorpha, {{also known}} as stone centipedes, {{represent}} the other main group of anamorphic centipedes; they also reach a mature segment count of 15 trunk segments. This group has lost the compound eyes, and sometimes has no eyes altogether. Instead, its eyes have a single ocellus {{or a group of}} ocelli. Its spiracles are paired and can be found laterally. Every leg-bearing segment of this organism has a separate tergite, these alternating in length apart <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> long tergites on each of segments 7 and 8. It also has relatively short antennae and legs compared to the Scutigeromorpha. Two families are included, the Henicopidae and Lithobiidae.|$|E

25|$|Michigan {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} against Ohio State; this was a dramatic game with {{a trip to the}} Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied 17–17, Brady led Michigan to the winning score. He led Michigan to an overtime win in the Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards, four touchdowns, leading the team back <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> 14-point deficits in regulation (14–0 in the first half, and 28–14 in the second). He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg to tight end Shawn Thompson. Michigan won the game when Alabama missed an extra point following its own touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Finney {{grew up in}} Marple, near Stockport, {{before moving}} to Dorset and then joining the British Army in September 2000. His first {{operational}} deployment came in the Iraq campaign. On 28 March 2003 the Scimitar armoured vehicle he was driving came under attack <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> American ground attack aircraft in a friendly fire incident. He rescued several of his comrades despite being hit by the attacking aircraft. For his valour {{he was awarded the}} GC – the highest award for acts of conspicuous gallantry performed when not {{in the face of the}} enemy, becoming the youngest serviceman in the British Armed Forces to receive it.|$|E
25|$|Yes then {{signed a}} deal with Frontiers Records and began {{recording}} in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around {{the time that they}} had been Yes members during 1980 and the Drama album. During the recording sessions, the band thought {{it would be wise to}} bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Upon completion of recording in March 2011, and post-production a month later, the album was released worldwide that July. Fly from Here peaked at number 30 in the UK and 36 in the US.|$|E
