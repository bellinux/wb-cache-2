500|$|In the episode, Field Marshal Haig {{is shown}} casually {{sweeping}} away toy soldiers with a <b>dustpan</b> and brush; BBC News Magazines Finlo Rohrer called this a [...] "visual allusion to his callousness", but quoted the historian Gary Sheffield as saying [...] "The real Field Marshal Haig {{was certainly not}} a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did you ended up with {{lots and lots of}} casualties." [...] Sheffield also noted that [...] "Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and John French and the other generals", so Haig effectively [...] "appears twice". The series, and the storyline of [...] "Goodbyeee" [...] especially, often depicts the [...] "lions led by donkeys" [...] perception of the War, an element of Blackadder Goes Forth that has been criticised by historians.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1989 BBC {{comedy series}} , Haig, played by Geoffrey Palmer, makes an {{appearance}} in the final episode. Referring to the limited gains made during the 1915–1917 offensives, Blackadder says: [...] "Haig is about to make yet another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin". Haig is also portrayed sweeping up model soldiers from a large map with a <b>dustpan</b> and brush, and tossing them casually over his shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|The Nazi {{woman had}} {{to conform to}} the German society desired by Adolf Hitler (Volksgemeinschaft), racially pure and {{physically}} robust. She did not work, living in the naturalization of motherhood and following the slogan of the former emperor William II of Germany: Kinder, Küche, Kirche, meaning [...] "Children, kitchen, church". In a document published in 1934, The Nine Commandments of the Workers' Struggle, Hermann Goering bluntly summarizes the future role of German women: [...] "Take a pot, a <b>dustpan</b> and a broom and marry a man". This was anti-feminism {{in the sense that the}} Nazis considered political rights granted to women (access to high-level positions for example) as incompatible with the nature of reproduction, the only role within which they could blossom and best serve the interests of the nation. Thus, Magda Goebbels declared in 1933: [...] "German women were excluded from three professions: the army, as elsewhere in the world; the government; and the judiciary. If a German girl must choose between marriage or a career, she will always be encouraged to marry, because that is what is best for a woman". It is not possible to make a mental leap to the conservative and patriarchal societies that prevailed for example during the Second Empire; in effect, the totalitarian character of the regime moved away from the concept that had been made of women being put on a shelf by society. On the contrary, they were expected to participate at the ground level in the roles of mother and spouse. The fact that the regimentation of women (Bund Deutscher Mädel then Frauenschaft) being so organized, did not permit relegating women to what they could do in the 19th century. Without a doubt, a conservative electorate and a fringe part of the population very critical of the image of the emancipated woman from the 1920s found a certain satisfaction in the new regime. But the goals were different, asking each woman to take part in the building of the [...] "Reich of 1000 years". Female liberation found itself therefore necessarily limited, and Heide Schlüpmann stated conclusively in Frauen und Film, that the films of Leni Riefenstahl (the official film director of the regime) [...] "value quite a negation of female sexuality and only offer women a deceptive autonomy".|$|E

Streets were reportedly clean by 10am, with volunteers having shown up with brooms and <b>dustpans</b> to clean the city. Boarded up windows were covered in apologies and defences of the city's reputation. In response, the Hudson's Bay Company, a major retailer in the area, hosted a free pancake breakfast in thanks.|$|R
6000|$|So it {{came about}} that in {{designing}} and writing those Moggs' Soap Advertisements, that wrought a revolution in that department of literature, my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost history, but also the enormous field for invention and enterprise that lurked among the little articles, the <b>dustpans</b> and mincers, the mousetraps and carpet-sweepers that fringe the shops of the oilman and domestic ironmonger. He was recalled {{to one of the}} dreams of his youth, to his conception of the Ponderevo Patent Flat that had been in his mind so early as the days before I went to serve him at Wimblehurst.

500|$|FIG {{became the}} first {{publicly}} performing women-only improvising group, and they challenged the established improvising community with performances that were theatrical, with politics and farce supplementing their music. They staged parodies around {{the role of women}} in society and incorporated domestic [...] "found objects" [...] in their performances, including [...] "vacuum cleaners, brooms, <b>dustpans,</b> pots and pans, and egg slicers". Their performances often had some of the women cleaning the stage, while the others huddled in a group to [...] "explore the sonic possibilities of household items." [...] They also broke down the barriers that traditionally existed between the performer and the audience by engaging in [...] "antiphonal exchange" [...] with them, and promoting the notion that [...] "anyone can do it". FIG redefined free improvisation by introducing [...] "social virtuosity", the ability to communicate with the other musicians and the audience.|$|R

5000|$|Automatic <b>dustpans</b> (e.g. [...] "Vacpan" [...] or [...] "KickSweep") can be {{installed}} in the kickspace under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard broom to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there.

60|$|I {{had some}} curious {{conversation}} {{the next morning}} with Miss Ambient, whom I found strolling in the garden before breakfast The whole place looked as fresh and trim, amid the twitter of the birds, as if, an hour before, the housemaids {{had been turned into}} it with their <b>dustpans</b> and feather-brushes, I almost hesitated to light a cigarette, and was doubly startled when, in the act of doing so, I suddenly perceived the sister of my host, who had, in any case, something of the oddity of an apparition, standing before me. She might have been posing for her photograph. Her sad-colored robe arranged itself in serpentine folds at her feet; her hands locked themselves listlessly together in front; and her chin rested upon a cinque-cento ruff. The first thing I did, after bidding her good-morning, was to ask her for news of her little nephew,--to express the hope that she had heard he was better. She was able to gratify this hope, and spoke as if we might expect to see him during the day. We walked through the shrubberies together, and she gave me {{a great deal of information}} about her brother's ménage, which offered me an opportunity to mention to her that his wife had told me, the night before, that she thought his productions objectionable.|$|R
50|$|About {{a century}} ago, the bambooworking was only {{limited to the}} making of living {{materials}} and productive tools such as hats, buckets, food steamers, <b>dustpans,</b> tables and chairs, beds, ridges and so on; when Taiwan was invaded by the Japanese {{at the end of}} the 19th century, the bamboo weaving skills were widely extended from the living and production use to the field of stationery, decoration, and even arts. In the meanwhile, the rough weaving skills were refined to be more delicate. The stationery case and lamp cover, which was woven by the Japanese artist at the Guangxu Times in Qing dynasty in China, was first discovered by Wang Zhenduo. Both these two bamboo products are beautiful in color, discreet in skills, and fashionable in pattern, which makes it too attractive to be released from one’s hands. The stationery case is 30 centimeters in length, 18 centimeters in width, and 8 centimeters in height. Woven by a number of bamboo strips of 0.5 cm in width, the stationery case has such average gaps between every two strips that it seems as if it were produced by the assembly line in the factory rather than made by human hands. Besides, the purplish red bamboo strips, where letter paper and thread-bound books were placed, appear quite simple and historically meaningful. As for the lamp cover, it is 23 centimeters in length, and 5 centimeters in width. Seeing the brown bamboo filament on the lamp and the paper-cut window decoration, one must be reminiscent of a simply-dressed and elegant host of the room.|$|R

This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.|$|E
60|$|The great aim of Elizabeth's {{life was}} to make a new man of Nutty. It was her hope that the quiet life and {{soothing}} air of Brookport, with--unless you counted the money-in-the-slot musical box at the store--its absence of the fiercer excitements, might in time pull him together and unscramble his disordered nervous system. She liked to listen of a morning to the sound of Nutty busy in the next room with a broom and a <b>dustpan,</b> for in the simple lexicon of Flack's there was no such word as 'help'. The privy purse would not run to a maid. Elizabeth did the cooking and Claude Nutcombe the housework.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is {{therefore}} with regret that we discover Christopher Crowfield applying so harshly, and, {{as we think}} so indiscriminatingly, the theory of work to women, and teaching a society made up of women sacrificed in the workshops of the State, or to the <b>dustpans</b> and kitchens of the house, that women must work, ought to work, and are dishonored {{if they do not}} work; and that a woman committed to the drudgery of a household is more creditably employed than when she is charming, fascinating, irresistible, in the parlor or boudoir. The consequence of this fatal mistake is manifest throughout New England,--in New England where the girls are all beautiful and the wives and mothers faded, disfigured, and without charm or attractiveness. The moment a girl marries, in New England, she is apt to become a drudge or a lay figure on which to exhibit the latest fashions. She never has beautiful hands, and she would not have a beautiful face if a utilitarian society could [...] "apply" [...] her face to anything but the pleasure of the eye. Her hands lose their shape and softness after childhood, and domestic drudgery destroys her beauty of form and softness and bloom of complexion after marriage. To correct, or rather to break up, this despotism of household cares, or of work, over woman, American society must be taught that women will inevitably fade and deteriorate, unless it insures repose and comfort to them. It must be taught that reverence for beauty is the normal condition, while the theory of work, applied to women, is disastrous alike to beauty and morals. Work, when it is destructive to men or women, is forced and unjust.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2014, Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, {{mentioned}} the Let Toys Be Toys campaign in a parliamentary debate {{she had called}} on gender-specific toy marketing. She told the House of Commons:“Before entering Parliament, I spent two decades as a professional engineer, working across three continents. Regardless of where I was or {{the size of the}} company, it was always a predominantly male, or indeed all-male, environment, but it is only when I walk into a toy shop that I feel I am really experiencing gender segregation. At some point over the past three decades, the toy industry decided that parents and children could not be trusted {{to figure out what to}} buy without colour-coded gender labelling—that means Science museum toys being labelled “for boys”, whereas miniature <b>dustpans</b> and brushes are “Girl Stuff”, according to SportsDirect.I say over the past three decades, because there was a time when toys were toys and blue and pink were just colours. An Argos catalogue page from 1976 shows toy houses, prams and so on all in different colours. Now they only sell them in pink. Recently, a Lego advert from 1981 went viral on the internet because it showed a girl proudly clasping her latest Lego creation. None of the text was gender-specific and the girl was actually wearing blue.What happened? Did someone dye the Y chromosome blue in the ’80s or force the X chromosome to secrete only pink hormones? No. This aggressive gender segregation is a consequence of big-company marketing tactics. Every successful marketeer knows that differentiation makes for greater profit margins and segmentation gives a bigger overall market, so with three-year-old girls only being able to “choose” pink tricycles, the manufacturer can charge more for that special girly shade of pink and the premium princess saddle. Of course, that trike cannot be handed over to a brother or nephew, ensuring further sales of blue bikes with Action Man handlebars. It has got to the point where it is difficult to buy toys for girls that are not pink, princess-primed and/or fairy-infused.”Onwurah later told Kira Cochrane, a reporter for UK Newspaper The Guardian, that she believes the limiting of children by gender stereotypes is a serious economic issue, with the proportion of female students on engineering degree courses having fallen from 12% to 8% in the thirty years since she had started studying for one herself. She said: [...] "We have some big economic problems, and one is a huge skills shortage in engineering and technology. There are thousands of jobs going unfilled, and in addition a lot of our engineers are in their 50s and retiring in the next five years. At the same time we have the lowest proportion in Europe of women who are professional engineers. … Toys are so important and formative, and for me this is about the jobs of the future, about what happens in 10 or 15 years' time. We can't go on with a segregated society." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scene one- Set in the 1910s, the {{audience}} is introduced to Seth Holly's boardinghouse, where Seth and his wife Bertha are in the kitchen watching Bynum in the backyard. Seth is complaining to Bertha about Bynum's strange spiritual activities. Bertha tells Seth to let him be as he isn’t bothering anyone. They also talk about Jeremy, a young man staying in the boardinghouse, getting arrested the night before for supposedly being drunk in public. Seth then has a monologue about the poor situation that the freed slaves are in after traveling up North. He worries that the African Americans are too naïve and that all the promises {{of jobs in the}} North will be taken by the poor white Americans. Then Rutherford Selig, the People Finder, comes to order <b>dustpans</b> from Seth, a maker of pots and pans. Then Bynum talks about an adventure that he once took up river where he found the [...] "shiny man", a man he found on the road that offered to explain to him the Secret of Life. He had a spiritual encounter with the man, and sees the ghost of his father, telling him to find his song in life. His song, he later explains, is the Binding Song, which he uses to bind people to one another. Selig leaves and Jeremy enters, and after getting a scolding from Seth, he tells him that the white cops came and picked him up for no reason and that he was, in fact, not drunk at all. Then Herald Loomis and his daughter Zonia enter, {{looking for a place to}} stay for the week. They reveal that he is looking for his wife, Martha. After Seth shows them to their room, Jeremy relates a story about his guitar-playing abilities and how he is wary of playing for white men or money because of a bad experience. Bynum convinces Jeremy to go down to a bar to play for some money. Seth confides in Bynum and Bertha his lack of confidence in Loomis, and thinks that he is a [...] "mean looking" [...] man and he doesn’t want to help him find his wife because of it. After this Mattie Campbell enters, looking for Bynum because she has heard that he can [...] "fix things". Her man, Jack, has up and left her, but she wants him to come back. Bynum tells her that he can only bind people that wish to be bound; that she is better off just letting him find his own path in life. Jeremy intervenes and suggests that Mattie stays with him as to cure both of their loneliness. The scene ends with Zonia and Reuben, the little boy from next door. Reuben discloses Bynum's odd tendencies to Zonia and tells her a story about his friend Eugene that used to sell pigeons to Bynum so he could use their blood in his rituals.|$|R

I took a bath and did most of my dressing, splashing, and whistling softly for the steward's edification, while the secret sharer of my life stood drawn up bolt upright in that little space, his face looking very sunken in daylight, his eyelids lowered under the stern, dark line of his eyebrows drawn together by a slight frown.|$|E
60|$|The smile did {{not last}} long, for Louis was well-nigh thrown downstairs by a <b>dustpan</b> in a dark corner, and James was heard muttering that nothing in that house was ever in its right place; and while Louis was {{suggesting}} {{that it was only}} himself who was not in the right place, they entered the drawing-room, which, like the lady, was in the same condition as that in which he had left it. Since Isabel had lost Marianne and other appliances, she had thought it not worth while to dress for dinner; so nothing had happened, except that the hermit had proved to be Adeline's great uncle, and had begun to clear up the affair of the sacrilege.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] {{continued}} Bob, [...] "that {{since our}} cook married, and Alice went to California, {{there seems to}} be no possibility of putting our domestic cabinet upon any permanent basis. The number of female persons that have been through our house, and the ravages they have wrought on it for the last six months, pass belief. I had yesterday a bill of sixty dollars' plumbing to pay for damages of various kinds which had had to be repaired in our very convenient water-works; and the blame of each particular one had been bandied like a shuttlecock among our three household divinities. Biddy privately assured my wife that Kate was in the habit of emptying <b>dustpans</b> of rubbish into the main drain from the chambers, and washing any little extra bits down through the bowls; and, in fact, when one of the bathing-room bowls had overflowed so as to damage the frescoes below, my wife, with great delicacy and precaution, interrogated Kate as to whether she had followed her instructions in the care of the water-pipes. Of course she protested the most immaculate care and circumspection. 'Sure, and she knew how careful one ought to be, and wasn't of the likes of thim as wouldn't mind what throuble they made,--like Biddy, who would throw trash and hair in the pipes, and niver listen to her tellin'; sure, and hadn't she broken the pipes in the kitchen, and lost the stoppers, as it was a shame to see in a Christian house?' Ann, the third girl, being privately questioned, blamed Biddy on Monday, and Kate on Tuesday; on Wednesday, however, she exonerated both; but on Thursday, being in a high quarrel with both, she departed, accusing them severally, not only of all the evil practices aforesaid, but of lying and stealing, and all other miscellaneous wickednesses that came to hand. Whereat the two thus accused rushed in, bewailing themselves and cursing Ann in alternate strophes, averring that she had given the baby laudanum, and, taking it out riding, had stopped for hours with it in a filthy lane where the scarlet fever was said to be rife,--in short, made so fearful a picture that Marianne gave up the child's life at once, and has taken to her bed. I have endeavored all I could to quiet her, by telling her that the scarlet fever story was probably an extemporaneous work of fiction, got up to gratify the Hibernian anger at Ann; and that it wasn't in the least worth while to believe one thing more than another from the fact that any of the tribe said it. But she refuses to be comforted, and is so Utopian as to lie there crying, 'Oh, if I only could get one that I could trust,--one that would really speak the truth to me,--one that I might know really went where she said she went, and really did as she said she did!' To have to live so, she says, and bring up little children with those she can't trust out of her sight, whose word is good for nothing,--to feel that her beautiful house and her lovely things are all going to rack and ruin, and she can't take care of them, and can't see where or when or how the mischief is done,--in short, the poor child talks as women do who are violently attacked with housekeeping fever tending to congestion of the brain. She actually yesterday told me that she wished, on the whole, she never had got married, which I take to be the most positive indication of mental alienation." ...|$|R

The charwoman usually employed by the Hepworths had not been admitted to the house on the morning of Mrs. Hepworth's departure. Mrs. Hepworth had met her at the door and paid her a week's money in lieu of notice, explaining to her that she would not be wanted any more. Jetson, thinking he might possibly do better by letting the house furnished, had sent for this woman, and instructed her to give the place a thorough cleaning.
