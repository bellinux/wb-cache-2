5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but <b>her</b> <b>attorney</b> said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. <b>Her</b> <b>attorney</b> reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

Cosby is countersuing both Huth and <b>her</b> <b>attorney</b> Marc Strecker for legal fees. Cosby's attorney contends Huth and <b>her</b> <b>attorney</b> engaged in an extortion attempt before filing a suit. Singer's claim is made in a notice of demurrer. He also is seeking sanctions against Huth and <b>her</b> <b>attorney,</b> Marc Strecker.|$|E

5000|$|The woman {{failed to}} appear {{at a press conference}} {{announced}} by <b>her</b> <b>attorneys,</b> saying she was fearful because of threats. She granted an interview to The Daily Mail together with Bloom (whom the Daily Mail identified as her lawyer) and permitted photographs. Soon after that, the woman dropped her lawsuit against Epstein and Trump on November 4, 2016. The Daily Mail said their reporters were aware of the woman's identity but were honoring her request to protect her privacy and not release <b>her</b> name. <b>Her</b> <b>attorneys</b> said the woman dropped her suit out of fear, based on having received [...] "numerous threats" [...] against her life.|$|R

After waiting all day for the indictment, <b>her</b> <b>attorney</b> told prosecutors she would return there the next morning. Instead, she was arrested at her home before the courthouse opened. <b>Her</b> <b>attorney</b> said prosecutors were bullying her for refusing to cooperate with them. Similarly, lawyers for Adelphia Communications chairman John Rigas criticized prosecutors for having him arrested at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side in 2002 despite his offer to surrender. Defense lawyers have been advised, if they are aware an indictment and arrest is imminent, to announce to the media that their client will surrender {{at a particular time}} in the near future, making a subsequent arrest and perp walk seem gratuitous.|$|E
