Version: FinalThe Maltese development pattern is influenced by the typical features of small island states: scarce natural resources, high density of population, lack of critical mass in infrastructure investment, high external dependency etc. These features have an impact on transport, the environment and the sustainability of tourism and make it necessary to strengthen the Island’s knowledge-based economy in order to promote competitiveness. EU Cohesion Policy contributes considerably to tackling these issues through support from the <b>ERDF</b> and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Fund,</b> while the Island participates in cross-border, trans-national and interregional cooperation programmes. The priorities of these programmes are highly complementary and consistent with the key development challenges: the support is concentrated mainly on sustainable development and environmental protection, (e. g. waste management and water treatment plants), knowledge and innovation as well as transport. Malta has been allocated EUR 728 million of <b>ERDF</b> and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Fund</b> for the 2007 - 2013 period. Environment-related investment represents a key priority and accounts for 38 % of the total allocation; 25 % of the total ERDF has been allocated to accessibility and transport; around 22 % has been allotted to territorial development and 13 % to support enterprise environment. The overall commitment rate as at end 2009 amounted to around 50 % of total funding allocated and during 2009 there were 229 projects (including aid schemes) being implemented. In 2009 the Programme started producing its first outputs and results on the ground: first signs of construction of infrastructure; equipment being procured and s mobilisation of much needed support for enterprises. The recent economic crisis did not change the strategy and the objectives of the OP, which are arguably well suited for fostering the upturn in the economy, thanks to the focus on transport infrastructure, environment, energy territorial development (including tourism) and enterprise support. To boost investment in enterprises and mitigate the consequences of the crisis, in some cases, the allocation of the funds was diverted from public infrastructure to private sector support (e. g. EUR 12 million were allocated to a number of aid schemes for firms, focusing on e-business development, R&D, international competitiveness, innovation and energy). Evidence on performance of intervention is limited and it is too early to identify examples of good practice. The Mid-Term Evaluation of the ERDF OP is currently being carried out and some results can be expected by the end of the year. The ex ante evaluation of the OP, carried out initially, is mostly an analysis of the coherence of the strategy and did not attempt to assess the potential effects of the programme. An analysis of the effectiveness of projects co-financed by the Structural Funds in 2004 - 2006 examined the achievements of a sample of 13 initiatives, focusing mainly on recommendations for the future in terms of monitoring and collection of data. Some of the main future challenges facing EU Cohesion Policy include: continue to tackle the lack of innovation and entrepreneurial culture and increase the capacity of Malta to generate research and apply new technologies; increase awareness of environmental problems among people and implement larger projects with a significant impact on environmental protection; develop an evaluation culture to systematically assess the performance of policy; improve cooperation between administrative bodiesN/...|$|R

Version: FinalMalta is the smallest of the EU member states both by population as well as geographic size. This characteristic is one that has influenced a number of aspects of Cohesion Policy in the country. Firstly, the whole Maltese archipelago is considered as one region at NUTS I and II levels. Second, at a local level, regional policy is limited with most national policy documents addressing the entire country, noting however the specific characteristics of the island of Gozo. The smallness of the economy results in the country being greatly exposed to external shocks, not least the recent economic recession. Although this is true, over the past decade Malta has built up its resilience against these shocks by diversifying its economic structure and shifting from traditional manufacturing activities to more lucrative, higher value added manufacturing and services activities that has helped to wither the economic storm. As a result, the deterioration in economic growth and public finances was contained in comparison to the EU average. Malta’s strategy for Cohesion Policy is presented in its National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2007 - 2013 with projects outlined in two operational programmes. Malta has been allocated EUR 728. 1 million under OP I (European Regional Development <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERDF)</b> and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Fund)</b> with total funds amounting to EUR 856. 6 million when including the Malta funds under co-financing. Around 38 % of funds have been allocated to environment and energy, 25 % to transport, 22 % to territorial development and 13 % to enterprise environment. Although changes to the financial allocation have occurred across measures within priority axis, no changes in allocation have taken place by priority axis over the past year, thereby leaving the overall strategy adopted by the local authorities broadly unchangedN/...|$|R

Malta introduced the first renewable energy scheme in 2006, which promoted the use of Photovoltaic technology on a small scale. Most of the funding available was directed at improving the energy efficiency of appliances and housing. In 2010, the focus has moved on towards larger support for the preferred choice in renewable energy technology, namely photovoltaics, as Malta struggles to work towards achieving its 2020 renewable energy targets. There has been a relatively strong reliance on solar energy, with a very small attempt to introduce wind turbines, the use of biofuels in industry and no use of geothermal energy. While the expectation was that wind energy would play a major part in the national landscape of renewables, technological and regulatory hurdles faced resulted in this technology not featuring on any substantial scale in the residential sector the industrial sector in Malta. The policy in Malta is reflective of EU policy, and justification for intervention in the provision of renewable energy is strong. The implementation of such policy, however, is still in its infancy. Malta obtains <b>ERDF</b> and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>funds</b> under the Convergence Objective, under which it can obtain a maximum EU co-financing rate of 85 % of the total eligible cost of projects. This is complemented by national co-financing. Regional differences in such support exist between the two larger islands, Malta (Main Island) and Gozo. However, this is not specific to renewable energy projects but pertains to interventions in general, as the country had at one point committed 10 % of EU funding to the island of Gozo. Moreover, Gozo is designated to become an Eco-Island over the next years, with a specific budget line out of national resources devoted specifically to this purpose, which may impact upon rates of support applicable to renewable energy projects in the Island Region. Real estate market differentiation for energy efficient housing is almost non-existent, with very few signs of any references to this in the property marketN/...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{debt crisis}} in several European {{countries}} has triggered a debate concerning the government debt sustainability and management.

However, to perform proper evaluation and use modern methods it is necessary to have a robust and complex database which allows researchers and policy makers to utilize modern data-demanding methods. Although there are many data sources in the Czech Republic there is no single complex database covering all cohesion expenditure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} the European Union {{regional}} policy on growth and convergence of productivity.

On average, EU funding had a positive, but concave, effect on productivity growth. However, by separately considering the three programming periods and the composition of the funds according to the objectives defined by the EU, we find that: i) only the funds allocated in the third programming period, when they remarkably increased, had a significant impact; and ii) only Objective 1 and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>funds</b> played a significantly positive effect, while funds devoted to Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 had a non significant or small effect. These results indicate that funding became effective when it reached a critical level, and that the funds allocated to Objectives different from Objective 1 and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> may hinder the efficient reallocation of resources across sectors i...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the reform}} of the Cohesion Policy in 2014 - 2020, two key {{objectives}} and 11 thematic objectives were set. These objectives are allocated to the European Structural and <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Funds</b> (ESCF). SCFs {{are part of the}} European Structural and Investment Fund (FSIE) which includes 5 funds, namely: The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social <b>Fund</b> (ESF), the <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Fund</b> (CF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European Fund for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs (FEPAM).. The reform of access to European funds is regulated by a new regulation, namely the Regulation of the Common Provisions (RCP) no. 1303 / 2013. The new regulation contains two types of regulations, regulations common to the five Funds (FSFE), but also specific rules for each fund. Initially, the two types of regulations seem to create confusion, but art. 66 of the RCP specifies that FSIE is used to provide support in the form of grants, prizes, reimbursable assistance, financial instruments or a combination of these. In the RDC, it is stipulated that operational programs benefiting from contributions from the <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Fund</b> are drawn up at national level, which did not exist during the 2007 - 2013 programming period.
