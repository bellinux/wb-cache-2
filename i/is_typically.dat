5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons <b>is</b> <b>typically</b> in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials.

5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} <b>is</b> <b>typically</b> {{caused by}} the use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs.

5000|$|The unit {{controllers}} {{typically have}} analog and digital inputs, that allow {{measurement of the}} variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and analog and digital outputs {{for control of the}} medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices.
