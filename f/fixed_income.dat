5|$|John P. Costas, {{a former}} bond trader and co-head of <b>Fixed</b> <b>income</b> at Credit Suisse First Boston {{and head of}} <b>Fixed</b> <b>Income</b> Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of investment banks, in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E

5|$|Railways reached Lincoln in August 1848, 15 {{years after}} the first proposal. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway hoped to build {{railways}} in the area, and negotiated with the proprietors and those of the Fosdyke. Under the arrangement, they would take over both navigations, and guarantee a <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> for the proprietors. They would then merge with the London and York Railway. Both proposals had been absorbed into the Great Northern Railway (GNR) by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained, but the original agreement was retained, and the GNR leased the Witham for 999 years for a payment of £10,545 per year to the proprietors. This figure represented the average profits for the previous three years, plus five per cent. The railway company also agreed to pay the interest on mortgages amounting to £24,692 which the proprietors held, but had redeemed them by 1857. The railway from Lincoln to Boston ran along the eastern bank of the river, and opened on 17 October 1848.|$|E

5000|$|The {{distribution}} system became more unequal as price controls on necessities were removed fuelling {{the growth of}} poverty among people on <b>fixed</b> <b>incomes</b> such as pensioners and the unemployed.

50|$|A {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} existing owners are reassessed as well as new owners and thus are required to pay taxes on property the value of which is determined by market forces, such as gentrification in low income areas of a city.

Without affordable, age-friendly housing and access to services, aging {{in community}} can be stressful, isolating, and limiting, rather than empowering...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the time}} of the Black-Scholes model {{published}} in 1973, the research about mathematical finance models has never stopped. The original Black-Scholes model is for stock and stock derivatives pricing. However, stock derivatives is not the only kind of financial instrument in the market. <b>Fix</b> <b>income</b> derivatives also plays a very important role in the financial market, appealing to many researchers to explore more about their pricing model. The fundamental theory of Black-Scholes is still employed in the pricing model for <b>fix</b> <b>income</b> derivatives, but there is something else making the research even more complicate: the definition function for the risk neutral interest rate. Like the stock price, part of the risk neutral interest rate also follows Brownian Motion, but still keeps certain term structure as the basic property of interest rate. There are many famous models in history to determine the risk neutral interest rate, but they have some disadvantages in estimating the spot interest rate. In this paper, we will use the historical data to build a spot neutral interest rate estimation model that can give us more accurate information about the imbalance of the <b>fix</b> <b>income</b> derivative prices. In this research, we use the yield to maturity of the Treasury bonds as our target, and collect the 10 years data of all kinds of Treasury bonds from Jan 3 rd, 1994 to Dec 31 st. Then we take part of the data which comes from a period when the economy was relatively stable to conduct the data analysis. Then we notice that the change of the interest rate has the shape of its graph asthe intersection of two parabolas with opposite directions. Based on this discovery, we build our model and test it with the other part of data from our collection, and our model turns to work well. To verify the accuracy of the model, we use the built-in model in MATLAB which is based on the similar theory of ours to do a model comparison. The result of the comparison shows that our model works better than the model in MATLAB. The spot interest rate estimation model in this research gives a new way to describe the properties of interest rate, and also give a more accurate estimation about the future interest rate. The bond, or <b>fix</b> <b>income</b> derivative, pricing model based on this interest rate model should be able to help investors to make better decisions from a new point of view...|$|R

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that older Californians with <b>fixed</b> <b>incomes</b> had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising {{as a result of}} California's population growth, increasing housing demand, and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An academic study found support for this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting a tax increase were more likely to vote for Proposition 13.|$|R
