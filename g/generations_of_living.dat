5000|$|In al-Andalus, Muwallad {{referred}} to the offspring of non-Arab/Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion. Notable examples of this category include the famous Muslim scholar Ibn Hazm. According to Lisan al-Arab, {{one of the earliest}} Arab dictionaries (c. 13th century AD), applied the term to the children of Non-Muslim (often Christian) slaves, or Non-Muslim children who were captured in a war and were raised by Muslims to follow their religion and culture. Thus, in this context, the term [...] "Muwalad" [...] has a meaning close to [...] "the adopted". According to the same source, the term does not denote being of mixed-race but rather being of foreign-blood and local culture.|$|E
50|$|After {{thousands}} of <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> without sunlight, the Morlocks have dull grey-to-white skin, chinless faces, large greyish-red {{eyes with a}} capacity for reflecting light, and flaxen hair {{on the head and}} back. They are smaller than humans (presumably of the same height as the Eloi). Like the Eloi, they are significantly weaker than the average human (the Time Traveller hurt or killed some barehandedly with relative ease), but a large swarm of them can be a serious threat for a single man, especially unarmed and/or with no portable light source. Their sensitivity to light usually prevents them from attacking during the day. The Morlocks and the Eloi have something of a symbiotic relationship: the Eloi are clothed and fed by the Morlocks, and in return, the Morlocks eat the Eloi. The Time Traveler perceives this, and suggests that the Eloi-Morlock relationship developed from a class distinction present in his own time: the Morlocks are the working class who had to work underground so that the rich upper class could live in luxury. With time, the balance of power changed - the surface people no longer dominating the underground dwellers but on the contrary, becoming their livestock.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Syro-Lebanese" [...] or [...] "Syrian-Lebanese" [...] is an {{umbrella}} term {{to identify the}} people of the Levant, especially the generations who lived when most of the region was known as Bilad al-Sham, or Greater Syria. Between the late 18th century and early 20th century, thousands of Levantines left their homeland, mainly due to warfare, and Egypt became the first stop for many who aimed to reach the Western world. In Egypt, as well as other nations with Syrian and Lebanese diaspora communities, the Levantines mainly identified by religion and city of origin, rather than by ethnicity. For example, one could identify as a [...] "Greek Catholic from Zahle", while another could identify as [...] "Greek Orthodox from Aleppo". For the most part, religious denomination and city of origin were more important to the Levantines than an actual [...] "Levantine" [...] or [...] "Syro-Lebanese" [...] identity. This may explain why it was generally easy for the Syro-Lebanese to assimilate into their newly found homelands, especially Egypt. However, the Egyptians, and especially the Copts, could easily point out a Levantine's non-native background due to their foreign Christian background, if not by their overall lighter skin tone. After <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> in Egypt, most of this community's descendants, now with Egyptian nationality, tended to identify more as [...] "Egyptian", rather than [...] "Levantine", [...] "Syrian", or [...] "Lebanese", while still maintaining their original Christian sect of identity. However, intermarriage for the Levantines in Egypt eventually became more common after generations, either with native Copts or with other foreign Christians such as Greeks, Armenians, and Maltese. There was much less intermarriage between Levantine Christians and native Muslims, as marriage between Christians and Muslims is still considered taboo in Egypt.|$|E

40|$|Evolution {{of living}} organisms depends on {{information}} being passed {{from generation to}} generation. Without information transfer between <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> organisms, evolution that we observe on Earth would not be possible. In other words, the ability of living organisms to pass information {{from generation to generation}} is a necessary condition for evolution to take place. Now let’s consider the necessary condition for information to exist. Information cannot exist without being encoded. Information encoding cannot be random, because randomly encoded information would not be retrievable. Encoding needs to be intelligent, systematic, coherent and durable. So, the necessary condition for information to exist is its coherent encoding. On the basis of the two necessary conditions defined above we can state with certainty, that the necessary condition for evolution to take place is existence of coherent information encoding. Since we determined that evolution is impossible without information, the information encoding had to exist prior to the onset of any evolution, not just o...|$|E

40|$|Indigenous {{knowledge}} (IK) can be {{broadly defined}} as the knowledge that an indigenous community accumulates over <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> in a particular environment whose scientific validity is not proven. ITKs could very well provide a panacea in building the technology gap required for the sustenance of the fisheries sector. There are numerous ITKs which is available in fisheries sector whose knowledge components still remain localized and yet to be disseminated across different locations. In this connection a research study was done among 60 randomly selected fisher households in Vypeen island of Ernakulam district using a pre structured interview schedule. The study analyzed the different ITKs available in capture fisheries like identification of fishing ground, time of fishing, weather prediction, fish shoals, determination of depth of water, birds {{as an indicator of}} shoals and usage of sinkers and floats. There is innate fear of ITKs disappearing in the future on account of capital intensification in fishing and improved technologies in fish aggregating among the traditional fishermen. These treasure houses of knowledge which are based on the practical experience of indigenous people needs to be documented and validated for the sustainable development of the fisheries sector for the future...|$|E
40|$|Until now the Late Neolithic {{period of}} Northern Syria (c. 6900 to 5300 BC) has {{remained}} {{somewhat of an}} enigma, {{despite the fact that}} it is acknowledged as one of the most important stages of history in the Near East. It is a period that shows a vast amount of regional differentiation in terms of site types, chronologies, material culture and subsistence patterns, yet it is period for which there are pitifully few comprehensively excavated, analysed and published sites. It is this intriguing period of human history that forms the basis of this research, with the site of Tell Sabi Abyad in the Balikh Valley of the northern Syrian dessert steppe forming the central focus. This impressive site has revealed over 1000 years of seemingly uninterrupted occupation, the excavation of which has unveiled a wealth of finds giving an insight into life some 8000 years ago. One of the most numerous finds is the faunal material; thousands upon thousands of animal bone fragments being all that is left of generations of hunting and farming at and around the site. This book is the result of the research undertaken on this material by Anna Russell for her PhD thesis at Leiden University. The analysis of these remains has given important and new insights into hunting and farming practices over a millennium. The local spectrum of wild and domestic fauna in the area is discussed together with an assessment of the domestication status of some of the key domestic animals through time – sheep, goats, cattle and pigs - with the methods of herding implemented being carefully elucidated from the zooarchaeology data together with an isotopic study of diet. The relationship between the animals and their natural environment and the possible implications of an abrupt climate change (the ‘ 8. 2 k BP Event’ which peaked c. 6200 BC) on the subsistence patterns of the late Neolithic people of Tell Sabi Abyad are also considered in detail. This comprehensive zooarchaeological study of the faunal remains, uncovered during the excavations of Tell Sabi Abyad, has not only shown the gradual development of animal husbandry to the detriment to hunting throughout the seventh millennium BC, but has also revealed for the first time one of the earliest uses of domestic animals for secondary products, such as milk and fibre. It has also uncovered evidence that people adapted to changes in their local environment brought about by climate change through local innovation and promotion of cultural adaptations developed as a result of <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> in a marginal environment. As such this research brings us one step closer to filling the void in our knowledge of this pivotal period at the end of the Neolithic period.
