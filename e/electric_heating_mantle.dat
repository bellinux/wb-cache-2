40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{reduction}} of sulphur compounds in crude tyre pyrolysis oil through gas-phase adsorption over molecular sieve. Crude tyre pyrolysis oil was distilled at 300 ° C using a bench scale distillation set-up consisting of an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>mantle,</b> glass round bottom flask and water cooled glass condenser. The glass condenser bulb was filled with steel wool and molecular sieve pellets for effective oxidation and adsorption of sulphur compounds in the vapours prior to condensation. It was observed that gas-phase adsorption improves total sulphur capture by 19. 6 %. Reduction in sharp pungent smell of the condensed distilled light fractions is justified by 21. 7 % total sulphur removal of low boiling point mercaptans and sulphides during moisture removal stage. High boiling point and large molecular size sulphur compounds in the distilled fractions can be further reduced by 3. 6 % using liquid phase adsorption over activated carbon black...|$|E
40|$|This {{graduation}} thesisdescribes {{the research}} focused on application of microwave irradiation to synthesis of unsaturated polyesters. The {{idea of using}} microwaves for process intensification is that the direct heating of the reactants with microwaves can lead to fast and homogeneous heating to reduces the energy consumption and give each molecule the same processing experience. Two poly-esterification reaction systems were studied: first was maleic- and phthalic anhydrides with propylene glycol, and second maleic anhydride with hexamethylene glycol. Experiments were conducted in different microwave applicators, as CEM Discover, CEM MARS and Sairem INTL, {{as well as with}} conventional heating (oil bath and with an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>mantle).</b> The hypothesis was that microwaves can accelerate reaction rates, increase conversion, improve the end product quality and quantity and save energy. Conversion, reaction time, molecular weight and polymer structure, and the quantity of by-products (i. e. water) obtained from different microwave applicatorswere compared with conventional heating. Comparison of power consumption of microwave reactor systems with two different types of applicators, multimode cavity and internal transmission line technology, to conventionally heated reactor was made and presented. Different reaction vessel sizes (1 and 2 liters) were used to investigate whether this can improve the removal of the by-product. The reaction was performed under nitrogen atmosphere or under vacuum at the time when water is produced in order to increase water removal. Different catalysts were tested to discover which catalyst has the best influence on the reaction, and to see, specifically, the difference in performance between microwave heating and conventional heating. Forced cooling of the reactor vessel was used so higher power levels could be applied without increasing the bulk temperature in the reactor. Silicon carbide cylinders were used to increase locally the temperature and to use the mixture as a heat sink. IRSProcess and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
30|$|The {{synthetic}} {{procedure for}} this step was a duplicate of the synthesis previously published by Kjonaas et al. [14]. A solution of 1 -chloro- 1 -(4 -isobutylphenyl)ethane (0.25  mL), magnesium (0.510  g), THF (10.00  mL), and 1, 2 -dibromoethane (4 drops) {{was placed in}} a dry 50 -mL round bottom flask. The flask was heat using an <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> <b>mantle.</b> To ensure that the reaction stayed moisture free, a drying tube filled with calcium chloride was attached {{to the top of the}} condenser. The solution was allowed to heat at reflux temperature (65  °C) for 30  min once there was evidence that the Grignard formation had begun (large amount of foaming present). After 30  min of reflux, heat was removed and the solution was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Carbon dioxide was bubbled into the reaction mixture for a period of 15  min. This solution was then decanted into a separatory funnel and washed with diethyl ether. The solution was then washed with 10  % HCl (8.00  mL) and mixed for a period of 5  minutes. The aqueous phase was then extracted using diethyl ether and combined with the organic phase. This new organic phase was then washed with 5  % NaOH solution. The aqueous layer from this wash was acidified using 10  % HCl until the solution was acidic to litmus. The aqueous layer was washed with diethyl ether to extract the product.

50|$|A <b>heating</b> <b>mantle,</b> or isomantle, is a {{piece of}} {{laboratory}} equipment used to apply heat to containers, as an alternative to other forms of heated bath. In contrast to other heating devices, such as hotplates or Bunsen burners, glassware containers may be placed in direct contact with the <b>heating</b> <b>mantle</b> without substantially increasing the risk of the glassware shattering, because the heating element of a <b>heating</b> <b>mantle</b> is insulated from the container so as to prevent excessive temperature gradients. <b>Heating</b> <b>mantles</b> may have various forms. In a common arrangement, electric wires are embedded within a strip of fabric that can be wrapped around a flask. The current supplied to the device, and hence the temperature achieved, is regulated by a rheostat. This type of <b>heating</b> <b>mantle</b> is quite useful for maintaining an intended temperature within a separatory funnel, for example, after the contents of a reaction have been removed from a primary heat source.|$|R
