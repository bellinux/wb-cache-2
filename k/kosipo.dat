40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanical}} properties of laminated window profiles manufactured using {{two types of}} adhesives were determined. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effects of heat treatment on some {{mechanical properties}} of laminated window profiles that manufactured from <b>Kosipo</b> (Entandrophragma candollei Harms.) using differenet type adhesives. Commercially produced polyurethane based Macroplast UR 7221 and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive were used for experiments. The overall test results were found to be comparable to those obtained in the previous studies. Both types of adhesives resulted in significant differences in their strength characteristics at 95 % confidence level. Adhesive UR 7221 improved the overall properties of the samples in contrast to PVAc...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of wood production, and {{particularly}} of diameter increment of trees, {{is central to}} forest management. This {{is one of the}} parameters contributing to determination of the length of the felling cycle as well as the maximum allowable cut without impoverishment of forest stands. Two techniques can be used to assess diameter increment of trees: analysis of growth rings and periodical measurements of circumference over a given period. The results obtained with several designs, in which trees have been periodically measured for more than ten years (Mopi, Irobo and La Téné in Cote de Ivoire, Mbaiki in Central African Republic and Oyane in Gabon), provide increments for each species. In the same way, several growth ring counts were carried out for species with visible annual growth rings, especially in Cameroon, Central African Republic and Gabon. This report describes the methodology used for growth ring analysis, the application of such analysis for each tree species, as well as a synthesis of the results obtained for the main species exploited in Central and West Africa. The following species are included: Ayous/Samba (Triplochiton sideroxylon), Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), Limba/Fraké (Terminalia superba), Sipo (Entandrophragma utile), Tali (Erythrophleum ivorense), Tiama (Entandrophragma angolensis), <b>Kosipo</b> (Entandrophragma candollei), Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) and Moabi (Baillonella toxisperma). It appears that the mean diameter increment of Meliaceae (Sapelli, Sipo, <b>Kosipo</b> and Tiama - Entandrophragma spp.) and Iroko (Milicia excelsa) is 4 - 5 mm/year. The increment is 2 - 3 mm/year for slow-growing species, such as Bossé clair (Guarea cedrata) and Kotibé (Nesogordonia papaverifera), while mean annual increment of Okoumé (Aucoumea klaineana) is slightly under 10 mm/year for trees with diameters from 20 to 100 cm...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of a study on the growth of 17 timber species that are {{commonly}} logged in African rainforest areas: aningre (Aningeria altissima), obeche (Triplochiton scleroxylon), bosse clair (Guarea cedrata), dabema (Piptadeniastrum africanum), dibetou (Lovoa trichilioides), iroko (Milicia excelsa), <b>kosipo</b> (Entandrophragma candollei), kotibe (Nesogordonia papaverifera), limba (Terminalia superba), longhi (Gambeya boukokoensis), moabi (Baillonella toxisperma), niangon (Heritiera utilis), okoume (Aucoumea klaineana), sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), sipo (Entandrophragma utile), tali (Erythrophleum ivorense) and tiama (Entandrophragma angolense). The data are compared with {{the results of}} growth ring analyses carried out in Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Gabon. The data were collected in a series of sampling trips to measure trunk girths in tree plots (Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana and Gabon). They will provide a basis for calculating rotations between potential successive logging operations within the framework of forest development projects...|$|E
