50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind U, one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradient</b> of pressure p. In addition, the Ampere force Jx Bo couples the electric current density j to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey Ohm's law. An electric polarization field E is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force Ux B. Usually, the electric conductivity tensor σ is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor Σ and a height integrated sheet current J are applied.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of environmental gradients in canyon-shaped reservoirs is influenced mainly {{by the size}} of reservoir and water retention time. The reservoir must be large and deep enough for environmental gradients to occur there. In such reservoirs vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradients</b> can be found. Presence of vertical gradients in lakes is relatively common, whereas <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradients</b> abound in deep canyon reservoirs. An example is the gradient of nutrients, the quantity of which decreases in the direction from the inflow towards the dam. Vertical abiotic gradients are the same for reservoirs and lakes. These are mainly gradients of light, heat, dissolved and oxygen. Some abiotic <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradients</b> may be present in both to reservoirs and lakes. The abiotic gradients also often affect the biotic ones. For example the gradient of nutrients affects the gradient of all organisms in the reservoir. Each species living in the reservoir prefers different type of environmental conditions, which may be given by a combination of these gradients. The areas preferred by particular cladoceran species can overlap quite extensively. In the Daphnia longispina species complex, co-{{occurrence of}} parental species may result in interspecific hybridization, and possibly formation of hybrid zones. The hybrids can often [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermal wind}} equations, {{in which the}} Coriolis force is {{balanced}} by pressure <b>gradients</b> and <b>horizontal</b> density <b>gradients</b> rather than by Lorentz forces, are used to describe patterns of magnetic field drift associated with core fluid motions near the core-mantle boundary (CMB). The advection of magnetic field may be {{due in part to}} the flow driven by such <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>gradients,</b> just as East-West air flow is driven by North-South temperature gradients in the Earth's atmosphere. It is argued that this flow may be concentrated in a shell near the CMB, and the <b>horizontal</b> temperature <b>gradients</b> are expected to be directly proportional to <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradients</b> in CMB topography, the lowest harmonics of which are approximately constrained in seismology.

In this paper, the positioning improvement in differential GPS (DGPS) by mitigating the ionospheric <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradient</b> has been shown.
