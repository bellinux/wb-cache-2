5|$|Brian Tierney is {{the fourth}} of five sons of James and Claire Tierney. Growing up in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, he {{attended}} Waldron Mercy Academy and later The Episcopal Academy. When he was seven, {{his family moved to}} Springfield Township, Pennsylvania. In 1975, at the age of eighteen, Tierney unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for township commissioner of Springfield. During the campaign supporters of his opponent in the Democratic primary had torn down his campaign posters and stole other campaign items. Tierney became a Republican after the primary when a few Republicans who said they would look out for <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> during his primary campaign, invited him to a party meeting.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} Ricketts did on sardines was {{a seminal}} application of ecology to fisheries science, {{but it was}} not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: “That’s probably {{due to the fact that}} <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> isn’t widely available... This is strange, but fisheries scientists so far as they are trained do extraordinarily little ecology... I will not publish a paper on pelagics without now mentioning Ricketts”.|$|E

On {{one end of the}} line dangled the Tin Woodman, hung by the neck, and on the other dangled the Scarecrow, hung by the waist and clinging fast to the spare anchor of the boat, which he had seized hoping to save himself.|$|R
25|$|On February 7, 2013, Hill {{signed a}} minor league deal with an invite to big league spring {{training}} with the Cleveland Indians. Terry Francona, who had been Hill's manager during his time with the Red Sox, was now the manager in Cleveland and was impressed with <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> and his comeback from the injury. On March 11, the Indians purchased his contract and added him to the 40-man roster. He made the opening day roster as a relief pitcher.|$|E
25|$|The late Stephen Jay Gould {{was one of}} Knight’s most {{well-known}} fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as “Apatosaurus” because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, “Not since the Lord himself showed <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day”.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

Grohl was {{introduced}} to Pettibon by ex-Minutemen bassist Mike Watt and, after visiting his house, decided to hire him for the artwork because [...] "we had to somehow pay tribute to Pettibon as a hero, because <b>his</b> <b>stuff,</b> those images just stuck with me my whole life." [...] Grohl came up with the heart theme used in the booklet and related singles. The album was issued with two different covers, black and white. The first 575,000 units comprised a limited edition with a bonus DVD.|$|E
500|$|Questlove also {{acknowledged}} J Dilla's {{influence over the}} recording sessions for Voodoo. He said of Dilla's unique programming method during the sessions, [...] "He makes programmed stuff so real, you really can’t tell it’s programmed. He might program 128 bars, with absolutely no looping or quantizing ... When Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest first played me some of <b>his</b> <b>stuff,</b> I said, 'The drums are messed up! The time is wrong!' And when we did a song for D'Angelo's record that Lenny Kravitz was supposed to play on, Lenny said, 'I can’t play with this — there’s a discrepancy in the drum pattern.' And we’re like, 'It's supposed to be this way!' ...|$|E

Jackson recalled that Fripp [...] "set up all of <b>his</b> <b>stuff,</b> put his headphones on, and started searing away." [...] Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording.

500|$|The {{beginning}} {{opens with}} Patchy the Pirate, {{as he has}} presumably lost the [...] "Lost Episode of SpongeBob" [...] prior to the episode. After laminating that he lost the episode, he sets off to find it using a treasure map. Throughout several difficulties, he eventually finds a slightly dirty VHS tape which holds the episode. He then returns home in glee, and watches the episode. However, the tape only shows a clip of SpongeBob doing a series of walk cycles to techno music before abruptly showing the SMPTE color bars. Patchy gets angry, thinking SpongeBob betrayed him, and gets rid of his SpongeBob merchandise, including his SpongeBob underwear, which results in him running away. The real episode then begins to start playing, and Patchy returns, fixes all of <b>his</b> <b>stuff,</b> then enjoys the episode.|$|E

Ramsbottom added, [...] "Tom {{took a lot of}} chances. He took a lot of it [...] I remember him taking a course of strychnine to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days." [...] although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel. Simpson explained to him: [...] "That's my year's supply of Micky Finns'. That lot cost me £800." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such as myself who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of <b>his</b> <b>stuff,</b> not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, Love {{appeared}} in 20 {{games for the}} Yankees, all but one as a relief pitcher, and compiled a 2–0 record with a 4.91 ERA.

At {{the end of the}} 1916 season, Sporting Life reported on Love's lack of control:"Bill Donovan has hopes that Slim Love will win a regular place on the New Yorks' pitching staff next season. Love simply lacks confidence in his own great ability. In batting practice when he puts <b>his</b> <b>stuff</b> on the ball, Love usually has the New York hitters helpless. At such times his control is exceptional. When sent into a game wildness, as a rule, forces him to let up on <b>his</b> <b>stuff,</b> and his batting practice speed and curves are missing." ...|$|E
