5|$|In a 2002 {{review in}} The New York Times, film critic Dave Kehr compares the film with Stella Dallas (1937) for the {{thematic}} similarity {{of the series}} of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic Mark Cousins and author Tejaswini Ganti agree that the film is the <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> of Indian cinema.|$|E
5|$|Across all releases, it is {{estimated}} that <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> has sold over 200 million tickets in the United States and Canada, and 35 million tickets in the United Kingdom, generating more theater admissions in those territories than any other film. In total, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> has grossed over $390 million globally at the box office; in 2007 Turner Entertainment estimated the gross to be equivalent to approximately $3.3 billion when adjusted for inflation to current prices, while Guinness World Records arrived at a figure of $3.44 billion in 2014, making it the most successful film in cinema history.|$|E
5000|$|A poem by Tang Dynasty poet Meng Jiao called The Stone Bridge of Lanke Mountain {{referenced}} the legend: [...] "The path {{on which}} the wood chopper returned / the rotten axe handle <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> / only <b>the</b> stone bridge remains / to ride above the red rainbow ...|$|R

50|$|The {{boat that}} they rode on <b>went</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> {{and landed on}} an eerie island. There, they {{encountered}} and oni, and the oni swallowed Issun Bōshi whole. However, Issun Bōshi took advantage of his small body and {{went out of the}} oni's body from the eye. This repeated several times until the oni was completely fed up and left, leaving the tap-conjure mallet behind.|$|R
5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> set {{a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> {{was pulled}} from the {{schedule}} at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee after a 34-year run of annual showings due to its perceived racially insensitive content.|$|E
5|$|In retirement, deHavilland has {{remained}} {{active in the}} film community. In 1998, she traveled to New York to help promote a special showing of <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> In 2003, she appeared as a presenter at the 75th Academy Awards. In 2004, Turner Classic Movies produced a retrospective piece called Melanie Remembers {{in which she was}} interviewed for the 65th anniversary of the original release of <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> In June 2006, she made appearances at tributes commemorating her 90th birthday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{included}} in the 2000 edition is a quote from Helen's last published book, Teacher (1955). In it she speaks of her undimmed enthusiasm for Swedenborg's teachings. She does this by first quoting the American poet, Walt Whitman who wrote: [...] "O Spirit, as a runner strips/ Upon a windy afternoon/ Be unencumbered of what troubles you--/ Arise with grace / And greatly <b>go,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> upon your face." ...|$|R

A dove directed him to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and by following it, he reached the witch's tower and asked {{the way to the}} castle of Come-and-never-go. The witch {{tried to get him to}} stay the night, but when he refused, demanded a jug of the many-colored waters, or she would turn him into a lizard. She then directed a dog to lead him to the water.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Margaret Mitchell's novel <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind,</b> first published in 1936, the fictional character Rhett Butler warns a group of upper-class secessionists of the folly of war with the North in terms very reminiscent of those Sherman directed to David F. Boyd before leaving Louisiana. Sherman's invasion of Georgia later plays {{a central role in}} the plot of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the highly}} {{successful}} releases of <b>Gone</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> and Rebecca, Selznick began a three-year liquidation of Selznick International Pictures {{in order to}} draw profits {{for himself and his}} outside investors. He developed and sold film projects to other producers and studios, and arranged loan outs of his contracted artists. Without outside backers he formed David O. Selznick Productions, Inc., which in 1941 became owner of one-fourth of United Artists.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood was in {{the midst}} of a widely publicized search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's {{production}} of <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she be considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.|$|E

The tensions between ethical practice and aesthetic freedom in documentary film are particularly magnified in auto/biographical films that involve representations of family members or participants from a different cultural background to the artist, both contexts that demand a greater awareness of self and other. In this doctoral thesis I use 'auto/biographical' in its most expansive sense to signify the blurring of autobiographical stories with biographical material - the impossibility of telling the self's story without implicating others and vice-versa. Also accompanying this thesis is a booklet of poems, titles "Porous", which is held in the Victoria University Library. The related URL {{links to the}} catalogue entry for this booklet...|$|R
5|$|On television, the American Broadcasting Company aired it for {{the first}} time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. {{broadcast}} attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second highest televised movie share at the time behind <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second biggest TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{claim that}} The Big Parade {{superseded}} The Birth of a Nation as highest-grossing film, eventually {{being replaced by}} Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which in turn was quickly usurped by <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind.</b> Exact figures are not known for The Birth of a Nation, but contemporary records put its worldwide earnings at $5.2 million as of 1919. Its international release was delayed by World War I, {{and it was not}} released in many foreign territories until the 1920s; coupled with further re-releases in the United States, its $10 million earnings as reported by Variety in 1932 are consistent with the earlier figure. At this time, Variety still had The Birth of a Nation ahead of The Big Parade ($6,400,000) on distributor rentals and—if its estimate is correct—Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ($8,500,000) would not have earned enough on its first theatrical run to take the record; although {{it would have been the}} highest-grossing 'talkie', displacing The Singing Fool ($5,900,000). Although received wisdom holds that it is unlikely The Birth of a Nation was ever overtaken by a silent-era film, the record would fall to 1925's Ben-Hur ($9,386,000) if The Birth of a Nation earned significantly less than its estimated gross. In addition to its gross rental earnings through public exhibition, The Birth of a Nation played at a large number of private, club and organizational engagements which figures are unavailable for. It was hugely popular with the Ku Klux Klan who used it to drive recruitment, and at one point Variety estimated its total earnings to stand at around $50 million. Despite later retracting the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated. While it is generally accepted that <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release—which is true in terms of public exhibition—it is likely it did not overtake The Birth of a Nation in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s. <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> itself may have been briefly overtaken by The Ten Commandments (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide rentals of $58–60 million compared to Gone with the Winds $59 million; if it did claim the top spot its tenure there was short-lived, since <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> was re-released the following year and increased its earnings to $67 million. Depending on how accurate the estimates are, the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur may also have captured the record from Gone with the Wind: as of the end of 1961 it had earned $47 million worldwide, and by 1963 it was trailing <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> by just $2 million with international takings of $65 million, ultimately earning $66 million from its initial release.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by James Goldstone. Ernest Haller, who had won the Oscar for Best Color Cinematography on the movie <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> (1939), served as director of photography for the episode. He had been brought in out of semi-retirement at Goldstone's recommendation at the last minute, after attempts to locate a cameraman had proved problematic. Robert H.

50|$|English Narrows (Spanish Angostura Inglesa) is a {{contracted}} {{passage in}} Messier Channel {{in the southwestern}} coast of Chile.

In these narrows the tide runs 6 knots at springs.|$|R
60|$|The frigate {{was on an}} easy bow-line, or, {{to speak}} more correctly, was {{standing}} directly across our fore-foot, with her yards nearly square. In a very few minutes, each keeping her present course, the two ships would have passed within pistol-shot of each other. I scarce knew {{the nature of the}} sudden impulse which induced me to call out to the man at the wheel to starboard his helm. It was probably from instinctive apprehension that it were better for a neutral to have as little to do with a belligerent as possible, mingled with a presentiment that I might lose some of my people by impressment. Call out I certainly did, and the Dawn's bows came up to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> looking to <b>the</b> westward, or in a direction contrary to that in which the frigate was running, as her yards were square, or nearly so. As soon as the weather leeches touched, the helm was righted, and away we <b>went</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> abeam, <b>with</b> about as much breeze as we wanted for the sail we carried.|$|R
5|$|At {{least ten}} films have held {{the record of}} 'highest-grossing film' since The Birth of a Nation assumed the top spot in 1915. Both The Birth of a Nation and <b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> spent twenty-five {{consecutive}} years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg holding the record on three occasions and James Cameron—the current holder—twice. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when Jurassic Park overtook E.T., and Cameron emulated the feat when Avatar broke the record set by Titanic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gone</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> {{has been}} criticized as {{historical}} revisionism glorifying slavery, but nevertheless, it has been credited for triggering changes to the way African-Americans are depicted cinematically. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. The film is {{regarded as one of}} the greatest films of all time; it has placed in the top ten of the American Film Institute's list of top 100 American films since the list's inception in 1998, and in 1989, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.|$|E

60|$|On this, {{the first}} occasion, the whale made the water foam, half-filled the boat, {{and would have}} dragged it under, but for the vigour of the negro's arm, and the home {{character}} of the blow, which caused the fish to turn up and breathe his last, before {{he had time to}} run any great distance. The governor arrived on the spot, just as Bob had got a hawser to the whale and was ready to fill away for the South Cape channel again. The vessels passed each other cheering, and the governor admonished his friend not to carry the carcass too near the dwellings, lest it should render them uninhabitable. But Betts had his anchorage already in his eye, and away he <b>went,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> on his quarter, towing his prize at the rate of four or five knots. It may be said, here, that the Martha went into the passage, and that the whale was floated into shallow water, where sinking was out of the question, and Bob and his Kannakas, about twenty in number, went to work to peel off the blubber in a very efficient, though not in a very scientific, or artistical manner. They got the creature stripped of its jacket of fat that very night, and next morning <b>the</b> Martha appeared <b>with</b> a set of kettles, in which the blubber was tried out. Casks were also brought in the sloop, and, when the work was done, it was found that that single whale yielded one hundred and eleven barrels of oil, of which thirty-three barrels were head-matter!

Rhadine was betrothed to a tyrant of Corinth and sent to him on board the ship as <b>the</b> west <b>wind</b> was blowing; meanwhile, her brother <b>went</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same <b>wind</b> to Delphi as chief of an embassy.

40|$|Abstract. Cables, {{distributed}} with diversity spatially angle, {{are rich}} in wind direction. Circular cross sectional shape is sensitive to the Reynolds number. This paper studed the aerodynamic performance of three-dimentional stayed cable under two-dimensional flow field in Chang'an University wind tunnel by Pitot tube, electronic pressure scanning valve, data conversion and collection systems. The following conclusions are obtained: (1) The stagnation point and {{the upper and lower}} airflow separation point clockwise <b>goes</b> on <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> angle increases. Absolute value of pressure coefficient at stagnation point and separation point are biggest at 0 °wind angle. (2) The absolute value of pressure coefficient at upper and lower separation point increase <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increase of <b>wind</b> speed. (3) Pressure stagnation point,and upper and lower airflow separation point don’t changed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> parameters of helix,while pressures near helix changed irregularlly. Drag coefficient decrease <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increase of helix distance and the deduce of helix height.
