Lawry made 33 as Australia batted first and made 258, taking a 95-run lead. He then fell for 2 as Australia collapsed for 153 in the second innings to give the hosts an opening, but they won the match in just over three days by 77 runs to clinch the series 3–1, but Lawry's team left India with Australia's reputation severely dented. Perhaps {{as a result of the}} controversy, Lawry could only manage 239 runs at 34.14 for the series. On reflection, Lawry stated [...] "It was the toughest tour I've ever been on.

2500|$|Recollecting the Nez Perce {{encounter}} with the Lewis and Clark party, in 1889 anthropologist Alice Fletcher wrote that [...] "the Lewis and Clark explorers were the first white men {{that many of the}} people had ever seen and the women thought them beautiful." [...] She wrote that the Nez Perce [...] "were kind to the tired and hungry party. They furnished fresh horses and dried meat and fish with wild potatoes and other roots which were good to eat, and the refreshed white men went further on, westward, leaving their bony, wornout horses for the Indians to take care of and have fat and strong when Lewis and Clark should come back on their way home." [...] On their return trip they arrived at the Nez Perce encampment the following spring, again hungry and exhausted. [...] The tribe constructed a large tent for them and again fed them. [...] Desiring fresh red meat, the party offered an exchange for a Nez Perce horse. [...] Quoting from the Lewis and Clark diary, Fletcher writes, [...] "The hospitality of the Chiefs was offended at the idea of an exchange. He observed that his people had an abundance of young horses and that if we were disposed to use that <b>food,</b> <b>we</b> might have as many as we wanted." [...] The party stayed with the Nez Perce for a month before moving on.|$|E

And we observe that descendants of immigrants from England, Portugal, and the Middle East appear to behave differently to the other residents of Bombay and Madras. We argue that these results offer support for the Combination Modes theory, and that this theory helps us to go beyond neoclassical economics, to give a more complete understanding of household behaviour...|$|R
