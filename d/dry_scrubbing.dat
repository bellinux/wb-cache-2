50|$|A dry or {{semi-dry}} scrubbing system, {{unlike the}} wet scrubber, does not saturate the flue gas stream {{that is being}} treated with moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally {{do not have a}} stack steam plume or wastewater handling/disposal requirements. <b>Dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> systems are used to remove acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl) primarily from combustion sources.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>Scrubbing</b> is {{a common}} {{commercial}} process that has been limited to low- and medium-sulfur coal applications because high-sulfur coal requires more reagent than can be efficiently injected into the process. Babcock & Wilcox has made several advances that extend <b>dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> technologies to higher sulfur coals by allowing deposit-free operation at low scrubber exit temperatures. This not only increases the amount of reagent that can be injected into the scrubber, but also increases SO{sub 2 } removal efficiency and sorbent utilization. The objectives of this project were to demonstrate, at pilot scale, that advanced, dry-scrubbing-based technologies can attain the performance levels specified by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments for SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} emissions while burning high-sulfur coal, and that these technologies are economically competitive with wet scrubber systems. The use of these technologies by utilities in and around Ohio, on new or retrofit applications, will ensure the future of markets for high-sulfur coal by creating cost effective options to coal switching...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a laboratory-scale {{study on the}} use of recirculating cyclones as reaction chambers for <b>dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> of gaseous HCl with solid slaked lime particles. This gas cleaning system combines a numerically optimized reverse flow gas cyclone (RS_VHE geometry) with a straight-through cyclone concentrator, which simultaneously increases the capture of the solid particles and promotes their partial recirculation. A laboratory-scale study was undertaken to test this technology and to compare its performance to a modified Stairmand HE reverse flow cyclone without recirculation. The experimental conditions were: reaction temperature ≈ 326 K, gas flow rate ≈ 2. 9 x 10 - 4 Nm 3. s- 1 and relative humidity of the gas ≈ 8. 5 %. The experimental variables tested were the solids load (1. 0 - 9. 2 x 10 - 7 kg. s- 1) and HCl concentration (0. 4 - 2. 8 x 10 - 2 mol. m- 3) in the inlet gas. The experimentally obtained particulate removal efficiencies with the recirculating cyclones (≈ 98 %) were higher than those obtained with the Stairmand HE cyclone (≈ 93 %), with the additional advantage of having significantly lower pressure drop. As for the acid removal efficiencies (≈ 10 to 96 %), {{no significant differences were found}} between the two systems tested under the same experimental conditions. The possibility of using optimized recirculating cyclones for gas cleaning in a <b>dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> process is very promising, since this is a low cost technology, highly efficient both for the removal of acid gases and for the capture of solid particles, which has the advantage of not requiring a post-reaction de-duster.

Pure fly ash removed SO 2 in both the spray dryer and in the baghouse. An increase of humidity divided the fly ashes into two groups. The high calcium fly ash gave a considerably higher SO 2 removal than the medium and low calcium fly ashes which showed similar SO 2 removals.

40|$|Discussions/presentations {{addressing}} the emerging field of simultaneous removal of NOx in SO 2 scrubbing operations invariably relate to wet collectors. Equal or superior in gas cleaning efficiency to wet scrubbing in all respects, dry scrubbers, particularly circulating fluid bed reactors, also so function, Graf, R et al (2001). Moreover, {{in the latter}} case, downstream use of fabric filtration provides superior performance in removal of fine particulate including any generated in operation of coal reburn. Applicable process designs include the Pahlman Process, which achieves action of permanganate oxidant using byproduct steel-industry waste…as well as alternative lime-based designs: (a) in use of in-duct formed chlorine dioxide gas accomplishing “full ” preoxidation of acid gases, SO 2 and NO/NO 2, to SO 3 and N 2 O 5; (b) economical use of hydrogen peroxide to preoxidize NO in employing the NO 2 reducing, oxidation-reduction scrubbing process mode; and (c) in use of ozone, (LoTOx Process), or a high-reactivity, organic oxidant for “fully ” preoxidizing NOx to N 2 O 5.

40|$|Electron beam <b>dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is a {{technique}} for removing in a single step both nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) and sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) from the off-gas generated by utilities burning high sulfur coal. The use of pulsed electron beams may provide the most cost-effective solution {{to the implementation of}} this technique. This paper presents the results of plasma chemistry calculations to study the effect of dose rate, pulse length and pulse repetition rate on pulsed electron beam processing of NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } in flue gases. The main objective is to determine if the proposed combinations of dose rate, pulse length and pulse repetition rate would have any deleterious effect on the utilization of radicals for pollutant removal. For a dose rate of 2 x 10 {sup 5 } megarads per second and a pulse length of 30 nanoseconds, the average dose per pulse is sufficiently low to prevent any deleterious effect on process efficiency because of radical-radical recombination reactions. During each post-pulse period, the radicals are utilized in the oxidation of NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } in a timescale of around 200 microseconds; thus, with pulse frequencies of around 5 kilohertz or less, the radical concentrations remain sufficiently low to prevent any significant competition between radical-pollutant and radical-radical reactions. The main conclusion is that a pulsed electron beam reactor, operating with a dose rate of 2 x 10 {sup 5 } megarads per second, pulse length of 30 ns and pulse repetition rate of up to around 5 kHz, will have the same plasma chemistry efficiency as an electron beam reactor operating with a very low dose rate in continuous mode...|$|E

40|$|The ideal {{aluminium}} smelting cell should operate {{at a fixed}} temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. Contrasting, in the long term, for mature cells the aluminium fluoride consumption is fairly accurately reflected by the soda and calcium oxide contents of the primary alumina. Therefore the poor control of aluminium fluoride concentration reflects the poor understanding {{of the causes of}} variation in aluminium fluoride concentration and molten bath mass within the cell. The aims of this thesis were to i. 	Develop {{a better understanding of how}} the dynamics of the {{aluminium smelting}} process impact process conditions  hence bath chemistry ii. 	Subsequently develop and evaluate diagnostic models that may be used to minimise the variations in chemistry in individual operating cells The key control feature to minimise adverse effects is Superheat. The ideal aluminium smelting cell should operate at a fixed temperature and superheat. However, spatial and temporal operating strategies cause changes in temperature, which usually result in variations in superheat as well. In this thesis industrial aluminium reduction cells and their material handling and <b>dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> operation were analysed in respect to their energy and material balance. A number of experiments were carried out to study the influence of process parameters and operations on the state and path function of a cell. Bath inventory measurements lead to a better understanding of the underlying process behaviour, and it was obvious that energy and mass balance cannot be controlled independently. With regard to the response of bath inventory, bath and liquidus temperature to pot operation, the following interesting phenomena were identified: -	some cells are active or inactive with respect to their response to aluminium fluoride additions -	positive and negative voltage steps cause non-proportional changes in liquidus and bath temperatures -	the liquidus temperature, bath volume and composition can respond rapidly to changes due to alumina feeding Successful application of the results and understanding developed in this research resulted in an energy requirement reduction of 1 kWh/k...|$|E
40|$|The Greenidge Multi-Pollutant Control Project was {{conducted}} {{as part of}} the U. S. Department of Energy's Power Plant Improvement Initiative to demonstrate an innovative combination of air pollution control technologies that can cost-effectively reduce emissions of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, Hg, acid gases (SO{sub 3 }, HCl, and HF), and particulate matter from smaller coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs). There are about 400 units in the United States with capacities of 50 - 300 MW that currently are not equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR), flue gas desulfurization (FGD), or mercury control systems. Many of these units, which collectively represent more than 55 GW of installed capacity, are difficult to retrofit for deep emission reductions because of space constraints and unfavorable economies of scale, making them increasingly vulnerable to retirement or fuel switching in the face of progressively more stringent environmental regulations. The Greenidge Project sought to confirm the commercial readiness of an emissions control system that is specifically designed to meet the environmental compliance requirements of these smaller coal-fired EGUs by offering a combination of deep emission reductions, low capital costs, small space requirements, applicability to high-sulfur coals, mechanical simplicity, and operational flexibility. The multi-pollutant control system includes a NO{sub x}OUT CASCADE{reg_sign} hybrid selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) /in-duct SCR system for NO{sub x} control and a Turbosorp{reg_sign} circulating fluidized bed <b>dry</b> <b>scrubbing</b> system (with a new baghouse) for SO{sub 2 }, SO{sub 3 }, HCl, HF, and particulate matter control. Mercury removal is provided as a co-benefit of the in-duct SCR, dry scrubber, and baghouse, and by injection of activated carbon upstream of the scrubber, if required. The multi-pollutant control system was installed and tested on the 107 -MW{sub e}, 1953 -vintage AES Greenidge Unit 4 by a team including CONSOL Energy Inc. as prime contractor, AES Greenidge LLC as host site owner, and Babcock Power Environmental Inc. as engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. About 44 % of the funding for the project was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy, through its National Energy Technology Laboratory, and the remaining 56 % was provided by AES Greenidge. Project goals included reducing high-load NO{sub x} emissions to {le} 0. 10 lb/mmBtu; reducing SO{sub 2 }, SO{sub 3 }, HCl, and HF emissions by at least 95 %; and reducing Hg emissions by at least 90 % while the unit fired 2 - 4 % sulfur eastern U. S. bituminous coal and co-fired up to 10 % biomass. This report details the final results from the project. The multi-pollutant control system was constructed in 2006, with a total plant cost of $ 349 /kW and a footprint of 0. 4 acre - both substantially less than would have been required to retrofit AES Greenidge Unit 4 with a conventional SCR and wet scrubber. Start-up of the multi-pollutant control system was completed in March 2007, and the performance of the system was then evaluated over an approximately 18 -month period of commercial operation. Guarantee tests conducted in March-June 2007 demonstrated attainment of all of the emission reduction goals listed above. Additional tests completed throughout the performance evaluation period showed 96 % SO{sub 2 } removal, 98 % mercury removal (with no activated carbon injection), 95 % SO{sub 3 } removal, and 97 % HCl removal during longer-term operation. Greater than 95 % SO{sub 2 } removal efficiency was observed even when the unit fired high-sulfur coals containing up to 4. 8 lb SO{sub 2 }/mmBtu. Particulate matter emissions were reduced by more than 98 % relative to the emission rate observed prior to installation of the technology. The performance of the hybrid SNCR/SCR system was affected by problems with large particle ash, ammonia slip, and nonideal combustion characteristics, and high-load NO{sub x} emissions averaged 0. 14 lb/mmBtu during long-term operation. Nevertheless, the system has reduced the unit's overall NO{sub x} emissions by 52 % on a lb/mmBtu basis. The commercial viability of the multi-pollutant control system was demonstrated at AES Greenidge Unit 4. The system, which remains in service after the conclusion of the project, has enabled the unit to satisfy its permit requirements while continuing to operate profitably.
