He was never afraid of difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he was dilligent, honest, and he had an utmost sense of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|Hogg found {{employment}} in a conveyancer's office in York. Percy Shelley initially planned to visit him, but changed his {{plans in the}} spring of 1811 after {{he fell in love with}} a young woman named Harriet Westbrook. Shelley had always been opposed to the institution of marriage, but <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> deeply for Harriet and feared she would leave him if they did not marry. Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet's best interests. Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, {{he did not believe}} in winning at any costs; he truly believed that {{the most important aspect of}} college football was the college football player. As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

5|$|Tyler was a slaveholder, at {{one point}} keeping forty slaves at Greenway. Although he {{regarded}} slavery as an evil, and {{did not attempt to}} justify it, he never freed any of his slaves. Tyler considered slavery a part of states’ rights, and therefore the federal government lacked the authority to abolish it. The living conditions of his slaves are not well documented, but historians surmise that <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> for their well-being and abstained from physical violence against them.In December 1841, Tyler was attacked by abolitionist publisher Joshua Leavitt, with the unsubstantiated allegation that Tyler had fathered several sons with his slaves, and later sold them. A number of African American families today maintain a belief in their descent from Tyler, but {{there is no evidence of}} such genealogy.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross the picket line. The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games in December to finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton the chance to be the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, a statistic he later admitted <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> about deeply.|$|E

And <b>he</b> <b>cares</b> about justice, and <b>he</b> <b>cares</b> about making sure that everybody gets a shot in life.

25|$|In late 1950 {{he began}} working as a {{secondary}} school teacher at Banbury Grammar School (now Banbury School) teaching English literature. In addition to his teaching duties he supervised sports and ran the school's drama society. He organised a number of amateur theatrical events in his spare time. These involved local people and students and included productions of T. S. Eliot's Sweeney Agonistes. Reports from his former students and colleagues indicate that <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> deeply about teaching.|$|E
25|$|While Lavoisier is {{commonly}} {{known for his}} contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated {{a significant portion of}} his fortune and work toward benefitting the public. Lavoisier was a humanitarian – <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> deeply about the people in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture, industry, and the sciences. The first instance of this occurred in 1765, when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
25|$|Pannal Church is {{the only}} one in the United Kingdom {{dedicated}} to Robert of Knaresborough (1170–1218). He was born in York, the son of Touk Flower. He was ordained subdeacon and served at Newminster Abbey for four and a half months. He returned to Knaresborough to become a hermit. His patron Juliana gave him the chapel of St Hilda at Rudfarlington. He became known as a holy man and lived in various places, including Spofforth near Pannal. <b>He</b> <b>cared</b> for the poor, and received support from King John, Sir William de Stuteville the son of Robert III de Stuteville, and his brother who became the Mayor of York.|$|E

25|$|Jambo was {{a western}} lowland gorilla born in Basel. He became a celebrity {{sensation}} at the Jersey Zoo where on August31, 1986 <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> for a 5-year-old boy who {{fell into the}} gorilla habitat. A video of the fall is on YouTube and was watched nearly 700,000 times before it was deleted in September 2009 and relisted. Two new movies of this event have been watched over 280,000 times combined (May 2010). After Jambo died in 1992, a bronze statue in his memory erected at the zoo and Gerald Durrell produced a video documentary called Jambo — the Gentle Giant. Richard Johnstone-Scott wrote the book Jambo — A Gorilla's Story.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{provided}} by Herodotus is that Leonidas sent away {{the remainder of}} his men because <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> about their safety. The King would have thought it wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus himself believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that he was closest to Perdiccas, because it was with Perdiccas that {{he went on the}} mission to take Peuceolatis and bridge the Indus. By that time, as Alexander's effective second-in-command, he could doubtless have chosen any officer <b>he</b> <b>cared</b> to name. They accomplished everything they set out to do with great success, which indicates {{that the two of them}} worked well together, and that Hephaestion found the irrepressible Perdiccas a congenial companion. It is notable that their two cavalry regiments in particular were selected by Alexander for the dangerous crossing of the river Hydaspes before the battle with the Indian king, Porus. On that occasion superb teamwork would have been of paramount importance.|$|E
