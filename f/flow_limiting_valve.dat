40|$|Although {{there is}} no single <b>flow</b> <b>limit</b> that applies to all dischargers covered by this general permit, to ensure ongoing {{compliance}} with the effluent limits and proper operation and maintenance of treatment systems, the operator should monitor and comply with two site specific flow limits: the design <b>flow</b> <b>limit</b> and the total elapsed <b>flow</b> <b>limit</b> on any treatment components. As discussed earlier in this Fact Sheet, the individual components of a wastewater treatment systems are designed and constructed within a margin of safety to allow for adequate treatment of the wastewater within certain limitations or “design flow. ” For the purposes of this RGP, the system’s “design <b>flow</b> ” <b>limit</b> is the <b>flow</b> capacity of the component or segment of the treatment train with the lowest capacity. In other words, the individual piece of equipment with the lowest design flow in the treatment system would set the design <b>flow</b> <b>limit</b> for the site. Similarly, in order to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the effluent treatment system, the operator needs to monitor total elapsed flow of the effluent. Total flow measurement is needed because many components of treatment systems have a predicted performance life measured in terms of total gallons of wastewater throughput. 4.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} feasibility, safety and {{accuracy}} of the adenosine protocol {{in the study of}} myocardial perfusion with microbubbles contrast echocardiography. METHODS: 81 pts (64 male, 60 + 11 years) were submitted to contrast echocardiography with PESDA (sonicated solution of albumin 20 %- 1 ml, dextrose 5 %- 12 ml and deca-fluorobutane gas- 8 ml) to study the myocardial perfusion at rest and after bolus injection of adenosine (6 to 18 mg) and to coronary angiography within 1 month each other. For each patient 3 left ventricle perfusion beds were considered (total of 243 territories). 208 territories were analyzed and 35 territories were excluded. PESDA was continuously infused (1 - 2 ml/min), titrated for best myocardial contrast. Triggered (1 : 1) second harmonic imaging was used. RESULTS: Coronary angiography showed 70 <b>flow</b> <b>limiting</b> (> 75 %) lesions and 138 no <b>flow</b> <b>limiting</b> lesions. At rest an obvious myocardium contrast enhancement was seen in at least 1 segment of a territory in all patients. After adenosine injection an unquestionable further increase in myocardial contrast was observed in 136 territories (99 %) related to no <b>flow</b> <b>limiting</b> lesions, lasting < 10 s, and a myocardial perfusion defect was detected in 68 territories (97 %) related to <b>flow</b> <b>limiting</b> lesions.

40|$|This paper explores an idea {{to extend}} Newton–Raphson power flow problem to handle power system {{transmission}} line <b>flow</b> <b>limits,</b> by means of generation redispatch and phase shifters.

The novelty of the approach is three step procedure (in case any limit violations exist in the system) : run ordinary power flow (and identify <b>flow</b> <b>limits</b> violated), solve a set of linear equations using extended power flow Jacobian by adding a new column and a new raw that characterize particular limit, and resolve ordinary power flow with initial solution obtained after the correction made by solution of linear equations.

40|$|Objective: Although {{computerised}} {{methods of}} analysis of respiratory system mechanics, such as the Least Squares Fitting (LSF) method, have been successfully applied in different patient populations, no conclusive data are available for COPD patients probably because they may develop expiratory flow limitation (EFL). The latter suggests the respiratory mechanics be determined only during inspiration. Setting: Eight bed multidisciplinary ICU of a teaching Hospital Patients: Eight non <b>flow</b> <b>limited</b> Post Vascular Surgery patients and eight <b>flow</b> <b>limited</b> COPD patients. Intervention: Patients were sedated, paralysed for diagnostic purposes and ventilated in volume control ventilation with constant inspiratory flow rate. Measurements: Data of resistance, compliance and dynamic intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (PEEPi,dyn) obtained by applying the LSF method during inspiration, expiration and the whole breathing cycle were compared with those obtained by the traditional method (constant flow, end-inspiratory occlusion method). Results and conclusion: Our results indicate that 1) the presence of EFL markedly decreased the precision of resistance and compliance values measured by the LSF method 2) the determination of respiratory variables during inspiration allows the calculation of respiratory mechanics in <b>flow</b> <b>limited</b> COPD patients; 3) the LSF method is able to detect the presence of PEEPi,dyn if only inspiratory data is used...|$|R

To investigate the nature of phase V, experiments using simultaneous washouts of N 2 and tracer boluses of Ar were performed on eight normal nonsmoking subjects aged 27 - 41 who exhibited a phase V.

40|$|A {{perturbation}} {{analysis is}} carried out to the second order to give effective equations for Darcy-Brinkman flow through a porous channel with slightly corrugated walls. The flow is either parallel or normal to the corrugations, and the corrugations of the two walls are either in phase or half-period out of phase. The present study {{is based on the}} assumptions that the corrugations are periodic sinusoidal waves of small amplitude, and the channel is filled with a sparse porous medium so that the flow can be described by the Darcy-Brinkman model, which approaches the Darcian or Stokes <b>flow</b> <b>limits</b> for small or large permeability of the medium. The Reynolds number is also assumed to be so low that the nonlinear inertia can be ignored. The effects of the corrugations on the flow are examined, quantitatively and qualitatively, as functions of the flow direction, the phase difference, and the wavelength of the corrugations, as well as the permeability of the channel. It is found that the corrugations will have greater effects when it is nearer the Stokes' <b>flow</b> <b>limit</b> than the Darcian <b>flow</b> <b>limit,</b> and when the wavelength is shorter. For the same wavelength and phase difference, cross flow is more affected than longitudinal flow by the corrugations.

40|$|Numerical {{solutions}} of {{the full}} Navier–Stokes equations are used to investigate the steady and unsteady deformation of a bubble in a biaxial straining flow for Reynolds numbers in the range 0 ≤R≤ 400, and Weber numbers up to O(10). The steady-state bubble shape {{and the frequency of}} small amplitude oscillations of shape are both identical for biaxial and uniaxial straining flows in the potential <b>flow</b> <b>limit.</b> However, for a large, but finite Reynolds number, the bubble shape in the biaxial straining flow is found to be fundamentally different from the shape in uniaxial flows. This is shown to be a consequence of vorticity enhancement via vortex line stretching in the biaxial flow, which does not occur in the uniaxial flow. At the highest Reynolds number considered here, R= 400, the steady-state bubble behavior for low W is qualitatively similar to the potential flow case, with a limit point for existence of the low W branch of steady solutions occurring at W~ 6. However, in this case a second branch of steady solutions is found for larger W≥ 7, which exhibits oblate bubble shapes for large W, and has no counterpart in the potential <b>flow</b> <b>limit.</b> In unsteady <b>flows,</b> the behavior of bubble deformation is fundamentally different in the uniaxial and biaxial flows for both high Reynolds numbers and the potential <b>flow</b> <b>limit.</b> This suggests that breakup will occur in far different ways in the two cases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The within-breath {{change in}} {{reactance}} (DX̄rs) measured by forced oscillation technique (FOT) at 5 Hz reliably detects expiratory flow limitation in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The present study compared {{this approach to}} the standard negative expiratory pressure (NEP) method. In total, 21 COPD patients were studied by applying both techniques to the same breath and in 15 patients the measurements were repeated after bronchodilator. For each patient and condition five NEP tests were performed and independently scored by three operators unaware of the FOT results. In 180 tests, FOT classified 53. 3 % as <b>flow</b> <b>limited.</b> On average, the operators scored 27. 6 % of tests <b>flow</b> <b>limited</b> and 47. 6 % non-flow limited, but could not score 24. 8 %. The methods disagreed in 7. 9 % of cases; in 78 % of these the NEP scores differed between operators. Bronchodilation reduced NEP and DX̄rs scores, with only the latter achieving significance. Averaging the operators 9 NEP scores, a threshold between 24. 6 – 30. 8 % of tidal volume being <b>flow</b> <b>limited</b> by NEP produced 94 % agreement between methods. In conclusion, when negative expiratory pressure and forced oscillation technique were both available they showed good agreement. As forced oscillation technique is automatic and can measure multiple breaths over long periods, it is suitable for monitoring expiratory flow limitation continuously and identifying patients 9 breathing close to the onset of expiratory flow limitation, where intermittent sampling may be unrepresentative...|$|R
