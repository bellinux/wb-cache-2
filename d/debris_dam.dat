5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the <b>debris</b> <b>dam,</b> reversing the flow of Pine Creek.

40|$|In forested, {{mountain}} landscapes where debris flows are common, their deposition commonly forms valley-spanning dams of wood, boulders, or complex {{mixtures of}} both in headwater valleys, and sediment impoundment behind these dams causes alluviation {{in what would}} otherwise be bedrock channels. In this paper, the effects of <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> {{on the evolution of}} headwater valley profiles over geologic time are examined. In the Oregon Coast Range, USA, longitudinal profiles of three headwater channels (approximately 2 sq. km maximum contributing area), two of which are nominally bedrock, and all <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> were surveyed. Channel and valley widths were measured, and surface bed material measurements (pebble counts) were taken at several locations along one stream. Cumulative relief in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> is highly variable within and among streams, reaching a maximum of 58 % of profile relief at one location. The surveyed dams comprise 9. 8 %, 19 %, and 6. 4 % of total basin relief in the three corresponding drainage basins, respectively. A model of bedrock erosion and channel profile evolution is derived that accounts for (a) fractional coverage by the channel of total valley width at any given time and (b) shielding by sediment impounded behind <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> The equation for incision rate, assumed constant, is solved for valley gradient as a function of contributing area...|$|R
50|$|Less than a {{year after}} the 1995 activity, a {{temporary}} dam was formed at about 250 m from the outlet of Lake Maughan, alarming the residents within the area due to fear of flashfloods. The deposited <b>debris</b> <b>dammed</b> the flowing Ga-o River and caused the lake level to rise by about 6 meters.|$|R

5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek <b>Debris</b> <b>Dam</b> was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E
25|$|Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly {{until about}} 20,000years ago, when the {{receding}} Laurentide Continental Glacier dammed it with rocks, soil, and other debris.

40|$|Since {{the arrival}} of humans {{approximately}} 1000 years before present (B. P.), New Zealand has lost approximately 80 % of its forest cover and along with it, the contribution of wood to our aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this thesis was to undertake a large catchment-scale assessment of LW loadings, spatial distribution and morphological influence in an old-growth indigenous forest to provide some understanding on the natural characteristics of wood {{that would have been}} present in many river systems of New Zealand prior to human settlement. The second component of the thesis involved the experimental removal of wood from three small streams in order to provide some insight into what that loss of wood may have meant for fish and aquatic invertebrate communities. In {{the first part of the}} study, a catchment scale survey of large wood (LW) was completed in a 5 thorder, old-growth forest river system. LW volumes ranged from 59 - 503 m³ ha⁻¹ and declined down the river system along with the number of LW pieces suspended across the channel and LW influence on channel morphology, whereas piece frequency, number of pieces in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> and length increased. Nearly half the pieces were influencing channel morphology, particularly wood accumulation, sediment storage, bank armouring, and pool formation. These key pieces were larger, longer and more stable than average. LW contribution to habitat complexity was highest in the middle to upper sections of the river system. Four key zones of wood distribution and influence were identified in the river system. Zonal boundaries were influenced by changes in transport capacity, fluvial processes and channel morphology. In the second part of the study, a field trial was established in three small forested streams to measure the influence of wood and its experimental removal on channel morphology, and indigenous fish and aquatic invertebrate communities. Prior to wood removal there were no significant differences in the total density of fish between wood pools (pools with wood cover), open pools and riffles. Total fish biomass was marginally significant with most of the fish biomass located in wood pools. At the species level, the density and biomass of banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus) and the weights of longfin eels (Anguilla dieffenbachii) were significantly higher in wood pools. Species richness, density and biomass of bluegill bullies (Gobiomorphus hubbsi), torrentfish (Cheimarrichthys fosteri) and the density of redfin bullies (Gobiomorphus huttoni) was highest in riffles. Differences in fish community composition were greatest between riffles and pools, whereas there was considerable overlap between the two pool types. Total invertebrate density was 70 % higher in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> than riffles prior to wood removal, but this difference was not significant. Densities of Trichoptera (caddisfly) and Plecoptera (stonefly), and five aquatic invertebrate taxa were significantly higher in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> which also contained greater numbers of less common taxa (< 1 % total catch) than riffles. Only Deleatidium sp. (Ephemeroptera) densities were significantly higher in riffles than in <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Aquatic invertebrate communities in <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> differed significantly from those in riffles and season had a significant influence on aquatic invertebrate community structure. Removal of wood and associated <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> from the treatment sections in each of the three streams resulted in a simplified channel morphology, significantly increasing the length and area in riffles and reducing the area of pools. The impact on the fish community was greatest for the two larger fish, banded kokopu and large longfin eels, whose abundance declined in the treatment sections. At the reach scale, only banded kokopu biomass showed a significant decline following wood removal. Invertebrates were less affected by wood removal and associated loss of <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Invertebrate composition in the remaining riffles in the treatment sections had a higher proportion of Ephemeroptera and lower proportions of Trichoptera, Plecoptera and Diptera with fewer rare species than remaining <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> in the control sections, but there were no discernable effects on invertebrate densities and functional feeding groups at the reach scale. Public perception of wood in waterways is mainly negative and wood is managed primarily to reduce flood damage in New Zealand’s streams. With continued research and advocacy on the environmental benefits, careful planning and judicial use, there is the potential to make better use of wood to rehabilitate and enhance New Zealand’s stream environments. This thesis provides some insight into the contribution of wood to forested stream ecosystems in New Zealand and the implicit losses associated with forest removal. It also contributes to our global understanding on the role of wood, its contribution to habitat heterogeneity and influence on biological communities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Retention of coarse {{particulate}} {{organic matter}} (CPOM) {{is essential to the}} efficient use of organic matter in streams supported by allochthonous inputs. To measure retention and to study factors affecting retention, we conducted both long-term and short-term experiments using small dowels as indices of stick retention and pieces of paper as indices of leaf retention. These experiments were done in streams at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. In general, we found that both types of CPOM were efficiently retained in all streams. Factors that affected CPOM transport and retention were storms, stream size, stream depth, and the abundance of retention structures in the streams. After initial transport, woody CPOM was transported only during storms. Retention was greater in smaller streams and in shallower stream sites. Rocks, boulders, and woody debris were the most important retention structures. In the stream draining a logged catchment, lower CPOM retention was associated with lower abundance of woody <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Key words: stream, large {{particulate organic matter}}, wood, retention, <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Streams draining forested areas have two as large particles, most export is small particles dominating characteristics: dependence on al- (e. g., Fisher and Likens 1973, Webster and Pat-lochthonous energy sources and downstream ten 1979, Webster et al. 1990, Wallace et al. 1991) ...|$|R
25|$|Mass wasting {{events such}} as the 1925 Gros Ventre {{landslide}} continue to change the area.

40|$|We {{examined}} particulate {{organic matter}} (POM) storage and retention in aquatic macrophyte beds (Sparganium americanum Nutt.) from 2, first-order, blackwater tributaries of Tinker Creek, South Carolina, USA. Measurements were made during the autumn (high litter input) and summer (low litter input), in 100 -m study reaches, 1 with low macrophyte density (T-l) and 1 with high macrophyte density (T- 2). Three experiments assessed: 1) POM retention by individual plant beds, 2) short-term retention of leaf analogs in plant beds and by other retention structures, and 3) benthic and transported POM at the reach scale. Upon completion, all above ground macrophyte biomass was removed and the experiments were repeated. At the scale of 1 bed, low plant density effectively trapped and stored POM in summer and autumn. High-density beds stored POM in the summer but during autumn POM output exceeded input. At the reach scale, both tributaries effectively retained coarse POM in summer, but only high-density beds did so in autumn. Likewise, only high-density beds trapped and retained fine POM. Following plant removal, both coarse and fine POM were transported with minimal retention. When plants were present, beds {{played a major role}} in leaf analog retention and increased the retentive capabilities of other channel structures (<b>debris</b> <b>dams,</b> overhanging vegetation). When beds were removed, most analogs were retained by <b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> or settled to the substrate. Macrophyte beds play a major role in POM retention and short-term storage in low-gradient blackwater streams at several spatial scales and are linked to retention by other channel structures.

40|$|AbstractThis paper summarises {{the results}} of the “Rhithron Ecology Group” meeting in Essen (March 2000), {{supplemented}} by a literature evaluation. An extended view of small mountain streams in Central Europe under “potentially natural conditions” is presented. We focus on the potential impact of natural transverse structures (<b>debris</b> <b>dams</b> and beaver dams) on stream morphology, hydrology, habitat composition and communities. Furthermore, impact of other stream morphological features, which are presently lacking in the Central European landscape, is described. We suggest that Central European mountain streams are characterised by a higher proportion of lentic zones under “potentially natural conditions”. Morphological degradation leads to a loss of lentic zones and to an increase of current velocities and corresponding changes in faunal composition, particularly higher abundance and proportion of rheophilic species and a decrease of species preferring lentic zones. This should be regarded in future stream assessment...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} hydraulics, {{sediment}} supply, channel condition, and riparian vegetation on stream development {{were examined in}} a chronosequence of five streams in Glacier Bay National Park. The youngest stream, Wolf Point Creek (deglaciated around 1955), is fed by a remnant glacier and had the highest suspended sediment concentrations of all streams (103 - 111 mg litre- 1 at baseflows). The study reach at Nunatak Creek (deglaciated around 1950) was actively downcutting through the fine glacial outwash deposits creating a deeper thalweg and redepositing some material near channel margins. About 100 yr after deglaciation (Ice Valley stream), woody riparian vegetation begins to stabilize streambanks and becomes established on gravel bars where it provides potential sites for incipient woody <b>debris</b> <b>dams.</b> Berg Bay South (deglaciated around 1830) appears to be near equilibrium with respect to sediment supply and transport. -from Author...|$|R
