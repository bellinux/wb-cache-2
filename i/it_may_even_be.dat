Further south it is said to be active in the evening, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> active at night during the summer months.

5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

5|$|Ununennium is {{the element}} with the {{smallest}} atomic number {{that has not yet}} been synthesized. Multiple attempts have been made by American, German, and Russian teams to synthesize this element: they have all been unsuccessful, as experimental evidence has shown that the synthesis of ununennium will likely be far more difficult than that of the previous elements, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> the penultimate element that can be synthesized with current technology. Planned attempts by Japanese and Russian teams are scheduled for 2019–2020. Its position as the seventh alkali metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, ununennium is expected to be less reactive than caesium and francium and to be closer in behavior to potassium or rubidium, and while it should show the characteristic +1 oxidation state of the alkali metals, it is also predicted to show the +3 oxidation state unknown in any other alkali metal.|$|E

25|$|There is no certain {{etymology}} for the name.

25|$|Music for {{parade and}} show bands is {{typically}} learned separately, in a concert band setting. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> memorized {{before any of}} the marching steps are learned. When rehearsing drill, positions and maneuvers are usually learned without playing the music simultaneously—a common technique for learning drill is to have members sing their parts or march to a recording produced during a music rehearsal. Many bands learn drill one picture or form at a time, and later combine these and add music.|$|E

Metro lines in Kuala Lumpur are categorized into different types: rapid transit, commuter rail and monorail.
