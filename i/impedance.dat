5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic <b>impedance</b> of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic <b>impedance.</b> This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high <b>impedance</b> line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 <b>impedance</b> transformers. The stubs {{in the body of the}} filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has <b>impedance</b> matching advantages. The <b>impedance</b> transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 <b>impedance</b> transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} k-type section, the image <b>impedance</b> of the m-type {{low-pass}} section is purely real below the cut-off frequency and purely imaginary above it.

Nevertheless, the passenger and freight demand modules are based on transportation <b>impedances</b> {{at the level of}} NUTS- 2 O/D relations. The <b>impedances</b> for the HIGH-TOOL base year 2010 are founded on ETISplus <b>impedances,</b> while the baseline’s <b>impedances</b> for the forecast years have been computed by the network-based transport model Vaclav for the infrastructure configuration underlying the EU Reference Scenario, and aligned with the <b>impedances</b> for the year 2010.|$|R

Using actual event data, captured at a solar farm, this paper aims to utilize existing assessment techniques to develop an online network harmonic <b>impedances</b> assessment model.

This technique is noninvasive and will provide an accurate estimation of the network <b>impedances</b> enabling the continuous assessment of power quality emissions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Conjugately characteristic-impedance {{transmission}} lines (CCITLs) implemented by lossless periodic transmission-line struc-tures have found various applications in microwave technology, and the T-chart {{was developed to}} perform the analysis and design of CC-ITLs effectively. Originally, the normalization factor used in defin-ing normalized <b>impedances</b> of the T-chart is the geometric mean of characteristic <b>impedances</b> of CCITLs, which is not only one possible choice. By using other normalization factors based on characteristic <b>impedances,</b> different graphical representations can be obtained; i. e., T-charts for CCITLs with passive characteristic <b>impedances</b> are not unique, and {{it depends on the}} associated normalization factor. In this study, three more possible normalization factors related to char-acteristic <b>impedances</b> of CCITLs are investigated. It is found that all T-charts for each normalization factor are strongly dependent on the argument of characteristic <b>impedances</b> of CCITLs in a complicated fashion. The original T-chart based on the geometric mean of char-acteristic <b>impedances</b> is found to be the most convenient graphical representation for solving CCITL problems...|$|R

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the <b>impedance</b> matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image <b>impedance</b> techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image <b>impedance</b> identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image <b>impedance</b> will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image <b>impedance</b> out of discrete components. The result of <b>impedance</b> mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
5|$|For {{the general}} {{case of a}} line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary <b>impedance</b> it is usual to describe the signal as a wave traveling down the line and analyse it in the frequency domain. The <b>impedance</b> is consequently represented as a frequency dependant complex function.|$|E
50|$|To be specific, if {{two or more}} <b>impedances</b> are in parallel, {{the current}} that enters the {{combination}} will be split between them in inverse proportion to their <b>impedances</b> (according to Ohm's law).

The adopted GaN HEMT device, TGF 2023 - 02 of TriQuint Semiconductor, was packaged in commercial package. The optimal <b>impedances</b> of the GaN HEMT package are extracted from load-pull simulation at package input and output reference planes.

5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex <b>impedance)</b> laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a driving point <b>impedance,</b> that is, the <b>impedance</b> that is connected to the generator. The expression for this <b>impedance</b> determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary <b>impedance</b> expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E
5|$|The plots shown {{of image}} <b>impedance,</b> {{attenuation}} and phase change are the plots of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal <b>impedance</b> R0 = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} a filter half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 farad. This prototype can be <b>impedance</b> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic <b>impedance</b> of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in <b>impedance</b> (narrower lines have higher <b>impedance).</b> A step down in <b>impedance</b> would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with <b>impedance</b> transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These <b>impedance</b> transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. <b>Impedance</b> transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

In this paper, we give {{an answer to the}} following question: What is the effect of output <b>impedances</b> on the inductivity of the power network? To address this question, we propose a measure to evaluate the inductivity of the power grid. By exploiting this measure together with the algebraic connectivity of the network topology, one can tune the output <b>impedances</b> in order to impose a desired level of inductivity on the power system.

5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of <b>impedance</b> matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the <b>impedance</b> match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

40|$|Small-signal {{stability}} {{is of great}} concern for electrical power systems {{with a large number}} of regulated power converters. In the case of dc systems, stability can be predicted by examining the locus described by the ratio of the source and load <b>impedances</b> in the complex plane per the Nyquist stability criterion. For balanced three-phase ac systems the same impedance-based method applies, for which this paper uses <b>impedances</b> in the synchronous rotating reference (d-q) frame. Small-signal stability can be determined by applying the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC). This approach relies on the actual measurement of these <b>impedances,</b> which up to now has severely hindered its applicability. Addressing this shortcoming, this paper investigates the small-signal stability of a three-phase ac system using measured d-q frame <b>impedances.</b> The results obtained show how the stability at the ac interface can be easily and readily predicted using the measured <b>impedances</b> and the GNC, thus illustrating the practicality of the approach, and validating the use of ac <b>impedances</b> as a valuable dynamic analysis tool for ac system integration, in perfect dualism with the dc case...|$|R
