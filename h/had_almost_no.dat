5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear the brunt of the attack, were weak. They <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E

5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> {{education}} apart from the Bible and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth was flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E
5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just {{run down the}} clock to ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford took to the air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two {{and a half minutes}} had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 7th century on, Klis was an {{important}} Croat stronghold, and later, one of the seats of many Croatia's rulers. In the 9th century, Croatian duke Mislav of the Duchy of Croatia, from 835 to 845, made the castle of Klis seat of his throne. Despite Frankish overlordship, the Franks <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> role in Croatia in the period from the 820s through 840s. After Mislav's death, starting with Duke Trpimir I, Klis was ruled by royal members of the House of Trpimirović, who were at first Dukes of the Croatian Duchy (dux Croatorum), and afterwards Kings of the Croatian Kingdom (rex Croatorum). They developed the early Roman stronghold into their capital. Relations with the Byzantines greatly improved under the Croatian duke Trpimir I, who moved the dux's main residence from Nin to Klis.|$|E
5|$|In the {{operation}} the 6th Airborne Division {{together with the}} 7th Armoured Division, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, formed the I Corps, attached to the First Canadian Army. When issuing his orders, Lieutenant General John Crocker, the Corps commander, aware that the 6th Airborne <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect them to advance quickly. To reach the River Seine the division would have to cross three main rivers, along only two main lines of advance. One route was in the north, running along the French coast, while the other route was further inland between Troarn and Pont Audemer.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Amiens {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed {{movement}} on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third Army with no armoured support <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> effect on the line while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. Australian commander John Monash was knighted by King George V in the days following the battle.|$|E

5|$|After {{the capture}} of Breville the {{division}} was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20June. Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20July, when the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into {{the line between the}} 6th Airborne and the 51st (Highland) Division. On 7August Gale was ordered to prepare the division to move over to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine. The three divisions east of the Orne together became I Corps; its commander, Lieutenant General John Crocker, knowing that the 6th Airborne <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect it to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine, the division would have to cross three major rivers. There were two main lines of advance, the road running along the coast and another road further inland from Troarn to Pont Audemer. The commando brigade and the two parachute brigades would use the inland route, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade being responsible for the breakout when the time was right.|$|E
5|$|Although the 9th Corps Army {{was one of}} China's elite formations, {{composed}} of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army {{was intended to be}} outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen. As the result, the 9th Corps Army <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps Army to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve, and starvation and exposure broke out among the Chinese units since foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.|$|E
5|$|As {{test flights}} {{conducted}} by No. 617 Squadron proved {{that it was}} not possible to make a return trip to Kaafjord from Scotland, and an evaluation of the main airstrip in the Shetlands determined that it was unsuitable for Lancasters, No. 5 Group's staff officers judged that it would be necessary for the aircraft to refuel in the Soviet Union. Detailed investigation of the airstrips near Murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> accommodation or aircraft servicing facilities. Moreover, the airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby German bases. Instead, it was decided that the attack force should fly over northern Sweden and Finland after raiding Kaafjord and refuel at Yagodnik airstrip, which was located on an island near Arkhangelsk. This plan was accepted by the Air Ministry on 6 September. Soviet Naval Aviation offered to attack German fighter bases at the same time as the British bombers arrived over the target area, but No. 5 Group rejected this proposal and requested that Soviet aircraft not fly near Kaafjord, to avoid alerting the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Dresden saw {{action in}} the Battle of Coronel in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, where {{she was the only}} German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into Robinson Crusoe Island in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> coal left for her boilers, so the ship's captain {{contacted}} the local Chilean authorities to have Dresden interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent Glasgow. The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the Battle of Más a Tierra. The Germans scuttled Dresden and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile {{for the duration of the}} war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate {{period of}} the Roman Empire (30 BC – AD 284), the all-mounted alae ("wings") {{contained}} the elite cavalry of the army. They were specially trained in elaborate manoeuvres, such as those displayed to the emperor Hadrian during a documented inspection in Numidia. They were best-suited for large-scale operations and battle, during which they {{acted as the primary}} cavalry escort for the legions, which <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> cavalry of their own. Roman alares were normally armoured, with mail or scale body armour, a cavalry version of the infantry helmet (with more protective features, such as completely covered ears) and oval shield or hexagonal. Their weapons could be a lance, javelins, or bow and arrow but all Roman horseman had a sword called a (spatha) and the ubiquitous pugio. The elite status of an alaris is shown {{by the fact that he}} received 20% greater pay than his counterpart in an auxiliary cohort, and than a legionary infantryman.|$|E
5|$|From late June the 315thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{a series of}} night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced AN/APQ-7 radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube Oil Refinery at Yokkaichi on the night of 26June. The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck the refinery destroyed or damaged 30percent of the facility. The unit's next attack was against a refinery at Kudamatsu three nights later, and on the night of 2July it struck another refinery at Minoshima. On the night of 6/7July the 315thBombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil refinery near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery. The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities {{by the end of the}} war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.|$|E

5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader.

5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E
