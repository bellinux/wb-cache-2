5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> the conspirators' plans and preparations exists.

5|$|Bramantyo {{attempted}} to make his film as historically accurate as possible. However, as no <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> Dahlan's life {{before he went to}} Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's youth were fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy. The crew restored several old buildings for their shots and custom-ordered 19th-century style traditional garments for their scenes.|$|E
