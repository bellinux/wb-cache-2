40|$|One {{objective}} {{of government is}} to provide services at least cost whilst maintaining or improving service quality. While this {{may be an important}} objective, questions are being asked whether services can be provided more efficiently and effectively by the private rather than by the government sector. The shift of service provision from the public to the private sector is known as outsourcing or contracting out. The objective in this study is to critically examine whether the contracting out of services by local government to the private sector is an efficient management practice. The contracting out of Parks and <b>Grounds</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>services</b> for the City of Kingston in the State of Victoria, Australia, is used as an exploratory case study to identify the variables associated with management decision-making in the contracting out process. Factors relevant to the contracting out decision such as the criteria used in selecting a contractor; the evaluation of a contractor’s performance; and any subsequent changes to management practice relating to the contracting out of the services are identified and discussed. Political forces were found to be an important consideration in the initial contracting out decision, and the selection of a contractor was influenced by the potential to avoid costs. It was also found that under-bidding and associated cost /profit constraints lead to contractors engaging in non-sustainable environmental practices which resulted in the degradation of the local government’s Parks and Gardens assets. A sustainable asset management philosophy as opposed to an avoidable costs approach now underpins the contracting out process to ensure the preservation of such assets. Further, administrative processes have been revised to make tender specifications more prescriptive, critical components of services have been brought back in-house, and management practices have been amended so that a greater degree of control is exercised over contractors’ activities. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The low-velocity impact {{problem in}} graphite/epoxy {{composite}} sheets must be solved before {{large amounts of}} that material {{can be used in}} commercial aircraft. Many of the low-velocity impacts that affect aircraft parts occur during normal <b>ground</b> operations and <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Service</b> equipment and tools have masses above 1 kg, and at velocities of less than 3 m/s can impact structural parts with energies higher than composites can endure without degradation of stiffness or strength. Simple solutions were developed for large-mass, low-velocity impacts which can be modeled as quasi-static events. Static test data and impact data show that the fiber properties control the impact energy which can be absorbed before penetration. Matrix shear strength and peel resistance control the extent of delamination. Comparison of results from tough matrix and brittle matrix composites show that although tough matrices reduce the extent of delamination, they lead to more fiber damage in the contact area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature and extent of {{outsourcing}} by higher education institutions, benefits and challenges associated with outsourcing, and the implications of outsourcing for effective management. The principal investigator conducted a national study of outsourcing by four-year colleges and universities at two points in time, 1998 - 99 and 2003 - 04. Results indicated that vending, dining, and bookstore operations were the most frequently contracted activities. The investigators also tested the relationship between each of two institutional variables, control and Carnegie classification, and each of the outsourcing activities. Private institutions outsourced <b>grounds</b> <b>maintenance</b> and custodial <b>services</b> significantly more than did public institutions. Master’s institutions outsourced bookstore operations significantly more than did baccalaureate institutions. This paper explores {{the nature and}} extent of outsourcing by higher education institutions, benefits and challenges associated with outsourcing, and the implications of outsourcing for effective management. Theoretical Framework The decision to contract with an external provider for the performance of an organizational function, on the premise that the outside entity can complete the task at a cost lower than that achievable by the organization, has a long history. Manufacturing businesses likely were the first to employ this calculus of lower cost, choosing to buy, rather than to make component parts (Dominia...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} {{industrial}} maintenance management is evolving constantly, as {{the trend of}} servitization and outsourcing of support <b>services</b> affect <b>maintenance</b> operations. In-house maintenance organizations have moved at least partly towards inter-organizational relationships in different company networks (consisting of customer companies, service providers and equipment providers). Hand in hand with structural change, new valuecreating opportunities have emerged. Equipment providers enter the service market {{more and more often}} to level out cyclical changes in equipment sales. In addition, an increasing number of companies that focus primarily on <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> have entered the market (often as a result of outsourced in-house operations). The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value and capture the different value creation strategies in service networks. First, the study identifies what the value creating elements and features in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> are. Second, the study explores how <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> operations are currently managed. Thirdly, the thesis studies what the prerequisites for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are. The thesis employs the mixed methods approach where both quantitative and qualitative methods are used in the empirical part of the research. The survey method is utilized for quantitative data collection in order to decipher the complex nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value. After quantitative analysis, a qualitative case study is used to explain the identified value creation strategies and the role of networks in value creation further. The findings of this thesis indicate that successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are created stagewise by utilizing comprehensive value creation capabilities. The thesis offers three main contributions to the field. First, it presents a framework for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks where different value creation strategies at different relationship and offering levels in <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are identified. Second, it provides a multidimensional value construct where the comprehensive value of <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> is presented. Thirdly, the findings highlight that non-financial value elements become critical when aiming at more collaborative <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks...|$|R

5000|$|Because Hualien City is {{a popular}} gateway into Taroko National Park, the airport became too small and {{outdated}} for {{the growing number of}} tourists. It underwent a significant expansion between 2002 and 2005 in anticipation of increased traffic from international charters and in an effort to spur local economic development. Plans called for new passenger and cargo terminals, new air bridges, and a new apron. The new passenger terminal was opened on March 19, 2004, at a cost of NT$2.3 billion (US$69 million). It incorporates design cues from both classical Chinese and Aboriginal Taiwanese architecture, though the building overall has a modern look with copious use of granite, marble, steel, and glass. Hualien's terminal is one of only three airport terminals in Taiwan whose layout allows aviation enthusiasts clear views of takeoffs and landings (the other two being Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Taipei, and Kaohsiung International Airport, Kaohsiung). However, even though the new terminal was designed to serve international clientele, the airport so far has neither the level of passenger usage nor the appropriate aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>ground</b> <b>services</b> to merit [...] "international" [...] status.|$|R
