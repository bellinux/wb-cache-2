This storm later doused the Mid-Atlantic states with flooding rains. In early September, a powerful storm known as [...] "Antje's Hurricane"—named after a ship that it dismasted—tracked generally westward after first being spotted over the Leeward Islands.

2500|$|Jet allows {{multiple}} {{users to}} access the database concurrently. To prevent that data from being corrupted or invalidated when multiple users try to edit the same record or page of the database, Jet employs a locking policy. Any single user can modify only those <b>database</b> <b>records</b> (that is, items in the database) to which the user has applied a lock, which gives exclusive access to the record until the lock is released. In Jet versions before version 4, a page locking model is used, and in Jet 4, a record locking model is employed. Microsoft databases are organized into data [...] "pages", which are fixed-length (2kB before Jet 4, 4kB in Jet 4) data structures. Data is stored in [...] "records" [...] of variable length that may take up less or more than one page. The page locking model works by locking the pages, instead of individual records, which though less resource-intensive also means that when a user locks one record, all other records {{on the same page}} are collaterally locked. [...] As a result, no other user can access the collaterally locked records, even though no user is accessing them and {{there is no need for}} them to be locked. [...] In Jet 4, the record locking model eliminates collateral locks, so that every record that is not in use is available.|$|E
2500|$|Jet {{supports}} {{transaction processing}} for database {{systems that have}} this capability. (ODBC systems have one-level transaction processing, while several ISAM systems like Paradox do not support transaction processing.) A transaction {{is a series of}} operations performed on a database that must be done together [...] this is known as atomicity {{and is one of the}} ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability), concepts considered to be the key transaction processing features of a database management system. For transaction processing to work (until Jet 3.0), the programmer needed to begin the transaction manually, perform the operations needed to be performed in the transaction, and then commit (save) the transaction. Until the transaction is committed, changes are made only in memory and not actually written to disk. Transactions have a number of advantages over independent database updates. One of the main advantages is that transactions can be abandoned if a problem occurs during the transaction. This is called rolling back the transaction, or just rollback, and it restores the state of the <b>database</b> <b>records</b> to precisely the state before the transaction began. Transactions also permit the state of the database to remain consistent if a system failure occurs in the middle of a sequence of updates required to be atomic. There is no chance that only some of the updates will end up written to the database; either all will succeed, or the changes will be discarded when the database system restarts. With ODBC's in-memory policy, transactions also allow for many updates to a record to occur entirely within memory, with only one expensive disk write at the end.|$|E
