40|$|In the {{territory}} of Serbia, the occurrence of trichinellosis in domestic pigs has been present for a long number of years. In a ten-year period, a total of 1, 224 pigs were registered in one populated area with the diagnosis of a larval form of the parasite T. spiralis. In {{the middle of the}} period of examination, a systematic <b>deratization</b> of the complete settlement was carried out, the neighboring garbage dumps, and a pit grave. The systematic <b>deratization</b> was performed using the preparation Brodisan. This preparation is a liquid concentrate for the preparation of bait with 0. 25 % bromadiolone (3 -(3 -/-bromobiphenyl- 4 - il/- 3 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylpropyl) - 4 -hydroxycoumarin). The total used quantity of bait for one systematic <b>deratization</b> in this populated area was 4, 840 kg. Analyzing the tendency of the incidence of positive pigs in the period before the systematic <b>deratization,</b> we established that the average annual increase was around 70 pigs (b= 69. 30). The best adapted line of movement of the number of positive pigs was a third degree polynomial (Ŷ= 185. 20 - 304. 10 x + 147. 10 x 2 - 16. 75 x 3), because its correlation coefficient is the biggest (rxy= 0. 96). The analysis of the trend in the number of infected pigs after the systematic <b>deratization</b> was performed in the examined area, it was established {{on the grounds of the}} negative parameter b of the straight line trend, that the average annual reduction in the number of infected pigs was 39. 80. The tendency of a reduction of the number of infected pigs following the systematic <b>deratization</b> is best described by a second degree polynomial (Ŷ= 307. 2 - 109. 23 x + 11. 57 x 2) because its correlation coefficient is rxy= 0. 98...|$|E

In this paper we have identified all methods for application of these chemical means in <b>deratization</b> practice.

40|$|In Budapest (population 2 million) 33 out of 100 {{buildings}} were rat-infested {{in the early}} seventies. Thus general <b>deratization</b> was decreed to cover {{the whole of the}} city in 1971 to 1972. As a result of the global eradication method applied, the rate of rat-infested premises could be reduced below 0. 5 % annually. After control the sparsely occurring rats could freely choose any of the habitats released for settling. The habitats of Budapest most preferred by Norway rats are presented after a wide-ranging investigation carried out over 8 years. Our examination data support and in some cases reveal the requirements of Norway rats living in Central European large cities as regards to the environment as well as their ethological features. This knowledge may help in improving <b>deratization</b> and especially maintenance operations, thus increasing the efficiency of the fight against rats...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Pest {{control in}} urban {{environment}} {{can be carried}} out either sporadically or in a concentrated way, covering large areas. The efficacy of organized pest control programs comprising large parts of cities or even whole cities is far higher than the success of separate control works done by individual methods. Having recognized this fact and taking into account the above modern aspects, the City Council of Budapest organized an overall <b>deratization</b> action covering the entire city of Budapest, capital of Hungary. as well as cockroach control actions comprising housing estates built by panel construction. As a result of a total <b>deratization</b> action carried out by Bhbolna Bioenvironmental Centre in 1971 - 72, the initial 32. 8 % rat infestation of properties has been decreased to below 0. 5 %. The success of this action allowed Budapest, a city with 2. 2 million inhabitants to become rat-free in 1972. Due to the systematic maintenance works following <b>deratization</b> conducted since 1973. rats have not been neither a public health, economic or general feeling problem in Budapest for 23 years now. As a result of the large-scale cockroach control action carried out in Budapest between 1978 - 1990, 144, 800 flats, 2 million sq. m public area in dwelling houses, I million sq. m area in public establishments (schools, trade units, etc.) as well as 700, 000 sq. m public health area (hospitals, social welfare homes, etc.) have become cockroach-free. This practically insect-free state could be saved on the long term due to the maintenance works carried out following the control itself. During the years of proper control, the large-scale pest control programs carried out in Budapest over the past 23 years have implied higher costs than usual. These control actions have been, however, followed in each case by the continuous maintenance works carrying less costs. As a result of the complex pest control and maintenance programs in Budapest have not only been more successful than the average, but have proved to be more profitable economically;IS well...|$|E
40|$|Common vole (Microtus arvalis Pallas, 1778) {{is one of}} the {{economically}} important rodents, especially in winter wheat. Multiple deratizations were done on the locality of Kneževo, “Belje” d. d., in winter wheat with different tillage treatments. It was done in the period of December 1999 - March 2000. Brodilon rodenticide was used in dosages 10 g/ hole. The presence of meadow mouse before <b>deratization</b> was in 2 nd and 3 rd category. After deratizations, declining trend was noticed in population dynamics. In standard tillage treatment the efficacy was 97...|$|E
40|$|A {{leading role}} of the anthropic factors in the {{determination}} of the composition, number and distribution of animals on the urbanized territory has been shown. Shown has been the possibility of using the composition and dynamics of the animal component of ecosystem in the town intended for the operative indication of the condition of the medium and ecological-faunistic monitoring on the urbanized territories. The additional recommendations on regulation of the number and composition of some groups of animals in the town has been inserted in the nature-protection and <b>deratization</b> organizations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{international}} experience of public participation in the licensing of certain types of economic activity in the sanitary and epidemiological direction. Virtually the only direction in the sanitary and epidemiological supervision subjected to state licensing is disinfection, disinsection and <b>deratization.</b> The definition of “pest control ” is formulated in the article. Comparison of the current pest control permit systems in 12 countries found that the most stringent licensing conditions for pest control business is in Australia and the USA. The most loyal licensing conditions for pest control business are in Japan, Poland and the United Kingdom, with no state pest control license. Unsettledness of Ukrainian pest control market, the lack of clear legislation and mental nuances affirm that it is too early to talk about the absence of pest control licensing in Ukraine. Therefore, the best approximate scheme of pest control licensing in Ukraine should include improving the efficiency of interaction between the state apparatus, self-regulatory and non-governmental organizations and their members. This study shows interesting implications that are useful for both academics and practitioners...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 145 samples from bovine, bird, pigs, dogs, {{slaughterhouse}} {{and people were}} tested for antibioresistance during the period 2003 - 2004. A total of 281 isolates were studied. 62 of them were determined as E. coli, 65 as Staphylococcus aureus, 54 as Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis The in vitro susceptibility of bacterial substances was tested by agar diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar. The results were defined by measuring {{the diameter of the}} zones of inhibition and for interpretation the three-stage system of Kirby-Bauer was used. The data indicated that there is an increased resistance by isolated bacteria to the common antibiotics in use in the animal farms. Furthermore, there was a conformity of antibioresistance in organisms, isolated from animals and from personnel, caring for or being in contact with them (farmers, calf breeders, cow breeders, pig breeders, slaughterhouse workers, dog owners etc.). An exchange of antibioresistant microflora between animals and men or only a transfer of genetic material (integrons), coding this resistance with high phenomenon prevalence was most probably occurring- a fact with significant epidemiological and medical importance for practice. This danger could be reduced by immunization of animals and people, adequate disinfection and <b>deratization</b> of premises, contaminated with resistant microorganisms, periodical screening and monitoring fo...|$|E
