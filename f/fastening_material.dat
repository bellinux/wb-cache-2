It was developed by Reinz-Dichtungs-GmbH, Technische Universität München, Hölzel Stanz- und Feinwerktechnik GmbH & Co. KG and Koenig Verbindungstechnik GmbH. Metaklett is claimed to support shear strength 35 t/m² at temperatures up to 800 °C [...] It consists of two complementary strips of 0.2 mm thick perforated steel with catcher and holes. A second variant consists of two strips with protruding brushes and hooks. There is also a hybrid variant with one metal and one synthetic fleece ribbon.|$|E
50|$|The {{main beams}} {{supporting}} the entire structure vary, {{depending on the}} intended length of stay in one area. Most houses are built without the expectation of using them for many years, due to the shifting nature of agricultural work. Houses are built {{as close as possible}} to a new field. Occasionally, a site is found so favorable that the house is built to last, employing heavy and solid wooden supports. The strongest houses would have supporting beams made of hardwood 15 to 20 centimeters thick, but this is rather rare. Usually, the supporting timbers are 1 centimeter thick, the entire structure being so light a person could easily shake it at one of the supports. Tops of supporting beams are connected with rough logs which serve as stringers, to which the split bamboo, or palma brava, or other flooring materials are lashed with rattan strips. No nails are used in putting houses together, and even the use of wooden pegs is rare. Strips of rattan are the most favored <b>fastening</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
40|$|This work is {{the final}} part of the Master of Science degree in Industrial Design Engineering towards Production Design, at Luleå University of Technology. This project has been {{conducted}} {{during the spring of}} 2017 at Alimak Hek. The task has been to analyze material handling, material presentation and why material shortages occur at the industrial hoists final assembly stations. To get an understanding of the system, interviews and observations were conducted. A literature study was carried out to find current knowledge and different solutions. To involve the workers in the process and to check if the problems were understood correctly a workshop was conducted. This was also an opportunity to discuss desired future state and ideas with the workers. Another way to look at potential solutions was through the benchmarkings. These were both conducted internally and at other companies where different solutions for material handling was studied.   The material in focus has been <b>fastening</b> <b>material.</b> This was stored in bins at racks. These racks were placed at the assembly stations and the two big racks have been the focus of this project. The problems at these storages has been that the refilling did not work as it was supposed to. The old system was an order list with which material could be ordered from the main storage at Alimak, this however is not used any more. The system of today is that the empty bins are collected and put on a pallet to be sent to the main storage for refilling. The problem with this is that the workers did not take the bins when they were empty but rather went to a different storage to look there. This meant that the material sometimes got totally emptied at all racks before the bins were sent to refilling. This made for urgent needs where workers {{had to go to the}} storage themselves to get something refilled. Another problem was that these storages were placed behind the fixed stations which made them hard to get to and see. The bins used in today’s system were not all marked the same way and an old system for numbering was still partly used. The bigger storages were divided so that one should have the stainless material and the other should have the galvanized/zinc-coated material. This together with the other aspects made it hard to know where the bins should be and sometimes all bins of one kind was put in the same rack.   To fix these problems different suggestions were made. The use of a two-bin system has been suggested because of its simplicity and the potential it has to avoid a lack of material to arise. The two racks of today should be combined into one and moved to a more visible place. This would make the refilling easier and reduce the need to search for material at different places. Two general layouts have been developed, and the open layout has been suggested to be implemented because of the accessibility it would bring to the system. The approximate size of the rack and bins needed have been put forward and different suggestion for order in the rack has been made. The marking of the bins and rack has also been discussed and this should be made distinct so it is easy to see and read...|$|E

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the <b>fastened</b> <b>material</b> or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{fasteners}} {{are used}} extensively in composite aircraft structures, offering a cost-effective, reliable and repeatable joining method while also facilitating disassembly for maintenance and repair. However, current design practices rely extensively on experimentation and detailed numerical analyses which are time consuming and expensive and thus significantly increase development and production costs. Although three-dimensional {{finite element analysis}} can be used in-lieu of more expensive experimental tests, current state-of-the-art computing technology cannot facilitate analysis of large-scale sub-structures (e. g. panels, wing spars, etc.) with potentially thousands of fasteners. The work conducted herein addresses this issue {{through the development of}} highly efficient analysis methodologies for bolted composite joints loaded at various rates. Several highly efficient numerical methods are developed that can account for laminate-laminate friction, bolt-hole clearance, non-linear material behaviour, bolt failure and loading-rate effects. Validated against quasi-static and high-rate experimental data, these methods have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art, due to their ability to accurately predict the response of multi-row, multi-column joints in seconds. Such an increase in efficiency is owed to the implementation of a series of parameterised functions which model the local mechanical behaviour of the fastener and <b>fastened</b> <b>material.</b> This approach allows the statistical variations arising from manufacturing and material processing to be easily accounted for, a feat that is impractical using traditional modelling techniques and near-impossible experimentally. Furthermore, these methods have been developed into user-friendly, stand-alone joint analysis tools and a user-defined finite element which is straightforward to implement in commercial finite element software. The developed analysis methods were used to investigate the effects of loading rate and relative spacing between fasteners in multi-bolt joints. Although loading rate effects primarily manifest as changes in joint failure loads and energy absorption, the propagation of stress waves also leads to variations in load distribution of up to 1. 7 % in the joints considered. Furthermore, it was found that a strain shielded region exists in all multi-fastener arrays and consequently any bolts positioned within this region carry a reduced proportion of load. When load is evenly distributed across the joint, increased failure initiation loads are to be expected, however, the most effective method of augmenting joint strength is through the use of additional fasteners. Additionally, the use of a load-path visualisation methodology gave novel insight into the role of fibre orientation on load transfer in bolted multi-directional laminates. It was found that load is transferred in a trajectory that is strongly dependent on fibre orientation, which is important in the distribution of load in multi-fastener joints...|$|R

Moreover, meta-materials and functional structures having fundamentally new mechanical properties can be designed this way. We present the design, fabrication and mechanics of a novel, deployable cellular material, which we call Flexigami. The unit cell {{takes the form of}} two parallel regular polygons, connected by a circuit of diagonally creased panels. Upon compression, individual unit cells transform either gently or abruptly between two stable equilibrium states depending on the interplay between hinge and panel properties. The mechanical behavior of each unit cell can be deterministically designed via geometry, dimensions and topology of the panels and hinges. Individual unit cells can collapsed reversible to less than 10 % of their deployed volume. Within this transition regime, the force-displacement curve of each cell can be tuned to exhibit a smooth compression behavior or an instability followed by a self-reinforcing response. We use finite-element models complemented by analytical and computational analysis of the results to understand the importance of different mechanical properties of constituent hinges and panels and also demonstrate the fabrication of flexigami cells and mechanisms in various structural materials.

40|$|In {{the world}} of today, issues of the {{relationship}} between society and nature are becoming more relevant. A process of continuous development of industrial and social activities and the negative interference in the environment cause damage to the unique biosphere. The dynamics of destructive processes necessitates conducting activities in accordance with the fundamental laws of nature. One way of solving these problems is to create a harmonious architectural environment that has minimal impact on the environment of the surrounding countryside. An important factor in the process of "sustainable architecture" formation is the use of the building materials, which are safe for humans and the environment. Special role in this aspect is played by wood possessing unquestionable priority in "sustainable architecture". Wood is a renewable natural material with unique properties. Wastelessness, low thermal conductivity, strength, unique texture, ease of processing and other quality wood help to create cozy and comfortable environment. From the perspective of ecological and energy problems the use of wood in architecture has a special role as the most optimal solution to these issues. In Russia construction of energy efficient buildings is at an early stage of development. To date, the power consumption of the existing residential and public buildings in Russia is on average about three times higher than in technically advanced countries of Scandinavia with similar climatic conditions. At the same time the tendency to steady growth of non-renewable energy resources leads to the need to improve the thermal protection of buildings. The problem of thermal protection of buildings in architecture led to widespread use of ventilated facades. Constructive solution is to install the layer of insulation on the exterior walls and to <b>fasten</b> cladding <b>materials</b> to the frame to form an air gap for air circulation. Finishing materials perform architectural function. The most common facing materials of natural origin include wooden facades. Demand for such kind of structures in contemporary architecture is explained by wide possibilities of architectural and artistic facades. Facade decor made of wood is various, it tends to be unusual, with exclusive forms, eliminating unnecessary luxury. Valuable wood panels, board with logs imitation, block house, facade boards (planken), the wood tile (shingle), etc. can be used in decoration. A large number of wooden facing materials allow to create wooden facades of different styles, and the texture and wood shades form a harmonious environment. Among the various methods of using wooden decor the most common technique is outplaying of wood texture. Wood is treated with special impregnation to give effect of the natural aging, wood is also tinted, creating a color contrast of house planes, and then is coloured, imitating the texture of precious wood. Wooden facade decor fully solves not only the problem of architectural expressiveness of structures, but also the problem of energy saving, which is especially important {{in the context of the}} global crisis.

30|$|In wooden light frame constructions, floors {{consist of}} joists and floor sheathings of plywood or other sheet <b>materials</b> <b>fastened</b> to the joists {{generally}} with CN 50 nails according to JIS A 5508. Shear walls are {{fastened to the}}se floors generally with CN 90 nails according to JIS A 5508 at their bottom plates [1, 2], where the bottom plates of the shear walls are fastened to the joists with CN 90 nails through the floor sheathings fastened to the joists with CN 50 nails themselves. In this structural system, the lateral forces applied to the shear walls are partially transmitted from the bottom plates to the joists directly via CN 90 nails, and the remained lateral forces are transmitted through the joints with CN 50 nails between the floor sheathings and the joists. The current design standard of timber structures [3] does not provide the allowable lateral resistance of the nailed joints in this combined system. Structural designers, therefore, cannot determine the working resistance for arbitrary combinations of materials and nails. Some studies [4 – 6] showed the models to calculate the lateral resistance of joints with interlayer, which were connected with nails or a dowel. However, those models assumed no connection or rigid connection between the interlayer and timber. It is then {{need to understand the}} actual behavior of the joints with interlayer slips for practical design of the joints considered in this study. The evaluation of allowable working resistance of nailed joints of various combinations has also become demanded for developing various construction systems including prefabrication of structural or non-structural components. An example of demand may be the installation of external thermal-insulation components that are expected to have structural resistance too [7], which is practical for one-stroke repair of thermal-insulation and earthquake-proof reinforcement. From this background, we conducted an experimental study on the nailed timber–plywood–timber joints extended from the standard wall–floor joints of wooden light frame constructions.|$|R
3000|$|Various {{materials}} and techniques {{have been developed}} to strengthen damaged or deteriorated civil structures. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets and plates are the most widely used strengthening materials (Triantafillou and Plevris 1992; Elsanadedy et al. 2013; Loreto et al. 2013). The most common strengthening techniques used for deteriorated structures are external bonding reinforcement (EBR) and near-surfaced-mounted (NSM) methods (Kim 2015). The EBR technique is a strengthening method that improves structural performance by attaching steel or FRP plates on the surface of a structure. However, the strengthening material in the EBR method is exposed, making it vulnerable to damage due to fire or corrosion. Furthermore, different thermal coefficients of the concrete and the material can cause debonding, leading to a premature failure of either the epoxy resin matrix or the strengthening material (Park 2003; Kim 2005; Barros et al. 2006; Casadei et al. 2006; [...] Choi et al. 2010; Hong et al. 2014; Bilotta et al. 2015; Coelho et al. 2015). NSM technology was proposed to overcome such problems of the EBR method. NSM involves inserting strengthening materials such as FRP bars, FRP strips, or steel strands into the grooves of concrete cover which needs to be strengthened, and then bonding the strengthening material with a cement mortar or epoxy resin matrix as a filler inside a groove (De Lorenzis et al. 2002; El-Hacha and Rizkalla 2004; El-Hacha and Gaafar 2011; El-Hacha and Soudki 2013). Recently, various researches on the strengthening civil structures using FRP materials for NSM methods have been conducted (El-Hacha and Rizkalla 2004; Gaafar and El-Hacha 2008; El-Hacha and Gaafar 2011; El-Hacha and Soudki 2013). Even though researches have not found a way to completely solve the premature failure of the strengthening material in the EBR method, the considerable improvement of the flexural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened by the NSM method compared to the RC beams strengthened by the EBR method has been demonstrated. Prestressing strengthening methods (PSMs) are used for concrete which needs to improve its flexural behavior in terms of serviceability and deflection (Yang et al. 2009). For decades, PSMs have been performed by <b>fastening</b> the post-tensioned <b>material</b> on the tensile side of a concrete beam (Rosenboom and Rizkalla 2006). Compressive stresses {{at the bottom of the}} concrete member and tensile stresses at the top of the concrete member are produced by the prestressing force transmitted from the prestressed strengthening material, which is known as the cambering effect (El-Hacha et al. 2001). The RC beam strengthened by the prestressed strengthening material has various advantages, such as reducing both deflection and crack width, increasing load-carrying capacity, and resistance of fatigue failure (El-Hacha et al. 2001; Woo et al. 2008). Among the PSMs, the NSM technique using prestressed FRP material, referred to as prestressed FRP NSM, has been studied by many researchers failure (El-Hacha et al. 2001; Nordin 2003; Hong et al. 2006; Woo et al. 2008). It has been reported that the prestressed FRP NSM technique increases cracking and yielding loads and reduces deflection at mid-span and crack width for the strengthened RC beams. However, this technique faces the critical problem of reduced ductility of the strengthened RC beam (Badawi and Soudki 2009). The ductility of the strengthened RC beam is reduced with higher prestressing level of the prestressed FRP material, which finally causes failure at a smaller deflection. The reason for this is that a large part of the strain capacity of the FRP reinforcement is already used during prestressing. The deformability of the RC beam strengthened by prestressed FRP material is greatly reduced, resulting in all specimens being strengthened by the prestressed FRP material failing by rupture of the FRP material (Rezazadeh et al. 2015; Kara et al. 2016). The decreased ductility of the strengthened RC beam is because of increased tensile reinforcement and the prestressing effect, which leads to less energy dissipation. Furthermore, in the prestressed FRP NSM technique, it is difficult to assign and secure the FRP material in the groove and to apply a pre-tension force in the groove (Shahverdi et al. 2016). This is the reason why the prestressed FRP NSM technique is not widely used in practice.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three main parts: The first part that uses classic track models {{as a basis for}} further developments, the second part that deals with constitutive behaviour of granular materials and the third part that describes {{the development of a new}} triaxial cell apparatus and the testing of a ballast material using this apparatus. The description of classic track models is focused on the beam-on-elastic-foundation model (abbr. BOEF model), which make use of the Winkler foundation, and a simple beam element model with linear discrete support. The shortcomings of the BOEF model is discussed: It assumes a continuous foundation, a continuously welded track, the weight of the track ladder is not incorporated, linear support which imply prediction of tension in the uplift regions, no shear deformation in the rails is taken into account, it cannot predict stresses and strains within the granular layers. While some of the shortcomings may easily be incorporated others are not: Especially to remove tension in the uplift zones, and to calculate stresses and strains in the granular layers. The latter actually requires a continuum approach. A track model that approximately eliminates the tension in the uplift regions has been developed for a single axle load. As expected, the model shows that the length of the uplift zone and the amount of uplift have higher values than predicted by the BOEF model. The model may be useful when considering contact problems in the track, for instance in a buckling-of-rails analysis. For the BOEF model a tool that makes use of dimensionless sensitivity diagrams has been developed. The method will in an easy way provide the new maximum track reactions when one or more track parameters are changed. It is hoped that this tool will prove very helpful in a design process, at least as a first step. Dimensionless sensitivity diagrams have been worked out for rail deflection, rail moment, rail seat load, tensional rail base stress and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast. The parameters considered are the design wheel load, rail moment of inertia, position of neutral axis in the rail, sleeper spacing, sleeper width and the length of the sleeper that carries the vertical load. The dimensionless sensitivity diagrams for the BOEF model may be used both for a single axle load and for a double axle load. Also for a beam element model with linear discrete support the dimensionless sensitivity diagrams may be used, but only for a single axle load which is located directly above one of the supports, i. e. a sleeper. For the beam element model the diagrams for the rail deflection, rail seat load and vertical stress between sleeper and ballast are almost identical to the ones for the BOEF model, while the diagrams for the rail moment and tensile rail base stress are somewhat different. A beam element model with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements resting on nonlinear discrete supports was developed for a single axle load. The discrete supports, which were located at the sleeper positions, were modelled by a two-parameter power function. The model takes advantage of a measured load-deflection relationship, which is also modelled by a two-parameter power function. These latter parameters are generally found by regression of the measured data, while the two parameters for the discrete supports are found as part of the overall solution to the problem. The present version of the model only takes into account a short track section and further development of the model is therefore needed. The track ladder weight and a no tension option in the uplift region are not incorporated in the present version. The model is useful when the BOEF model cannot be used because of nonlinear track response. Regarding constitutive behaviour it is argued that the plastic strain per load cycle in a well functioning railway track must be very small and normally below 1 / 100 000 of the elastic strain per load cycle. If also the hysteresis of the material during a load cycle is small, then an elastic approximation could be justified when it comes to calculating the stresses. The plastic strains may then be detached from the stress-strain calculation and modelled separately on the basis of laboratory or field measurements. Several elastic constitutive models are described: The Hooke's law generalised to three dimensions, the cross anisotropic elastic model, two versions of the k-model, and two hyperelastic models. The general elasto-plastic framework with isotropic hardening is also described. The basics of repeated loading of a frictional system is described by analogy to a simple model with springs and frictional sliders. This model can be viewed as the basis for the pure kinematic multisurface model by Mróz and Iwan. Through energy considerations in cyclic loading of the frictional system the concept of reclaimed plastic strain is rejected. The concept of initial stresses and strains is discussed. It is argued that initial stresses cannot be large in the upper part of a road or railway embankment. The main reason for this is that granular materials cannot self equilibrate stresses through tension. The development and construction of triaxial equipment for testing railway ballast in its original grading is described. The specimens are 300 mm by 600 mm (diameter by height). A new and direct way of applying the confining load was developed, which allowed faster variation of the confining stress. A new instrumentation concept was invented where instrumentation rings are <b>fastened</b> to <b>material</b> particles instead of being attached to the outer membrane or to plugs embedded in the material. This arrangement measures the horizontal deformation. The vertical deformation has to be measured over the whole specimen length as resilient particle rotations prevented on-sample instrumentation. A test series on Vassfjell railway ballast was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the new apparatus and to characterise the ballast material. The overall performance of the apparatus was found to be good with a reliable repeatability, but some modifications were suggested to improve the loading procedure in the beginning of the load steps. The test series on Vassfjell ballast was rather limited and no advanced modelling of the results was found to be appropriate. Instead an isotropic linear elastic approach was followed. Moisture was added, to the natural retention capacity, to some of the specimens. It was found that the added moisture only slightly affected the mechanical behaviour of the material. A somewhat denser grading was also tested, but the observed effect on the material properties was limited. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
