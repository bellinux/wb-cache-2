40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of the equipment necessary to simulate the S-band multiple access link between user spacecraft, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and a ground control terminal are discussed. The core of the S-band multiple access concept is the use of an Adaptive Ground Implemented Phased Array. The array contains thirty channels and provides the multiplexing and <b>demultiplexing</b> <b>equipment</b> required to demonstrate the ground implemented beam forming feature. The system provided will make it possible to demonstrate the performance of a desired user and ten interfering sources attempting to pass data through the multiple access system...|$|E
