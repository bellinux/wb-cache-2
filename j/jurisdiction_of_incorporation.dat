40|$|While {{reference}} to 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary duties 2 ̆ 2 (plural) is routinely {{employed in the}} United States as a convenient short-hand for a corporate director 2 ̆ 7 s duties of care and loyalty, other common-law countries generally treat loyalty as the sole 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary duty. 2 ̆ 2 This contrast prompts some important questions about the doctrinal structure for duty of care analysis adopted in Delaware, the principal <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> for U. S. public companies. Specifically, has the evolution of Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s convoluted and problematic framework for evaluating disinterested board conduct been facilitated by styling care a 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary 2 ̆ 2 duty? If so, then how should Delaware lawmakers and judges respond moving forward? In this Essay I argue that styling care a 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary 2 ̆ 2 duty has impacted Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s duty of care analysis {{in ways that are}} not uniformly positive. Historically, loyalty has been aggressively enforced, while care has hardly been enforced at all - the former approach aiming to deter conflicts of interest through probing analysis of 2 ̆ 2 entire fairness, 2 ̆ 2 while the latter aims to promote entrepreneurial risk-taking through a hands-off judicial posture embodied in the business judgment rule. Conflation of these differing concepts as 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary duties, 2 ̆ 2 however, has facilitated a tendency toward over-enforcement of care, periodically threatening to impair entrepreneurial risk-taking until arrested by a countervailing legislative or judicial response. Additionally, their conflation threatens to erode the duty of loyalty by fueling the contractarian argument that the sole utility of such 2 ̆ 2 fiduciary duties 2 ̆ 2 is to fill contractual gaps, and that corporations therefore ought to possess latitude to 2 ̆ 2 opt out 2 ̆ 2 of loyalty to the degree already permitted with respect to care. While I concede that there may be good reasons not to abruptly recharacterize Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s duty of care as 2 ̆ 2 non-fiduciary, 2 ̆ 2 I conclude that the analytical problems described in this Essay can otherwise be remedied only through a statutory provision more clearly distinguishing these differing duties and enforcement strategies. Specifically, I advocate a statutory damages rule declaring once and for all that monetary damages may be imposed on a corporate director for loyalty, but not care, breaches - an approach effectively discarding much of Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s multi-layered and convoluted mode of care analysis, while insulating the duty of loyalty from future erosion...|$|E
40|$|Over recent decades, {{shareholders}} {{in public}} corporations have increasingly sought to augment {{their own power}} - and, correlatively, to limit the power of boards - through creative use of corporate bylaws. The bylaws lend themselves to such efforts because enacting, amending, and repealing bylaws are essentially the only corporate governance actions that shareholders can undertake unilaterally. In this Article I examine thecontested nature of bylaws, the fundamental issues of corporate power and purpose that they implicate, and the differing ways in which state and federal lawmakers and regulators may impact the debate regarding thescope of the shareholders 2 ̆ 7 bylaw authority. The Article first discusses various dimensions of corporate governance historically addressed in the bylaws, and the controversial uses to which bylaws have been put by shareholders seeking greater corporategovernance power, focusing on Delaware - the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> for most public companies. I then turn {{to the ways in}} which rules of corporate governance are generated in our federal legal system, including the complex and evolving mechanisms through which state and federal lawmakers and regulators interact. In particular, I evaluate the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s process for assessing whether shareholder proposals to amend bylaws must be included in a public company 2 ̆ 7 s proxy statement, as well as the recently created process through which Delaware permits SEC certification of contested issues of state law directly to the Delaware Supreme Court - a process the SEC has already used in evaluating the excludability of a proposed shareholder bylawamendment. I conclude that this process threatens to substantially distort the evaluation and evolution of theshareholders 2 ̆ 7 bylaw authority by presenting the Delaware Supreme Court with proposed bylaws to be assessed in the abstract - an awkward posture resulting in the sacrifice of important values reflected in theripeness doctrine, and abandonment of the presumption of validity that ordinarily favors enacted bylaws. I then consider who ought to determine the scope of permissible shareholder bylaws, concluding that there is no perfect approach because none of the relevant state and federal actors dominates with respect to both political legitimacy and expertise - the SEC possessing neither, while Congress possesses the former and Delaware the latter. I argue, however, that the least-bad approach would be to remove the SEC from theprocess entirely, leaving these matters to Delaware in the first instance, subject to potential intervention by Congress. The pragmatic means of achieving this outcome would be a strict SEC policy of refusal to permit exclusion from the proxy of proposed shareholder bylaws prompting competing opinions of Delaware counsel. This approach would eliminate the distortion introduced by SEC certification, permitting resolution of the fundamental issues at stake in a more organic and better informed manner through traditional Delaware litigation...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the constitutional validity of business combination antitakeover statutes. Delaware and other important corporate law jurisdictions enacted these statutes during the 1980 s to inhibit hostile leveraged corporate takeovers and protect incumbent managements. These statutes work by prohibiting transactions which enable a hostile acquirer with a mere majority of target stock to sell target assets for cash and retain all the cash to service acquisition debt while paying off with securities the minority shareholders 2 ̆ 7 interest in the assets sold. This allows the takeover to be financed with the assets acquired. Analyzing the structural operation of these statutes in greater depth than either the courts or other commentators reveals previously unidentified bases to challenge their constitutional validity. Using the Delaware statute as an example, the article describes a series of transactions which either evade the prohibitions of these statutes or require the enacting jurisdiction to repudiate the internal affairs doctrine for their prohibitions to remain effective. This doctrine is the consensus choice of law rule for all U. S. jurisdictions and one virtually constitutionalized by CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America. Existing assessments of the constitutionality of these statutes {{have focused on the}} fact that they explicitly apply only to target corporations incorporated in the state enacting the statute. In this respect they appear consistent with the internal affairs doctrine, which looks to the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> to determine the controlling law for matters peculiar to corporations, such as voting rights and board duties. This appearance of consistency with the internal affairs doctrine is deceiving. The effective application of these statutes to the described transactions requires the repudiation of the internal affairs doctrine because these transactions involve no formal corporate action by the Delaware target. Instead, they use foreign majority owned subsidiaries of the target. Only if Delaware law controls the internal governance of these foreign subsidiaries can the business combination statute actually bar the transactions. Since the antitakeover prohibition applies even without injury or harm to the Delaware target, these statutes go far beyond well established prohibitions against cleverly structured self dealing or unfair transactions. Without injury to the Delaware target, Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s antitakeover statute essentially mobilizes the private, economic power of the Delaware target to control the internal decisions of its foreign subsidiaries (whose very existence is owed to their own jurisdictions of incorporation and their governance requirements) to compel compliance with Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s prohibitions. To extend its regulatory mandate extraterritorially in this manner without the jurisdictional basis of injury within its jurisdiction exceeds constitutional limits. If Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s antitakeover statute purports to govern the internal affairs of a foreign subsidiary, then Delaware and the subsidiary 2 ̆ 7 s state of incorporation both claim to govern the internal affairs of the same corporation. Moreover, upon completion of the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s tender offer, the Delaware target becomes the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s majority owned foreign subsidiary. This status provides the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s state of incorporation with the same legislative basis as Delaware to extend its own legislative mandate over foreign subsidiaries, including the Delaware target. The bidder 2 ̆ 7 s state could then enact an antidote statute to Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s and supplant Delaware law for the internal affairs of the Delaware target. The potential for inconsistent or conflicting state regulation created by this situation exceeds what the Supreme Court found sufficient under the dormant commerce clause to invalidate an earlier generation of antitakeover statute in Edgar v. MITE. These statutes are vulnerable to constitutional challenge on other grounds as well. For a state to deviate from the internal affairs doctrine as its choice of law rule only when necessary to prevent a foreign corporation from escaping its regulatory jurisdiction may well violate the equal protection clause even under rational basis scrutiny. Lastly, the assertion of regulatory power over a foreign subsidiary, absent either contact with the regulating state or harmful effects within its jurisdictional territory, is an extraterritorial exercise of power fundamentally inconsistent with a federal system of co-equal sovereign states and in violation of due process...|$|E
