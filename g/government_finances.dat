5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most gifted and articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> were not turned around dramatically.|$|E

25|$|Since 2010, the {{government}} has been gradually reforming Malaysia's subsidy system, via a series of reductions in subsidies for fuel and sugar to improve <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> and to improve economic efficiency. As a result, in December 2014, {{the government}} officially ended all fuel subsidies and implemented a 'managed float' system, taking advantage of low oil prices at the time, potentially saving the government almost RM20 billion ringgit (US$5.97 billion) annually.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy and}} <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> {{began to show}} signs of {{impending}} recession by the end of 2007 when tax revenues fell short of the 2007 annual budget forecast by €2.3 billion (5%), with stamp duties and income tax both falling short by €0.8 billion (19% and 5%) resulting in the 2007 general government budget surplus of €2.3 billion (1.2% of GDP) being wiped out. An imminent recession became clear by mid-2008. Subsequently, government deficits increased, many businesses closed and unemployment increased. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ) fell and many immigrant workers left.|$|E
25|$|After Hamilton {{left office}} in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. {{informed}} Congress that, {{due to the}} existing state of <b>government</b> <b>finances,</b> more money was needed. This could be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the bank, or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been inviolably pledged {{for the support of}} the sinking fund to retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Finally, India's {{relations}} with Pakistan {{have always been}} tense. In 1998, there was a nuclear standoff between Pakistan and India. Border conflicts with Pakistan, mostly over the long held dispute over Kashmir, has further aggravated any economic ties. This impedes progress by limiting <b>government</b> <b>finances,</b> increasing social unrest, and limiting potential domestic economic demand. Factors such as international conflict, civil unrest, unwise political policy, outbreaks of disease and terrorism are all factors {{that are difficult to}} predict and that could {{have an effect on the}} destiny of any country.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} reorganise its subsidy system, {{which is a}} heavy burden on <b>government</b> <b>finances.</b> In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, {{and sooner or later}} the load will have to be shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
25|$|India's economy {{benefited from}} recent high {{economic}} growth which declined greatly {{due to the}} global economic crisis. Economic growth in India during FY2008-09 stood at 6.7%. The global crisis had less impact of India because exports account for only 15% of India's GDP, {{less than half the}} levels of major Asian economic powers such as China and Japan. However, unlike other major Asian economies, India's <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> were in poor shape and as a consequence, it was not able to enact large-scale economic stimulus packages. Despite this, from June 2008 to June 2009, industrial production in India grew by 7.1%.|$|E

25|$|Pedro's {{decision}} {{to defy the}} Cortes was met with armed opposition across Brazil by troops loyal to Portugal. The ensuing Brazilian War of Independence spread {{throughout most of the}} country, with battles fought in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825. In addition to those Brazilians and Portuguese who fought in the war, much of the credit for this victory is credited to Bonifácio's cabinet. It created an army and a navy practically out of nothing, greatly improved <b>government</b> <b>finances,</b> and unified the provinces under a single, cohesive leadership.|$|E
25|$|In Thrace {{today there}} are 235 {{minority}} primary schools, where education is in the Greek and Turkish languages, {{and there are also}} two minority secondary schools, one in Xanthi and one in Komotini, where most of the minority is concentrated. In the remote mountainous areas of Xanthi where the Pomak element is dominant, the Greek government has set up Greek language secondary education schools in which religious studies is taught in Turkish and the Quran is taught in Arabic. The Pomak language (which is essentially considered a dialect of Bulgarian), however, is not taught at any level of the education system. The <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> the transportation to and from the schools for students who live in remote areas, and in the academic year 1997-98, approximately 195,000 USD was spent on transportation.|$|E
25|$|The 1851 Yellow River flood deluged {{hundreds}} of thousands of square miles and caused immense loss of life. The Qing government slowly began cleaning up after the disaster but could not provide effective aid, as <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> had been drained during a recent war with Great Britain and the ongoing slaughter of the Taiping Rebellion. The damage created by the disaster had still not been repaired when, in 1855, the river burst its banks again, drowning thousands and devastating the fertile province of Jiangsu. Along with the destruction caused by the floods famine spread. At the time, the Qing government was trying to negotiate a deal with the European powers, and as state finances had been so severely depleted, the regime was again unable to provide effective relief. This enraged the Nian movement, which blamed the Europeans for contributing to China's troubles, and increasingly viewed the Qing government as incompetent and cowardly {{in the face of the}} Western powers.|$|E

25|$|Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron {{was educated}} at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 {{he worked at}} the Conservative Research Department, {{assisting}} the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats – the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in <b>government</b> <b>finances</b> that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to welfare, immigration policy, education, and healthcare. It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Historical tables {{within the}} President's Budget (OMB) provide {{a wide range}} of data on federal <b>government</b> <b>finances.</b> Many of the data series begin in 1940 and include {{estimates}} of the President's Budget for 2009–2014. Additionally, Table 1.1 provides data on receipts, outlays, and surpluses or deficits for 1901–1939 and for earlier multi-year periods. This document is composed of 17 sections, each of which has one or more tables. Each section covers a common theme. Section 1, for example, provides an overview of the budget and off-budget totals; Section 2 provides tables on receipts by source; and Section 3 shows outlays by function. When a section contains several tables, the general rule is to start with tables showing the broadest overview data and then work down to more detailed tables. The purpose of these tables is to present a broad range of historical budgetary data in one convenient reference source and to provide relevant comparisons likely to be most useful. The most common comparisons are in terms of proportions (e.g., each major receipt category as a percentage of total receipts and of the gross domestic product).|$|E
25|$|The Nian {{movement}} {{was formed in}} the late 1840s by Zhang Lexing and, by 1851, numbered approximately 40,000. Unlike the Taiping Rebellion, though, the Nian movement initially had no clear goals or objectives aside from criticism of the Qing government. However, the Nian rebels were provoked into taking direct action against the Qing regime following a series of ecological disasters. In 1851, the Yellow River burst its banks, flooding {{hundreds of thousands of}} square miles and causing immense loss of life.

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the net impact of immigration to <b>government</b> <b>finances.</b> A 1990 study found that an average immigrant household paid $22,528 in all forms of taxes and on average each household directly consumed $10,558 in government services. By contrast an average native Canadian household paid $20,259 in tax and consumed $10,102 dollars in services. Across the country this means that immigrant households contributed $2.6 billion more than their share to the public purse. A 1996 study found that over a lifetime a typical immigrant family will pay some forty thousand dollars more to the treasury than they will consume in services. Explanations for this include that immigrant households tend to be larger, and have more wage earners, increasing taxes. Newcomers are also less likely {{to make use of}} many social services. Immigrants are less likely than native Canadians to receive employment insurance, social assistance, and subsidized housing. Immigrants are also much less likely to become homeless or suffer from mental illness. Recent immigrants are also less likely to make use of subsidized housing than native Canadians of the same income level. In 2004 22.5% of low-income native Canadians lived in subsidized housing, but only 20.4% of low income recent immigrants did so, though this number was considerably higher among more established immigrants. Results from a study from the Fraser Institute found that the immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004 cost governments $23 billion per annum (as of 2006) in excess of taxes raised from those immigrants, relating to universal social services (e.g., welfare, medicare, public education).|$|E
500|$|Other {{officials}} were appointed as supervisors of <b>government</b> <b>finances.</b> Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a {{reform of the}} Imperial era. Under the Republic, provincial governors and tax farmers could exploit local populations for personal gain more freely. Equestrian procurators, whose authority was originally [...] "extra-judicial and extra-constitutional," [...] managed both state-owned property and the vast personal property of the emperor (res privata). Because Roman government {{officials were}} few in number, a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity, such as a procurator or a military officer, including centurions down to the lowly stationarii or military police.|$|E
500|$|Working with William Paulet and Walter Mildmay, Warwick {{tackled the}} {{disastrous}} {{state of the}} kingdom's finances. However, his regime first succumbed to the temptations of a quick profit by further debasing the coinage. The economic disaster that resulted caused Warwick to hand the initiative to the expert Thomas Gresham. By 1552, confidence in the coinage was restored, prices fell, and trade at last improved. Though a full economic recovery was not achieved until Elizabeth's reign, its origins lay in the Duke of Northumberland's policies. The regime also cracked down on widespread embezzlement of <b>government</b> <b>finances,</b> and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices, which has been called [...] "one of the more remarkable achievements of Tudor administration".|$|E
