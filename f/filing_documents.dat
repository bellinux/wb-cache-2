TIA was reported at the time to be studying the [...] "possibility of seeking control" [...] of National. Several weeks later, TIA announced intentions to buy up to 25% of National's stock, and requested approval from the CAB to acquire the stock and direct control of National. TIA's attempted takeover of the much larger National [...] "surprised a lot of people", because National was about six times the size of TIA at the time. Lorenzo's management team viewed National's stock as significantly undervaluing the assets of the company, and the move was financial in addition to being aimed at combining the routes of the two airlines.|$|E

The system allows further routing within the courts e.g. for approvals by the Duty Registrar and a reply is then sent out by the Registry staff which is routed back to the originating LF.

Fees payable by the LFs for <b>filing</b> <b>documents</b> to Court are deducted automatically by the EFS. The whole process is fast, convenient and efficient.|$|E

An attorney who violates these rules can be held liable for the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the other party in responding to the document. A document that is not signed by the attorney may be stricken. Where a party is not represented by counsel, the party must sign the documents himself, and thereby make the foregoing certifications.|$|E

5000|$|As a result, the JCPC {{has only}} really been {{accessible}} {{to either the}} very wealthy from the Caribbean or to certain inmates on death row {{who are able to}} secure pro bono legal service from British barristers. In the case of those nationals, such as Jamaicans, who also require visas in order to travel to the UK to pursue cases before the JCPC, there is the risk that the denial of the visa could negatively impact on the ability for their cases to be heard, thus further reducing potential accessibility (especially if the work load is not sufficient to justify the JCPC travelling to their jurisdiction instead). [...] By contrast, the CCJ, in most cases, is a much less expensive option for litigants in all comparative costs (filing, airfare, accommodations, other expenses, etc.). As the CARICOM has successfully pushed for visa free access by CARICOM nationals (except Haitians for now) to other member states, no citizen of any country that currently has the JCPC as its final court would need to apply for and exhaust financial resources obtaining a visa to travel to the seat of the CCJ or to any other state where the CCJ may sit. And by virtue of distance, travel to the seat of the CCJ in Trinidad, is much cheaper than travel to the UK. In fact physical travel to the seat of the CCJ itself in some cases is not necessary as the court itself (like the JCPC) is itinerant and (unlike the JCPC), the CCJ makes extensive use of electronic and teleconferencing facilities to reduce the cost to litigants. The CCJ has an e-filing system (which has been hailed as [...] "impressive") that makes provision for all court filing to be carried out electronically specifically in order to reduce to the cost to litigants of <b>filing</b> <b>documents</b> with the court and to keep its commitment of access to justice for all. The CCJ also utilizes the system to conduct hearings electronically, making use of teleconferencing equipment installed in all contracting states.|$|E

They are not only working on <b>filing</b> <b>documents,</b> but also analyzing those data they have. They require help from a visualization system to know the trend of immigration among offices across the country over time. We developed a project called CIS Map Drawer {{that is used to}} help build a visualization system for USCIS in order to analyze immigration data easily. This system makes use of a map view, a calendar visual representation, line charts, pixel drawing and other analysis tools to improve the efficiency of analysis process. Data is collected and updated by USCIS office. Map Drawer represents those data and provides users analysis tools for deeper understanding. Methods such as diverse colors are used both on the map and pixel drawing to improve the performance of this system. Our system is designed in a way to fit diverse monitor resolutions to avoid distortion. Some modules are currently under progress and more modules will be achieved to improve the visualization system in both layout and functions...|$|E
