5|$|The upper {{basin of}} the St. Johns was {{significantly}} lowered in the 1920s {{with the establishment}} of the Melbourne Tillman drainage project.

5|$|About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in Numantia, {{which is}} known as the First Numantine War, and a long war of {{resistance}} was fought between the advancing forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrived in 151 BC and began the process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary, Jewell {{approved}} the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP). The DRECP focuses on renewable energy and land conservation in California's desert. At the signing ceremony, held September 16, 2016, at the Santa Rosa & San Jacinto Mountains National Monument Visitor Center, Secretary Jewell stated phase one {{was intended to}} streamline approval for solar, wind, and geothermal projects. The DRECP also aimed to preserve 4.2million acres of land. Conservation groups viewed the initiative more favorably than did wind and solar developers, who criticized the DRECP for removing some public land designated for development.|$|E

5|$|During 1936, the Arab Revolt {{broke out}} in the British Mandate of Palestine. British troops were dispatched, ending the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war by the close of the year. Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With rising {{tensions}} in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere. The conclusion of the Munich Agreement—on 30September 1938—calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{attack by}} {{infantry}} in the 75th Division (XXI Corps) were {{to capture the}} line Tel el Turmus–Qastina–Yazur and then seize Mesmiye. On their left infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were to secure the line Yazur–Beshshit and then seize Qatra. After a pause for the artillery to be brought forward, the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al-Mansura for the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions were to be made. The first phase was due to start at 08:00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour's bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941 the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) {{was ordered}} to {{formulate}} an air superiority plan {{for the protection of}} three German capital ships to escape from France to Germany through the English Channel.

Both Cerberus and its supporting operation, Donnerkeil, were launched on 11 February 1942. During the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation the Germans achieved surprise.

Among other findings, before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had been badly neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1870s, {{following}} the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa, the Italians began a large naval expansion program, aimed at countering the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Re Umberto class was {{the culmination of}} the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program, which saw ten modern ironclad battleships built; these ships placed Italy with the third largest navy, after Great Britain and France. The three Re Umbertos were designed by Benedetto Brin, then the president of the Committee for Naval Projects. The first two ships were authorized in 1883, and in 1885 Brin, who was now the naval minister, proposed a third vessel.|$|E
5|$|Tadeusz Kościuszko {{proposed}} a plan where the entire Polish army would be concentrated and would engage {{one of the}} Russian armies, in order to assure numerical parity and to boost the morale of mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory; this plan was however rejected by Prince Poniatowski.

Poniatowski also planned to avoid serious engagements in the <b>first</b> <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, hoping to receive the expected Prussian reinforcements of 30,000 which would bring parity to the two sides.|$|E
