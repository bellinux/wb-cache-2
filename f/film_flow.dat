50|$|The heat {{transfer}} coefficient on the evaporating side of the tube is mostly determined by the hydrodynamic flow conditions of the film. For low mass flows or high viscosities the <b>film</b> <b>flow</b> can be laminar, in which case {{heat transfer}} is controlled purely by conduction through the film. Therefore in this condition the {{heat transfer coefficient}} decreases with increased mass flow. With increased mass flow the film becomes wavy laminar and then turbulent. Under turbulent conditions the heat transfer coefficient increases with increased flow.Evaporation takes place at very low mean temperature differences between heating medium and process stream, typically between 3 - 6K, therefore these devices are ideal for heat recovery in multi stage processes.A further advantage of the falling film evaporator is the very short residence time of the liquid {{and the absence of}} superheating of the same. Not considering the vapour separator, the residence time inside the tubes is measured in seconds, making it ideal for heat-sensitive products such as milk, fruit juice, pharmaceuticals, and many others.Falling film evaporators are also characterised by very low pressure drops; therefore, they are often used in deep vacuum applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} Vacuum Film Deaeration(VFD) {{based on the}} characteristics of fluid film on a rotating cone surface is carried out.

It is found that the thickness and the velocity of the <b>flowing</b> <b>film</b> on the rotating cone surface are the key parameters for VFD; the time of bubble remove mainly includes the growth time and the rest time; the velocity of bubble is slightly lagging behind the main flow; the low angular velocity has little effect on the film thickness; and the time of VFD for <b>flowing</b> <b>film</b> is less than that of static film...|$|R
40|$|We readdress a {{classical}} and practical problem {{as to whether}} viscoelasticity can have a measurable and beneficial effect on lubrication performance in thin <b>film</b> <b>flows.</b> In this paper, the viscoelasticity of the fluid is described by general Maxwell–Oldroyd type models. More specifically, it is modeled by the Phan-Thien–Tanner constitutive equations. A perturbation analysis for all the primary variables is carried out with the Deborah number as the perturbation parameter. The sequence of governing equations that results from the perturbation procedure is solved analytically up to first order in the Deborah number. Despite the inherent limitations of the perturbation method, the approach presented here demonstrates a reasonable way to determine the viscoelastic effects on lubrication performance in thin <b>film</b> <b>flows.</b> Numerical solutions indicate {{that there is a}} significant enhancement of the viscoelastic pressure when the minimum film thickness is sufficiently small. This mechanism suggests that viscoelasticity does indeed enhance the lubricant pressure field and produce a beneficial effect on lubrication performance, which is consistent with experimental observations...|$|R
