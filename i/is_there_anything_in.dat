6000|$|... 'He is cursedly {{familiar}} with the little Dacre. As the friend of her father, I think I shall interfere. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it, think you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{what your}} father says?" [...] Mrs. Davenant asked, {{as she passed}} her hand fondly over Walter's head, as {{he sat on a}} low stool beside her.|$|E
60|$|Allen {{saw that}} the river had simply widened at the spot, and that a hundred yards further on it flowed into a narrow channel, as before. Only on the side which he {{occupied}} <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{the shape of a}} shore. Opposite the rocks stood straight up, and were covered with moss and slime.|$|R
6000|$|But {{it was a}} lie, {{and they}} both {{knew that it was}} a lie. If love had existed before, <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> his {{helplessness}} and her long and tender care to make it less? Alas! no; rather was their companionship the more perfect and their sympathy the more complete. [...] "Propinquity, sir, propinquity," [...] as the wise man said;--we all know the evils of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then papa {{should not}} let him come here just as he pleases and {{whenever}} he likes. It is papa's fault;--that is to say it would <b>be</b> if <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} the nature of your question, Gerald," [...] Mr. Fentolin began. [...] "It is unlike you. You do not seem yourself. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> particular the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Brown's {{methods are}} not so crude. In the {{meantime}} we must send for a doctor, but before we do so, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> this room that might be of value to us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Lorry, {{look again}} upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as those two {{passengers}} were, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> his bulk and stature to render {{it unlikely that}} he was one of them?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{cannot be}} too often {{pointed out that}} in this annexation, the starting-point of our troubles, Great Britain, however mistaken she may have been, had no obvious selfish {{interest}} in view. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> no Rand mines in those days, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the country to tempt the most covetous. An empty treasury and two native wars were the reversion which we took over. It was honestly considered {{that the country was}} in too distracted a state to govern itself, and had, by its weakness, become a scandal and a danger to its neighbours. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> nothing sordid in our action, though it may have been both injudicious and high-handed.|$|R
60|$|The serang grinned; the Surtee man grinned; the winch began again, and {{the voices}} that called: 'Lower away! Stop her!' were as {{familiar}} as the friendly whiff from the lascars' galley or the slap of bare feet along the deck. But for {{the passage of a}} few impertinent years, I should have gone without hesitation to share their rice. Serangs used to be very kind to little white children below the age of caste. Most familiar of all was the ship itself. It had slipped my memory, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the rates charged to remind me, that single-screws still lingered in the gilt-edged passenger trade.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pirolo?' An {{unsteady}} voice lifted itself. 'Then tell us <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> except light <b>in</b> those {{lights of}} yours just now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it?" [...] said Geoffrey uneasily, as {{he shifted}} his hat to the right. [...] "I can't {{understand}} the report. She didn't complain to me a bit when I saw her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't confide.... Do I even {{confide in}} myself? I imagine I do.... <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> myself that I haven't looked {{squarely}} in the face?... How much are we going into? Even as regards facts? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say it-is-a-lie. Suspend the collection, indeed! Will the collectors, {{that have}} taken their oaths to make the collection, dare to end it? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> law {{requiring}} them to perjure themselves at the bidding of James Shields? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the second}} place, I suggest {{to him that}} if he will examine the policy {{proposed}} to be carried forward, he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> wrong <b>in</b> it. If you will examine the arguments that are made on it, you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> wrong <b>in</b> slavery.|$|R
60|$|It was a small, cosy room, not ill-furnished, {{and with}} a cheerful fire burning in the grate. Leaning against the mantelpiece, with his face towards us, was Cis, whose {{likeness}} to Lady Beatrice was so remarkable that I liked him heartily before we had exchanged a word. Standing by his side, with her head suspiciously near his shoulder, was a very fair girl, with nice figure and complexion and large blue eyes. Her face was certainly pretty, {{but it was not}} of a very high type of prettiness. The features, although regular of their sort, were not in any way refined or spirituelle, nor <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> her expression to redeem her from the mediocrity of good looks.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Yes, Miss Mannering, {{chaplain}}; <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> {{very new}} <b>in</b> that word? Had we not a chaplain at the Residence, {{when we were}} in India?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Minister {{signed to}} me to move a little nearer to him. [...] "I must say it," [...] he whispered, [...] "and I am afraid of her hearing me. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> her face that reminds you of her miserable mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "it's no use sending for me {{unless you}} mean to tell me everything. Have you been getting {{yourself}} into any trouble apart from our affairs, or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> connection with them which I don't know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My saviours, my brothers!' said Orestes, politely {{ignoring}} the laughter. 'How can I repay you? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> which my office here enables me--I {{will not say}} to reward, for {{that would be a}} term beneath your dignity as free barbarians--but to gratify you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE: [...] "You forget yourself, Mr. Ransom. Has <b>there</b> <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> my manner--conduct--to justify you {{in using}} such {{language}} to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{the world}} better than roast beef," [...] Brooks remarked, {{unfolding}} his serviette, [...] "I haven't found it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Forel, {{who was a}} good-tempered man, flushed a little. [...] "If <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> {{the stories}} I should take this very ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Loved him! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> him {{or about}} him that a woman could love? Is he not a poor social stick;--a bit of half-dead wood, good to make a post of, if one wants a post? I did want a post so sorely then!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And after what's 'appened, I didn't {{expect a}} visit from YOU, mem. I thought Mrs. Capting Walker was too great a dame to visit poor Harchibald Eglantine (though {{some of the first}} men in the country DO visit him). <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> which I can oblige you, mem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You too, then," [...] he said, [...] "can remember. Ambitious! Well, why not? To be Premier of England, {{to stand}} for the people, to carry through to its logical consummation a bloodless revolution, surely this is worth while. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the world better worth having than power?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the world,' said my aunt, {{with great}} {{decision}} and force of manner, 'that Mr. Dick is not, it's that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{this was}} the young man's conduct, <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> it that you can even blame? Which of you would have done otherwise? Which of you will tell me that in avenging the wrongs of a sister, or of a daughter, he would pause to measure {{the weight of his}} stick, or the number of his blows. Fancy each of you that you see the form of her you love best in the rough grasp of a violent seducer! Endeavour to bring home to yourselves the {{feelings}} to which such a sight would give rise within you! and then, if you can, find that young man guilty of murder, because his heart was warm to feel his sister's wrongs and his hand was strong to avenge them.|$|R
60|$|MR. PRESIDENT AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW YORK:--The facts {{with which}} I shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar; nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> new <b>in</b> the general use I shall make of them. If <b>there</b> shall <b>be</b> any novelty, {{it will be}} in the mode of {{presenting}} the facts, and the inferences and observations following that presentation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] Richard Fardell answered. [...] "I {{am going}} to ask you a question, Mr. Mannering. Go back a good many years, as many years as you like. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> your life as a younger man, say when you first entered Parliament, which--if it were brought up against you now--might be--embarrassing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely not, good seignior," [...] {{answered}} the burgher, [...] "the Liegeois are neither so idly {{curious as to}} practise such a custom, nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> your dress or appearance saving that which is most welcome to this city, and which our townsmen are both delighted to see and desirous to honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} you feel," [...] he proceeded; [...] "I am afraid of the discoveries which she may make; and I am {{strongly}} tempted to advise her to leave the proposed examination to her aunt's lawyer. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> your knowledge of Miss Emily's late father, which tells you that I am right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerry {{is such a}} far cry," [...] she replied. [...] "And if Jerry won {{from the}} Solomons to California, then <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anything</b> more {{remarkable}} <b>in</b> Michael so winning?--Oh, listen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Has {{it struck}} you that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> queer <b>in</b> his letters lately?" [...] she asked, looking away, her eyes all bright with tears.|$|R
60|$|Burdon was astonished, {{but he was}} irritated, too, {{and would}} not allow that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> strange <b>in</b> the {{cessation}} of the flowing blood.|$|R
