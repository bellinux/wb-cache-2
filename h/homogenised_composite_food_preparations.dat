40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to explore and provide evidence-based insight on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy in adolescents? homes. First, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted to understand (1) synthesize the literature on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy among adolescents, and (2) assess the methodological quality of these studies. The review comprised 38 articles and addressed how researchers conceptualize <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy, their rationale for including some aspects of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy, and reasons for the methodology utilized. Second, photovoice and Grounded Theory were combined to assess <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices {{in the homes of}} four rural families with an adolescent household member. The analysis shows adolescents were encouraged to participate in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> at home. The adolescents described their cooking experiences as challenging at first, but becoming easier overtime with practice. The adolescents believed <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> at home reduced stress and promoted bonding time with parents, but increased tiredness. On the other hand, the parents of adolescents reported their <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy and teaching strategies emerged from observation, motivation, and direct instruction. Time, age, emotion, and family (grandparents) helped to determine when teaching and learning occurred. Other factors that impacted learning and teaching were resources (T. V., computers), location (home, school), and feedback. Overall, the two studies identified three key findings: (1) not enough work is being done in the area of food preparation; (2) many factors influence how <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy is transmitted; and (3) <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> knowledge and skills are transmitted primarily through informal means. This study provides an initial theoretical model to understand the dynamics of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> training among adolescents. Further research is needed to test the model qualitatively and better understand the definition in the use of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy. Health policy advocates or policymakers, health educators, and dietitians may consider developing and testing educational and behavioral interventions related to <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> literacy for adolescents and their parents...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundThe {{amount of}} time spent on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and cooking may have {{implications}} for diet quality and health. However, little is known about how food-related time use relates to food consumption and spending, either at restaurants or for food consumed at home. PurposeTo quantitatively assess the associations among the {{amount of time}} habitually spent on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and patterns of self-reported food consumption, food spending, and frequency of restaurant use. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study of 1, 319 adults in a population-based survey conducted in 2008 – 2009. The sample was stratified into those who spent 2 hours/day on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and cleanup. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models examined differences between time-use groups. Analyses were conducted in 2011 – 2013. ResultsIndividuals who spent the least amount of time on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> tended to be working adults who placed a high priority on convenience. Greater {{amount of time spent}} on home <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> was associated with indicators of higher diet quality, including significantly more frequent intake of vegetables, salads, fruits, and fruit juices. Spending < 1 hour/day on <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> was associated with significantly more money spent on food away from home and more frequent use of fast food restaurants compared to those who spent more time on <b>food</b> <b>preparation.</b> ConclusionsThe findings indicate that time might be an essential ingredient in the production of healthier eating habits among adults. Further research should investigate the determinants of spending time on <b>food</b> <b>preparation...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Carrot {{greens are}} the most under-exploited class of greens despite of high {{nutritional}} value. In daily diet an increased intake of these inexpensive greens {{can be one of}} the strategies for improving the nutritional status. Keeping this in view, the present study was undertaken with the objective to develop commonly consumed <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> by separately incorporating fresh and dry carrot greens, applying different cooking methods. Levels of incorporation of fresh carrot greens in different <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> ranged 40 to 80 per cent whereas powder of dry carrot greens was added in different preparations at 7, 8 and 9 per cent levels. Organoleptic evaluation of all <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> were conducted by a panel of ten judges using Hopkin’s seven point scale. In fresh carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations,</b> the maximum and most acceptable level (80 %) of incorporation of under exploited carrot greens was in saag and minimum (40 %) in puri and kadhi. In dry carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations,</b> the most and best level (9 %) of incorporation of greens was in mathri and minimum (7 %) in matrey. Among all the fresh carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations,</b> gulabjamun scored highest (6. 96 + 0. 27) overall acceptability scores while laddoo scored minimum (5. 52 + 0. 68). In dry carrot greens incorporated <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> tacques scored highest (6. 31 + 0. 28) and laddoo scored minimum (5. 98 + 0. 69) overall acceptability scores. Beta carotene content in all <b>food</b> <b>preparations</b> increased significantly (P< 0. 01) with incorporation of fresh as well as dry carrot greens...|$|R
40|$|Frequent family {{meals and}} home <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> are {{considered}} important for children 2 ̆ 7 s nutritional health and weight maintenance. This cross-sectional study tested whether these parent-driven behaviors {{are related to}} the availability of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies in low-income urban households. Caregivers of children ages 6 - 13 provided information on family meal frequency, child consumption of home-prepared dinners, household food insecurity, and attitudes towards cooking. Researchers used a newly developed <b>Food</b> <b>Preparation</b> Checklist (FPC) to assess the availability of 41 <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies during a physical audit of the home environment. Caregivers and children provided anthropometric measurements and jointly reported on child dietary intake. In ordinal logistic regression models, greater home availability of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies was associated with more frequent family meals and child consumption of home-prepared dinners. Associations were independent of household financial strain, food insecurity, caregiver attitudes toward cooking, and sociodemographic characteristics. Fewer <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies were available in households characterized by greater food insecurity, lower income, and negative caregiver attitudes towards cooking, but did not differ by child or caregiver weight status. As in prior studies, more frequent family meals and consumption of home-prepared dinners were associated with healthier child dietary intake in several areas. We conclude that <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies are often limited in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged households, and their availability is related to the frequency with which children consume family meals and home-prepared dinners. The potential role of <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> supplies as contributors to socioeconomic disparities in child nutritional health and obesity deserves further study...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{factors affecting}} {{the duration of}} eating and <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> among adults in single decision-maker households. Eating time is differentiated into primary and secondary eating time and further differentiated by location: at home versus away from home. We construct a simple theoretical model, based on Becker’s household production approach, to motivate empirical equations for eating and <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> time. Empirical analysis is performed {{using data from the}} 2006 to 2008 Eating and Health Module of the American Time Use Survey. Higher food-at-home prices are found to be associated with more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and primary eating at home. Higher fast food prices are associated with more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and less time in primary eating at home. We conclude that food prices influence home production and time allocation decisions. We also find that low-income adults spend more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and primary eating at home and are less likely to eat away from home than those with more income. The presence of children in the household is associated with more time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and less time in primary eating away from home. Public policies attempting to effect an increase in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> among low-income, single adult households with children may need to account for limited opportunities such households can have to acquire and prepare healthier foods when additional time is required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop standardized mixed <b>composite</b> <b>foods</b> for assessing consumer acceptance and for achieving optimal accuracy in nutrient estimation of Pakistani meals. Since, it was a pilot study only two <b>composite</b> <b>foods</b> Dal maash (Phaseolus Radiata) and Tori Bujia (Luffa Segyptice) were selected. Nine recipes were selected from a recipe pool. Three different recipes for each <b>composite</b> <b>food</b> were prepared and evaluated by the Preference Evaluators (PE) for consumer acceptability. The <b>composite</b> <b>food</b> with the Highest Preference Score (HPS) was selected and subjected to the process of standardization. Both the mixed/composite foods were prepared and assessed on nine point Hedonic scale for consumer acceptability by sensory evaluation. Standardized recipes of both Dal maash and Tori Bhujia scored highest points with mean values ranging from 8. 0 - 8. 8 for three attributes of sensory evaluation taste, texture and color with LSD = 0. 30. The Nutritional assessment of the two standardized <b>composite</b> <b>foods</b> was calculated using Pakistani Food Tables (2001) and values were compared with the values of food items (cooked or raw) given the national food tables. The study concluded that nutritional composition of standardized <b>composite</b> <b>food</b> (Tory Bujia) differed remarkably from those presented as raw edible food part reflected in the Pakistani Food Composition Tables as the recipes are either not included in these food tables or have limitation for not being standardized...|$|R

40|$|Food {{demand is}} an {{important}} component of the agricultural sector and much <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> occurs in the home. While there is much information about the market cost of food, there has been no information about the <b>preparation</b> cost of <b>food</b> at home because there has been no data available on the quantity of time spent in <b>food</b> <b>preparation.</b> Using newly released time diary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this paper provides the first known estimates of the cost of time in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> at home.

40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>preparation</b> {{has become}} a massive {{phenomenon}} that {{grew up on a}} huge and increasing variety of media and channels. With different levels of specialization and skills, individuals show an increasing commitment in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and related discourses. In this setting we see three different dimensions that overlap and integrate: production, consumption, and self-representation. As such, <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> and its multiple, related practices enables a theoretical assessment of consumption theories that developed from the original “buy and own” approaches toward more recent contributions (e. g. presumption, sharing, etc.), according to which the consumer is responsible for creating and communicating value out of consumption resources and activities. We will discuss some of the recent theoretical developments which gave consumers {{a more active role in}} the market process and employ the <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> setting to demonstrate how these developments can be recognized and attached to empirical evidence...|$|R
40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} decade, the U. S. has {{struggled}} to effectively address the childhood obesity epidemic. Healthy eating is paramount to child health, {{especially in terms of}} obesity prevention. The rate of obese adolescents in grades 9 - 12 between 2005 and 2013 remained about the same in Georgia, decreased in New Jersey, and increased in Kentucky. It is possible that school meals could be different amongst these states. Methods: This study analyzed changes and differences in school <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices between 3 selected states. These regions were chosen based on their relatively low (New Jersey), intermediate (Georgia), and high (Kentucky) obesity rates. Both SHPPS 2006 and 2012 nutrition services data was chosen for this analysis to look at changes in school <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices in each state and in the overall sample over time using independent samples t-tests and one way ANOVA. Results: Overall, statistically significant changes (p 3 ̆c. 05) in <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices were observed in seven out of 22 <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practice variables between 2006 and 2012. New Jersey and Georgia improved their <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices between 2006 and 2012 while Kentucky improved in some areas and worsened in others. Between states comparisons showed Kentucky had several practices different from New Jersey and Georgia in 2006 but by 2012 there were very few differences between states. Discussion: These states have improved in some areas of school <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices while other areas still need improvement. The state with the highest adolescent obesity rate was the only state to show declines in the average use of healthier school <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices. Public health efforts should seek to address barriers to providing healthy foods in schools for regions that show the need for intervention...|$|R
40|$|Food-related choices have an {{important}} impact on health. <b>Food</b> <b>preparation</b> methods {{may be linked to}} diet and health benefits. However, the factors influencing people’s food choices, and how they are shaped by <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> experiences, are still not fully understood. We aimed to study home <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> practices, experiences and perceptions amongst adults in North East England. A matrix was used to purposively sample participants with diverse socio-demographic characteristics. Participants developed photographic food diaries that were used as prompts during semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using the Framework Method. Interviews were conducted with 18 adults (five men and 13 women), aged approximately 20 to 80 years, to reach data saturation. Participants’ practices varied widely, from reliance on pre-prepared foods, to preparing complex meals entirely from basic ingredients. Key themes emerged regarding the cook (identity), the task (process of cooking), and the context (situational drivers). Resources, in terms of time, money and facilities, were also underpinning influences on <b>food</b> <b>preparation.</b> Participants’ practices were determined by both personal motivations to cook, and the influence of others, and generally reflected compromises between varied competing demands and challenges in life. Most people appeared to be overall content with their <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> behaviour, though ideally aspired to cook more frequently, using basic ingredients. This often seemed to be driven by social desirability. Home <b>food</b> <b>preparation</b> is complex, with heterogeneous practices, experiences and perceptions both between individuals and within the same individual over time, according to shifting priorities and circumstances. Generalisability of these findings may be limited by the regional participant sample; however the results support and build upon previous research. Focussing interventions on life transition points at which priorities and circumstances change, with careful targeting to stimulate personal motivation and social norms, may prove effective in encouraging home <b>food</b> <b>preparation...</b>|$|R
