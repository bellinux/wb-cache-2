5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripperâ€™s disease, a <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>pneumonitis.</b> Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Some of the diagnoses {{that can}} result from the {{mechanisms}} explained above include irritant contact dermatitis; allergic contact dermatitis; occupational acne; tracheitis; esophagitis; bronchitis; asthma; allergy; <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> (HP); and worsening of pre-existing respiratory problems.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF), <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>pneumonitis,</b> sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there is}} no {{definite}} proof, there are compelling reasons to think the sport of racing pigeons may go back {{at least as far}} as 220 AD or possibly earlier. [...] The sport achieved a great deal of popularity in Belgium in the mid 19th century. The pigeon fanciers of Belgium were so taken with the hobby that they began to develop pigeons specially cultivated for fast flight and long endurance called Voyageurs. From Belgium the modern version of the sport and the Voyageurs which the Flemish fanciers developed spread to most parts of the world. Once quite popular, the sport has experienced a downturn in participants in some parts of the world in recent years, possibly due to the rising cost of living, ageing fanciers, and a severe lack of public interest. <b>Hypersensitivity</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> is also a reason why some people are leaving the sport ...|$|E

Also, unlike asthma, <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> targets lung alveoli rather than bronchi.|$|E
