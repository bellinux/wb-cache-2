40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori is {{the primary}} cause of peptic ulcer disease and an {{etiologic}} agent in the development of gastric cancer. A high frequency of H. pylori infection has been reported from resource-poor regions. H. pylori infection is curable with regimens of multiple antimicrobial agents. However, antibiotic resistance is a leading cause of treatment failure. In Africa, there are very little data concerning the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates to antibiotics. Methodology: H. pylori isolates from gastric biopsies from outpatients ≥ 18 years old affected by a <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> were used in this study. Susceptibility testing was performed for amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole by using the Epsilometer test (E-test) method. Results: H. pylori strains were isolated from 40 patients of whom 36 were diagnosed as having duodenal ulcer, two with gastric ulcer, and two with <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Thirty-six (90 %) of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole (MICs ≥ 8 µg/l), whereas all isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin (MICs ≤ 0. 5 µg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MICs ≤ 1 µg/ml). Conclusion: These data suggest that metronidazole should not be used therapeutically among Senegalese patients in first-line therapy, while ciprofloxacin could be recommended in association with amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor in Senegal...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Brain tumors, {{traumatic}} head injury, {{and other}} intracranial processes including infections, can cause {{increased intracranial pressure}} and lead to overstimulation of the vagus nerve. As a result, increased secretion of gastric acid may occur which leads to <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> formation known as Cushing's ulcer. METHODS: A review of original records of Dr. Harvey Cushing's patients suffering from gastro-duodenal ulcers was performed followed by {{a discussion of the}} available literature. We also reviewed the clinical records of the patients never reported by Cushing to gain his perspective in describing this phenomenon. Dr. Cushing was intrigued to investigate gastro-duodenal ulcers as he lost patients to acute gastrointestinal perforations following successful brain tumor operations. It is indeed ironic that Harvey Cushing developed a <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> in his later years with failing health. RESULTS: Clinically shown by Cushing's Yale Registry, a tumor or lesion can disrupt this circuitry, leading to gastroduodenal ulceration. Cushing said that it was "reasonable to believe that the perforations following posterior fossa cerebellar operations were produced in like fashion by an irritative disturbance either of fiber tracts or vagal centers in the brain stem. " CONCLUSION: Harvey Cushing's pioneering work depicted in his Yale registry serves as a milestone for continuing research that can further discern this pathway...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} {{is the main}} cause of gastritis, <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer,</b> and gastric cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as endogenous silencers of numerous target genes. Many miRNA genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Recent discoveries have shed new light on the involvement of miRNAs in gastric malignancy. However, at the same time, several miRNAs have been associated with opposing events, leading to reduced inflammation, inhibition of malignancy, and increased apoptosis of transformed cells. The regulation of miRNA expression could be a novel strategy in the chemoprevention of human gastric malignancy. In this article, the biological importance of miRNAs in gastric malignancy is summarized...|$|E

40|$|Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) {{are very}} {{effective}} in inhibiting acid secretion and are extensively used in many acid related diseases. They are also often used in patients with cirrhosis sometimes {{in the absence of}} a specific acid related disease, with the aim of preventing peptic complications in patients with variceal or hypertensive gastropathic bleeding receiving multidrug treatment. Contradicting reports support their use in cirrhosis and evidence of their efficacy in this condition is poor. Moreover there are convincing papers suggesting that acid secretion is reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis. With regard to Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection, its prevalence in patients with cirrhosis is largely variable among different studies, and it seems that H pylori eradication does not prevent <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> formation and bleeding. With regard to the prevention and treatment of oesophageal complications after banding or sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices, there is little evidence for a protective role of PPI. Moreover, due to liver metabolism of PPI, the dose of most available PPIs should be reduced in cirrhotics. In conclusion, the use of this class of drugs seems more habit related than evidence-based eventually leading to an increase in health costs...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach for}} management of retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF), an inflammatory process of retroperitoneal fibro-adipose tissue, {{leading to the}} compression and obstruction of the ureters and other adjacent organs is ureterolysis with omental wrapping, and an effective alternative to surgery is immunosupressive medication such as oral corticosteroids. Sairei-to (TJ- 114) is a traditional herbal medicine used {{for the treatment of}} RF in Japan. It has both anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects. Here we report two cases of RF successfully treated with Sairei-to. One case was idiopathic and the other was caused by artificial graft-induced vasculitis. Both cases were treated with Sairei-to following the decompression of uremia by precutaneous nephrostomy or indwelling ureteral stents. There was hardly any ureteral obstruction three months after the administration of Sairei-to. They have been doing well for 12 and 26 months. Sairei-to rarely causes side effects such as immunodeficiency, <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> and osteoporosis that often accompany long-term administration of corticosteroids. Sairei-to is a safe and effective medicine for the treatment of RF.

Helicobacter pylori was detected more frequently in cases than controls but only in 32. 0 % versus 20. 1 % in controls (P = 0. 001). Independent exposure factors for gastric ulcers were male gender (P = 0. 001), chronic neurologic disease (P = 0. 015), chronic renal disease (P < 0. 001) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug consumption (P = 0. 035).

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{powerful}} acid-suppressive drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has revolutionized {{the management of}} acid-related diseases and has minimized the role of surgery. The major and universally recognized indications for their use are represented by treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection in combination with antibiotics, therapy of H. pylori-negative peptic ulcers, healing and prophylaxis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastric ulcers and control of several acid hypersecretory conditions. However, in the last decade, we have witnessed an almost continuous growth of their use and this phenomenon cannot be only explained by the simple substitution of the previous H 2 -receptor antagonists, but also by an inappropriate prescription of these drugs. This endless increase of PPI utilization has created an important problem for many regulatory authorities in terms of increased costs and greater potential risk of adverse events. The main reasons for this overuse of PPIs are the prevention of <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> in low-risk patients or the stress ulcer prophylaxis in non-intensive care units, steroid therapy alone, anticoagulant treatment without risk factors for gastro-duodenal injury, the overtreatment of functional dyspepsia and a wrong diagnosis of acid-related disorder.

Omeprazole is used for the treatment of <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Dissolution of various marketed products was performed using USP type I apparatus in 0. 1 N HCl for 2 h and in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer for 1 h at 100 rpm. The separation of enantiomers was done using a chiral HPLC method on CHIRAL AGP column (100 x 4. 6 mm i. d.). The wavelength for UV detection was set at 210 nm. The mobile phase was 10 mM phosphate buffer with 5 % acetonitrile adjusted to pH 6. 5 at a flow rate of 0. 9 ml min- 1 with an injector valve fitted to a 50 &# 956;L volume sample loop. The retention times for R and S enantiomers of omeprazole were 5 and 7. 5 min, respectively. The dissolution of S enantiomer of Ocid- 20 and Omee was found to be significantly more compared to their R enantiomer at 5 and 10 min dissolution time points after which there was no stereospecific discrimination in the dissolution.

The risks of several conditions, including hypertension, myocardial infarction and other heart diseases, asthma, tuberculosis and kidney disease were elevated among ex-smokers. The diseases showing elevated risks among current smokers and significantly positive dose-risk trends included acute bronchitis (relative risk, RR = 3. 2 for heavy cigarette smokers vs never smokers), chronic bronchitis or lung emphysema (RR = 2. 0), <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> (RR = 1. 8) and bone fractures (RR = 1. 6). For respiratory conditions, the risk of pipe or cigar smokers was {{comparable to that of}} moderate cigarette smokers, whereas for ulcer (RR = 4. 1) or fractures (RR = 2. 0) the point estimates were even higher than for heavy cigarette smokers. Smokers tended to consult more frequently general practitioners, used more other outpatients services, and were more frequently admitted to hospital during the year preceding the interview. These effects were consistent across strata of age, socio-economic indicators, and persisted after allowance for major identified potential distorting factors.

40|$|Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} {{is the main}} cause of <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> The molecular mechanisms that underlying this progress are still not very clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulator of nu-merous target genes at posttranscriptional lev-el. miRNAs plays important roles in the devel-opment of many infection related diseases. The roles of miRNAs in the development of H. pylori-infected gastroduodenal ulcer haven’t been well studied yet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The miRNA and mRNA profiles in normal gastroduodenal biopsy, H. pylori-infected gastroduodenal biop-sy and H. pylori-infected gastroduodenal ulcer biopsy samples were compared and analyzed to identify potential related miRNAs and their target genes. The differential expression of the identified miRNAs and their target gene were validated in an independent set of H. pylori positive gastroduodenal ulcer biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry staining and RT-PCR. Then microRNA mimics were transfected to gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori 26695 (cagA+). RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to confirm the target gene of the identified microRNAs. RESULTS: The integrative analysis and im-munohistochemistry staining validation indicat-ed that miR- 155 and miR- 146 b, as well as their predicted target gene IL 6, are up-regulated in H. pylori positive gastroduodenal ulcer. Further experiments in gastric epithelial cells revealed that H. pylori 26695 (cagA+) infection induces IL 6 overexpression. But the overexpression of IL 6 is weaken due to negative regulation by miR- 155 and miR- 146 b. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the up-regulation of miR- 155 and miR- 146 b de-creases H. pylori (cagA+) -introduced IL 6 over-expression, which might weaken the cleanup of H. pylori (cagA+) and contributes to ulcer...|$|E

Prognostic factors were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model. All cases of <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> perforations diagnosed in Sweden from 1974 to 2002 were identified using the National Hospital Discharge Register and incidence figures were calculated. Information on sales of ASA/NSAID´s {{was obtained from the}} National Prescription Survey. Results and conclusions: Incidence of peptic-ulcer perforations has decreased in Sweden since the late 1980 ?s, after the introduction of the proton pump inhibitors (PPI), despite an increase in sales of NSAID/ASA of 28 % during this period. The reason for this is probably multifactorial (cohort phenomena, smoking habits, Helicobacter pylori), but the increasing use of PPI might have protected the population from NSAID complications and thus contributed to the fall in incidence. In oesophageal perforations, a CAT scan or a contrast plain film investigation had the highest degree of true positive investigations. Regarding peptic ulcer perforations a plain film was the most widely used investigation and it was true positive in 75 % of cases. In oesophageal perforations, pre-operative ASA-score was the only factor that significantly influenced outcome. Perforations in the thoracic part of the oesophagus had worse prognosis than perforations in the neck. Treatment with a covered stent with or without open drainage had the lowest mortality. Diversion by a pharyngostoma did not improve survival. In patients with a peptic ulcer perforation, age > 75 years, significant co-morbidity, location in the stomach and > 24 hours from symptoms to operation, had a negative impact on outcome.

40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori {{elicited}} IL 1 B {{is one of}} {{the various}} modulators responsible for perturbation of acid secretion in gut. We have earlier reported that IL 1 B activated NFkB downregulates gastrin, a major modulator of acid secretion. However, we hypothesized that regulation of gastrin by IL 1 B would depend on the cell’s ability to integrate inputs from multiple signaling pathways to generate appropriate biological response. Principal Finding: In this study, we report that IL 1 B induces Smad 7 expression by about 4. 5 fold in gastric carcinoma cell line, AGS. Smad 7 resulted in transcriptional repression of gastrin promoter by about 6. 5 fold when co -transfected with Smad 7 expression vector and gastrin-promoter luciferase in AGS cells. IL 1 B inhibited phosphorylation of Smad 3 and subsequently interfered with nuclear translocation of the positive Smad complex, thus occluding it off the gastrin promoter. IL 1 B promoter polymorphisms (- 511 T/- 31 C IL 1 B) are known to be associated with H. pylori associated <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> We observed that IL 1 B expressed from - 31 T promoter driven IL 1 B cDNA elicited 3. 5 fold more Smad 7 than that expressed from the IL 1 B- 31 C variant in AGS cells. This differential activation of Smad 7 by IL 1 B promoter variants translated into differential downregulation of gastrin expression. We further analyzed Smad 7, NFkB, IL 1 B and gastrin expression in antral gut biopsy samples of patients with H. pylori associated duodenal ulcer and normal individuals. We observed that individuals with duodenal ulcer had significantly lower levels of IL 1 B, Smad 7, NFkB and corresponding higher level of gastrin expression. Conclusion: Pro-inflammatory cytokine IL 1 B repress gastrin expression by activating Smad 7 and subsequent inhibition of nuclear localization of Smad 3 / 4 complex. Polymorphic promoter variants of IL 1 B gene can modulate the IL 1 B expression which resulted in differential activation Smad 7 and consequent repression of gastrin expression, respectively. Analysis of H. pylori infected duodenal ulcer patient’s gut biopsy samples also supported this observation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Infection {{with the}} {{bacterium}} Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{is still one}} of the leading causes of gastritis and <b>gastro-duodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> and predisposes to risk for gastric cancer. Considering the increasing prevalence of resistance to antibiotics, the development of a reliable vaccine against H. pylori infections would constitute a major advance in the prevention of gastrointestinal illnesses. The objective of this work, which was carried out as part of a collaborative Helicobacter pylori vaccine study of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Infection Biology in Berlin and the Charité University Medicine Berlin, was to identify and characterize the role of forkhead box protein P 3 (FOXP 3) -expressing regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) in the antral and duodenal mucosa in the pro-tection against H. pylori persistence and in the immunomodulation during infection. The work in-cludes the analysis of expression patterns of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), of the immunomodulatory cytokine interferon-γ (INFγ), and of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) during the course of an infection. Methods: 43 healthy H. pylori-negative participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Eleven participants received the H. pylori Urease A/B vaccine (DB 2), another 11 participants received a vaccine with the H. pylori-spezific antigen HP 231 (DB 4), and a control group of 21 participants received the adjuvant only (Typhoral® L, an oral typhoid vaccine). All participants received a dosis of 105 bacteria of the H. pylori Baylor strain six weeks after vaccination. Histopathological examina-tions of the antral and duodenal mucosa biopsies were performed before and during the infection. Expression of FOXP 3 + Treg in the antrum and duodenum was assessed with immunohistochemistry. Cytokine concentrations (INFγ, TNFα, IL- 4 und IL- 10) in the biopsy supernatants were measured via multiplex analyses using the Cytometric bead array (CBA), followed by flow cytometry. Results: Four of the 43 (9. 3 %) eradicated the infection (one participant from the DB 4 group and three participants from the control group). There were no significant between-group differences regarding either FOXP 3 + Treg or cytokine levels (INFγ, TNFα, IL- 4 und IL- 10) during the course of the infection. Participants successfully eradicating H. pylori exhibited, however, moderate alterations of cytokine and FOXP 3 patterns. Conclusion: The DB 2 and DB 4 vaccines had no protective influence on H. pylori infection. The present results do not provide sufficient information with respect to a potential mechanism underly-ing H. pylori eradication. The study nevertheless provides further support for the hypothesis that successful eradication involves the Th 1 immune response...|$|E
