5000|$|In the Baal Cycle, Ba'al Hadad is {{challenged}} by and defeats Yam, using two magical weapons (called [...] "Driver" [...] and [...] "Chaser") made {{for him by}} Kothar-wa-Khasis. Afterward, {{with the help of}} Athirat and Anat, Ba'al persuades El to allow him a palace. El approves, and the palace is built by Kothar-wa-Khasis. After the palace is constructed, Ba'al gives forth a thunderous roar out of the palace window and challenges Mot. Mot enters through the window and swallows Ba'al, sending him to the Underworld. With no one to give rain, there is a terrible drought in Ba'al's absence. The other deities, especially El and Anat, are distraught that Ba'al has been taken to the Underworld. Anat goes to the Underworld, attacks Mot with a <b>knife,</b> <b>grinds</b> him up into pieces, and scatters him far and wide. With Mot defeated, Ba'al is able to return and refresh the Earth with rain.|$|R

Women make the textiles and pottery in their free time. Men {{are involved in}} blacksmithing, carpentry, cutlery and harness making, working at home. Children begin to learn craft work about six years. Because of its importance in the regional economy, the craftsmanship of palm products deserves a special reference. Palms are used to make hats, mats, purses, toys, brooms, handbags and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Sabre grind — Similar to a flat grind blade {{except that}} the bevel starts at about {{the middle of the}} blade, not the spine. Also {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "V Grind", made with strength in mind and found on tactical and military <b>knives.</b> A Sabre <b>grind</b> without a secondary bevel is called a [...] "Scandinavian Grind," [...] which is easier to sharpen due to the large surface.

50|$|If {{no power}} {{equipment}} is available, {{this can be}} done with files if the piece of steel has not yet been hardened. Grinding wheels, or small belt sanders are usually what a beginner uses. Well equipped makers usually use a large industrial belt grinder, or a belt grinder made specifically for <b>knife</b> making. Pre-polish <b>grinding</b> on a heat treated blade can be done if the blade is kept cool, to preserve the temper of the steel. Some knife makers will use a coolant mist on the grinder to achieve this.|$|R
40|$|The Danish project “Organic Aquaculture” {{the link}} between {{sustainable}} production and superior products” is examining the availability of relevant organically produced crops with a high protein content {{to be used as}} raw materials for fish feed. Fish meal is the main source of protein for fish feed. On a global scale the production of fish meal will not increase. There is a demand for developing sustainable protein sources as a substitution for fish meal. Protein from crops and legumes is an obvious solution, however, the crops and legumes need to be processed into fractions with a higher protein content in order to compete with fish meal. The process development was carried out at The Danish Technological Institute’s pilot plant located in Sdr. Stenderup, Denmark. Sweet lupine seeds were processed among other grains and legumes. A dehulling process was developed based on three process steps: <b>knife</b> mill <b>grinding,</b> vibration sifting and zig zag air classifying. The protein content was concentrated from 34...|$|R
40|$|Different ground stone tool production-distribution {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} as present {{at the site of}} Huizui in the Yiluo River Basin, central China, during the Erlitou period (1900 - 1500 BC). The current study used an economic approach to identify if differences could be observed between the systems. Using efficiency as the main parameter for comparison; raw material procurement and on-site production were investigated. Raw material procurement was shown to be efficient for all of the tool types studied, with particular focus on distance to source and the functional and extractive properties of the raw materials. Efficiency in production was less clear, with scale of production instead being the distinguishing factor. In total, two different production-distribution systems were identified; the mass produced oolitic dolomite spades which appear to be distributed regionally, and the locally produced and consumed adzes, axes, chisels, <b>knifes</b> and <b>grinding</b> slabs. Both of these systems appeared to be retained within the household context and may have operated independently of elite control, which is a contrast to the heavily circumscribed production and distribution of elite items. This study also showed that whilst efficiency is a useful tool to elicit detailed information from the stone tool production-distribution systems, further parameters need to be included to provide a more accurate contrast between systems...|$|R
50|$|Was {{built around}} 1722 and {{had one of}} the largest wheels in the valley with a {{diameter}} of 15 ft. It was owned by the Windle brothers between 1818 and 1852 who used it for <b>grinding</b> <b>knives</b> and razors, after which it was sold to the Water Company. The mill was in regular use until 1918, but a survey in 1934 revealed that the internal machinery had been dismantled. The pond that served the Wolf Wheel is still in fine condition and has received much attention from the RVCG. It is one of four dams that are used by fishermen in the valley and surrounding wildlife includes Dragonfly's such as the common darter Sympetrum striolatum and the common hawker, Aeshna juncea. Other wildlife includes Kingfisher's, great diving beetles and amphibians such as the common frog and palmate newt.|$|R
60|$|He made a {{sufficiently}} {{poor job of}} it; and to his surprise too, for the cleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed {{an easy thing to}} do. It was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it at last. He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now; however, he was not to lose this thrifty dame's society so easily. She furnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got through with after a fair fashion and with some credit. Then she set him and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so awkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a butcher <b>knife</b> to <b>grind.</b> Afterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid the good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in the matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in story-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. And when, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket of kittens to drown, he did resign. At least he was just going to resign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and {{it seemed to him that}} to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right thing--when there was an interruption. The interruption was John Canty--with a peddler's pack on his back--and Hugo.|$|R
40|$|Deflashing is {{the process}} of removal of excess flashes from the rubber products. Initially {{deflashing}} was a manual operation where dozen of workers, seated at small work stations would take each part and trim the excess rubber off with scissors, <b>knives</b> or by <b>grinding.</b> Still the same method is employed in most of the rubber industry. The drawbacks of this method are demand inconsistent and repeatable quality. Work done by hand is often inconsistent. There are commercially available cryogenic deflashing machine but they are too expensive hence cost effectiveness is also a prime factor. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a technique, to identify the media through which the flashes can be removed easily and effectively. Based on the test results obtained from testing of five different types of media, ABCUT Steel media gave best results. The testing of the ABCUT Steel media on rubber samples like O-rings, grommet tail door, bottom bush etc. shows good results...|$|R
50|$|The Porter, {{like the}} other rivers in Sheffield, is ideally suited for {{providing}} water power, as the final section falls some 450 ft in a little over 4 mi. This enabled dams to be constructed reasonably close together, without the outflow from one mill being restricted by the next downstream dam. In addition to this water-power, natural sandstone was available in abundance in the nearby hills of Sheffield and the Peak District National Park. Lying {{at the edge of}} these hills, mill-owners found Millstone Grit was an easily extractable resource. By 1740 Sheffield became the most extensive user of water-power in Britain and probably in Europe. Ninety mills had been built, two-thirds of them for grinding. By 1850 these mills numbered well over 100. In the Porter valley alone 21 mill dams served 19 water-wheels, mostly used for grinding corn, operating forge-hammers, and rolling mills, <b>grinding</b> <b>knives</b> and the various types of blade that made Sheffield famous. Most were active during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
50|$|The grade two listed mill {{stands at}} the {{junction}} of Stannington Road and Holme Lane. The earliest written records for a mill on this site date from 1739; at {{that time it was}} used for <b>grinding</b> <b>knives.</b> It {{is one of the few}} remaining examples of an undershot water wheel in the country, it is six metres in diameter and 2.5 metres wide. The mill was completely destroyed in the flood of 1864 and was rebuilt by the Wilson family. Around 1915 it was converted to a corn mill by the Marsden family and operated until 1956. Since then it has been a Comet store, Chinese restaurant and a clothing store before becoming disused. In 2006 Sheffield City Council granted permission for 23 new apartments to be built on the site; the plans include strict controls to preserve the historic building and water wheel. The apartments and the restoration were completed in the second half of 2008.|$|R
50|$|An {{appropriate}} grind {{will depend}} upon what the blade {{is to be used}} for and the material from which the blade is made. Knife manufacturers may offer the same model of <b>knife</b> with different <b>grinds</b> on the blade and owners of a blade may choose to reshape it as a different grind to obtain different blade properties. A trade-off exists between a blade's ability to take an edge and its ability to keep an edge. Various grinds are easier to maintain than others or can provide a better shape {{over the life of the}} blade as the blade is worn away by repeated sharpening. In material science terms, harder steels take sharper edges, but are more brittle and hence chip more easily, while softer steels are tougher, and are used for knives such as cleavers which must be tough but do not require a sharp edge. In the range of hardnesses used for knives, the relationship between hardness and toughness is fairly complex and high hardness and high toughness are often possible at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Development of Cleanup Methods for PCB Containing Elastic Sealant Used in Outdoor Joints between Concrete Blocks in Buildings. The {{goals of}} the project were to develop cleanup methods for PCB {{containing}} elastic sealants used in outdoor joints between concrete blocks and to minimise the PCB spread to the outdoor environment, to the indoor air and also to keep the PCB levels as low as reasonably possible in the workplace environment during the work with taking away the sealant. Analyses of PCB are done within the project. The cleanup process consisted of different steps, (1) cutting the elastic sealant with an oscillating <b>knife,</b> (2) <b>grinding</b> of the concrete with a mechanical machine, (3) sawing the concrete with a machine (4) cutting the concrete with a machine chisel. At all these different steps a high capacity vacuum cleaner which {{was connected to the}} machines was used. The following PCB analyses were done (1) concentration in the elastic sealant, (2) concentration in the concrete close to the sealant, (3) concentration in soil, (4) concentration in the indoor air, (5) concentration in the air in the workplace environment. The elastic sealant contained 6 % total PCB of a technical product with a composition most similar to Clophen A 40. The concrete close to the sealant (first 1 - 2 mm) contained 0, 11 % and 1, 7 % total PCB at two different places. The pattern of the PCBs resembled that of the sealant. PCB concentrations, å 7 PCB, in the soil increased during the work with the sealants with 0, 08 mg/kg dry soil 1 meter from the building and with less than 0, 03 mg/kg dry soil 10 meters from the building. The source of the PCB in the soil is most likely the sealant as the pattern of the PCB-congenes is similar. The PCB levels in the workplace air {{in the beginning of the}} project when the equipment used were not fully developed were generally above the occupational exposure limit 10 mg/m 3 (up to 120 mg/m 3). Later when the equipment were optimised to better take care of dust and gases produced during the cutting and grinding etc, levels were below or close to 10 mg/m 3. The pattern of the PCBs in the workplace air was different from that of the sealant containing more of the lighter components. The PCB concentration in the indoor air were measured before and under the work with cleaning-up the sealants. The levels were around 600 ng/m 3 and there was no significant increase during the work with taking away the sealant. The PCB level indoor, after the work with cleaning-up the sealants, does not show any decrease two months after the end of the work. The pattern of the PCBs in the indoor air were different from that of the sealant as well as that of the work place air, more of the lighter PCB were present indoors compared to the composition in both workplace air and in sealant...|$|R
