He presented the idea to Atlantic Records chairman Craig Kallman, {{and one of the}} company's artists, T.I., got an acting role in the film. However, the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures owned the rights to the film; [...] "It was a Universal film and they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack to WMG" [...] (Atlantic's parent company). Thus Scott brought back Marc Streitenfeld, who had worked with him in A Good Year. The composer stated that [...] "the overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker" [...] given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of blues and soul music to fit the 1970s setting. The musical score for American Gangster was recorded between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself. Additional score material was composed and recorded by Hank Shocklee.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Scott Mendelson of Forbes criticized the film {{for being too}} [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "gritty," [...] saying that the film lacked in humor or excitement, offering little nuance and little artistic interpretation beyond hitting the expected goal posts. He added, [...] "Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings is a terrible film. It is a badly acted and badly written melodrama that takes what should be a passionate and emotionally wrenching story and drains it of all life and all dramatic interest." [...] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com in his review said, [...] "Ridley Scott [...] do a plague well, and here, he gets to do 10 of them. But is this oh-so-familiar tale still fresh enough to get people into theaters in the droves needed to make back the very high production values that we see on screen?" [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap also gave a negative review and said, [...] "If you're going into Exodus: Gods and Kings thinking that director Ridley Scott is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> Moses story anything we didn't already get from Cecil B.

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> charge {{was one of the}} most important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

Her delivery is real confident now. It's definitely a new Kelly Rowland. She wouldn't even let me put autotune on her voice this time round. She was like 'No, I want people to really get me'." [...] The following month, Rowland told MTV News that the album would have a theme and that she had been documenting the recording process of the album for her fans to see. During an interview with Vegas magazine in June 2012, she described the album as a dedication to [...] "my ladies". She explained, [...] "I want to tell women how incredible we are, how our intuition is so spot-on. Sometimes we don't listen to it, but it is the thing that can actually make us happier." [...] Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder as the album's inspirations.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 Coppola {{was charged}} in the 1977 killing of John [...] "Johnny Cokes" [...] Lardiere. According to authorities, Lardiere was {{released}} for 26 hours from prison to spend the Easter holidays with his family. The reason for his sanctioned killing aren't fully known, but is speculated that he had turned against the mob and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> FBI information on the mob's influence on garbage hauling. Another story has it that Lardiere got into a heated argument with Ralph [...] "Blackie" [...] Napoli, a caporegime in the Philadelphia crime family and his death was ordered. When Lardiere {{got out of his}} car at a Bridgewater, New Jersey motel, Coppola {{was standing in front of}} him with a [...]22 automatic pistol, complete with a silencer. When Coppola squeezed the trigger, the gun jammed. Lardiere was both amused and annoyed by the man and allegedly said [...] "What're you gonna do now, tough guy?". Coppola responded by pulling up his pant leg, and removing a [...]38 revolver from an ankle holster and shooting Lardiere four times. When police arrived at the crime scene, they knew immediately it was a mob hit. The shooter had left behind his weapons and a hat. In 1996 Lucchese crime family mobster Thomas [...] "Tommy" [...] Ricciardi who had been arrested on murder and extortion charges, decided to cooperate with authorities. He told the FBI that Lardiere's killer was Michael Coppola. Ricciardi told police that he heard the entire story of Lardiere's murder from Coppola while talking about mob murders with Michael Taccetta at a party in 1983.|$|E
