500|$|Arguing that The Day After Tomorrow is [...] "kinda like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey... for kids", science-fiction {{writer and}} {{reviewer}} Christopher Mills expresses disappointment with {{the effect of}} the black hole itself, but describes the fall into the anomaly as [...] "very colourful". However, in contrast with Muir, he views the sequences set inside Altares during the descent as [...] "a bit of a hoot", directing particular criticism at the actors' exaggerated gesticulations. Commenting that the plot contains [...] "plenty of wonky pseudo-science and insanely improbable coincidences", Mills also recalls his fascination at [...] "how 'British'... the characters , facing each new peril with remarkable calm and 'stiff upper lip' stoicism. By the time they're caught in the clutches of the ominous black hole, they're apparently so resigned to being jerked around by the universe that they <b>just</b> <b>hold</b> hands and calmly await their fate." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Human Nature" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a positive review, stating that [...] "for years, Madonna spoke in metaphors, fantasies and blatant shock tactics, but the performer indignantly struck {{back at her}} critics on 'Human Nature'. She didn't <b>just</b> <b>hold</b> up a mirror, she became the mirror". Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review of the song, commenting that [...] "Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre", adding that [...] "Madonna's message is still 'Express yourself, don't repress yourself.' This time, however, it comes not with a bang but a whisper". Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 11 on his list of [...] "30 Ultimate Madonna Singles", stating that the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets" [...] was a [...] "Madonna mantra {{if ever there was}} one".|$|E

500|$|Spears {{explained}} that since {{she did not}} tour to promote Blackout, she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, [...] "We're going to be doing the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance— and if I do a trick, she doesn't <b>just</b> <b>hold</b> the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations." [...] The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2.

500|$|Bradley Stern from MuuMuse {{felt that}} since [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was a {{previous}} unheard track not present among the leaks, {{it was the}} most surprising. With the ample presence of melodies, Stern reminisced that one of the major complaints about Madonna's past few studio albums was a lack of memorable lyrics, which was dissipated with [...] "Ghosttown". Quoting a part of the lyrics—"When the world gets cold I'll be your cover/Let's <b>just</b> <b>hold</b> onto each other."—Stern added that the song [...] "is a gorgeously earnest, us-against-the-world anthem tailored for two souls wandering alone in this mad, mad world." [...] Giving the song a rating of two-and-a-half out of five stars, Hardeep Phull from the New York Post described it as musically and emotionally [...] "hectic", but found it to be tender and simple while being a [...] "big synth-ballad of solidarity". Writing for i-D, Nick Levine felt that [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was enhanced as a song by the [...] "glorious stealth bomb of a chorus". Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald commended Billboard's production techniques, and the blend of EDM and lyrical introspection, while focusing on the [...] "catchy" [...] chorus. Jon Pareles from The New York Times found the song to be a mixture of [...] "affection and post-apocalyptic gloom", adding that [...] "it begs for a dystopian-romance video". Michael Jose Gonzalez from Danish music magazine, Gaffa, praised Madonna's decision to give emphasis on her singing, with [...] "trouble embossed and melodic" [...] tracks like [...] "Ghosttown".|$|E

[...] Sagal also mentioned during the same interview that Groening told her at Comic-Con that [...] "we'll find a place" [...] and [...] "don't worry, it's not going to end" [...] (in Sagal's words).|$|E
2500|$|The wild food guru of the 1960s, Euell Gibbons, {{gathered}} and ate chenopods. [...] "In rich soil," [...] he said, [...] "lamb's quarters will grow {{four or five}} feet high if not disturbed, becoming much branched. It bears a heavy crop of tiny seeds in panicles {{at the end of}} every branch. In early winter, when the panicles are dry, it is quite easy to gather these seeds in considerable quantity. <b>Just</b> <b>hold</b> a pail under the branches and strip them off. Rub the husks between the hands to separate the seed and chaff, then winnow out the trash. I have collected several quarts of seed in an hour, using this method. The seeds are quite fine, being smaller than mustard seeds, and a dull blackish-brown color....I find it pretty good food for humans." ...|$|E

2500|$|Underwood {{has been}} highly {{acclaimed}} for her vocal talents. David Wild of Rolling Stone has praised her voice, saying that [...] "she can hit any note". Her vocal range {{has been described}} as [...] "enormous", with critics highlighting her ability to hold notes {{for an extended period of}} time. Billboard describes her vocal ability as [...] "freakish". Concert critics have pointed out that [...] "she’ll let loose with an improbably long note that runs through more octaves than you knew existed". When asked if it ever becomes difficult to belt at such high intensity during her 90–120 minute live shows, Underwood responded, [...] "I'm too proud to drop keys. I won't do it. Maybe the older I get, I'll write some songs in lower keys so it'll be easier. I've always been pretty good as far as stamina onstage. Being able to work out and stay physically strong is important... So far, it's worked for me. I'm just blessed at being able to be loud for long periods of time." [...] Fellow country music singer Randy Travis paid high praises to Underwood's voice when asked about her cover of his 1988 hit song [...] "I Told You So", saying that [...] "her voice is so much better suited to the song. I have a baritone voice, and her soprano voice really fits well with the range of the song. Her ability to get into the upper register of her voice and <b>just</b> <b>hold</b> those high notes is great." [...] Her voice has also been praised as [...] "versatile". She has indeed performed live versions of gospel songs like [...] "How Great Thou Art", in which Yahoo! critics noticed her ability to move an audience with a [...] "powerful performance", and Rock songs like Guns N' Roses' [...] "Paradise City", with Rolling Stone critics saying it was a [...] "standout performance", adding that [...] "when the song reached its crescendo, the singer went right over the edge with it, twirling like a tornado and tossing in more than a few banshee wails" [...] and even saying [...] "if the original members of Guns N' Roses ever wanted to reunite without Axl Rose, they might be wise to ask Carrie Underwood to fill his bandana".|$|E
