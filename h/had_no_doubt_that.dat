5|$|The Romans faced further reverses on the {{battlefield}} and a savage guerrilla war in the Bosnian mountains. It took them three years of hard fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian Suetonius,writing in c. AD 100, as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the Punic Wars over two centuries earlier. Tiberius finally succeeded in quelling the revolt in 9AD. This was apparently lucky timing for the Romans: that same year Arminius destroyed Varus' three legions in Germany. The Roman high command <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Arminius would have formed a grand alliance with the Illyrians.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{as a whole}} encapsulates Rome's {{ideas of}} itself, its origins and moral values. For modern scholarship, it {{remains one of the}} most complex and {{problematic}} of all foundation myths. Ancient historians <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Romulus gave his name to the city. Most modern historians believe his name is a back-formation from the name of the city. Roman historians dated the city's foundation to between 758 and 728 BC, and Plutarch reports the calculation of Varroʻs friend Tarutius that 771 BC was the birth year of Romulus and his twin. A tradition that gave Romulus a distant ancestor in the semi-divine Trojan prince Aeneas was further embellished, and Romulus was made the direct ancestor of Rome's first Imperial dynasty. It's unclear whether or not the tale of Romulus or that of the twins are original elements of the foundation myth or whether both or either were added.|$|E
25|$|May 4, 1947 saw the Acre Prison break: the Irgun {{engineered}} a mass {{escape from}} Acre Prison, {{with the aim}} of freeing 41 Irgun and Lehi prisoners. Some 28 Jews and almost 200 Arabs managed to escape. However, nine Jewish fighters (both escapees and perpetrators of the prison break) were killed. Among the perpetrators of the prison break, three were killed and five were arrested. While two of those arrested, Amnon Michaelov and Nachman Zitterbaum, were minors, and thus too young to be executed under British law, the other three, Avshalom Haviv, Yaakov Weiss and Meir Nakar, were not. The Irgun High Command <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> they would be tried and convicted of capital offences, and the Irgun immediately set out to find British hostages. All of the arrested Irgun militants refused to accept British judicial authority. However they were tried by a military court and Haviv, Weiss, and Nakar were sentenced to death.|$|E

25|$|According to many historians, most of Jesus' teachings were intelligible and {{acceptable}} {{in terms of}} Second Temple Judaism; what set Christians apart from Jews was their faith in Christ as the resurrected messiah. The belief in a resurrected Messiah is unacceptable to Jews today and to Rabbinic Judaism, and Jewish authorities have long used this fact to explain the break between Judaism and Christianity. Recent work by historians paints a more complex portrait of late Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some historians have suggested that, before his death, Jesus forged among his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and {{the resurrection of the}} dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> he had been resurrected, and that the restoration of the Kingdom and resurrection of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism. In the following years the restoration of the Kingdom as Jews expected it failed to occur. Some Christians believed instead that Christ, rather than being the Jewish messiah, was God made flesh, who died for the sins of humanity, and that faith in Jesus Christ offered everlasting life (see Christology).|$|E

500|$|Nansen {{rejected}} the complex organisation and heavy manpower of other Arctic ventures, and instead planned his expedition {{for a small}} party of six. [...] Supplies would be manhauled on specially designed lightweight sledges. [...] Much of the equipment, including sleeping bags, clothing and cooking stoves, also needed to be designed from scratch. These plans received a generally poor reception in the press; one critic <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> [...] "if [...] scheme be attempted {{in its present form}} ... the chances are ten to one that he will ... uselessly throw his own and perhaps others' lives away". The Norwegian parliament refused to provide financial support, believing that such a potentially risky undertaking should not be encouraged. The project was eventually launched with a donation from a Danish businessman, Augustin Gamél; the rest came mainly from small contributions from Nansen's countrymen, through a fundraising effort organised by students at the university.|$|E
500|$|The casket letters did {{not appear}} {{publicly}} until the Conference of 1568, although the Scottish privy council had seen them by December 1567. Mary {{had been forced to}} abdicate and held captive for the best part of a year in Scotland. The letters were never made public to support her imprisonment and forced abdication. Historian Jenny Wormald believes this reluctance {{on the part of the}} Scots to produce the letters, and their destruction in 1584, whatever their content, constitute proof that they contained real evidence against Mary, whereas Weir thinks it demonstrates the lords required time to fabricate them. At least some of Mary's contemporaries who saw the letters <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> they were genuine. Among them was the Duke of Norfolk, who secretly conspired to marry Mary in the course of the commission, although he denied it when Elizabeth alluded to his marriage plans, saying [...] "he meant never to marry with a person, where he could not be sure of his pillow".|$|E

The synopsis of the film narrative provided in the review highlighted a perversion of the plot of Feuchtwanger’s text that the author instantly recognised. He identifies {{the focal point of the}} distortion when he refers to the desperate young woman and the sexual abuse she endures. She is indeed a prime example of the Nazis’ ruthless misrepresentation, and her character, her rape, and tragic death prove the Nazis’ deliberate abuse of the Jewish writer’s work." ...|$|E

500|$|Chapter IX {{deals with}} the fact that the {{geologic}} record appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable transitional fossils expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed Charles Lyell's argument in Principles of Geology that the record is extremely imperfect as fossilisation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of geological formations, and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he cited the example of [...] The Weald as discussed in [...] Principles of Geology together with other observations from Hugh Miller, James Smith of Jordanhill and Andrew Ramsay. Combining this with an estimate of recent rates of sedimentation and erosion, Darwin calculated that erosion of The Weald had taken around 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the Cambrian explosion, posed a problem. Darwin <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.|$|E
