40|$|Typical biomolecular {{systems such}} as {{cellular}} membranes, DNA, and protein complexes are highly charged. Thus, efficient and accurate treatment of electrostatic interactions is of great importance in computational modeling of such systems. We have employed the GROMACS simulation package to perform extensive benchmarking of different commonly used electrostatic schemes {{on a range of}} computer architectures (Pentium- 4, IBM Power 4, and Apple/IBM G 5) for single processor and parallel performance up to 8 nodes—we have also tested the scalability on four different networks, namely Infiniband, GigaBit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and nearly uniform memory architecture, i. e. communication between CPUs is possible by directly reading from or writing to other CPUs' local memory. It turns out that the particle–mesh Ewald method (PME) performs surprisingly well and offers competitive performance unless parallel runs on PC hardware with older network infrastructure are needed. Lipid bilayers of sizes 128, 512 and 2048 lipid molecules were used as the test systems representing typical cases encountered in biomolecular simulations.

40|$|M. Tech. Fashion Design and TechnologyFor {{students}} {{to remain competitive}} in their respective industries, it has become essential {{for them to be}} trained in the use of discipline relevant software programs. When focusing on Computer Aided Design (CAD) training for fashion specifically, certain challenges arise. Traditionally software instruction focused on teaching the interface, tools and functions of a software program as opposed to it being used appropriately {{within the context of a}} particular discipline. As a result, students struggle to recall the steps they need to follow and consequently also to apply their newly gained knowledge to project work. Compounding this, high-end fashion-specific design packages, such as Lectra, are not suitable for use by individuals due to its expensive nature. The use of these packages is similarly limited in its use via <b>departmental</b> <b>computer</b> laboratories due to licencing restrictions. The licencing of mid-range design packages such as the Adobe Creative Suite might be more affordable, but at an institutional level it is still regarded as expensive and also only installed in <b>departmental</b> <b>computer</b> laboratories, again limiting students access. Even where a student owns a personal computer, purchasing the Adobe Creative Suite (at discount) may not be viable. However, despite it being intended for other design disciplines resulting in large parts of the program becoming redundant for Fashion use, Adobe Photoshop still remains the best possible, most affordable and preferred alternative package with the capacity for long-term use. The challenge arises where the lecturer is required to teach students against the backdrop of the problems mentioned above. Curricula rarely keep up with industry requirements and the onus falls on the lecturer to employ methods and tools to adapt and change within the confines of the curriculum structure itself. Software instruction should ideally take place in a manner that will aid the retention of the students user knowledge and be integrated with their project work. Resultantly, an innovative approach to teaching had to be developed and tested. v Observing, identifying and aiding the resolution of students learning problems place the lecturer within a participatory anthropological, natural environment. As such the research study was qualitative in nature. Appropriately, this study did not propose to merely better the current (inadequate) situation observed in the classroom. Instead, it created an entirely new learning environment aimed at addressing the students pre-determined and quantifiable needs through the student-centred teaching method of Concurrent Cycle Instruction (CCI). The chosen methodology: Design Research (DR), provided the framework against which the new CCI method could be tested and data relating to its efficacy could be gathered. The findings of the research study are based on an analysis of the data that was mined as part of the small-scale design experiment...|$|E

METHODS [...] Information was collected manually from result reports received by eight laboratory users: three wards in the main hospital, four GP practices, and one local psychiatric hospital. This was combined with data from the <b>departmental</b> <b>computer</b> files to create a spreadsheet detailing different time points in the processing of a specimen, from venepuncture to receipt of result report. RESULTS [...] At the main hospital, 80 % of samples arrived within two hours of venesection and 95 % by four hours; 75 % of samples were analysed within two hours; 85 % of results arrived in the wards within six hours of printing, although 12 % took more than 18 hours to arrive; median overall time six hours. At the satellite (psychiatric) hospital, all samples arrived within seven hours of venesection; 45 % were analysed within two hours [...] the rest the following morning; there were highly variable post-analytical times, minimum 18 hours, maximum 122 hours; the median overall time was 69 hours.

40|$|During the 1960 s and 1970 s, Canadians {{increasingly}} used computers and computerized processes for {{government and business}} purposes. By the 1980 s, some began to have personal computers at home. This thesis examines the experiences of emerging computerization {{by focusing on the}} Public Archives of Canada during this period. The 1960 s saw the first computer projects at the Public Archives, although these efforts had mixed reviews. Many archivists feared that automated information retrieval would compromise the quality of their service, and professional position, while others argued that computers were a necessary efficiency to meet the growing demands on their institution. Overall, the decade of the 1960 s was one in which many archivists encountered computers, computerized processes and computer records for the first time, and they responded with a range of feelings and reactions. By the outset of the 1970 s, a select group of advocates proposed the concept of a Machine Readable Archives. When the creation of this division was approved in 1973, its staff members formed a distinct professional community within the Public Archives. They held a complex position as the computer "haves" of the federal archives and records management community, and the relative "have nots" in their communication with <b>departmental</b> <b>computer</b> personnel. The Machine Readable Archives became the hub of attempted communication and cooperation among all of these players, during the period of major technological development during the 1970 s and early 1980 s. By the time of the Machine Readable Archives' closure in 1986, computers were frequently used as an archival tool. A survey among archival leaders in the mid- 1980 s concluded that archivists, once a technologically conservative profession, had not only adopted the use of computers into their repositories, but most of them were optimistic about their profession's role in the evolving technological environment. Archivists' changing views of computers paralleled the increasing acceptance and familiarity of computer technology within Canadian society. To accommodate computerization, many Canadians adapted their work processes, and negotiated new work relationships. In Canada during these years, individuals responded to computers, personally and professionally, in complex and contradictory ways that reflected both reservations and excitement. The Public Archives of Canada, and especially the Machine Readable Archives, provide a significant focus to analyse this dynamic and changing milieu as Canadians engaged with the technological and cultural transformations of the era...|$|E

5000|$|The {{success of}} system {{implementation}} {{is affected by}} the way in which systems are operated. Thus, education and training for using the system can be carried out at various levels, by considering the size and complexity of the system. Staff and personal need to be informed about the overall information structure and how to operate the system. This will give some overall understanding of system in place and how information is handled throughout the organisation. Information system infrastructures of the organisation need to be determined in order to decide what training requirements should be carried out. Firms with complex systems involving operations between regional offices through network and distributed system will need information system managers, system operators and support staff. In order to deal with problems, the staff will need training in the operation of equipment and support services. For small organisation where information systems are handled by <b>departmental</b> <b>computers</b> and software, staff may well have the responsibility of managing computer systems in addition to being users. This may be where organisation systems have been developed by end-users or through the use of application packages. Various training courses are available and this is in relation to the organisation information systems. Software houses and universities are often provide general training courses and much will depend upon organisation requirements and the location of training centres. Supplier for a particular product also provides specific training related to their product or system. Many companies which supply software have training divisions whose main purpose is to support customers and training can usually be conducted at the supplier's premises or organisation can choose for in-house training which takes place in the organisation own facilities. It is essential that the operators and users of the new system undergo training to ensure that they can run the system correctly. The cost involved should therefore be viewed as an investment in the organisation in order to achieve the expected goals.|$|R

It provides an additional ‘free’ resource from the existing computing and networking infrastructure for modelling and simulation requiring {{a large number of}} small jobs, such as applications from biology, chemistry, physics, and digital signal processing. At the University of Huddersfield, there are thousands of idle laboratory machines {{that could be used to}} run serial/parallel jobs by cycle stealing. Our HTC system, implemented in Condor [1], is part of the Queensgate Campus Grid (QGG) [2] that consists of a number of dedicated <b>departmental</b> and university <b>computer</b> clusters. Condor is an excellent HTC tool that excels in cycle stealing and job scheduling on idle machines. However, only idle powered machines can be used from a networked pool. Many organizations deploy power saving mechanisms to try to reduce energy consumption in their systems, and power down idle resources, using rigid and inflexible power management policies. The University of Huddersfield Computing Services use the Energy Star EZ GPO power saving tool that runs as a Windows service and detects how long the computer has been idle. Then it allows the computer to first turn off the screen and then go into hibernation. Our research and development work is focused on implementing a HTC system using Condor to work within a “green IT” policy of a higher education institutions that conform to green IT challenges for a multi-platform, multi-discipline user/ resource base. This system will allow Condor to turn on machines that may have gone to sleep due to lack of usage when there is a large queue of pending jobs. The decision to utilise dormant resources will be made on a variety of factors such as job priority, job requirements, user priority, time of day, flocking options, queue conditions etc. Good practice scheduling policies would need to be devised that would work within this “green IT” pool...|$|R
