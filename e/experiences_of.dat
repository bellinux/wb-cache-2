40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a self-report scale delineating the components <b>of</b> the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> heterosexual intercourse of both men and women. In a preliminary study, 70 men freely expressed the feelings, thoughts, and motives involved in the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> heterosexual intercourse. A content analysis revealed that the components <b>of</b> the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> heterosexual intercourse found in the men’s sample {{are very similar to}} those found in a women’s sample in a previous study (Birnbaum, Glaubman, & Mikulincer, 2001). On this account, the <b>Experience</b> <b>of</b> Heterosexual Intercourse Scale (EHIS), which was used by Birnbaum and her colleagues, was administered to 181 women and 178 men. Overall, the results revealed that the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> women was more centred on both the aversive and positive relational aspects of heterosexual intercourse than the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> men. Findings are discussed in relation to sociobiological and social influence theories...|$|R
40|$|Objectives We {{hypothesized}} that the psychosocial factors perceived stress and sense of personal control mediated the relationship between self-reported racism and <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache. We {{hypothesized that}} social support moderated this relationship. Methods Data from 365 pregnant Aboriginal Australian women were used to evaluate <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache, socio-demographic factors, psychosocial factors, general health, risk behaviors, and self-reported racism exposure. Hierarchical logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CIs) for <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache. Perceived stress and sense of personal control were examined as mediators of the association between self-reported racism and <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache. Social support was examined as a moderator. Results Self-reported racism persisted as a risk indicator for <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache (OR 1. 99, 95 percent CI 1. 07 - 3. 72) after controlling for age, level of education, and difficulty paying a $ 100 dental bill. The relationship between self-reported racism and <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache was mediated by sense of control. The direct effect of self-reported racism on <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache became only marginally significant, and the indirect effect was significant (β coefficient-=- 0. 04, bias-corrected 95 percent CI 0. 004 - 0. 105, 21. 2 percent of effect mediated). Stress was insignificant as a mediator. Social support was insignificant as a moderator. Conclusions The findings indicate that high levels of self-reported racism were associated with <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache and that sense of control, but not perceived stress, mediated the association between self-reported racism and <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache among this sample of pregnant Aboriginal Australian women. Social support did not moderate the association between self-reported racism and <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> toothache...|$|R
