5|$|The first stable carbenes to be {{isolated}} were based on an <b>imidazole</b> ring, with the hydrogen in carbon 2 of the ring (between the two nitrogen atoms) removed, and other hydrogens replaced by various groups. These imidazol-2-ylidenes are still the most stable and the most well studied and understood family of persistent carbenes.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{the formal}} {{substitution}} of sulfur {{for one of}} the nitrogens in <b>imidazole</b> would yield the aromatic heterocyclic compound thiazole. A thiazole based carbene (analogous to the carbene postulated by Breslow) has been prepared and characterised by X-ray crystallography. Other non-aromatic aminocarbenes with O, S and P atoms adjacent (i.e. alpha) to the carbene centre have been prepared, e.g. thio- and oxy-iminium based carbenes have been characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the pKa of its <b>imidazole</b> nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E

40|$|Cascade {{reactions}} of amidines with nitroallylic acetates and alpha-bromonitroalkenes provide potentially bioactive <b>imidazoles</b> in good to excellent yields in most cases. While 2, 4 -disubstituted imidazol- 5 -yl acetates are {{formed in the}} first case, 2, 4 -disubstituted <b>imidazoles,</b> bearing no substituent at position 5, are the products in the second case. These two series of <b>imidazoles,</b> viz. 2, 4, 5 -trisubstituted and 2, 4 -disubstituted, were screened for their activity against the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi {{which is responsible for}} Chagas disease.

5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an <b>imidazole</b> nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
25|$|Salts of <b>imidazole</b> {{where the}} <b>imidazole</b> ring {{is in the}} cation are known as imidazolium salts (for example, imidazolium chloride). These salts are formed from the {{protonation}} or substitution at nitrogen of <b>imidazole.</b> These salts {{have been used as}} ionic liquids and precursors to stable carbenes. Salts where a deprotonated <b>imidazole</b> is an anion are also well known; these salts are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate, NaC3H3N2).|$|E
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of industrial}} and technological importance contain <b>imidazole</b> derivatives. The thermostable polybenzimidazole (PBI) contains <b>imidazole</b> fused to a benzene ring and linked to a benzene, and acts as a fire retardant. <b>Imidazole</b> {{can also be found}} in various compounds that are used for photography and electronics.|$|E
25|$|Thiazoles {{are members}} of the azoles, heterocycles that include <b>imidazoles</b> and oxazoles. Thiazole can also be {{considered}} a functional group.

40|$|In Staphylococcus aureus, {{using the}} <b>imidazoles</b> {{miconazole}} and ketoconazole, detailed studies of minimal inhibitory concentrations, kinetics of growth, viability, and release of intracellular K+ {{confirm that the}} two <b>imidazoles</b> work differently in this bacterium. Miconazole is bactericidal at low concentrations and causes release of cellular K+. Ketoconazole has no bactericidal effect at any tested concentration and has little effect on K+ permeability of S. aureus; it slows growth at high concentration. This is reflected in a low minimal inhibitory concentration for miconazole and a high one for ketoconazole. The probable mechanisms of the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of the <b>imidazoles</b> are discussed {{in light of these}} results and the previously described antifungal mechanisms of the drugs. alpha-Tocopherol blocks the action of both <b>imidazoles...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Imidazole</b> can be {{synthesized}} {{by numerous}} methods besides the Debus method. Many of these syntheses {{can also be}} applied to different substituted imidazoles and <b>imidazole</b> derivatives by varying the functional groups on the reactants. These methods are commonly categorized by which and how many bonds form to make the <b>imidazole</b> rings. For example, the Debus method forms the (1,2), (3,4), and (1,5) bonds in <b>imidazole,</b> using each reactant as a fragment of the ring, and thus this method would be a three-bond-forming synthesis. A small sampling of these methods is presented below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Imidazole</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in 1858 by the German-British chemist Heinrich Debus, although various <b>imidazole</b> derivatives {{had been discovered}} {{as early as the}} 1840s. Its synthesis, as shown below, used glyoxal and formaldehyde in ammonia to form <b>imidazole</b> (or glyoxaline, as it was originally named). This synthesis, while producing relatively low yields, is still used for creating C-substituted imidazoles.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{applications}} of <b>imidazole</b> {{is in the}} purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). <b>Imidazole</b> is used to elute tagged proteins bound to nickel ions attached {{to the surface of}} beads in the chromatography column. An excess of <b>imidazole</b> is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins.|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of the 1 -methyl(trimethylsilyl) (TMS) -substituted <b>imidazoles</b> 3 a, 4 a, 8, 9, and 11 a by silylation of the corresponding metallated <b>imidazoles</b> is described. Carbodesilylation of 3 with aldehydes or carboxylic halogenides occurs selectively in 2 -position. In {{the presence of a}} strong base (CsF) the reactivity against carbon electrophiles correlates well with the stability of the imidazolyl anions; regioselective carbodesilylation in 2 -, 5 -, or 4 -position of the twofold TMS-substituted <b>imidazoles</b> 3 a and 9 therefore is possible, which allows the synthesis of a great variety of hydroxyalkyl-substituted <b>imidazoles</b> and of acylimidazoles. By using the dimethylsulfamoyl substituent as an N-protecting group, the N- unsubstituted 5 -benzoylimidazole (26) as well as the comparable 5 -benzoyl-pyrazole (30 b) and 5 -(hydroxyphenylmethyl) -pyrazole (30 a) are accessible...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe electron-transfer {{properties}} of H 117 G- and wild-type azurin were compared by applying both as electron acceptors in {{the conversion of}} 4 -ethylphenol by 4 -ethylphenol methylenehydroxylase (4 -EPMH). The reactivity of H 117 G-azurin was determined in the absence and presence of <b>imidazoles,</b> which can substitute the missing fourth ligand. In the absence of <b>imidazoles,</b> H 117 G-azurin reacted directly with 4 -ethylphenol, this reaction was abolished {{in the presence of}} <b>imidazoles.</b> The enzymatic reduction of H 117 G-azurin by 4 -EPMH was 40 times slower than that of wild-type azurin. The rate of this reaction was enhanced by some <b>imidazoles,</b> diminished by others. In all cases the reduction of H 117 G-azurin was irreversible.
