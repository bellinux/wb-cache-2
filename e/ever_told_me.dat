25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He fell in battle, I have suspected," [...] {{answered}} the daughter, in a suppressed, doubtful tone--"for {{no one has}} <b>ever</b> directly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> even that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{that subject}} I will not listen. I have felt very sore and angry <b>ever</b> since you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{last night to}} leave the room when Sholto insulted me, as if I were the aggressor." ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL. Certainly! I've been {{thinking}} it over <b>ever</b> since you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> Henty had fought shy. I 've a poor opinion of Henty. He's {{one of those}} fellows that says one thing and does another. An opportunist! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And you, Agnes,' I said, by and by. 'Tell me of yourself. You have hardly <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of {{your own}} life, in all this lapse of time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do I?' She {{spoke with}} a {{slightly}} foreign accent, which gave a little prettiness to her speech. 'I was never told so. But nobody <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> anything about myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl's scalp tickled, but {{he tried}} to be very offhand in remarking: [...] "You must have gotten that dress in New York, didn't you? Why haven't you <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about New York? You've hardly told me {{anything}} at all." ...|$|E
60|$|For a moment, I stood rooted with apprehension; I {{dared not}} enter. A horrible dread {{deprived}} me of strength, until from within a piteous sobbing, more musical, more welcome than any sounds which I had <b>ever</b> before heard, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that the child}} I sought was safe.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, Cuthbert. I {{have been}} {{wondering}} <b>ever</b> since you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{you were to}} have Fairclose again, if you would give up painting, and hoping that you would still go on with it. I should so like you to win a name for yourself as a great painter." ...|$|R
5000|$|He looks consumptive, but was in {{excellent}} spirits, and displayed as much wit and humour in 3 hours time as any man I <b>ever</b> knew.

6000|$|... "No, he {{does not}} know what he is about," [...] cried Catherine; [...] "{{he does not}} know the pain he is giving my brother. Not that James has <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so, but I am sure he is very uncomfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{what you}} do not {{understand}} your lady must interpret, and be not angry with me, I pray you, if I seem to know more {{of you and your}} affairs than you have <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Render my words now, Dona Margaret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he is. He ain't <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you was here; {{told me to}} come, and he'd show {{me a lot of}} water-moccasins. If {{anything}} happens HE ain't mixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it 'll be the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As good as gold," [...] said Bob, [...] "and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful, {{sitting by}} himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you <b>ever</b> heard. He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> coming home, {{that he hoped}} the people {{saw him in the}} church, because he was a cripple, and it might be {{pleasant}} to them to remember upon Christmas-day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the McGuinness Flint {{recording}} When I'm Dead and Gone, Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle play kazoos {{in harmony}} during the instrumental break. The New Seekers' live track (<b>Ever</b> Since You <b>Told</b> <b>Me</b> That You Loved Me) I'm A Nut features a kazoo solo by singer Eve Graham. [...] British singer-songwriter Ray Dorset, {{the leader of}} pop-blues band Mungo Jerry, played the kazoo on many of his band's recordings, as did former member Paul King.|$|R
6000|$|Rosamond made reply {{enough to}} set him off again. [...] "Lady Tyrrell would have been content to stay there for <b>ever,</b> she <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> but she thought it too {{confined}} a range for Eleonora; there was no formation of character, though I don't see how it could have formed better; but Lady Tyrrell is a thoroughly careful motherly sister, and thought it right she should see {{a little of the}} world. So they broke up from Rockpier, and spent a year abroad; and now Lady Tyrrell is making great sacrifices to enable her father to come and live at home again. I must say it would be more neighbourly to welcome them a little more kindly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor lit one himself, {{resting his}} arm {{on the edge}} of the chair. [...] "Corporal, you must realize that there are very few men who become plants, {{especially}} on such short notice. I have to admit you are the first person who has <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} so," [...] he answered. [...] "Really, you know, you have. I never {{received}} such a dressing-down in my life. If any one had <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I'd {{be a party}} even to the present situation. [...] . Yes, I confess, you have rattled my dry bones pretty considerably." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} read any but this,' said Phyllis. 'Ada and I have often {{looked at the}} pictures, and I liked the poor wounded stag coming {{down to the water}} so much, that I read about it, and then I went on. Was it wrong, Claude? no one <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not.' ...|$|E
60|$|Thus I had to {{turn out}} my fine gowns (grown all too tight for me) and betake me to the Queen, who had become a little old woman, but was as gay and kind as <b>ever,</b> and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> much about my mother and sister. The King himself came and spoke to me, and said he {{supposed}} I wished to have the old title revived; but I told him, with all thanks, that I liked my husband better by his own name than by that which I had rather leave sacred to my brother; whereat he laughed, and said he must make a low bow to me, as being the first person he had met who had nothing to ask from him.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{believed}} so in you," [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "She {{thought you were}} the best man who <b>ever</b> lived. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that you were the}} only really good man she had ever known, and her confidence and belief in you were contagious. You will probably never know all that she did for you. It was really she that imbued my father and his attorney with a belief in your innocence, and it was she who influenced the Lizard to take the stand in your behalf. Yes, she was a very good friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say you don't? But you do! You haunt me. Those {{very eyes}} that you turned upon my {{with such a}} bitter flash a moment ago, they come to me just as you showed them then, {{in the night and}} in the day! Tess, <b>ever</b> since you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of that child of ours, it is just as if my feelings, which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream, had {{suddenly}} found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at once gushed through. The religious channel is left dry forthwith; and it is you who have done it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he has {{followed}} my father's custom. He was the favorite son, you know, and I sometimes {{think that my}} father may have told him more than he <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> That is Bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, {{but there is no}} light from within, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. But, say, kid, {{you don't}} {{want to be}} frightened of germs or {{microbes}} or bacilli {{or any of the}} rest of the circus. You don't want to be frightened of nothing. You're the White Hope, the bear-cat that ain't scared of anything on earth. What's this germ thing like, anyway?" ...|$|E
60|$|LADY GIOVANNA. If I {{might send}} you down a flask or two Of that same vintage? There is iron in it. It {{has been much}} commended as a medicine.

6000|$|... "She {{knows that}} I love you, {{and that would}} be sufficient, dearest. But, as it happens, she knew more about you than I did. From her I learned, for the first time, that your mother came from a family which was great and noble before ours was <b>ever</b> founded. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> a sad story of your uncle, Margharita, which you, too, doubtless know of, and she seemed glad to think that our {{marriage}} would be, in a certain sense, an act of poetic justice. She <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> too, Margharita, that if your uncle died unmarried, you could, if you chose, take his name and call yourself the Countess di Marioni. Why, sweetheart, I am not sure that I ought to aspire to the hand of so great a lady." ...|$|R

Nobody <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{how to be}} religious, and your poor papa would not have liked it. Phoebe, you know more than I do. You don't think God will be hard with me, do you?

6000|$|... "Why haven't you <b>ever</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about her?" [...] asked Cynthia. How was she to {{know that}} her {{innocent}} questions tortured him cruelly; {{that the spirit of}} the Cynthia who had come to him in the tannery house had haunted him all his life, and that she herself, a new Cynthia, was still that spirit? The bygone Cynthia had been much in his thoughts since they came to Boston.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Monk," [...] {{the old man}} said, {{catching}} his arm, [...] "my daughter was a strange woman, a very strange woman, and since I heard this dreadful news I have been afraid that perhaps she was--unhappy.

40|$|Quality is {{something}} that every pathologist is commit-ted to—at least that is what every pathologist I have <b>ever</b> met has <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Nevertheless, {{while there are many}} publications documenting ways in which the process of pathology can be improved, very few of these processes are adopted. Why? And when something new appears, how can you tell if it is going to catch on or not? In this issue of the Journal, Zarbo and colleagues 1 do a wonderful job of demonstrating what a group of patholo-gists who are fully committed to the process and who appear to have real financial and administrative support can do to improve quality. They have shown that bar coding, along with significant changes in the way people actually handle specimens and the culture in which they work can lead to significant improvement in specimen misidentificatio...|$|R
