40|$|AbstractAccidents such {{as support}} failure and {{excessive}} deformation of roadways due to drastic changes in strata behaviors are frequently reported when mining the <b>extra-thick</b> coal seams Nos. 3 – 5 in Datong coal mine with top-coal caving method, which significantly hampers the mine's normal production. To understand {{the mechanism of}} strata failure, this paper presented a structure evolution model with respect to strata behaviors. Then the behaviors of strata overlying the <b>extra-thick</b> coal seams were studied with the combined method of theoretical analysis, physical simulation, and field measurement. The {{results show that the}} key strata, which are usually thick-hard strata, {{play an important role in}} overlying movement and may influence the mining-induced strata behaviors in the working face using top-coal caving method. The structural model of far-field key strata presents a “masonry beam” type structure when “horizontal O-X” breakage type happens. The rotational motion of the block imposed radial compressive stress on the surrounding rock mass of the roadway. This can induce excessive deformation of roadway near the goaf. Besides, this paper proposed a pre-control technology for the hard roof based on fracture holes and underground roof pre-splitting. It could effectively reduce stress concentration and release the accumulated energy of the strata, when mining underground coal resources with top-coal caving method...|$|E

The results show that roadway support structure is rational and four solutions are proposed for reinforcing surrounding rock timely, enlarging anchorage range, improving the support stiffness of lower rock stratum, and disposing the bolt and anchor cable along the cracks to improve the intensity at the top right angles of the roadway.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the four factors of {{spontaneous}} combustion of coal, the causes of such combustion in the tunnel fall of ground were comprehensively analyzed. The causes include the generation of float coal, influence of hot wind pressure on the laneway, and airflow dynamic pressure caused by sloping roadways. According to the characteristics of a fire that occurred in the intake airflow roadway of working face 12190 in the Geng Cun Coal Mine, a three-phase foam composed of mud, nitrogen, and water was used to extinguish the fire. The foam was injected into the fire zone through boreholes on the tunnel roof. Given the precise scheme and reliability of the technology, the fire was successfully extinguished. The specific technological process and parameters of the technology are discussed in detail. It is concluded that the three-phase foam is useful in preventing spontaneous combustion of coal in the tunnel fall of ground.

40|$|In <b>extra-thick</b> coal seams, mining {{operations}} {{can lead to}} large-scale disturbances, complex overburden structures, and frequent and strong strata behavior in the stope, which are serious threats to mine safety. This study analyzed the overburden structure and strata behavior and proposed the technique of confined blasting in water-filled deep holes as a measure to prevent strong rock pressure. It found {{that there are two}} primary reasons for the high effectiveness of the proposed technique in presplitting hard coal and rock. First, the fracture water enables much more efficient transfer of dynamic load due to its incompressibility. Second, the subsequent expansion of water can further split the rock by compression. A mechanical model was used to reveal how the process of confined blasting in water-filled deep holes presplit roof. Moreover, practical implementation of this technique was found to improve the structure of hard, thick roof and prevent strong rock pressure, demonstrating its effectiveness in roof control...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{reasonably}} determine the external load of outer freezing shaft wall, {{it is necessary}} to conduct interaction study between frozen soil wall and outer shaft wall. First, based on the characteristic of three-stage compressive deformation of foam board, a relational expression of such radial deformations as frozen soil wall, outer shaft wall, and foam board is established; then based on the homogeneous viscoelastic model of frozen soil wall, with the rigidity in different compression stages of foam board being regarded as a constant, an expression of deformation pressure is derived. According to the research conducted in combination with project examples, the foam board remarkably slowed down the increase in deformation pressure; for steady creep frozen soil wall, the final value of deformation pressure should be effectively reduced; for unsteady creep frozen soil wall, the final value of deformation pressure {{has nothing to do with}} the effect of foam board, and tends to be equal to the level external load of frozen soil wall. The research shows that as the depth of alluvium rises, the frozen soil wall under high pressure is to gradually present a unsteady creep characteristic and that the value of level external load of outer shaft wall in <b>extra-thick</b> alluvium can be regarded as equal to permanent level ground pressure...|$|E

The {{results show that the}} microstructure, tensile property and exfoliation corrosion in different layers of 7085 -T 651 aluminum alloy of 110 mm thick are inhomogeneous.

For the 1 / 4 thickness layer, it has the largest recrystallized fraction up to about 47. 7 % and the grain size is about 105 μm; there are equilibrium phase particles precipitated on grain boundaries or within grains; the size of aging precipitates is small; and thus both mechanical properties and resistance to exfoliation corrosion are the worst. For the core layer, it has the smallest recrystallized fraction of about 14. 8 % and there are a large amount of sub-grains; the fraction of residual phase Al 7 Cu 2 Fe almost reaches up to about 1. 43 %; the size of the equilibrium phase on grain boundaries, the size of aging precipitates and the width of PFZ are large, and therefore good mechanical properties and bad resistance to exfoliation corrosion are obtained...|$|E
