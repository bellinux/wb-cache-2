5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS <b>estimated</b> <b>expenditure</b> of $8 million, to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{foundations}} of the campaign was the knowledge that certain aspects of the law on council budgeting in 1985 were not entirely clear. What was clear was that all local authorities had a duty to set a budget and therefore an annual rate or precept, under sections 2 and 11 of the General Rate Act 1967. Precepting authorities had the additional responsibility to set their budgets and precepts at least 21 days {{before the start of the}} new financial year; as the local government financial year began on 1 April, 21 days before that was 10 March. No such duty applied to rate-making authorities. In practice most set a budget and a rate some weeks before the new financial year, but not all did; some authorities routinely made their rates after the beginning of a financial year. The General Rate Act, section 2(1), also provided that the rate had to be sufficient to meet all <b>estimated</b> <b>expenditure</b> not met by other sources, thereby making any deficit budget illegal.|$|E

2500|$|Britain {{entered the}} Crimean War in February 1854, and Gladstone {{introduced}} his second budget on 6 March. Gladstone had to increase expenditure {{on the military}} and a vote of credit of £1,250,000 was taken to send a force of 25,000 to the East. The deficit for the year would be £2,840,000 (estimated revenue £56,680,000; <b>estimated</b> <b>expenditure</b> £59,420,000). Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased income tax by half, from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (From ≈2.92% to ≈4.38%). He proclaimed that [...] "the expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose on the ambition and the lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations". By May £6,870,000 was needed to finance the war and introducing another budget on 8 May, Gladstone raised income tax from tenpence halfpenny to fourteen pence in the pound to raise £3,250,000. Spirits, malt, and sugar were taxed to raise {{the rest of the}} money needed.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the literature that <b>estimates</b> parental <b>expenditures</b> on children; describes the types of child support guidelines that are {{being used by the}} states; and compares how the child support awards that emerge from each state's guidelines compare to the empirical <b>estimates</b> of <b>expenditure</b> patterns on children. The findings indicate that the states' guidelines appear to be more or less consistent with the <b>estimates</b> of <b>expenditures</b> on children. In a few cases, however, the guidelines require less in support from the noncustodial parent than the parent would have spent on the child(ren) in an average intact family. In many other cases, the guidelines require child support payments that are very close to the lower bound of the <b>estimates</b> of <b>expenditures.</b> This article concludes with a discussion of the difficult value judgments that ultimately must be made in setting child support awards. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel algorithm for <b>estimating</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> during physical activity. The estimation {{is based on}} acceleration data measured from a wrist-worn accelerometer. Simultaneous measurements of acceleration and oxygen consumption using a biaxial accelerometer and a breath gas analyzer were made during four different ac-tivities: walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling. A variance feature is used to compress the original accel-eration signals. A linear mixed model is fitted to the data to estimate oxygen consumption based on the acceleration data. Lagged values of acceleration are used to take the de-layed effect of physical activity on oxygen consumption into consideration. The algorithm also uses information on {{the height of the}} subjects. Oxygen consumption is estimated at 15 -second intervals and energy expenditure is directly cal-culated from the oxygen consumption. Based on the experi-mental data gathered from 10 subjects, a new algorithm for <b>estimating</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> is suggested. It is shown that the method <b>estimates</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> very accurately. In walking, running and Nordic walking the model underesti-mates energy expenditure by 13, 2 and 9 percent, respec-tively, and in bicycling energy expenditure is overestimated by 7 percent. Thus, the new approach is a very promising method for <b>estimating</b> energy <b>expenditure.</b> ...|$|R
