5|$|The {{police did}} not {{rely solely on}} horses, using pack ponies and mules to carry {{equipment}} and supplies, and using oxen as <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> {{in the early years}} of the force. Dog-sled teams and canoes were also used in the far north.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom, and this continued through the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed {{the name of the}} country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army became the VKJ. The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. At the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> for transport, and the large size of its formations. For example, infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26,000–27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France.|$|E

5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} deployed with 310 {{horses in}} 1873, both as mounts and as <b>draught</b> <b>animals,</b> but {{large numbers of}} these died on the march, and {{for much of the}} 1870s there were shortages of horses, impacting on the police's work. The importance of horses to the force's work grew, particularly once the new patrol system was introduced by Commissioner Herchmer. By the 1880s the police's horses were looked after carefully and given good veterinarian support, although they were worked very hard. A large riding school was built in Regina at a cost of $30,000 in 1886 to allow training throughout the cold winter months. At their peak {{towards the end of the}} century, the force owned around 800 horses, and needed to purchase 100 new mounts each year. The police initially used a wide range of saddlery, mostly of the British Army's Universal pattern, but this was found to be unsuitable for the prairies. After some experimentation, the force settled on the Western, or Californian, style of saddle in the 1880s, which was more comfortable for both the rider and horse.|$|E

25|$|Both {{agriculture}} (including wheat, millet, and barley) {{and keeping}} of domesticated animals (cattle, {{as well as}} sheep and pigs) were practiced, and fishing and shellfish were also sources of food, as well as deer, elk, and other wild animal hunting.

25|$|Tsetse flies are {{regarded}} as {{a major cause of}} rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> because nagana, the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals.

25|$|Livingstone {{was one of}} {{the first}} Westerners to make a transcontinental journey across Africa in 1854–56, from Luanda on the Atlantic to Quelimane on the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Zambezi. Central and {{southern}} Africa had not been crossed by Europeans at that latitude, despite repeated European attempts (especially by the Portuguese), owing to their susceptibility to malaria, dysentery, and sleeping sickness which was prevalent in the interior and which also prevented use of <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> (oxen and horses). Such journeys had also been hindered by the opposition of powerful chiefs and tribes, such as the Lozi, and the Lunda of Mwata Kazembe.|$|E
25|$|Though Isandlwana was a {{disaster}} for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> were lost. As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.|$|E
25|$|The cattle were {{valuable}} <b>draught</b> <b>animals,</b> {{often seen}} as equal to human servants, or in some cases, members of the family. Cattle were also given their own holiday during the first 'cow' day of the lunar New Year. The importance of cattle does not suggest Koreans ate an abundance of beef, however, as the cattle were valued as beasts of burden and slaughtering one would create dire issues in farming the land. Pork and seafood were consumed more regularly for this reason. The Buddhist ruling class of the Goryeo period forbade the consumption of beef. The Mongols dispensed with the ban of beef during the 13th century, and they promoted the production of beef cattle. This increased production continued into the Joseon period, when the government encouraged both increased quantities and quality of beef. Only {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century has beef become regular table fare.|$|E
50|$|The Terreña was {{formerly}} a triple-purpose breed, {{used as a}} <b>draught</b> <b>animal</b> and for milk and meat production, but is now raised only for meat. Terreño oxen {{were in the past}} used in the traditional Basque rural sport of idi probak, or stone-pulling.|$|R
50|$|The breed was {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} <b>draught</b> <b>animal,</b> {{however it}} is now transitioning into a primarily beef breed due to the mechanisation of agriculture.

50|$|The Pirenaica was {{formerly}} a triple-purpose breed, {{used as a}} <b>draught</b> <b>animal</b> and for milk and meat production.

25|$|The Bulgarian {{successes in}} the west raised fears in Constantinople, and after serious preparations, Basil II {{launched}} a campaign into the very centre of the Bulgarian Empire to distract Samuel from southern Greece. The Byzantine army passed through the mountains around Ihtiman and besieged Sredets in 986. The Byzantines assaulted the city for 20 days, but their attacks proved fruitless and costly: the Bulgarians {{came out of the}} city several times, killed many enemy soldiers and captured <b>draught</b> <b>animals</b> and horses. Eventually, the Bulgarian troops burned the siege equipment of the Byzantine army, forcing Basil II to withdraw to Thrace, but on 17 August 986, while passing through the mountains, the Byzantine army was ambushed and routed at the Trajan's Gates Pass. This was a significant blow for Basil, {{who was one of the}} few to return to Constantinople; his personal treasure was captured by the victors.|$|E
25|$|Training {{emphasised}} rapid advance, the silencing of machine-guns {{and maintaining}} {{communication with the}} artillery, to ensure that infantry and the creeping barrage moved together. Infantry were issued with light machine-guns, mortars and rifle grenades and intensively trained. Thirty divisions were trained in the new tactics but had a lower scale of equipment than the elite divisions and the remainder were stripped of material to supply them, giving up most of their remaining <b>draught</b> <b>animals.</b> In the north, two German armies would attack {{either side of the}} Flesquières salient, created during the Battle of Cambrai. The 18th Army, transferred from the Eastern Front, planned its attack either side of St. Quentin, to divide the British and French armies. The two northern armies would then attack the British position around Arras, before advancing north-west to cut off the BEF in Flanders. In the south, it was intended to reach the Somme and then hold the line of the river against any French counter-attacks; the southern advance was extended to include an advance across the Somme.|$|E
25|$|Michael Morpurgo {{wrote the}} 1982 children's novel War Horse after meeting World War I {{veterans}} in the Devon village of Iddesleigh where he lived. One {{had been with}} the Devon Yeomanry and was involved with horses; another veteran in his village, Captain Budgett, was with the cavalry and told Morpurgo how he had confided all his hopes and fears to his horse. Both told him of the horrific conditions and loss of life, human and animal, during the Great War. A third man remembered the army coming to the village to buy horses for the war effort: horses were used for cavalry and as <b>draught</b> <b>animals,</b> pulling guns, ambulances and other vehicles. Morpurgo researched the subject further and learned that a million horses died on the British side; he extrapolated an overall figure of 10 million horse deaths on all sides. Of the million horses that were sent abroad from the U.K., only 62,000 returned, the rest dying in the war or slaughtered in France for meat. The Great War had a massive and indelible impact on the U.K.'s male population: 886,000 men died, one in eight of those who went to war, and 2% of the entire country's population.|$|E
