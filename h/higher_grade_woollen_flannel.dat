50|$|Rochdale rose to {{prominence}} during the 19th {{century as a}} major mill town and centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and amongst the first ever industrialised towns. The Rochdale Canal—one of the major navigable broad canals of the United Kingdom, which opened between 1798 and 1804—was a highway of commerce during this time. It {{was used for the}} haulage of cotton, wool and coal to and from the area.Rochdale's early industry was the production of <b>woollen</b> <b>flannel,</b> and the cotton industry grew up alongside it. Water-powered cotton spinning mills were built on the Roch in the 1780s and 1790s, but as late as 1818 there were only seven cotton mills in Rochdale itself. By the 1840s, however, cotton had overtaken wool in importance, although the wool industry enjoyed a resurgence during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of the 1860s.|$|R

These limited-run kits featured full snap-fit assembly, an [...] "internal frame" [...] (for the first two kits, which provides better range of motion and were more poseable), and utilized the molding technique known as System Injection, wherein multiple colors would be cast on the same part. Since 1999, the <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> series uses various names to separate them from line to line. <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Universal Century (HGUC) refers to units that appear from Mobile Suit Gundam to Mobile Suit Victory Gundam and the series that are released in between. In 2010, this was expanded to include other series, under the lines <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> After Colony (HGAC), <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> After War (HGAW), <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Future Century (HGFC), <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Correct Century (HGCC) and <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Cosmic Era (HGCE). Models from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED/Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Mobile Suit Gundam 00, Mobile Suit Gundam AGE, Gundam Reconguista in G, and Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin were released separately under the sub-lines <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Gundam SEED (HG Gundam SEED), <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Gundam 00 (HG Gundam 00), <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Gundam AGE (HG Gundam AGE), <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Reconguista in G (HG Reconguista in G), and <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> The Origin (HG The Origin), respectively. In late 2013, two new lines were introduced: <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Build Fighters (HGBF) and <b>High</b> <b>Grade</b> Build Custom (HGBC) to celebrate the release of Gundam Build Fighters.

40|$|Aims The {{classification}} of abdominal mucinous neoplasia is a controversial area. In 2010, WHO published a classification which divides pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) into low and <b>high</b> <b>grades.</b> The {{aim of the}} authors was to correlate this classification with the prognosis and site of primary neoplasm. Methods The authors reviewed 274 patients with PMP who had undergone surgery at a single institution and classified them according to WHO criteria. The findings were correlated with clinical information and survival data. Results PMP was low grade in 78 % of patients and <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> in 22 %. The appendix accounted for 94 % of lesions, and the most common primary tumour was a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Colorectal primaries {{were more likely to}} be associated with <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> PMP. There was an excellent correlation between the grade of the PMP and the primary neoplasm; only two cases showed discordant morphology: both were <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> appendiceal adenocarcinomas that were associated with low grade PMP. Nodal metastases were more likely in <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> lesions, but there was no significant difference in the rate of parenchymal organ invasion between low <b>grade</b> and <b>high</b> <b>grade.</b> Low grade morphology was associated with significantly longer survival than <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> (overall 5 -year survival of 63 % for low grade and 23 % for <b>high</b> <b>grade).</b> Conclusions Categorisation as either low <b>grade</b> or <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> by WHO criteria correlates with prognosis. The grade of the PMP is generally consistent with the grade of the primary neoplasm. Colorectal primaries are more likely to be associated with <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> PMP...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), a group of proteolytic enzymes with {{a central role in}} extracellular matrix invasion and degradation, in stromal sarcomas. METHODS: 11 endometrial stromal sarcomas (four low <b>grade</b> tumours, seven <b>high</b> <b>grade)</b> were stained for MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and MMP- 9 using immunohistochemical stains. The surgical material consisted of nine hysterectomy specimens and two pelvic recurrences. Three hysterectomy specimens, removed for leiomyomas, were studied as controls. Staining area was evaluated using image analysis. RESULTS: Age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 21 to 67 years. Four of the 11 patients (three with <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> tumours and one with a low grade tumour) died of the disease, six remained free of disease, and one was lost to follow up. Staining for MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and MMP- 9 was more diffuse in <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> tumours than in low grade tumours and controls. Staining for MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 was more pronounced in <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> than in low grade tumours (p = 0. 04; p = 0. 05). Staining for MMP- 9 was significantly greater in all stromal sarcomas than in controls (p < 0. 001 for <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> tumours v controls; p < 0. 01 for low grade tumours v controls). Diffuse staining for MMP- 2, exceeding 90 % of the tumour area, was observed in three of seven <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> tumours but in no low grade tumours. There was no apparent correlation between staining for any of the three enzymes and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Both low and <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> endometrial stromal tumours express matrix metalloproteinases. MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 are expressed more diffusely in <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> than in low grade tumours. In the individual case, diffuse staining for MMP- 2 appears to best characterise the <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> tumours. Thus staining for MMP- 2 may aid in differentiating <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> from low grade tumours, and MMP- 9 in differentiating normal endometrial stroma from low and <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> endometrial stromal sarcomas. MMP expression does not appear to predict disease outcome in endometrial stromal sarcoma...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Performance {{measures}} for Australian laboratories reporting cervical cytology are {{a set of}} quantifiable measures relating to the profile and accuracy of reporting. This study reviews aggregate data collected over the ten years in which participation in the performance measures has been mandatory. Methods: Laboratories submit annual data on performance measures relating to the profile of reporting, including reporting rates for technically unsatisfactory specimens, <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> or possible <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> abnormalities and abnormal reports. Cytology-histology correlation data and review findings of negative smears reported from women with histological <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> disease are also collected. Suggested acceptable standards are set for each measure. This study reviews the aggregate data submitted by all laboratories for the years 19982008 and examines trends in reporting {{and the performance of}} laboratories against the suggested standards. Results: The performance of Australian laboratories has shown continued improvement over the study period. There has been a fall in the proportion of laboratories with data outside the acceptable standard range in all performance measures. Laboratories are reporting a greater proportion of specimens as definite or possible <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> abnormality. This is partly attributable to an increase in the proportion of abnormal results classified as <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> or possible <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> abnormality. Despite this, the positive predictive value for <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> and possible <b>high</b> <b>grade</b> abnormalities has continued to rise.
