25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is <b>Good</b> <b>for</b> <b>You,</b> {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E
500|$|... (It is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I leave), BWV108, is {{a church}} cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He {{composed}} it in Leipzig for Cantate Sunday, the fourth Sunday after Easter, and first performed it on 29 April 1725.|$|E
60|$|Next, 'He hath showed thee, O man, what is GOOD.' Not merely {{what will}} turn away God's punishments, and buy God's rewards; not merely {{what will be}} <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> after thou diest: but what is good, good in itself, <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> now, and <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> ever; <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> in health and sickness, joy and sorrow, life and death; <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> through all worlds, present and to come; yea, what would be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> in hell, if thou couldst be in hell and yet be good. Not what is <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> thy {{neighbours}} and not <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> sinners and not <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> saints, <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> stupid persons and not <b>good</b> enough <b>for</b> clever ones; but what is good in itself and of itself. The one very eternal and absolute Good which was with God, and in God, and from God, before all worlds, and will be for ever, without changing or growing less or greater, eternally The Same Good. The Good which {{would be just as}} good, and just, and right, and lovely, and glorious, if there were no world, no men, no angels, no heaven, no hell, and God were alone in his own abyss. That very good which is the exact pattern of His Son Jesus Christ, in whose likeness man was made at the beginning, God hath showed thee, O man; and hath told thee that it is neither more nor less than thy Duty, thy Duty as a man; that thy duty is thy good, the good out of which, if thou doest it, all good things such as thou canst not now conceive to thyself, must necessarily spring up <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> ever; but which if thou neglectest, thou wilt be in danger of getting no good things whatsoever, and of having all evil things, mishap, shame, and misery such as thou canst not now conceive of, spring up <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> necessarily <b>for</b> ever.|$|R

500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I leave; for if I did not go, the Comforter would not come to you.) It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E
500|$|... "Carbona Not Glue" [...] {{was written}} as a {{follow-up}} to [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue" [...] from their debut album. The song was Legs McNeil's favorite song from Leave Home, who relates: [...] " [...] was meant to clarify that while glue might not be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> the cleaning fluid Carbona was definitely a better high." [...] The song contemplates around Beach Boys harmonies, and it uses a [...] "bouncy" [...] guitar riffs. [...] "Suzy Is a Headbanger" [...] {{was inspired by the}} 1947 film noir Nightmare Alley, with the lyrics detailing a female involved in the punk rock scene.|$|E
500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for nothing in My name, BWV 87).|$|E

500|$|Another {{guest on}} the Marala was Cilla Black, singer {{and a friend}} to the Beatles since the 1960s, who recalls Starr and Harrison playing [...] "Photograph" [...] during an evening get-together, with [...] "everyone on board" [...] {{contributing}} ideas for the lyrics. As with Starr's two singles over 1971–72, [...] "It Don't Come Easy" [...] and [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", Harrison helped write the melody, although [...] "Photograph" [...] would mark {{the first time that}} he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. In her autobiography, Step Inside Love, Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: [...] "No, it's too bloody <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> I'm having it myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Julia Pistor, the film's co-producer, {{said that}} {{although}} Nickelodeon (which owns the SpongeBob trademark) wanted to sell character-themed backpacks, lunch boxes and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg's integrity and gave him control of merchandising. Hillenburg {{had no problem with}} candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was [...] "full of hidden additives." [...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's not that <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> - especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the line. I don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages". Writing for Library Journal, Judith Sutton concluded, [...] "There are, in fact, several other cookbooks devoted to bacon, {{including}} Sara Perry's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon, but with its irresistible recipes and wealth of information and lore, Villas's new title is recommended for most collections." [...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, goat cheese, and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the music video was {{generally}} favorable. Entertainment Weeklys columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close-ups of D'Angelo's physique a [...] "measure of the video's smarm-free joy {{that even though the}} camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating [...] "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> too?". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating [...] "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's [...] "Thank U" [...] (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated [...] "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of The New York Times called it [...] "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that [...] "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".|$|E

In August 2010 she gave birth to a second son. On 3 November 2011 it was reported that she was pregnant with a third son, and she gave birth in March 2012. When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said [...] "Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough. You understand what’s <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and the babies, while tennis is just a game. It’s fun because you have a different life when you step on the court but when the baby is sick you go crazy.

2500|$|In early 2011, Scherzinger {{announced}} that the musically diverse music she recorded had a bittersweet theme in which she titled the album, Killer Love, saying [...] "I wrote 'Killer Love' about a tortured love. Where you can't {{get enough of the}} love but it's not <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> And I guess when the fans listen to the album, I want them to {{know that a lot of}} the music that I chose had to do with my past experiences and relationships, where I've lost myself many times. It's [...] being lost and broken and in a very fearful, dark place and the process [...] coming out of that. It's a very empowering album but it comes from a place of heartbreak." [...] On March 2, 2011, Rap-Up revealed the cover art along with the track listing for Killer Love. On the standard cover, Scherzinger strikes a comfy pose, cracking a half-smile with a tuft of gray fur draped over her left shoulder. On October 20, 2011, the re-release cover was released with Scherzinger smiling coyly and draped lightly in a loose, unidentified, furry and wind-blown article of clothing similar to the first cover.|$|E
2500|$|His love {{of films}} {{began at the}} age of nine when Panahi's sisters would recruit him to go to see films at the local cinemas so that he could {{dramatically}} re-enact scenes and dialogue for them. His sisters were not allowed to leave their family home and Panahi often had to hide from his father at the local movie theatres. Panahi's father was also a film lover, but disapproved of his son going to see films. Panahi has stated that his father told him [...] "'These films are not <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to see.' But I wanted to see what wasn't good for me to see." [...] One day Panahi's father caught him in a movie theatre and punished him. This led to him having to seek out showings that he knew his father would never attend and he began to frequent the Kanoon, Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults, which showed art-house and international films. Kanoon is where he first discovered the films of Abbas Kiarostami, an Iranian filmmaker {{who was one of the}} co-founders of Kanoon's Filmmaking Department in 1969. He would also meet Kambuzia Partovi through Kanoon.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I think it just has great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and she and I were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna look <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps {{women in a}} good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say I give it to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
