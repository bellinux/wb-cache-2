Although for p-adic numbers p should be a prime, base 10 was chosen to highlight the analogy with decimals. The <b>decadic</b> numbers are generally not used in mathematics: since 10 is not prime or prime power, the decadics are not a field. More formal constructions and properties are given below.|$|E
25|$|LogMAR {{is another}} {{commonly}} used scale, expressed as the (<b>decadic)</b> logarithm {{of the minimum}} angle of resolution (MAR). The LogMAR scale converts the geometric sequence of a traditional chart to a linear scale. It measures visual acuity loss: positive values indicate vision loss, while negative values denote normal or better visual acuity. This scale is rarely used clinically; it is more frequently used in statistical calculations because it provides a more scientific equivalent for the traditional clinical statement of “lines lost” or “lines gained”, which is valid only when all steps between lines are equal, which is not usually the case.|$|E
25|$|Instructive for {{the study}} of the {{development}} of Jewish mysticism is the Book of Jubilees written around the time of King John Hyrcanus. It refers to mysterious writings of Jared, Cain, and Noah, and presents Abraham as the renewer, and Levi as the permanent guardian, of these ancient writings. It offers a cosmogony based upon the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and connected with Jewish chronology and Messianology, while at the same time insisting upon the heptad (7) as the holy number, rather than upon the <b>decadic</b> (10) system adopted by the later haggadists and observable in the Sefer Yetzirah. The Pythagorean idea of the creative powers of numbers and letters was shared with Sefer Yetzirah and was known in the time of the Mishnah before 200 CE.|$|E

5000|$|Like the decibel, the neper is a unit in a {{logarithmic}} scale. While the bel {{uses the}} <b>decadic</b> (base-10) logarithm to compute ratios, the neper uses the natural logarithm, based on Euler's number (e ≈ 2.71828). The {{value of a}} ratio in nepers is given by ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{density is}} usually {{measured}} by the decrease {{in the amount of}} light which shines through a transparent film, it is also called absorptiometry, the measure of light absorption through the medium. The corresponding measuring device is called a densitometer (absorptiometer). The <b>decadic</b> (base-10) logarithm of the reciprocal of the transmittance is called the absorbance or density.|$|E
5000|$|The total {{cross section}} {{is related to the}} {{absorbance}} of the light intensity through Beer-Lambert law, which says that absorbance is proportional to concentration: , where Aλ is the absorbance at a given wavelength λ, C is the concentration as a number density, and l is the path length.

50|$|When {{released}} at the finger stop, the wheel returns to its home position by spring action {{at a speed}} regulated by a governor device. During this return rotation, the dial interrupts the direct electrical current of the telephone line (local loop) a specific number of times for each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each dialed digit. Each of the ten digits is encoded in sequences of up to ten pulses so the method is sometimes called <b>decadic</b> dialling.|$|E

Measurements of <b>decadic</b> attenuation coefficient μ10 are made at one wavelength λ that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences.

50|$|In the International System of Quantities (ISQ), B is {{the symbol}} of the bel, a unit of {{logarithmic}} power ratios named after Alexander Graham Bell, creating a conflict with the IEC specification. However, little danger of confusion exists, because the bel is a rarely used unit. It is used primarily in its <b>decadic</b> fraction, the decibel (dB), for signal strength and sound pressure level measurements, while a unit for one tenth of a byte, the decibyte, and other fractions, are only used in derived units, such as transmission rates.|$|E
50|$|The prefixes of {{the metric}} system precede a basic {{unit of measure}} to {{indicate}} a <b>decadic</b> multiple and fraction of a unit. Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. Some of the prefixes {{date back to the}} introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, but new prefixes have been added, and some have been revised. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures has standardised twenty metric prefixes in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991 for use with the International System of Units (SI).|$|E

5000|$|Williams, Landel and Ferry {{proposed}} the following relationship for aT {{in terms of}} (T-T0) :where [...] is the <b>decadic</b> logarithm and C1 and C2 are positive constants that depend on the material and the reference temperature. This relationship holds only in the approximate temperature range Tg. To determine the constants, the factor aT is calculated for each component M [...] and [...] of the complex measured modulus M*. A good correlation between the two shift factors gives {{the values of the}} coefficients C1 and C2 that characterize the material.|$|E

5000|$|DMax and DMin {{refer to}} the maximum and minimum density that can be {{produced}} by the material. The {{difference between the two}} is the density range. The density range is related to the exposure range (dynamic range), which is the range of light intensity that is represented by the recording, via the Hurter-Driffield curve. In the context of photography, the dynamic range is often measured in [...] "stops", which is the binary logarithm of the ratio of highest and lowest distinguishable exposures; in an engineering context, the dynamic range is usually given by its <b>decadic</b> logarithm expressed in decibels.|$|E
50|$|A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a {{basic unit}} of measure to {{indicate}} a multiple or fraction of the unit. While all metric prefixes in common use today are <b>decadic,</b> historically {{there have been a}} number of binary metric prefixes as well. Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix kilo-, for example, may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix milli-, likewise, may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.|$|E
5000|$|In most {{countries}} one pulse {{is used for}} the digit 1, two pulses for 2, and so on, with ten pulses for the digit 0; this makes the code unary, excepting the digit 0. Exceptions to this are: Sweden (...) , with one click for 0, two clicks for 1, and so on; and New Zealand with ten clicks for 0, nine clicks for 1, etc. Oslo, the capital city of Norway, used the New Zealand system, {{but the rest of the}} country did not. Systems that used this encoding of the 10 digits in a sequence of up to 10 pulses, are sometimes known as <b>decadic</b> dialing systems.|$|E
50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, <b>decadic</b> dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|E
