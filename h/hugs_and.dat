5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and <b>hugs</b> <b>and</b> kisses Susan.|$|E

[...] "These are your cousins Larkins," [...] said Mrs. Johnson; [...] "that's Annie (unexpected <b>hug</b> <b>and</b> smack), that's Miriam (resolute <b>hug</b> <b>and</b> smack), and that's Minnie (prolonged <b>hug</b> <b>and</b> smack)." ...|$|R

Liz convinces him to make it up to her, and everyone else who helped him with the video game, by buying them presents.

500|$|The {{performance}} sparked criticisms {{from some}} parents {{on social media}} who believed the performance was [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "inappropriate" [...] due to its risqué nature; Melissa Henson, {{a representative of the}} Parents Television Council {{said in a statement that}} the performance was [...] "suggestive" [...] before adding, [...] "We have seen pretty consistently enough inappropriate material , that a lot of parents have written these off." [...] Contrastingly, writing for ThinkProgress, Alyssa Rosenberg said of the controversy: [...] "This may not be the vision of marriage conservatives intended to try to promote [...] if marriage is a product that conservatives desperately want to sell, the smartest thing they could do right now is to hire Beyoncé and Jay-Z as a product spokescouple... they made marriage look fun, and sexy, and a source of mutual professional fulfillment." [...] On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago." [...] On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the DirecTv pre-Super Bowl party. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone referred to the pair's chemistry as the highlight of the event and said the performance was [...] "smiles and <b>hugs</b> <b>and</b> laughs, with one of the most famous rappers in the world gladly playing hypeman" [...] in contrast to the Grammy performance. Nekesa Mumbi Moody writing for the Associated Press felt that it was the set's highlight. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2014, Beyoncé performed [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. The performance featured the singer dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and a singalong from the audience. She started the performance on a set of steps, with numerous dancers in headstands around her and went to the stage afterwards. Nadeska Alexis from MTV News commented that when the song opened, [...] "the crowd really started to lose their composure". Writers of The Hollywood Reporter described the song's performance as [...] "booty-popping".|$|E

[...] Unlike {{the concerts}} of {{classical}} pianists which normally ended with applause and a retreat off-stage, Liberace's shows ended with the public invited on-stage to touch his clothes, piano, jewelry, and hands. Kisses, handshakes, <b>hugs,</b> <b>and</b> caresses usually followed. A critic summed up his appeal {{near the end of}} Liberace's life: [...] "Mr. Showmanship has another more potent, drawing power to his show: the warm and wonderful way he works his audience. Surprisingly enough, behind all the glitz glitter, the corny false modesty, and the shy smile, Liberace exudes a love that is returned to him a thousand-fold." ...|$|E

The building overflowed with positive vibes, and that emotion was infectious. This day was not about basketball. It was not about a game. This was a celebration of life and a community coming together to support one girl and two teams as they banded together to beat up on cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{high contact}} culture, many {{things are not}} {{verbally}} stated but are express through physical touch.

2500|$|Stone Cold Steve Austin, who {{had turned}} heel at WrestleMania and formed an {{alliance}} with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed {{from the threat of}} The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince a cowboy hat as a present. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Austin played [...] "Kumbaya" [...] and [...] "We Are the Champions" [...] for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him <b>hugs</b> <b>and</b> gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold who was a [...] "beer-swilling, foul-mouthed SOB" [...] and the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold that [...] "didn't take shit from anyone". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, [...] "If you want Stone Cold to beat the living hell out of Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!" [...] to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, shook his head and proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed.|$|E
