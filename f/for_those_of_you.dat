Heads-up <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> who missed the other warning threads and {{need a place to}} completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is {{to make it easier to}} use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s, WHFS would {{broadcast}} {{music that}} other FM Rock stations normally overlooked, including cuts {{as long as}} 20 minutes. Artists like Frank Zappa, Yes, Genesis, Roxy Music and other non-commercial artists of the time were the normal format. If The Beatles were ever played, their more obscure tracks like Tomorrow Never Knows or Blue Jay Way were used instead of familiar tracks like Hey Jude or Lady Madonna. Once the station played all of Revolution 9. The station made a policy of never playing a [...] "hit" [...] and broke with precedent by leaving the playlists strictly up to the DJs.

[...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would like to change my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did.

Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it certainly could have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun.

We arrived in Texas, Friday morning at 2 : 30, all tired + sleepy. What a ride it was! On our way down here we experienced a very spectacular incident. We were caught in a flood in Indiana. The Wabash River was rising at the rate of 2 inches per hour. We were forced to stop because the water was over the rails. The engineer finally solved the problem by taking a detour so to escape the flood. You should have seen the people standing on their home sites just watching their houses being washed away. What a horrible thing to witness, that is something I will always remember. Is there much excitement at school now or aren’t there enough fellows? I hope everything could be back to normal conditions when we lived so freely and enjoyed everything we did- especially the times at Bryant, such as Greek Letter dance, Commencement, fraternity dances, etc. By the way, are they going to have the Greek Letter this year?

40|$|In {{considering}} {{how best to}} tackle this topic, I ultimately decided that in Nebraska the 2 ̆ 2 best 2 ̆ 2 approach is usually the 2 ̆ 2 most straight forward 2 ̆ 2 one. Given {{that much of the}} conversation about distance education is filled with myth and marketing hype, I decided what we could best contribute to the conversation would be the facts. While some of the other authors may have a better in-depth grasp of distance education opportunities and realities in Nebraska, Erik and I come as native Nebraskans with a good understanding of the history, economy, communities and cultures in our home state. My early faculty career here at UNL included producing thousands of radio and television programs in home economics and agricultural areas including a weekly educational television program in consumer affairs. I spent approximately 20 years of my career outside Nebraska in the U. S. Department of Agriculture in international training and development positions and as head of Communication, Information and Technology for the USDA Extension Service. Six <b>of</b> <b>those</b> 20 years were spent in Tanzania, East Africa, establishing a large human resource development program. My academic degrees are in journalism, nutrition and adult and continuing education - all from UNL. My current position as president of the ADEC distance education consortium which includes approximately 55 state university and land grant college members provides a unique perspective on the field of distance education locally, nationally and internationally. Erik France, who is assisting me in this work, is a journalism and business graduate from UNL and is currently doing his masters degree in the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication. Erik conducted a series of Nebraska interviews related to the issues we were asked to cover. I also think he provides a youthful, up and coming perspective that is important for us to hear. We also consider this paper to be a draft, a document to stimulate <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> attending this conference and others who may want to contribute ideas following this conference on our ADEC website. We posted the paper to the website - [URL] and would welcome additional insights that will assist us in completing the document by November 15. We have chosen to organize the document around five propositions - for each of these, I will provide rationale and discussion material, Erik will then provide perspectives from his interviews that relate and then we will ask <b>for</b> reactions from <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in this room...|$|R
60|$|Again, {{in other}} of your classes, in Chemistry, in Astronomy, in Natural History, besides {{acquiring}} groups of facts, {{the student has}} {{a glimpse of the}} method by which they were discovered, of the type of inference to which the discovery conforms, so that the discovery of a new comet, the detection of a new species, the invention of a new chemical compound, each becomes a lesson of the most beautiful and impressive kind in the art of reasoning. And it would be superfluous and impertinent for me here to point out how valuable such lessons are in the way of mental discipline, apart from the fruit they bear in other ways. But here again the relation to the judgments we have to form in the moral, political, practical sphere, is too remote and too indirect. The judgments, in this region, of the most brilliant and successful explorers in physical science, seem to be exactly as liable to every kind of fallacy as those of other people. The application of scientific method and conception to society is yet in its infancy, and the Novum Organum or the Principia of moral and social phenomena will perhaps not be wholly disclosed to any of us now alive. In any case it is clear that for the purposes of such an institution as this, if the rules of evidence and proof and all the other safeguards for making your propositions true and relevant, are to be taught at all, they must be taught not only in an elementary form, but with illustrations that shall convey their own direct reference and application to practical life. If everybody could find time to master Mill's Logic or so instructive and interesting a book as Professor Jevons's Principles of Science, a certain number at any rate of the bad mental habits of people would be cured; and <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> here who have leisure enough, and want to find a worthy keystone of your culture, {{it would be hard to}} find a better thing to do for the next six months than to work through one or both of the books I have just named--pen in hand. The ordinary text-books of formal logic do not seem to meet the special aim which I am now trying to impress as desirable--namely, the habit of valuing, not merely speculative nor scientific truth, but the truth of practical life; a practising of the intellect in forming and expressing the opinions and judgments that form the staple of our daily discourse.|$|E

40|$|From 12 to 14 February, the Louis Bolk Instituut {{organised}} the 3 rd annual QLIF workshop, titled "Measuring food quality, concepts, {{methods and}} challenges”. During these days a diverse and intensive program was presented. Participants came from, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Turkey. Participants {{were all very}} enthusiastic, both {{on the quality of}} the presentations and the total program. <b>For</b> all <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> who missed it, I give a brief impression. On the first day definitions of food quality were discussed as well as the methods to measure this quality. Machteld Huber explained the inner quality concept, developed by the Louis Bolk Instituut. This inner quality concept is based on two main life processes in organisms; Growth and Differentiation and the balance or integration of these two processes. This in contrast to many other quality definitions based on the presence or absence of substances. Analytical methods for measuring food quality (measuring substances) and experimental methods (e. g. crystallisation, biofotons) measuring life processes were discussed. After the theoretical part, participants had the opportunity to work with biocrystallisation pictures and to visit the crystallisation laboratory. The second day started with a visit to one of the largest organic greenhouses in the Netherlands. The farmer grows tomatoes and paprika on a contract basis. Recently he started with a speciality in tomatoes, the Wild Wonders, a mixture of different shaped and coloured tomatoes. The greenhouse therefore gave a good view on the combination of ‘volume’ production and quality growing. In the afternoon, Jacob Holm Nielsen gave us a very interesting insight into the QLIF studies on organic and low input dairy. The type of feed showed to be very important for the milk composition and he emphasized that for organic high-quality dairy, maize can better be avoided as part of the feeding regime. Joke Bloksma presented the studies performed on lettuce, apple and carrot quality and how management factors (for apple, the bearing of the tree, sun light, ripening etc) influenced the quality of the products. Finally Gabriele Wyss from FIBL gave a presentation on food safety and food risks in organic production. She explained that many food safety aspects and food risks in organic are covered by conventional safety regulations and additional rules for organic farming. Because of the precautionary principles in organic food production the product safety and process safety tends to be higher in organic than in conventional. At the end of the day 4 participants presented their own research. This gave a broad view on different studies in the field of food quality and it gave rise to many questions and suggestions from other participants. The 3 rd day taste and health were the main topics. Organic food might have a better taste than conventional, but how do we measure taste. Bob Cramwinckel of the Centre for Taste Research explained their 3 -steps method to measure physical, psychological and total taste. Last presentation was given by Ruth Adriaansen on how we can study health effects of organic food. The necessity of a clear working definition of health showed to be very important for the design of a study, the choice of parameters and the effects to be studied. As an example, the study design of “Organic, more healthy ??”, the large feeding study in chicken, currently being performed by the Louis Bolk Instituut, was discussed. According to one of the scientific contributors the program “gave a great insight in the discussion going on in the field of organic food quality”. The overall conclusion was that for the evaluation <b>of</b> food quality <b>you</b> have to take much more aspects into account than nutritional content and contaminants only. An enlarged or holistic quality concept is needed to cover the ambitions of organic food production. Challenge is to further develop such concepts and to design robust scientific studies which account for all relevant quality aspects. ...|$|R
