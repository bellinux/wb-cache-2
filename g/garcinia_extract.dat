The activity of xathone can be found from the number of NK cell that will increase the production of IFN-γ cytokine. Methods: The human experimental research has been done by Randomized Control Group Pretest-Post Test Design, 20 patients sample for each group. Group 1 : The HIV patients with ARV therapy were given mangosteen peel extract, 2 : The HIV patients with ARV therapy were given placebo capsule. The treatment was done for 30 days, then NK cells number and IFN-γ level examination was done in pre – post treatment. The result was tested to find out the normality of data distribution by Saphiro Wilks test. If the data distribution is normal, the data analysis was continued by Paired Sample T Test to determine the difference between the pre test nad post test treatment. If the data distribution is abnormal, data analysis was continued by Wilcoxon Smith test. And Spearman’s Rho test was used to determine the correlation between the number of NK cells and IFN-γ level.

5000|$|Caspase-3 is {{activated}} in the apoptotic cell both by extrinsic (death ligand) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways. [...] The zymogen feature of caspase-3 is necessary because if unregulated, caspase activity would kill cells indiscriminately. [...] As an executioner caspase, the caspase-3 zymogen has virtually no activity {{until it is}} cleaved by an initiator caspase after apoptotic signaling events have occurred. [...] One such signaling event is the introduction of granzyme B, which can activate initiator caspases, into cells targeted for apoptosis by killer T cells. [...] This extrinsic activation then triggers the hallmark caspase cascade characteristic of the apoptotic pathway, in which caspase-3 plays a dominant role. [...] In intrinsic activation, cytochrome c from the mitochondria works in combination with caspase-9, apoptosis-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), and ATP to process procaspase-3.

SEM images of all electrospun PVP/GME composite nanofiber mats showed that they had similar and smooth morphology, no beads, and spindle shape. Its average diameter decreased and its surface area therefore increased with the decrease of its PVP concentration. The benefit of high surface area is obvious in drug delivery systems for poorly water-soluble drugs. Their FTIR spectra indicated that PVP and GME interacted intermolecularly via hydrogen bonds in the composite nanofiber mats. A conformational change in the C-H chain of PVP occurred in the composite nanofiber mats due to the intermolecular interactions. Their XRD patterns confirmed that they were amorphous because of amorphization during electrospinning. The XRD analyses also strengthened the FTIR studies; namely, GME and PVP formed intermolecular interactions in the electrospun composite nanofiber mats. As a result, GME as the encapsulated drug was molecularly dispersed in the electrospun PVP nanofiber matrix that functioned as a drug delivery system.

Various HCA salts are available, including calcium, magnesium, potassium and mixtures of these. Experimentally, these salts exhibit different properties with some, but not all, improving glucose tolerance and blood pressure. Recently, obesity-prone C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45 kcal% fat) {{with or without}} GC (1 %, w/w) for 16 wk. The active arm reduced visceral fat, adipocyte size and serum glucose, yet purportedly also exhibited hepatic collagen accumulation, lipid peroxidation and increased mRNA levels of genes related to oxidative stress. The latter findings {{are at odds with}} a large body of animal and human studies that have been conducted on the safety and efficacy of HCA. This literature shows HCA to be protective against the liver toxicity associated with ethanol and dexamethasone administration, and to maintain serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase at near normal levels. In both animal and clinical literature, elevated intakes of HCA per se have not led to signs of inflammation or hepatotoxicity. The compound has been found to reduce markers of inflammation in brain, intestines, kidney and serum...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the anti-obesity effect of a mixture composed of <b>Garcinia</b> cambogia <b>extract,</b> soypeptide, and l-carnitine (1. 2 : 0. 3 : 0. 02, w/w/w) in rats rendered obese by a high-fat diet (HFD). Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either the high-fat control diet (CD) or the 0. 38 % mixture-supplemented HFD (CD + M) for 9  weeks. The mixture significantly reduced body weight gain and the accumulation of visceral fat mass in a rat model of HFD-induced obesity. Moreover, the mixture effectively lowered blood and hepatic lipid concentrations and serum glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and leptin levels in rats with HFD-induced obesity. Results from real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that the expression levels of leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c (SREBP 1 c) genes in the epididymal fat tissue of rats fed the CD + M diet were 0. 4 -, 0. 6 -, and 0. 48 -fold, respectively, of those found in the CD rats (P  <  0. 05), while expression of the uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) gene in epididymal adipose tissue was 1. 25 -fold (P  <  0. 05) of that found in CD rats. In conclusion, a mixture composed of G. cambogia extract, soy peptide, and l-carnitine attenuated visceral fat accumulation and improved dyslipidemia in a rat model with HFD-induced obesity...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured copper {{particles}} are synthesized by <b>Garcinia</b> mangostana leaf <b>extract</b> as reducing agent with copper nitrate. X-ray diffraction study confirms {{the formation of}} nanocrystalline cubic phase of copper nanoparticles. The micro-structural properties such as grain size, strain, dislocation density and particle size are examined. The lattice constant is calculated using Nelson–Riley function. Physical parameters like lattice constants, stress, strain, dislocation density and size are calculated. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermo gravimetric (TGA) have confirmed that nanoparticles have phase purity and weight loss percentage is 3. 328 %. The particle size calculated from XRD is 26. 51  nm which is in good agreement {{with the results of}} W–H plot, SSP methods and particle analyser. The morphology of prepared copper nanoparticles is characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and TEM. These biologically synthesized nano{{particles are}} highly antibacterial against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the cardiovascular effect of administration of antimalarial drugs amodiaquine and artesunate and the efficacy of <b>Garcinia</b> kola <b>extract</b> (kolaviron) in protecting against such possible effect. Thirty (30) adult male albino rats divided into six (6) groups were used in this study. Groups D, E and F were treated with 100 mg/Kg b. w of the extract twice daily for the first one week and 200 mg/Kg b. w. /day for the subsequent three (3) weeks. Amodiaquine (10 mg/Kg. b. w. /day) was administered orally for four (4) days into rats in groups A and E while rats in groups B and F were treated with artesunate (5 mg/Kg b. w. /day) for four (4) days. Group C rats (normal control) were treated with normal saline. All the rats were sacrificed after four (4) weeks treatment period. Blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture while the liver, kidney, stomach and heart were removed, cleansed and weigh. Total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in the serum, while total fibrinogen, platelet count, red blood cell and {{white blood cell count}} were measured in the whole blood. The artherogenic and coronary risk index were also determined. Results indicate that both amodiaquine and artesunate predispose to cardiovascular disease, however the effect was more pronounced with artesunate than amodiaquine. The result also suggests that both drugs could increase the risk of coronary and artherogenic diseases and that Garcinia kola do not prevent th...|$|R
