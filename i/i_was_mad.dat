5|$|I {{called to}} him to turn hard opposite, so I could {{sandwich}} the Red fighters, but in his standard-rate bomber turn he got hit. I saw {{the whole thing and}} ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I tell you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, their {{military}} term over, Pascu and Fundal returned to Mediaş, where Pascu {{was discovered by}} Romanian Radio's Radio Vacanţa station. [...] He was invited to perform at the station's youth concerts, where he met and befriended Teo Peter, bass player for Compact, and music promoter Andrei Partoş. During 1982, Pascu also played Cenaclul Flacăra concerts, and was billed for the UTC's Scînteia Tineretului shows. He later described his mentoring by rock singers Cristi Minculescu, Liviu Tudan, Adi Ordean and Vladi Cnejevici as his [...] "third real school". In 1980, Pascu also discovered and became influenced by reggae music. He {{was introduced to the}} reggae style by The Police and its reggae fusion sessions, then became a fan of reggae numbers played by African diaspora students in Romanian universities. Twenty years later, Pascu told reporters: [...] "Between 1980 and 1985, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> about Bob Marley." ...|$|E

My friend Pritchard here says <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad.</b> <b>I</b> {{must have}} <b>been</b> <b>mad</b> or <b>I</b> shouldn't {{have tried to}} hurt that dear beautiful lady over there." ...|$|R

500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>Mad</b> Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2011 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cramer {{explained that he}} was unprepared for Stewart's intense interview, saying [...] "As soon as he started, I realized Stewart was on a mission to make me look like a clown. I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. What was I supposed to do, talk about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush. I'm a Democrat, I've got the canceled checks to prove it, and suddenly I'm the enemy? Me? Me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] she moaned. [...] "There are shadows {{everywhere}} {{among my}} thoughts. Tell me. Have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>mad?</b> Am <b>I</b> going to <b>be</b> mad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Florence!' she cried. 'My better angel! Before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad</b> again, {{before my}} stubbornness {{comes back and}} strikes me dumb, believe me, upon my soul <b>I</b> <b>am</b> innocent!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad,</b> my dear Mrs. Vavasour; <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> so a long time: but Snowdon ponies are {{in their}} sober senses,--and I shall take one of them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Grant {{was born}} in Edinburgh, {{and raised in the}} city's Morningside district. His Musselburgh-born father James managed the pop band Marmalade before {{becoming}} an accountant. His mother Susan worked for the University of Edinburgh. He attended the Edinburgh Academy before joining Barnard Castle School as a boarding pupil. Grant explained that [...] "My parents thought {{it would be better for}} me to be away from home. They have good friends who live not far from Barnard Castle and their two sons were there. So they knew the school and said it was good for rugby and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> on rugby." [...] Whilst at Barnard Castle he represented Scottish rugby union at U18 and U19 level, although his rugby career was cut short by a shoulder injury. Grant lists his early fashion influences as Barbour, Burberry, Hunter, Lyle & Scott and Pringle.|$|E
2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed me a couple of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I tell?" [...] he begged. [...] "I will conceal {{nothing from}} you. That {{night when he}} left I {{followed}} him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> with jealousy. On a dark street I struck him down. He did not rise. I examined him. His head had struck a stone. I {{did not intend to}} kill him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> with love and jealousy. I hid near by and saw an ambulance take him away. Although you married him, Helen--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When I tell you," [...] he said, [...] "you {{will think}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad.</b> Yet this <b>is</b> the truth. The {{man with whom}} you talked was Prince von Falkenberg." ...|$|R

60|$|ANABEL. I was blinded--maddened. Gerald stung me and stung me till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b> I {{left him}} for reason's sake, for sanity's sake. We should have killed one another.|$|E

6000|$|The tension <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{suffering}} from {{was so great}} that it was perhaps just as well that Mr. Burns had started on his grievance. He seemed very sore about it and grumbled, [...] "Does he think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad,</b> or what?" ...|$|R
60|$|It is not enclosed, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad</b> to {{know where}} she writes from that I may write to her. Pray set this right, for her uneasiness will be greatly {{intensified}} if she have no word from me.|$|R

60|$|Upon the morrow I repented me already {{with much}} bitterness. But in that hour I knew no reason. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> and of my madness was born this harsh brutality.|$|E

6000|$|... "Possibly not, sweet sister, but as {{you often}} tell me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad,</b> and as <b>I</b> never deny the charge, {{it seems to me}} that you have said nothing to vindicate the old woman's {{character}} for sanity." ...|$|R
60|$|TRUE!--nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> and am; but why {{will you}} say that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad?</b> The disease had {{sharpened}} my senses--not destroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>mad?</b> Hearken! and observe how healthily--how calmly I {{can tell you the}} whole story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{can assure}} you that I have rather enjoyed it," [...] she {{answered}} him. [...] "My coachman believes that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>mad,</b> and my maid is sure of it. Won't you introduce me to your friend--your sister, perhaps?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} twist any more, {{it was just}} which of us could get there first. I {{gathered}} all my remaining strength, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> mad with terror, and bounded forward.|$|E
