5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{which usually}} appears from late summer to autumn, is {{distributed}} in the hemlock <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Coast Ranges from Northern California to Alaska, the Cascade Range, {{as well as in}} interior forests such as in Manitoba.

5|$|At first, the <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{watershed}} {{were not}} significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{save the}} <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region began in the 19th century under Major Ramsay, the British Officer who was in-charge of the area during those times. The {{first step in the}} {{protection}} of the area began in 1868 when the British forest department established control over the land and prohibited cultivation and the operation of cattle stations. In 1879 these forests were constituted into a reserve forest where restricted felling was permitted.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E

In 1956, Miskovsky obtained a law degree from the George Washington University Law School. He joined the legal office of the CIA, and was eventually promoted to the rank of assistant general counsel.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Madagascar's three established sites, a further seven sites {{are listed as}} tentative and are under consideration by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for elevation to official status. Five initial sites were inscribed on the tentative list in 1997: the Betafo Riziculture and Hydraulic Landscape, the Royal Compound of Tsinjoarivo), the Mahafaly Country of Southwestern Madagascar, the Cliff and Caves of Isandra, and Antongona. In 2008, two additional sites {{were added to the}} list: Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve (an extension of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana) and the Dry <b>Forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andrefana.|$|E

For instance, the scarcely inhabited <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under Béla IV. Huts disappeared, and new rural houses {{consisting of}} a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built.

5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s.

It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed.

5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Plateau region of West Virginia, lying {{to the west of the}} Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains, was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous mixed oaks and chestnut trees. The cove <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate broadleaf and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{wild boars}} (Sus scrofa) are {{native to the}} park. They are often found near the beaches where they feed on scraps and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, other mammals can be spotted, such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (Caracal caracal), among many others usually not native to such areas.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius vinaceorufescens grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under pine between August and October. The species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). It is a fairly common and widely distributed species in North America. The mushroom {{has been found in}} boreal forests and high-elevation <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Appalachians, associated with the tree genera Picea, Abies, and Pinus. In California, it has been noted to commonly co-occur with L.fragilis, L.rubrilacteus, Russula emetica, and R.cremoricolor.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
