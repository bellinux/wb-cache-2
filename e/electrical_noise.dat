Martlesham provided a Handley Page Heyford bomber, a reversal of duties from the original Daventry Experiment {{that led to the}} development of CH in which a Heyford was the target. One reason for the selection of this design was that its Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines had a well-shielded ignition system which gave off minimal <b>electrical</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} small signal amplification, {{it is most}} {{desirable}} to get gain {{as close as possible}} to the initial point of the signal interception: moving the gain ahead of any signal processing reduces the additive contributions of effects like resistor Johnson-Nyquist <b>noise,</b> or <b>electrical</b> <b>noises</b> in active circuits. In optical heterodyne detection, the mixing-gain happens directly in the physics of the initial photon absorption event, making this ideal. Additionally, to a first approximation, absorption is perfectly quadratic, in contrast to RF detection by a diode non-linearity.|$|R

25|$|Motorola {{offered a}} 1970s-era {{system based on}} the United States Coast Guard LORAN {{maritime}} navigation system. The LORAN system was intended for ships but signal levels on the US east- and west-coast areas were adequate for use with receivers in automobiles. The system may have been marketed under the Motorola model name Metricom. It consisted of an LF LORAN receiver and data interface box/modem connected to a separate two-way radio. The receiver and interface calculated a latitude and longitude in degrees, decimal degrees format based on the LORAN signals. This was sent over the radio as MDC-1200 or MDC-4800 data to a system controller, which plotted the mobile's approximate location on a map. The system worked reliably but sometimes had problems with <b>electrical</b> <b>noise</b> in urban areas. Sparking electric trolley poles or industrial plants which radiated <b>electrical</b> <b>noise</b> sometime overwhelmed the LORAN signals, affecting the system's ability to determine the mobile's geolocation. Because of the limited resolution, this type of system was impractical for small communities or operational areas such as a pit mine or port.|$|E
25|$|Surge {{protective}} devices {{are designed to}} reduce the random energy surges of voltage transients and <b>electrical</b> <b>noise</b> on the power supply line that can damage sensitive electronics such as TVs, computers, and smart appliances. They are available for 120V, 15/20A applications, in different form factors such as surge protective receptacles in single, duplex, four-in-one, and six receptacle configurations as well as surge-protective power strips. These devices provide point-of-use protection and are {{the last line of}} defense in a whole house surge protection network.|$|E
25|$|Suppression {{capacitors}} {{are effective}} interference reduction components because their electrical impedance decreases with increasing frequency, {{so that at}} higher frequencies they short circuit <b>electrical</b> <b>noise</b> and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{incident}} CERN reported that the most likely {{cause of the problem}} was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets, and that– due to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature– it would take at least two months to fix. CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively, and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008. The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty electrical connection had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and <b>electrical</b> <b>noise</b> induced in other quench detectors also {{played a role in the}} rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown. This accident was thoroughly discussed in a 22February 2010 Superconductor Science and Technology article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.|$|E

We propose and experimentally prove a nano-ratchet effect directly linked to an asymmetry in the equilibrium transmission probability, which becomes possible when a magnetic field is present. Remarkably, the current/voltage do not disappear even without any intentional external excitation.
