50|$|The {{town was}} {{settled in the}} 19th century with the first {{industrialization}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Main industries are wood products and the chemical industry.

50|$|Phaeocystis can <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> either {{free-living}} {{cells or}} colonies. Free-living cells can show {{a variety of}} morphologies, depending on the species. All species can <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> scaly flagellates, {{and this is the}} only form that has been observed for P. scrobiculata and P. cordata. Three species have been observed as colonies (P. globosa, P. pouchetii and P. antarctica) and these can also <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> a flagellate devoid of scales and filaments. In colonies of Phaeocystis, the colony skin may provide protection against smaller zooplankton grazers and viruses.|$|R
5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions.

5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still <b>exists,</b> <b>as</b> does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E
5|$|Borscht, {{like any}} other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E

5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} <b>exists</b> <b>as</b> a village, but for {{location}} see {{for example the}} 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{significant}} fortifications in the harbour area, {{the rest of}} the islands remained mostly undefended until the 17th century, and they were prone to attacks (such as the raid of 1551).

5|$|Examination of peat cores and pollen records {{indicates}} that soil erosion (suggesting clearance of woodland for agricultural purposes) {{was taking place}} in 3470 BC (the early Neolithic era); much later, from 2460 BC, evidence of arable cultivation <b>exists.</b> <b>As</b> the climate became damper, peat expanded its coverage {{at the expense of}} woodland, and post-glacial sea level changes left raised beaches around the coastline 18–45metres above the present sea-level, especially between Harris and A'Bhrideanach; Bronze Age artefacts, such as barbed-and-tanged arrowheads typical of the Beaker People, have been found in the machair which replaced it.|$|E
