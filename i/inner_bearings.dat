In 1842 locomotive power consisted of twelve six-wheeled engines; {{a second set of}} six were ordered from Shepherd and Todd to a revised design: a broad wheelbase of 11 ft and lateral spring spacing of 6.5 ft, along with a centrally located driving crank was employed to increase safety by reducing oscillations at speed; the design was simplified to two inner frames supporting the <b>inner</b> <b>bearings</b> creating more space in the inside frame, in order to facilitate ease of maintenance; expansive working of steam was employed for fuel efficiency; the remainder of the design was influence by contemporary best practice - 6 ft driving wheels, pistons of 2 by 1 ft stroke by diameter, and a firebox 2 by 3.5 ft with 94 fire tubes each 9.5 ft long and [...] diameter.|$|E

40|$|The {{blood supply}} of the {{symphysis}} pubis is still the subject of some debate. Classic anatomy books state that this joint is avascular, whereas some published works have shown blood vessels in young specimens. As several articular discs such as the knee menisci {{are known to have}} blood vessels in their peripheries, we decided to investigate the possible nutrition pathways to the interpubic disc and ligaments. We used 60 Wistar rats, male and female, aged between 28 and 32 days, or between 90 and 100 days. Samples were processed using a variety of techniques: regular histology, immunohistochemestry, India ink injection and corrosion casting. The interpubic disc consisted of an <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> portion and an outer fibrous rim. The interpubic ligaments and the fibrous rim were well vascularized in all groups. Marrow contacts between the interpubic disc and the subchondral bone were also observed. Blood vessels formed an authentic arterial circle embracing the joint, from which blood vessels branched into capillary loops facing the avascular <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> portion of the disc. These results confirm the need for future studies on the human symphysis pubis, to provide more details on its structure, which would enable clinicians such as physiotherapists to improve prognosis and treatment design.

40|$|Bearings of three-bearing shafts {{are usually}} treated as ideally-rigid {{articulated}} supports.

Moreover, in most types of bearings, a reactive bending moment is the response of bearing to unparallel position of <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> rings in relation to outer rings, that is to the tilt angle.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Femoral neck fracture is a common fracture in senior pa-tients, which can decrease mobility and increase mortality [1]. There are many options for these fractures including internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty, and total hip arthro-plasty [2]. Among these procedures, hemiarthroplasty has become the most preferred treatment option for surgeons according to the surveys [1 - 3]. There are two types of options, including unipolar hemiarthroplasty (UH) and bipolar hemiarthroplasty (BH), when using a hemiarthro-plasty. In comparison to UH, BH has an additional <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> between the stem and the endoprosthetic head component. In theory, this design would decrease acetab-ular erosion, decrease protrusion, and decrease disloca-tion, as well as maintain joint stability and improve hip function [4, 5]. However, whether UH or BH is preferable for the patient population remains uncertain [6 - 13]. Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic have been published, these studies showed in-conclusive and controversial results [14 - 23].

40|$|A wave {{journal bearing}} concept {{features}} a waved <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> {{diameter of the}} non-rotating bearing side {{and it is an}} alternative to the plain journal bearing. The wave journal bearing has a significantly increased load capacity in comparison to the plain journal bearing operating at the same eccentricity. It also offers greater stability than the plain circular bearing under all operating conditions. The wave bearing's design is relatively simple and allows the shaft to rotate in either direction. Three wave bearings are sensitive to the direction of an applied stationary side load. Increasing the number of waves reduces the wave bearing's sensitivity to the direction of the applied load relative to the wave. However, the range in which the bearing performance can be varied decreases as the number of waves increases. Therefore, both the number and the amplitude of the waves must be properly selected to optimize the wave bearing design for a specific application. It is concluded that the stiffness of an air journal bearing, due to hydrodynamic effect, could be doubled and made to run stably by using a six or eight wave geometry with a wave amplitude approximately half of the bearing radial clearance...|$|R

Such a design increases the effective head diameter and therefore is an attractive option in challenging situations of unstable total hip arthroplasties.

At a minimum followup of 2. 2  years (mean, 4  years; range, 2. 2 – 6. 8  years), one hip had redislocated 2  months postoperatively and was managed successfully without reoperation by closed reduction with no additional dislocation.

The problems that were addressed during the testing procedure were: removal of an <b>inner</b> <b>bearing</b> in the Opens Boat to rectify the torque inconsistencies; a constant monitoring and recalibration of the shaft speed due to voltage variations during testing; and a temporary water seal on the Opens Boat to inhibit water ingress into the Open Boat during high carriage speed test runs.

Therefore, it is recommended that the Opens Boat should be utilized for future open water experiments. Other recommendations were also stated to ensure that the Opens Boat data would not be spoiled by other problems that may creep into the system.
