One important form of multiorganizational collaboration is the <b>hospital</b> alliance or <b>federation.</b> Federations consist of three or more organizations that pool re-sources to achieve stated objectives.

40|$|INTRODUCTION TO GOOD PRACTICES IN MENTAL HEALTH The GPMB is an {{international}} community health project designed to describe and publicise local mental health services which represent a particularly high standard of mental health provision. It is not a research project but a method of showing that in most communities {{there are a number}} of imaginative effective services. It encourages an exchange of information about these good practices and stimulates others to build on what is already proving successful. Started by the International <b>Hospital</b> <b>Federation</b> in Britain in 1977, the project grew out of {{an international}} survey of health care in big cities. This revealed a universal impression that the mental health services were failing to cope. There were however, isolated examples of imaginative mental health schemes in all the cities, often operating on a small scale and at low cost. Information about such schemes tended to spread slowly, possibly because the people involved were too busy or modest to publicise their efforts. GPMB local studies are not intended to be comprehensive guides for consumers or referral agencies. They are local resource references of good ideas which have been put into practice and a source of practical information for those wishing to set up similar schemes. The descriptions are intentionally brief and always include the name and address of a contact who will provide further details. This report is primarily for local use but copies are sent to the GPMB data-bank which now has over 1000 project sheets available to anyone thinking of setting up a particular service. Details may be obtained from the Mental Health Association of Ireland, Mensana House, 6, Adelaide Street, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin. Telephone: 01 - 841166.

Tallaght, where this first study has been carried out, is a fairly new urban area with a high density population whose community health services are at the developmental stage.

The programme of the Tour had been drawn up in such a way as to enable participants to see Ireland's newest hospitals. and in fact. of the twenty-three establishments included. ten have been opened since 1953, while several others have new departments or extensions recently added. This will give some idea of the extensive programme of hospital construction which has been undertaken in Ireland. During the past seven years. some £ 30 million have been spent; building operations completed have provided some 8, 000 additional hospital beds and cots. and work in progress will provide some 1. 200 further beds on completion. Plans have been made for future extensions and the construction of several new hospitals, covering a total of over 2, 500 new beds and cots. The hospitals visited by participants in the Study Tour range in size from a district hospital with 35 beds to a mental hospital with 1, 655 beds, and between them serve all branches of medicine. They are described in Chapter TV of this Report. which also contains information on the number of patients treated. building costs and cost of treatment. Points of particular interest in the hospitals visited are dealt with in Chapter 111, compiled from notes supplied by a number of participants in the Tour. Their assistance is much appreciated; the value of an international Study Tour derives in no small measure from the fact that it enables hospital workers to see hospitals abroad not only from their own point of view, but through the eyes of their colleagues from other countries. It is hoped that those who were unable to visit the hospitals of Ireland will gain useful information from the impressions of those who did...|$|E

The type of CDSS most frequently implemented was information on hospital formularies (n = 13) and drug-drug interactions (n = 11), but CDSSs with regard to genotype, drug interactions with laboratory test results, contraindications, specific age groups and necessary drug orders were only rarely implemented.
