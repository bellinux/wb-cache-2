40|$|Inhomogeneities of the {{magnetic}} and electric fields in the active TPC volume lead to displacements of cluster coordinates, and therefore to track distortions.

40|$|Purpose. About one of {{the causes}} of slip rolling is known from {{the second half of the}} 19 th century, it was {{believed}} that the slip resistance appears at the place of contact due to different speeds on the arc of contact. Only in the mid- 20 th century it was proved that this resistance is negligible in rolling resistance. However (for some unknown reason) it is ignored the fact that in practice in rolling bearings may rotate both the inner ring with a stationary outer one, and vice versa almost in equal relations. It is not taken into account the fact that the ball or roller in the rolling bearings runs the different distance along the roller path of the outer and <b>inner</b> bearing <b>cages</b> in one revolution. This fact is not taken into account in determining the calculated values for the friction coefficient of a rolling bearing reduced to the shaft. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine the influence of path length on the track riding the outer and inner race of the bearing on the determination of the calculated value of the coefficient of friction of rolling bearings is given to the shaft. Methodology. The solution technique is based on the theory of plane motion of a rigid body, the theory of Hertzian contact deformation and the analytical dependencies for determination of coefficient of rolling friction. Findings. The obtained dependences on determination of rolling resistance of the balls or rollers along the bearing tracks of inner and outer bearing cages as well as path difference metering of the rolling on them allows to analytically obtain the rolling resistance and slipping for any size of bearings and different devices of bearing units.

40|$|Choke valves {{are widely}} used in the oil&gas {{industry}} to control the fluid flowing in the system. Some of these valves rely on a "cage and sleeve" functioning, in which an outer, sliding sleeve controls the flow rate by overlapping the holes of an <b>inner,</b> fixed <b>cage.</b> The regulation characteristic of choke valves is typically quantified by the opening curve, which is {{the plot of the}} flow coefficient versus the valve opening. Experimental tests performed on a ???cage and sleeve??? choke valve revealed that the orientation of the holes of the cage affects significantly the flow coefficient. This work focuses on the worst situation encountered, in which an anomalous decreasing trend in the opening curve for large valve openings is accompanied by strong vibrations of the device. CFD simulations were run to provide a physical interpretation of this unexpected result. Due to the complexity of the flow field structure at the origin of this behavior particular attention was paid in properly defining the CFD model; the turbulence model and the differencing scheme for the convective fluxes were found to be the most significant parameters. The CFD runs allowed attributing the anomalous trend of the opening curve to the peculiar interactions of the jets within the cage.

40|$|The zone of {{apposition}} of diaphragm to {{rib cage}} provides a theoretical mechanism that may, in part, contribute to rib cage expansion during inspiration. Increases in intra-abdominal pressure (Pab) that are generated by diaphragmatic contraction are indirectly {{applied to the}} <b>inner</b> rib <b>cage</b> wall in the zone of apposition. We explored this mechanism, {{with the expectation that}} pleural pressure in this zone (Pap) would increase during inspiration and that local transdiaphragmatic pressure in this zone (Pdiap) must be different from conventionally determined transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during inspiration. Direct measurements of Pap, as well as measurements of pleural pressure (Ppl) cephalad to the zone of apposition, were made during tidal inspiration, during phrenic stimulation, and during inspiratory efforts in anesthetized dogs. Pab and esophageal pressure (Pes) were measured simultaneously. By measuring Ppl's with cannulas placed through ribs, we found that Pap consistently increased during both maneuvers, whereas Ppl and Pes decreased. Whereas changes in Pdi of up to - 19 cmH 2 O were measured, Pdiap never departed from zero by greater than - 4. 5 cmH 2 O. We conclude that there can be marked regional differences in Ppl and Pdi between the zone of apposition and regions cephalad to the zone. Our results support the concept of the zone of apposition as an anatomic region where Pab is transmitted to the interior surface of the lower rib cage. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Unilateral airway {{occlusion}} permits {{measurement of}} single lung func-tion. Since {{the results suggest}} that the occluded lung influences the mobility of the contralateral hemithorax, we wanted to test this hypothesis. In eight healthy subjects, we measured, using computed tomography, lung parenchy-mal area and <b>inner</b> rib <b>cage</b> parasagittal and transverse diameters at three differ-ent levels and at maximal inspiration and expiration. These measurements were made without and during balloon occlusion of one mainstem bronchus at residual volume (RV) and at total lung capacity (TLC). Unilateral occlusion at RV reduced the ipsilateral diameters in maximal inspi-ration, but the increase during inspiration was still 39 – 50 % of that without occlu-sion. The inspiratory increase in contralateral diameters was reduced to 64 – 80 % of the increase without occlusion. Occlusion at TLC reduced the expiratory decrease in ipsilateral diameters to 37 – 57 % of that without occlusion. The expiratory decrease on the contralateral side was reduced to 56 – 70 % of that without occlusion. Due to accompanying mediastinal shifts the parenchymal areas of the occluded lung barely changed. In contrast, the contralateral area was 86 – 97 % of that without occlusion. We conclude that the movement of the two hemithoraces are, at least partially, interdependent. The occluded hemithorax prevents full expansion/compression of the nonoccluded contralateral side, whilst its own mobility appears to be increased by the presence of this nonoccluded side. Potential negative effects are outweighed by the physiological benefit of the coupling, as this mechanism could secure ven-tilation to a chest half without own movement...|$|R
40|$|A pleural {{effusion}} is excess fluid that collects in the pleural cavity, the fluid-filled space {{that surrounds the}} lungs. Surplus amounts of such fluid can impair breathing by limiting {{the expansion of the}} lungs during inhalation and can cause severe chest pain. Measuring the fluid volume is indicative of the effectiveness of any treatment but, due to the similarity to surrounding regions, fragments of collapsed lung present and topological changes; accurate quantification of the effusion volume is a highly challenging imaging problem. A novel technique is presented that segments the structures of the <b>inner</b> thoracic <b>cage,</b> fits 2 D closed curves to the detected pleural cavity features and propagates the curves transversely. Missing structure is interpolated using adjacent slices and orthogonal planes to correctly approximate the pleura. An adaptive slice-by-slice region growth procedure constrained by the bounding curves then extracts the pleural fluid volume. The applicability of the technique is analysed on two concurrent test samples totalling 35 {{pleural effusion}} patients. A strong correlation was observed between the pleural fluid volume obtained computationally and manually by a radiologist (R^ 2 = 0. 94). The mean pleural fluid volume for the semi-automated approach was 482. 54 mL (Â± 518. 32 mL) compared with 485. 9 mL (Â± 532. 8 mL) for the manual segmentation.

40|$|Double cage {{induction}} motors {{are typically}} employed in applications that require high starting torque for frequent, loaded starts. This makes the starting (outer) cage susceptible to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermo-mechanical stress {{associated with the}} high starting current and long acceleration time.

40|$|In aeroengines {{the shafts}} are {{supported}} on bearings that carry the radial and axial loads. A ball bearing {{is made up}} of an inner-race, an outer-race and a cage which contains the balls, these together comprise the bearing elements. The bearings require oil for lubrication and cooling. The design of the bearing studied in this work is such that the oil is fed to the bearing through holes/slots in the inner race. At each axial feed location the oil is fed through a number of equispaced feedholes/slots but there is a different number of holes at each location. Once the oil has passed through the bearing it sheds outwards from both sides into compartments known as the bearing chambers. A number of studies have been carried out on the dynamics of bearings. Most of the analyses consider the contributions of fluid forces as small relative to the interaction of the bearing elements. One of the most sophisticated models for a cage-raceway analysis is {{based on the work of}} Ashmore et al. [1], where the cage-raceway is considered to be a short journal bearing divided into sectors by the oil feeds. It is further assumed that the oil exits from the holes and forms a continuous block of oil that exits outwards on both sides of the cage-raceway. In the model, the Reynolds equation is used to estimate the oil dynamics. Of interest in this current work is the behaviour of the oil and air within the space bounded by the <b>cage</b> and <b>inner</b> race. The aim is to determine whether oil feed to the bearing can be modelled as coming from a continuous slot or if the discrete entry points must be modelled. A Volume of Fluid Computational Fluid Dynamics approach is applied. A sector of a ball bearing is modelled with a fine mesh and the detailed simulations show the flow behaviour for different oil splits to the three feed locations of the bearing thus providing information useful to understanding oil shedding into the bearing chambers. The work shows that different flow behaviour is predicted by models where the oil inlets through a continuous slot compared to discrete entry holes. The form and speed of oil shedding from the bearing is found to depend strongly on shaft speed with the shedding speed being slightly higher than the cage linear speed. The break-up pattern of oil on the <b>cage</b> <b>inner</b> surface suggests smaller droplets will be shed at higher shaft speed...|$|R
