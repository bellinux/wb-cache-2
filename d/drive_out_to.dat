5|$|Finally, Rachel {{decides to}} return to her community. Mr. Will is bailed out of jail by Tim, who is looking for Rachel. Together, he and Mr. Will <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the community, and on the way they {{discover}} Clyde, whose van has broken down on the highway. As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in a tent by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E
25|$|The {{mutilated}} {{bodies of}} Wilson and Andrews were {{discovered by the}} security forces at 4. They were lying in pools of blood {{on either side of}} Wilson's Mini at a quarry off the Hightown Road near Cavehill as described by the UFF caller. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army had proceeded carefully to the quarry in case the bodies had been booby-trapped. Wilson had been stabbed to death 30 times and his throat sliced from ear-to-ear. There was evidence that he had put up a struggle before he was killed. Andrews had received 20 knife wounds. A UFF Brigade Staff member described the killings to a journalist as ritualistic; in addition to the multiple stabbings, Irene Andrews also had her breasts hacked off. The killings took place at the quarry and it was suggested by police that Wilson's Mini had been stopped on the road leading to Ballysillan and they were forced at gunpoint to <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the quarry. According to Martin Dillon forensic evidence indicated that Wilson had been dragged from the car and pinned to the ground where he was stabbed and Andrews was killed afterwards. Dillon speculated that the killers had made Andrews watch Wilson being killed.|$|E

2500|$|Specially {{manufactured}} flash drives {{are available}} {{that have a}} tough rubber or metal casing designed to be waterproof and virtually [...] "unbreakable". These flash drives retain their memory after being submerged in water, and even through a machine wash. Leaving such a flash <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dry completely before allowing current to run through it {{has been known to}} result in a working drive with no future problems. Channel Five's Gadget Show cooked one of these flash drives with propane, froze it with dry ice, submerged it in various acidic liquids, ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar. A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives managed to recover all the data on the drive. All data on the other removable storage devices tested, using optical or magnetic technologies, were destroyed.|$|E
