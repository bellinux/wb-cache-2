5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth <b>hinted</b> <b>that</b> he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E

5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well. According to Stanton, he was pleased with the film and said it and Pretty in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene <b>hinted</b> <b>that</b> Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E

5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is <b>hinted</b> <b>that</b> restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, {{had gone}} to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the {{transport}} ship Middleton and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages. Thereafter he disappears; {{if he was not}} Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton's existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. The Claimant <b>hinted</b> <b>that</b> some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton's family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money.

5|$|Because of {{atypical}} scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, American Dad! has {{a controversial}} season number discrepancy {{in which many}} are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between American Dad! creators and the show's official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website. At Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, American Dad! co-creator Mike Barker <b>hinted</b> <b>that</b> an American Dad! movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. What with Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear {{if any of these}} plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.|$|E
