5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} stage, Garin {{had asked the}} race {{official}} Lefèvre for food, which was illegal.

Hermione {{would have}} been his slave--there was in her a horrible desire to prostrate herself before a man--a man who worshipped her, however, and admitted her as the supreme thing. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> an odalisk. <b>He</b> wanted a woman to TAKE something from him, to give herself up {{so much that she}} could take the last realities of him, the last facts, the last physical facts, physical and unbearable.|$|R

5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sell the rights until the series was finished.

Rosebery issued a challenge to Isinglass's owner, Harry McCalmont, for a match race between Ladas and Isinglass to take place at Newmarket in May. McCalmont declined as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> disrupt his horse's preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Browns did not retain Bottomley {{after the}} 1937 season, {{replacing}} him with Street, {{who served as}} his first assistant during the 1937 season.

5|$|The {{experiment}} {{started on}} a sour note, however, when an ownership dispute forced Benson to pull San Antonio out on the same evening the franchise was to be formally introduced.

60|$|To him also it was agony.

The rage and storm of unsatisfaction tormented him ceaselessly. Why had she not satisfied him? He had satisfied her. She was satisfied, at peace, innocent round the doors of her own paradise.|$|R

5|$|As a redshirt {{freshman}} for the 2015 Wolverines, Speight began {{the season as}} a backup to Jake Rudock and Shane Morris. Speight made his Michigan debut on September 12, 2015, taking kneel-down snaps in the closing minutes of a victory over Oregon State. Asked why he played Speight instead of Morris {{at the end of}} the Oregon State game, head coach Jim Harbaugh explained that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> burn Morris's redshirt year on a meaningless snap, emphasizing that Morris remained his No. 2 quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood {{on the verge of}} victory. He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople.

In his memoirs, he {{explains}} that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E

5|$|Castro was {{initially}} {{disappointed with the}} project as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was {{the decisions of the}} executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E
5|$|In 356 BC, Philip then besieged and {{captured}} Potidea, thus marking {{the beginning of}} true hostilities with Athens. As promised, he handed Potidea over to the Olynthians, and let the Athenian garrison depart freely back to Athens, since <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cause undue offence to the Athenians ("he was particularly solicitous toward the people of Athens {{on account of the}} importance and repute of their city"). The Athenians were by this time fully engaged in fighting the Social War, and were unable to respond effectively to Philip's moves against Potidea and Pydna.|$|E
5|$|In October 1588 the Diet {{proposed}} {{to declare the}} sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania.

The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E
