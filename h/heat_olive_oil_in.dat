40|$|Laboratory {{tests with}} <b>heating</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> kitchens {{suggest that the}} current {{building}} regulation in the Netherlands for kitchen exhaust is inadequate to directly address cooking fumes. Due to building traditions, for motor less cooker hoods often only 50 % of the available capacity of the mechanical ventilation system is extracted via the hood. In the experiments a peak PM 1 concentration of 826 and a hourly average concentration of 327 μg/m 3 was measured. These concentrations {{are far higher than}} the average ambient value of PM 2, 5 which is 15 μg/m 3 for the Netherlands. It is advised to provide information to building parties for the optimal design of kitchen exhaust systems and to conduct field measurements to verify the laboratory findings in real practice. These field measurements can be used as input for revision of building regulations with regard to kitchen exhaust...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract A {{series of}} 25 virgin and refined edible oils, {{obtained}} from the retail market was analyzed for the content of free 3 -MCPD and 3 -MCPD released from its esters with higher fatty acids (bound 3 -MCPD). The oils contained free 3 -MCPD ranging from < 3 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to 24 ƒÝg/kg. Surprisingly, the bound 3 -MCPD level was much higher and varied between < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) and 2462 ƒÝg/kg. <b>In</b> average, virgin <b>oils</b> had relatively low levels of bound 3 -MCPD ranging from < 100 ƒÝg/kg (LOD) to < 300 ƒÝg/kg (LOQ). Higher levels of bound 3 -MCPD were found <b>in</b> <b>oils</b> obtained from roasted oilseeds (337 ƒÝg/kg) and {{in the majority of}} refined oils (< 300 ƒÝg/kg to 2462 ƒÝg/kg), including refined <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> <b>In</b> general, it appears that the formation of bound 3 -MCPD <b>in</b> <b>oils</b> is linked with the preliminary heat treatment of oilseeds and with the process of oil refining. The analysis of unrefined, degummed, bleached, and deodorized rapeseed oil showed that the level of bound MCPD decreased during the refining process. However, additional heating of seed oils for 30 minutes at temperatures ranging from 100 oC to 280 oC, and heating at 230 oC (260 oC) for up to 8 hours led to an increase of the bound 3 -MCPD level. On the contrary, <b>heating</b> of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> resulted <b>in</b> a decrease of the bound 3 -MCPD level. For comparison, the fat isolated from salami was analyzed for the intact fatty acid esters of 3 -MCPD. This fat contained the bound 3 -MCPD at the level of 1670 ƒÝg/kg and the fatty acid esters of 3 -MCPD mainly consisted of 3 -MCPD diesters, monoesters of 3 -MCPD were present in smaller amounts. The major types of 3 -MCPD diesters (about 85 %) were mixed diesters of palmitic acid with C 18 fatty acids (stearic, oleic, linoleic acids). These diesters were followed by 3 -MCPD distearate (11 %) and 3 -MCPD dipalmitate (4 %). Generally, very little 3 -MCPD existed as the free compound (31 ƒÝg/kg) ...|$|R
