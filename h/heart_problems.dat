5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} live more than {{fourteen}} years.

While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced {{when compared to the}} healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.|$|E
