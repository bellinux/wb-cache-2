[...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close my eyes and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> better day/ I close my eyes and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Red Shirt was lionized by the British {{press and}} photographed by reporters {{wherever}} he went. His handsome features and stately bearing caused reporters {{to hang on}} his every word and he became the most quoted Wild Wester celebrity of Cody’s trip to England. Red Shirt explained to a reporter from Sheffield: “I started from my lodge two moons ago knowing nothing, and had I remained on the Native Reservations, I should have been as a blind man. [...] Now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> new dawn. I have seen the great houses (ships) which cross the mighty waters, the great villages which have no end where the pale faces swarm like insects in the summer sun. Our people will wonder at these things when {{we return to the}} Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{far from}} the surface now, that's certain," [...] he thought, with {{considerable}} satisfaction. [...] "And yet, hang me if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> opening of any sort yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I say, leftenant, {{how long}} do you mean to keep pullin' about here, without an enemy, or, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>an</b> object in view? Don't you think we might land, and let Minnie see some of the caves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should it}} not go {{for as much}} as prettiness in a woman? It is no use being cynical, Isobel; it is part of our nature to admire pretty things, and as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> {{exceptionally}} handsome man is as legitimate an object of admiration as a lovely woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do {{you make}} that out? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of things that}} cost more than a dollar. Look at the silver watch, and the revolver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are certain}} points on which, {{as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>a</b> man may {{be allowed to have}} his way,--and certain points on which he may not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is an opening, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little light, and, what is more, I {{hear the}} sounds of voices. Maybe we have run into our enemies again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{somewhat}} difficult to say," [...] returned Mr. X. [...] "You see these students, {{they are a}} wild lot, {{and when they get}} together--And then, I believe, a good many toasts are drunk. I don't know how it will affect me. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> opportunity <b>I</b> shall come away early, that is if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do so without giving offence; but if not--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Princess Clia {{was looking}} {{out of one of}} the windows. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> opening far up in the top of the dome," [...] she said. They all hastened to the windows to look, and {{although}} Trot and Cap'n Bill could <b>see</b> nothing but <b>a</b> solid dome above the castle--perhaps because it was so far away from them--the sharp eyes of Aquareine were not to be deceived.|$|R
5000|$|James Kettle of The Guardian {{said of the}} show, [...] "From what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it's <b>a</b> triumph, {{harnessing}} classic comedy chops to {{a modern}} sensibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|Somebody else whispered: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{glimmer of}} a fire through the bush." [...] And then the boat floated past them, disappearing {{instantly}} in the darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm dashed!" [...] he said. [...] "If this don't beat cock-fighting! Most remarkable!--And there <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> rabbit clean through you, 'arf a mile away! Not {{a bit of}} you visible--except--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, Meinik, look {{along by}} the side of this stone. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> ray of light. Yes, and some leaves. I don't think they are more than thirty feet above us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Theayters ain’t for me," [...] ses Charlie, with a groan. [...] "I’m {{more likely}} to go to gaol, so far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> than <b>a</b> theayter." ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD W. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> she's <b>a</b> fine {{independent}} old lady! But {{suppose you}} were to pay her ten bob a week, and keep my name out of it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> pretty {{thing up}} this tree," [...] said Arabella. [...] "A sort of a--caterpillar, {{of the most}} loveliest green and yellow you ever came across!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word. You {{know the}} French proverb: 'Who excuses himself {{is his own}} accuser.' The truth {{generally}} makes its way. As far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>a</b> slander never lives long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To be sure, how {{near that}} fire is!" [...] said Fairway. [...] "Seemingly. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> fellow {{of some sort}} walking round it. Little and good must be said of that fire, surely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, look!" [...] Aggie cried; [...] "there, {{out in the}} waves--there, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> head. That's {{just about}} where I was nearly drowned. Oh, grandpapa, take me away, I can't look at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{answer to}} his {{question}} she {{replied with a}} pitiful little smile, [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> you, but only in pieces. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>see</b> <b>a</b> part of your face,--the rest of you is all black." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} the next {{campaign}} will turn out differently; but I own that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarce <b>see</b> <b>a</b> possibility of Prussia, alone, making head against the dangers that surround her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] she insisted, [...] "we shall {{look at the}} collection. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> at <b>a</b> glance {{that it is a}} fine one, and it is not yet {{time to go to the}} Waltons'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be fancy, sir," [...] faltered the cook, {{lowering}} his eyes, [...] "but {{it does seem}} to me as though <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little misty sort o’ thing there. Ah, now it’s gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{wonder if}} you're right!" [...] said the mate, taking the glass. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> lot of heads in her bow, and now I wonder {{what is going}} to happen next!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Robert Aleys," [...] I said, [...] "should it be {{pleasing}} {{to you and}} another, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> way in which this debt may be cancelled without shame to you and yet to my profit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so; {{but as far}} as my {{experience}} goes, wherever Englishmen frequent, there the coffee is spoilt. Englishmen, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> have <b>a</b> partiality for chicory, but none at all for coffee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep mute; {{you need}} tell me nothing. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> into <b>a</b> mystery {{that is as}} deep as a well, to-night. Your companions are hirelings; perhaps your shipmates; or men to pilot you on this expedition!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] said Vane. [...] "I'll {{support such}} <b>a</b> scheme, when <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> how <b>an</b> {{increased}} capital {{could be used}} to advantage and I am convinced about the need for a smelter. At present, that's not the case." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I allow I haven't your imagination, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> thing that's obvious. Father {{thought he}} hid his feelings, but mother knew and grieved. She {{was afraid he}} would give us up {{and go back to}} the North." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must look!" [...] Sophie tiptoed to a window, and shaded {{her eyes}} with her hand. [...] "Oh, this room's half-full of cotton-bales--wool, I suppose! But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> bit of the mantelpiece. George, do come! Isn't that some one?" ...|$|E
