5|$|Sometimes {{you open}} your mouth and you don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to say, and {{whatever}} comes out is the starting point. If that happens and you are lucky, it can usually {{be turned into a}} song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|E
25|$|Socrates warns the excitable Hippocrates that Sophists are dangerous. He {{tells him}} that {{the words of the}} Sophists go {{straight}} into the soul (psychē) and can corrupt a person straightaway. Socrates says that buying wisdom from a Sophist is different from buying food and drink at the market. With food and drink, you never <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> getting, but you can consult experts for advice before consuming anything that might be dangerous (313a–314c).|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{interviews}} {{members of}} the Phelps family including Fred Phelps (called [...] "Gramps" [...] by {{members of the}} organisation) and Shirley Phelps-Roper. Theroux asks Fred Phelps, [...] "Isn't it an act of presumption, when you don't have all the information about all the other churches, to assume you have privileged access to Grace?"; Phelps responds, [...] "Oh, I know all {{there is to know about}} 'em." [...] When Theroux asks him how he knows this, Phelps answers, [...] "I'm not going to keep on talking to you. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> [...] you're an evil. [...] I don't even wanna go there. Good luck to ya!" ...|$|E

500|$|Guitarist The Edge {{explained}} {{that some of}} the sounds in the introduction that resemble keyboards were actually created by him on guitar. Of the song's introduction, bassist Adam Clayton says, [...] "When people put on the record, we wanted their first reaction to be either 'this record is broken' or 'this can't be the new U2 record, there's been a mistake.' So there is quite a dramatic extended intro where you just don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> listening to." [...] Author Albin Zak, in his book The Poetics of Rock, says of the introduction, [...] "Before any words are sung, the sounds alone alert the listener that the band has moved into new expressive territory." ...|$|E
500|$|The House Committee on National Security {{hearing on}} 3 August was {{presided over by}} Congressman Bob Dornan and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus {{explained}} how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, [...] "Sir, as a pilot, I would have made another pass. You would never fire until you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> shooting at." [...] Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.|$|E
500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E

2500|$|... {{thought to}} myself: [...] "You poor soul; {{you do not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking about. You {{will never be able}} to have a {{first-class}} medical school." [...] But today I walked over that same block covered with beautiful buildings and a veritable hive of medical activity. I have not completed my inspection yet, but I am almost certain as to the kind of a report I will make; and I am sure you will be satisfied with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Termination: If {{you don't}} want your subject to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing, you simply {{distract}} their attention, usually by some appropriate remark, and casually terminate. Sometimes they remark, [...] "What did you say? I got absentminded {{there for a}} moment and wasn't paying attention to anything." [...] This is slightly distressing to the subjects and indicative of the fact that their attention was so focused and fixated on the peculiar hand stimuli that they were momentarily entranced so they did not hear what was said.|$|E

2500|$|Dennett {{was born}} on March 28, 1942 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth Marjorie (née Leck) and Daniel Clement Dennett, Jr. Dennett spent part of his {{childhood}} in Lebanon, where, during World War II, {{his father was a}} covert counter-intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services posing as a cultural attaché to the American Embassy in Beirut. When he was five, his mother took him back to Massachusetts after his father died in an unexplained plane crash. Dennett's sister is the investigative journalist Charlotte Dennett. Dennett says that he was first introduced to the notion of philosophy while attending summer camp at age 11, when a camp counselor said to him, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Daniel? You're a philosopher." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Sydney radio {{a decade after the}} publication of Program for a Puppet, Perry spoke about learning more from the negative reviews for his first fiction book than the good reviews: ‘Some were a bit cranky; some were patronising,’ he said, ‘but they were all in some way instructive. One thought the writing was [...] "too high mileage." [...] Another spoke of a [...] "staccato" [...] style. I recall another mentioning that it was, at times, like a film script. One reviewer thought I had two good thrillers in one, which had merit. I did meld two big themes that may have been better separated. But you don’t really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> doing on a first fiction. I did all the heavy research, [...] "forty ways to pick a lock," [...] that sort of thing.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Spellman later {{took the}} issue {{directly}} to Pope Pius XII, pleading his case with Sheen present. The Pope sided with Sheen. Spellman later confronted Sheen, stating, [...] "I will {{get even with}} you. It may take six months or ten years, but everyone will <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> like." [...] Besides being pressured to leave television Sheen also [...] "found himself unwelcome in the churches of New York. Spellman cancelled Sheen's annual Good Friday sermons at St. Patrick's Cathedral and discouraged clergy from befriending the Bishop." [...] In 1966 Spellman had Sheen reassigned to Rochester, New York, and caused his leadership at the Society for the Propagation of the Faith to be terminated (a position he had held for 16 years and raised {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars for, to which he had personally donated 10 million dollars of his own earnings). [...] On December 2, 1967, Spellman died in New York.|$|E
