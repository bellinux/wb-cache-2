In addition to the usual functions associated with videos, MAT allows users to enter written comments at strategic and key positions to emphasise the required learning points.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The typical member of the group “Scientists and Engineers ” (S/E) in Finland is 1 a 39 - year-old male, vocational school <b>graduate,</b> private <b>sector</b> employee (typically in services or, to a lesser extent, manufacturing). There are exceptions to this characterization since one-fifth of scientists and engineers are female, and {{they are more likely to}} work in the public sector of the economy. Females also tend to be more highly educated. Changes in the Finnish economy have highlighted the role of scientists and engineers. Following a rapid increase in research and development (R&D) spending since the early 1980 s, significantly increased high-technology exports have supplemented the country’s traditional reliance on forestry and metallurgy exports. This has helped Finland adapt to the disruption of longstanding trade arrangements with the former Soviet Union and expedited integration with the rest of Europe...|$|R

40|$|This Paper {{considers}} {{the determinants of}} male and female pay in {{the public and private sectors}} by estimating a joint model of sector allocation and wage determination using cross-sectional data from the Egyptian 1987 and 1997 labour force surveys. The results points to the profound impact of the <b>graduate</b> public <b>sector</b> employment guarantee on labour market segmentation in Egypt. In particular, the level of educational attainment became the most important factor in sorting workers between sectors. Comparison of the 1987 and 1997 results highlight that the strong impact of the public sector employment guarantee on the labour market in the 1980 s was weakened in the 1990 s for males but remains important for females. Moreover, risk-averse individuals (proxied by those who have greater financial responsibility in their households) have a greater probability of choosing public sector than private sector employment. These results are consistent with the effective operation of the guarantee for more highly educated workers and with time based queuing for guaranteed positions. A model of compensating wage differentials is then defined and estimated, in order to quantify the value of arguably the three most important non-pecuniary aspects of public sector employment: job security, fringe benefits (especially comprehensive retirement pensions) and lower effort and shorter hour...|$|R

40|$|We study why the {{relationship}} between education and log-wages has become more convex in India, the Philippines and Thailand. To do so, we develop decompositions connecting returns to education, and shifts in those returns, to the evolving structure of employment. Returns to college depend mostly upon high-skill service jobs. While relative demand for college <b>graduates</b> in that <b>sector</b> generally rose, its employment share grew slowly, pushing workers with secondary education into less skill intensive services. Services employment, which grew fast, therefore became more menial on average. These polarizing trends in services account for the growing convexity of the Mincerian wage profile. The effects of industrialization on the returns to secondary education depend upon the composition of manufacturing employment. Slow structural transformation when educational attainment increases rapidly causes education inflation, and drives down the returns to secondary education. This constrains governments' seeking to use educational expansion to alter the wage distribution...|$|R

40|$|A lengthy {{literature}} {{estimating the}} returns to education has largely ignored the for-profit sector. In this paper, we offer {{some of the}} first causal estimates of the earnings gains to for-profit colleges. We rely on restricted-use data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY 97) to implement an individual fixed effects estimation strategy that allows us to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics of students. We find that students who enroll in associate’s degree programs in for-profit colleges experience earnings gains between 6 and 8 percent, although a 95 percent confidence interval suggests a range from- 2. 7 to 17. 6 percent. These gains cannot be shown to be different from those of students in public community colleges. Students who complete associate’s degrees in for-profit institutions earn around 22 percent, or 11 percent per year, and we find some evidence that this figure is higher than the returns experienced by public <b>sector</b> <b>graduates.</b> Our findings suggest that degree completion is an important determinant of for-profit quality and student success...|$|R
30|$|The {{experience}} of graduates {{over time in}} Jordan is similar in some respects but different in others. The proportion of <b>graduates</b> obtaining public <b>sector</b> jobs in their first job also fell dramatically in Jordan over time, but it started its decline much later than in Egypt, around the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. It then fell rapidly, from about 60 percent to 30 percent, in just over a decade. Unlike Egypt, where the decline continued apace, the decline in Jordan slowed dramatically in the 2000 s and even reversed somewhat in recent years. Also, in contrast to Egypt, where informality was the main alternative to public employment, formal private wage employment took up much of the slack in Jordan. A careful examination of the data shows that Jordan was able to avoid informalization by providing it private employers with greater flexibility in hiring and firing. The data show that a growing proportion of these formal private sector jobs was in fact jobs with temporary contracts rather than in ones with indefinite duration contracts (Assaad 2013) 4.|$|R
