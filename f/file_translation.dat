40|$|Brain image {{analysis}} often involves processing neuroimaging data with different software packages. Using different software packages together requires exchanging files between them; the output files of one package {{are used as}} input files to the next package in the processing sequence. File exchanges become problematic when different packages use different file formats or different conventions within the same file format. Although comprehensive medical image file formats have been developed, no one format exists that satisfies the needs of analyses that involve multiple processing algorithms. The LONI Debabeler acts as a mediator between neuroimaging software packages by automatically using an appropriate <b>file</b> <b>translation</b> to convert files between each pair of linked packages. These translations are built and edited using the Debabeler graphical interface and compensate for package-dependent variations that result in intrapackage incompatibilities. The Debabeler gives neuroimaging processing environments a configurable automaton for <b>file</b> <b>translation</b> and provides users a flexible application for developing robust solutions to translation problems...|$|E
40|$|Using {{standard}} components or modules is vital in product design, development and manufacturing. The current book type catalogues and those, {{in the form}} of electronic files together with CAD drawings distributed on disks or via web-based publication systems, can not meet industry requirements for collaborative engineering. Ideally, users could source competitive offers from different vendors and use their information over the Internet. The drawbacks in the current catalogues are platform dependency, and difficulties in version management, CAD <b>file</b> <b>translation,</b> and catalogue content updating. In this research, a novel “Web Service” oriented approach is proposed to address these limitations. Based on an in-house standard component and assembly library, a new method is proposed to engage a CAD modeler with Java Web Service technology. With such an approach, all the aforementioned drawbacks are eliminated. Moreover, the new method avoids hard coding of catalogues within CAD systems, facilitates the catalogue vendors to update their databases at any time. Taking injection molding design as an example, the authors discussed key mechanisms in its implementation and the feasibility of industrial applications...|$|E

This article describes the cooperative verbal and classificatory subject indexing in the OBV, taking into account the structural requirements for subject indexing in the technical framework of the library system Aleph. The current workflow for the construction of new headings in the subject authority file (SWD) is explained. A review of the development since the reinstallation of the SWD-central editorial office in 2004 and the inclusion of all subject indexers in the online-editorial process for authority files (ONR) in the years 2008 - 2010 shows that the change of paradigm was indeed necessary. Finally, the many functional aids that have been developed {{in the course of the}} online-editorial process and which have since been updated several times are explained. Many of those will continue to be useful when the Joint Authority File (GND) is in use. The high expenditure for the maintenance of such help functions is justified in view of their sustainability in the daily practice of all subject indexers and contributes significantly to the high standard required of authority data. The electronic tool for the obligatory list of subject reference works “Liste der fachlichen Nachschlagewerke”, NSW online, which is accessible to all since autumn 2010 should not go unmentioned either...|$|E

40|$|Several {{paradigms}} for accessing CAD geometry during surface meshing for CFD are discussed. <b>File</b> <b>translation,</b> inconsistent geometry {{engines and}} non-native point construction are all identified {{as sources of}} non-robustness. The paper argues in favor of accessing CAD parts and assemblies in their native format, without translation, and {{for the use of}} CAD-native predicates and constructors in surface mesh generation. The discussion also emphasizes the importance of examining the computational requirements for exact evaluation of triangulation predicates during surface meshing. The native approach is demonstrated through an algorithm for the generation of closed manifold surface triangulations from CAD geometry. CAD parts and assemblies are used in their native format, and a part's native geometry engine is accessed through a modeler-independent application programming interface (API). In seeking a robust and fully automated procedure, the algorithm is based on a new physical space manifold triangulation technique specially developed to avoid robustness issues associated with poorly conditioned mappings. In addition, this approach avoids the usual ambiguities associated with floating-point predicate evaluation on constructed coordinate geometry in a mapped space. The technique is incremental, so that each new site improves the triangulation by some well defined quality measure. The algorithm terminates after achieving a prespecified measure of mesh quality and produces a triangulation such that no angle is less than a given angle bound, a or greater than pi - 2 alpha. This result also sets bounds on the maximum vertex degree, triangle aspect-ratio and maximum stretching rate for the triangulation. In addition to the output triangulations for a variety of CAD parts, the discussion presents related theoretical results which assert the existence of such an angle bound, and demonstrate that maximum bounds of between 25 deg and 30 deg may be achieved in practice...|$|E
40|$|This Master thesis {{was mainly}} {{performed}} at Electrolux Automated Equipment and Tooling (AE&T) in Adelaide, Australia between September 2004 and January 2005. The aim with {{this project was}} to investigate the process and co- operation of the areas CAD, CAM and CNC-machines at the plant and come up with more efficient solutions. The outcome of the project is an investment recommendation and organizational change. The project has been performed at AE&T and finished in Sweden. The current situation has been documented and analysed, literature has been reviewed, benchmarking visits have been made, a questionnaire has been sent out and the future situation and requirements have been analysed. AE&T is a toolmaking company within the Electrolux concern. Though, its "to be or not to be" has been discussed a lot during this last year. The plant was out for sale during fall 2004 as it was {{not a part of the}} core business, according to Electrolux. In December 2005, Electrolux decided to keep the business in the concern anyway. It is a tough situation for tooling companies at the moment and to be competitive on the world market one has to have an optimal and efficient organization, have skills and new technology, be suitable and helpful to meet customer requests, be time saving and have a helpful system to support the business. AE&T have the skills, but need to use them in the right place of organization and update its technology. Our recommendation is in two steps. The first is to train the CNC operators to do the CAM at the shop floor instead of having a designated CAM programmer. They also have to replace the old CNC-machines and increase the total quantity to get higher capacity and more effective production hours. The designers should become project leaders and together with a new information- and planning-system make the manufacturing go smother with lower lead times. The organization change will improve the motivation and quality in work as well as in products. Another change is to employ missing skills, like salesmen. Salesmen are needed to get more work to the shop and fill up all the three coming shifts as planned in this solution. The recommendation concerning the software is to keep the current solution, but be prepared to change software to attract more customers and come by <b>file</b> <b>translation</b> and rework and thereby also save time. The second step is to buy a new set of three CNC-machines and a new information- and planning- system that is self-learning and decision-making. The economical appraisal shows that the changes and investments for both steps are profitable and payback time is two years, which is a demand from Electrolux. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
