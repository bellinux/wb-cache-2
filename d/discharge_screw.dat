5000|$|In {{horizontal}} decanter centrifuges, {{as shown}} in figure 1, the rotating assembly is mounted horizontally with bearings on each end to a rigid frame, which provides a good sealing surface for high-pressure applications. The feed enters through one end of the bearings, while the gearbox is attached to the other end and is operated below critical speed. Capacities range up to 40000 lb of solids per hour with liquid feed rates of up to 300 gal per minute. The horizontal machine is arranged in a way that slurry can be introduced at the centre of a rotating horizontal cylindrical bowl. The scroll <b>discharge</b> <b>screw</b> forces the solids to one end of the bowl as it is collected on the walls. This orientation is the most common design implemented in industry.|$|E
5000|$|In the Reduction shaft {{the iron}} ore, along with {{limestone}} and dolomite additives, is added and then reduced by reduction gas into 95% direct reduced iron, DRI. The DRI is then redirected via six <b>discharge</b> <b>screws</b> into the melter-gasifier. The Melter gasifier has three main sections, the gaseous free board zone, the Char bed, and the hearth zone, {{and it has}} an effect on several stages in the process. First it serves to create the reduction gas by gasifying the coal with oxygen and then cooling it. After being reduced, the DRI is redirected to the char bed where the iron and slag are melted and then directed to the hearth zone. [...] The heat inside the metal gasifier keeps the amount of phenols small, keeping them out of the atmosphere. Meanwhile, carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas from the original gasification of the coal exit the gasifier while other byproducts are captured in the metallic slag. The rest of the hot gas is then cooled and sent into the reduction shaft resulting in the Corex export gas which is used to control pressure in the plant. Many of the gases resulting from this process can then be recycled or used to produce electricity. [...] Dust particles also appear in these gases and the Melter gasifier recycles them with four dust burners.|$|R
40|$|Chester, a 10 month old Oldenberg colt, {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for evaluation and repair of a cleft soft palate. Endoscopic evaluation revealed a very wide cleft that spanned over 2 / 3 of the caudal soft palate as well as feed material throughout his airways. Thoracic ultrasound revealed mild aspiration pneumonia. The palate was visualized via a combined mandibular symphysiotomy and laryngotomy approach and repaired using two mucosal flaps to cover the defect since {{the width of the}} cleft precluded a standard repair. Postoperatively, the caudal aspect of the repair broke down resulting in persistent mild bilateral nasal <b>discharge.</b> The lag <b>screws</b> used to secure the mandible also loosened leaving a gap between the first mandibular incisors. Due to the anticipated performance level of the horse, the owner elected a second procedure which has yet to be performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} of rice bran ‘cake’ or <b>discharge</b> from a <b>screw</b> press {{corresponds to the}} level of oil produced in the extraction process. The relationships between operating settings, oil extraction level and cake appearance were studied. Cake characteristics reliably indicate the expected oil recovery extraction level. These conclusions applyed to both Chainat 1 rice bran and parboiled rice bran. Variables were the speed of the screw press (set at five levels from 8. 5 to 19. 8 r/min) and corresponding clearance distances between the screw and barrel (set between 1. 0 and 1. 9 cm). Results showed that the maximum levels of extraction were 4. 17 % for the rice bran and 8. 20 % for the parboiled rice bran. At the maximum extraction level, the apparatus continuously discharged cake that were hard, crispy, flaky, shiny and polished on one side but dull and coarse on the other...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One {{dimensional}} {{dynamic model}} for submarine low pressure screw compressor deballasting system performance analysis is developed. Cross section of outer shell of ballast tank {{is described as}} cylinder, one dimensional flow equations combined with screw compressor performance model are employed to describe compressor’s flow characteristic. Coupled effect between gas pressure in ballast tank and <b>discharging</b> performance of <b>screw</b> compressor is considered in the presenting model as gas leakage during compressing process is taken into account. Deballasting duration for one certain submarine model is calculated using the developed model, and the result agrees well with that obtained by using Chinese state code for submarine low pressure system design. For different cross section tank models as circular section model, parabolic section model and trapezoidal section model, dynamic performance of screw compressor deballasting system is studied using the validated model. Gas pressure in tank, dropping speed of tank water surface and draft of submarine are simulated, and {{the results show that}} little difference of deballasting duration is caused by changing tank cross section. The most stable deballasting process is achieved by using a circular section tank. Deballsting performance is also studied as tonnage of submarine and volume of ballast tank change and commonsense conclusions are obtained...|$|R
