6000|$|... 'I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} before,' said Mary, heartily; 'I have just done:' and she {{returned}} to her writing-table, while her mother was saying, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jacinta, reflectively, [...] "I am rather <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Gratitude that {{is worth}} {{anything}} carries {{a certain sense of}} obligation with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{certainly}} not; and I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} of it. These schemes {{are not at all}} the thing. Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and public places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it. I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not think of}} going; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking? <b>Do</b> not <b>you</b> think these kind of projects objectionable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The elderly gentleman had risen; {{he looked}} puzzled. [...] "And how's Aunt Martha?" [...] asked him our low comedian. [...] "Dear old Aunt Martha! Well, I am <b>glad!</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> look bonny! How is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To Vienna, indeed! Well, I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not miss}} Reisenburg; {{you must not}} quit it now. You {{know that this is}} not the Vienna season?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pleased is {{scarcely}} the word," [...] said Mrs Jehoram. [...] "I was moved--profoundly. These {{others did not}} understand.... I was <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not play with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No matter! I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>DID</b> find it, Dick," [...] said Demorest, [...] "and I hope you'll {{find the}} liquor {{good enough to}} pay you for the trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now, then,' said she, {{when we had}} seated ourselves, 'let us go to work to make {{experiments}} with your tube. I am so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not feel about it as I thought you would.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm very <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> But I am {{ashamed to}} have to confess that though I {{remember}} your Christian name very well I can't recall your surname. I only remember {{that it is an}} uncommon one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} {{you will be}} so very kind as not to let any one know of it. I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I should not feel it right that you should not, but it is {{different}} with others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha!' said Mould. 'He's evidently gratified. Poor fellow! I {{am quite}} <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it, my love. Bye bye, Mrs Gamp!' waving his hand. 'There he goes; there he goes!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am almost <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> blame me,' said John cheerfully, 'since, {{if you had}} not, {{the letter}} would not have come. I have read it fifty times a day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} did," [...] he said. [...] "I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not {{ask me to}} {{hire you}} the boys. The system under which he obtained them is an iniquity." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{love you}} very much. I love your body. It is so clear and fine. I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not go naked, {{or all the}} women would {{fall in love with}} you. I am very jealous of it, I love it so much.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> sir, for I don't,' meekly {{answered}} Tregarva. 'But the vicar, sir, he {{is a kind}} man, and a good; but {{the poor}} don't understand him, nor he them. He is too learned, sir, and, saving your presence, too fond of his prayer-book.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--I am so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I thought <b>you</b> would, {{he is so}} pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is {{excessively}} {{pleased with}} you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't come to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Fanny! I am so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not go; I am {{sure it is}} not fit for ladies," [...] said poor Mrs. Damer, forgetful of {{her friend}} Miss Dawkins.|$|E

6000|$|... "She turns us {{all round}} her finger," [...] said grandpapa. [...] "I never found {{the person who}} could resist Queen Bee, except grandmamma. But I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not take after her, Henrietta, for one such {{grandchild}} is enough, and it is better for woman-kind to have leadable spirits than leading." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You think so,' Mr Haredale answered, 'and I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I know myself better, and {{therefore}} distrust myself more. Let us leave this subject for another--not so {{far removed from}} it as it might, at first sight, seem to be. Sir, you still love my niece, and she is still attached to you.' ...|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR BRO.,--I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} the clerkship, for that Patent Office is in such a muddle {{that there would be}} no {{security}} for the permanency of a place in it. The same remark will apply to all offices here, now, and no doubt will, till the close of the present administration.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We were {{thankful to}} have a chance of knowing the young people,' added Jane. 'I am only <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come home at Christmas, when I was not happy about the two girls.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> that," [...] {{replied the}} girl, deeply {{grateful}} at this evidence of thoughtfulness. [...] "It's bad {{enough for the}} Major to have me away, without making him worry, into the bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> for I {{will attend}} to it, and stop {{this sort of}} thing," [...] said Miss Celia, after the {{children}} had told some of the tormenting speeches which had tried poor Ben.|$|E
6000|$|MARTHA--So <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> came. <b>Do</b> come {{in again}} any time. We keep open house, you know--Western fashion. [She accentuates this.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{choose to}} suppose {{anything}} of the kind," [...] said Mrs. Crowder. [...] "Thee tried to do right, but I am <b>glad</b> <b>thee</b> <b>did</b> not deprive the world of any of Petrarch's poetry. But now I want thee to {{tell us something about}} ancient Egypt, and those wonderfully cultivated people who built pyramids and carved hieroglyphics. Perhaps thee saw them building the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Aynsley Clay told me {{that you}} would call, and I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> so,” he said cordially. “I hope you will stay for a few days.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm very <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{take the}} fancy. You'll make an {{excellent}} model. If you won't mind posing {{again for a}} few minutes--I will not weary you to-day. Your right arm a little more forward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The liner will {{be clear}} of the land by now," [...] she said. [...] "I suppose you are <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not go with Jefferson? You never {{told me that he}} had asked you to!" ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{had been}} {{kneeling}} before him in dressing his hurt, {{and then in}} critically regarding her handiwork, she got to her feet. [...] "I know you oughtn't," [...] she retorted, [...] "but I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>done</b> it. And I'm thankful every breath I draw. And now I want you to go. And don't <b>you</b> think I <b>done</b> what I done out of love for you, Joseph Dylks. I'd 'a' done it for any hurt or hungry dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Sir, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I don't {{believe in}} crowdin' a man {{because you got}} him in a corner, an' I don't believe in bearin' malice. Never did. All I wanted was what the place was wo'th--to him. 'Twa'n't wo'th nothin' to me! He's got {{the house and the}} ten acres around it, and he's got the house on Lion's Head, includin' the Clearin', that the poottiest picnic-ground in the mountains. Think of goin' up there this summer?" ...|$|R
