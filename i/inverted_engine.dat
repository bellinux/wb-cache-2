25|$|These terms {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} of the engine cylinder. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical <b>inverted</b> <b>engine</b> is defined as a vertical cylinder arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the engine types above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.|$|E

2500|$|The ANEC I and II, {{designed}} by W.S Shackleton, were amongst the earliest ultralight aircraft; {{they were very}} small, wooden, strut braced high-wing monoplanes.

It was the first aircraft with an <b>inverted</b> <b>engine,</b> a 696 cc Blackburne Tomtit, to fly in the United Kingdom. [...] The ANEC I was designed {{to the rules of}} the 1923 Lympne light aircraft trials, principally an engine capacity limit of 750cc, and the two aircraft completed that August took part. [...] The main prizes were for fuel economy and the second ANEC I G-EBIL, flown by Jimmy James, shared half of the £1,500 prize with an English Electric Wren for flights of 87.5miles (141km) on one gallon (4.54 L) of petrol. [...] He later reached an altitude of 14,000ft (4,267 m) in it. G-EBIL was evaluated by the Air Ministry in 1924, briefly carrying the RAF serial J7506. Afterwards it was modified with a wingspan greatly reduced [...] from 32ft to 18ft 4 in (9.75 m to 5.59 m) and re-engined with a 1,000 cc Anzani engine for entry in the 1925 Lympne August Bank Holiday Races, designated the ANEC IA.|$|E

50|$|Ding Dong {{obtained}} notoriety {{during the}} 18th century {{because of an}} infringement lawsuit. A 28 inch cylinder <b>inverted</b> <b>engine</b> designed by Edward Bull, chief designer for Boulton and Watt, was put into Ding Dong in 1796; James Watt saw this as an infringement of his 'condenser patent'. One of these engines was erected at Ding Dong in 1797, when a conventional Boulton and Watt engine was inverted by Richard Trevithick and William West. Trevithick worked with his father at Wheal Treasury mine and, after making improvements which increased the operating pressure of the Bull Steam Engine, Trevithick was promoted to engineer of the Ding Dong mine in 1796. Today the ruined Count (Account) House is the only remaining structure from Richard Trevithick's time at Ding Dong.|$|E

5000|$|The {{limousine}} {{was originally}} {{powered by a}} [...] four-cylinder, inverted, water-cooled engine, produced in 1913 by Grégoire, which drove a three-bladed propeller; both the propeller and the <b>inverted</b> <b>engine</b> were unusual at the time, though Grégoire had used this engine arrangement in his 1910 monoplane. The engine was cooled with a cylindrical Lamblin radiator mounted above the central wing, where the fuel tank was located. Behind the engine, its upper parts under a narrow cowling, the mahogany plywood-covered, elm-framed fuselage was rectangular in section but tadpole-shaped in profile, deep below the wing but slender aft. It also slimmed aft in plan, though not so strongly. Its enclosed, spacious cabin, which seated pilot and passenger side-by-side, was below the wing with Cellon windows angled {{to the line of}} flight {{on each side of the}} cowling, aided by side and roof windows. It also provided a space for baggage and for tools. There was a port side door for access.|$|E
