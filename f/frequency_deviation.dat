These control actions do not substantially affect the behaviour of the aggregation as far as controllability is concerned, since they act on a much larger time scale.

40|$|A Photovoltaic system&# 039;s {{output power}} is not {{constant}} and fluctuates depending on weather conditions. Fluctuating power causes <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> and reduction in reliability of the isolated power utility or micro grid when large output power from several Photovoltaic systems is penetrated in the utility. In this paper, to overcome this problem, a simple coordinated control method for clustered Photovoltaic systems is proposed to provide the frequency control. Here, output power command is generated in two steps: central and local. Fuzzy control is used to generate the central output power command considering average insolation, change of insolation, and <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations.</b> In the local step, a simple coordination is maintained between the central power command and the local power commands by producing a common tuning factor. The proposed method is compared with the method where extracted maximum power is supplied to the utility. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method is feasible to reduce the <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> of the isolated power utility and delivers the power near maximum Photovoltaic power...|$|R

2500|$|OFDM {{requires}} {{very accurate}} frequency synchronization between {{the receiver and}} the transmitter; with <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> the sub-carriers {{will no longer be}} orthogonal, causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) (i.e., cross-talk between the sub-carriers). Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators, or by Doppler shift due to movement. While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver, the situation is worsened when combined with multipath, as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets, which is much harder to correct. This effect typically worsens as speed increases, and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high-speed vehicles. In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios, one can shape each sub-carrier in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non-orthogonal subcarriers overlapping. For example, a low-complexity scheme referred to as WCP-OFDM (...) consists of using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non-rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single-tap per subcarrier equalization. Other ICI suppression techniques usually increase drastically the receiver complexity.|$|E
40|$|Standalone microgrids, {{which are}} mainly {{constructed}} on island areas have low system inertia, may result large <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> even for small load change. Moreover, increasing penetration level {{of renewable energy}} sources (RESs) into standalone microgrids makes the frequency stability problem even worse. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an active power sharing method with zero <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations.</b> To this end, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is operated as constant frequency (CF) control mode, whereas the other distributed generations (DGs) are operated as an active and reactive power (PQ) control mode. As a result, a state of charge (SOC) of the BESS is changed as the system load varies. Based on the SOC deviation, DGs share the load change. The SOC data {{is assumed to be}} sent via communication system, hence the communication time delay is considered. To enhance reliability, controllers of DGs are designed to take account of the failure of communication system. The simulation results show that active power can be shared among DGs according to desired ratio without <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> even for large variation of output power of RESs...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>frequency</b> <b>deviation</b> of a {{radio is}} of {{particular}} importance in relation to bandwidth, because less deviation means that more channels can fit into {{the same amount of}} frequency spectrum.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{frequency}} control of reheat interconnected two area power systems are mainly characterized by non-linearity and uncertainty. A hybrid neural network and fuzzy control is proposed for load {{frequency control}} in the power systems considering governor dead band (GDB) non-linearity. Fuzzy with neural network is employed to forecast the control input requirement and system’s future output, based on the current Area Control Error (ACE) and the predicted change-of-ACE. The Control Performance Standard (CPS) criterion is adopted to the fuzzy controller design, thus improves the dynamic quality of system. The system was simulated and the output responses of <b>frequency</b> <b>deviations</b> in area 1 and area 2 and tie-line power deviations for 1 % step-load disturbance in area 1 were obtained.
