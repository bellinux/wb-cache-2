500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E
500|$|The pair {{initially}} traveled mainly over flat snowfields. Nansen {{had allowed}} 50days {{to cover the}} [...] to the pole, requiring an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13km; 8.1mi). On 22 March a sextant observation showed that the pair had travelled [...] towards the pole at a daily average of over nine nautical miles (17km; 10mi). This had been achieved despite very low temperatures, typically around , and small scale mishaps including {{the loss of the}} sledgemeter that recorded mileage. However, as the surfaces became uneven and made skiing more difficult, their speeds slowed. A sextant reading on 29 March of 85°56′N indicated that a week's travel had brought them [...] nearer to the pole, but also showed that their average daily distances were falling. More worryingly, a theodolite reading that day suggested that they were at only 85°15′N, and they had no means of knowing which of the readings was correct. They realised that they were fighting a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. Johansen's diary indicated his failing spirits: [...] "My fingers are all destroyed. All mittens are frozen stiff ... It is becoming worse and worse ... God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen to us".|$|E

500|$|Alwyn W. Turner in {{the book}} The Rough Guide to Rock stated that the album {{features}} [...] "the best of her slow pieces" [...] displaying that [...] "Madonna had evolved over the years into an excellent ballad singer." [...] Edna Gundersen from USA Today said that the album [...] "flaunts the less sizzling, though equally galvanizing, highlights of her career." [...] She was mostly impressed with Madonna's vocal and emotional power on the track [...] "You'll See" [...] which became [...] "the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity." [...] J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts, saying [...] "It was interesting that, {{with all of his}} [...] exciting musical ability from which to draw, he and Madonna would come up with two of the most sombre songs she has ever recorded—but such is the excitement of collaboration; one never <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> come of it." [...] Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs [...] "show a great leap in sophistication" [...] and felt that Madonna [...] "has invested much in improving her vocal technique."

2500|$|The {{architect}} was Ralph Symons, and in 1588 the {{new building}} was opened with a dedication festival, which Mildmay attended. He installed in the college a master, Laurence Chaderton, three fellows, and four scholars; but subsequent benefactions soon increased the fellowships to fourteen and the scholarships to fifty. According to Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court, after the college was opened was addressed by the Queen with the words: [...] "Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a puritan foundation", to which Mildmay replied: [...] "No, madam; far be it from me to countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> be the fruit thereof".|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Jacob bar Acha {{taught in}} the name of Rabbi Zorah that the command to Aaron in [...] "at the door of the tent of meeting shall you abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord," [...] served as a source for the law of seven days of {{mourning}} for the death of a relative ( [...] , shivah).
