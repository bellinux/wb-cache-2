5000|$|There are two {{possible}} structures of hyponitrous acid, trans and cis. Trans-hyponitrous acid forms white crystals that are <b>explosive</b> <b>when</b> <b>dry.</b> In aqueous solution, it is a weak acid (pKa1 = 7.21, pKa2 = 11.54) , and decomposes to nitrous oxide and {{water with a}} half life of 16 days at 25 °C at pH 1-3: ...|$|E
50|$|Ether is {{sensitive}} to light and air, tending to form explosive peroxides. Ether peroxides have a higher boiling point than ether and are contact <b>explosives</b> <b>when</b> <b>dry.</b> Commercial diethyl ether is typically supplied with trace amounts of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which reduces the formation of peroxides. Storage over sodium hydroxide precipitates the intermediate ether hydroperoxides. Water and peroxides can be removed by either distillation from sodium and benzophenone, or by passing through a column of activated alumina.|$|R
50|$|Desensitized Explosives: <b>explosives</b> that, <b>when</b> <b>dry,</b> are <b>Explosives</b> of Class 1 {{other than}} those of {{compatibility}} group A, which are wetted with sufficient water, alcohol, or plasticizer to suppress explosive properties; and are specifically authorized by name either in the 49CFR 172.101 Table or have been assigned a shipping name and hazard class by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety.|$|R
50|$|Flowers produce copious {{amounts of}} nectar which attract birds, {{especially}} the Lesser Double-collared Sunbird and Malachite Sunbird. The butterfly Dantalis breeds in the tree. Flowers {{are followed by}} attractive, large, lime green to pink seedpods which turn brown when ripe. The seed is dispersed through an <b>explosive</b> seedpod, which <b>when</b> <b>dry,</b> catapults the seeds great distances from the parent plant. Seeds are produced in May and June of each year. Under normal circumstancesmstances the seeds would germinate in moist soil in late spring after the winter rains.|$|R

50|$|Ammonia is <b>{{explosive}}</b> <b>when</b> {{mixed with}} air (15 - 25%). Other lower azanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid azanes are highly flammable; this risk increases with {{the length of the}} nitrogen chain.|$|R

50|$|Silver nitride {{is often}} {{produced}} inadvertently during laboratory experiments involving silver compounds and ammonia, leading to surprise detonations. Whether silver nitride is formed {{depends on the}} concentration of ammonia in the solution. Silver oxide in 1.52 M ammonia solution readily converts to the nitride, while silver oxide in 0.76 M solution does not form nitride. Silver oxide can also react with dry ammonia to form Ag3N. Silver nitride is more dangerous <b>when</b> dry; <b>dry</b> silver nitride is a contact explosive which may detonate from the slightest touch, even a falling water droplet. It is also <b>explosive</b> <b>when</b> wet, although less so, and explosions do not propagate well in wet deposits of the compound. Because of its long-term instability, undetonated deposits of Ag3N will lose their sensitivity over time.|$|R

40|$|AbstractComparison of drying {{characteristics}} of Thompson seedless grapes using combined microwave oven and hot air cabinet dryer was investigated. The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen <b>when</b> increasing <b>drying</b> time from 30 to 120 min <b>when</b> grapes <b>drying</b> started in hot air cabinet dryer and finished in microwave oven for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to hot air cabinet dryer alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated. The average total soluble solids was 90. 4 ° Brix <b>when</b> <b>drying</b> was achieved by microwave oven followed by hot air cabinet dryer, meanwhile, it was 90. 2 ° Brix <b>when</b> <b>drying</b> was achieved by hot air cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven. The total soluble solid was 92 ° Brix <b>when</b> <b>drying</b> process started and finished in hot air cabinet dryer alone. The average drying ratio was 4. 21 <b>when</b> <b>drying</b> was achieved by microwave oven followed by hot air cabinet dryer; meanwhile, it was 4. 19 <b>when</b> <b>drying</b> was achieved by hot air cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven. The hot air cabinet drying method had higher drying constant ‘k’ compared to the other two methods. The microwave oven followed by hot air cabinet dryer as a drying method achieved 78 % of the optimum selection percentage.
