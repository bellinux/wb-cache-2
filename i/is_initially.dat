40|$|Aims: Once the {{biologic}} therapies {{have been}} used, the present-day medicine trend is to homogenize {{the treatment of}} the inflammatory autoimmune rheumatic diseases, meaning rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). But, there is still the need to find out a common assessment instrument for this pathology. Methods:The study included 120 patients (40 patients with RA, 40 patients with AS, 20 patients with PsA and 20 patients with SLE). They were assessed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study period by using both DAS (Disease Activity Score) and HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire) scales. BASDAI (Bath AS Disease Activity Index) was used for AS patients and SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) for SLE patients. Results: The RA patients had significant improvements regarding both DAS and HAQ scores (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 4. 49 and finally 3. 75; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 1. 78 and finally 2. 15; p< 0. 05). Important improvements were registered in AS patients (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 5. 25 and finally 4. 02; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 2. 24 and finally 2. 57; BASDAI mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 4. 28 and finally 3. 21; p< 0. 05), in PsA patients (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 7. 32 and finally 5. 15; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 2. 1 and finally 2. 51; p< 0. 05) and in SLE patients (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 4. 4 and finally 3. 45; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 1. 9 and finally 2. 4; SLEDAI mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 24. 7 and finally 12. 5; p< 0. 05). Conclusions:Having in view that the DAS scale analyses complex aspects (clinical activity of the disease, its inflammatory lab evidence, patient’s general health status), as well as its good correlation to other specific disease scales, it can be used as a more widely assessment instrument in the autoimmune inflammatory rheumatisms...|$|R

If the buyers <b>are</b> <b>initially</b> optimistic, then the optimal prices <b>are</b> <b>initially</b> low followed by higher prices that extract goodwill from the buyers with a high willingness to pay...|$|R

5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap <b>is</b> <b>initially</b> hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The cap margin <b>is</b> <b>initially</b> curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to the stalk), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may {{the top of the}} stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from the stalk {{to the edge of the}} cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).|$|E
