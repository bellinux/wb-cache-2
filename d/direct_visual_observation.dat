40|$|ABSTRACT Variation of {{behavior}} among hens and the relationships {{of behavior}} to measures of production and physical condition were investigated. The birds were 384 pullets from the mating of two stocks of males, obtained from a commercial breeder, to females from a third flock. The birds were housed as pairs in laying cages at 22 and 20 wk of age (Hatches 1 and 2, respectively). The laying phase was divided into 28 -day periods. In Periods 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, samples of hens were video recorded for 8 h. In Period 13, <b>direct</b> <b>visual</b> <b>observations</b> were made {{of the behavior of}} individually identified hens. Eleven production-related variables were recorded throughout the laying phase. Feather scores were assessed in Periods 3, 6, 9, and 12. Body weight, lesions to the feet, and claw length were recorded in Periods 6 and 13. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between video-recorded behavioral variables and measures of production and physical condition. The data from <b>direct</b> <b>visual</b> <b>observations</b> were used for heritability estimates of behavioral traits. Eating and standing were positively correlated with egg production, whereas sitting and, for hens derived from male parental Stock 1, resting were negatively correlated with production. Inactivity also coincided with poorer plumage condition and higher body weight. For the offspring of male parental Stock 2, behavioral actions frequently performed in stereotyped manner, e. g., cage pecking and toe pecking, were positively associated with egg production. No significant additive genetic variation for behavior was evident among sires; however, for dams, fairly large heritability estimates occurred for a number of behavioral states. The apparent absence of additive genetic variability among sires for behavior may have been due to genetic fixation at gene loci which control behavior in the stocks acquired from the commercial breeder.

The results how that the mobilization offines depends trongly on the chemistry of fluids present in the reservoir. Specifically, a critical electrolyte concentration exists for mobilization, which depends on the pH. For large particles of fines and relatively high fluid velocity, the mobilization offines may depend on the fluid velocity, but in a narrow range of electrolyte concentration. The types of interactions between the fines and sand grain surfaces were corroborated by <b>direct</b> <b>visual</b> <b>observations</b> u ing a traveling microcell pack.

Background Advances in bio-telemetry technology {{have made it possible}} to automatically monitor and classify behavioural activities in many animals, including domesticated species such as dairy cows. Automated behavioural classification has the potential to improve health and welfare monitoring processes as part of a Precision Livestock Farming approach. Recent studies have used accelerometers and pedometers to classify behavioural activities in dairy cows, but such approaches often cannot discriminate accurately between biologically important behaviours such as feeding, lying and standing or transition events between lying and standing. In this study we develop a decision-tree algorithm that uses tri-axial accelerometer data from a neck-mounted sensor to both classify biologically important behaviour in dairy cows and to detect transition events between lying and standing.
