This article evaluates CDPs ’ efforts to help nonprofit CDCs increase their capacity to revitalize low-income communities. We identified five types of capacity and conducted interviews and focus groups with CDPs and CDCs across the nation. The nature of capacity and capacity building among CDCs, the ways partnerships help increase CDC capacity, what the partnerships and CDCs learn from each other, and how they could better gauge the effectiveness of capacity-building support were discussed. We learned that CDCs and CDPs have forged an effective alliance and continue to work together: Community organizations require help in building capacity, and local partnerships provide the requisite <b>funding,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> and other elements to help them grow and serve their neighborhoods...|$|E
40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{and sexual}} violence (SV) are significant public health problems that negatively impact {{physical and emotional}} health and have serious consequences for victims, families, and communities. According to 2010 findings from the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) 1, about 1 in 4 women (24. 3 %) and 1 in 7 men (13. 8 %) in the U. S. have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner (e. g., hit with a fist or something hard, beaten, slammed against something) {{at some point in}} their lifetime. Additionally, nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men have been raped in their lifetime. As part of their efforts to address these two significant public health problems, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds state-level organizations for the prevention of the initial occurrence (primary prevention) of IPV and SV. Primary prevention requires comprehensive, coordinated, and sustained efforts of multiple, diverse organizations and stakeholders. These organizations and stakeholders further require both general and primary prevention specific organizational capacity to successfully adopt, implement, evaluate, and sustain primary prevention principles, concepts, and practices. 2, 3 With these requirements in mind, CDC developed two programs. The Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement and Leadership Through Alliances (DELTA) program funds State Domestic Violence Coalitions (SDVCs) for the primary prevention of IPV. The Enhancing and Making Programs and Outcomes Work to End Rape (EMPOWER) program provided additional <b>funding,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and training to a subset of the national Rape Prevention Education (RPE) program grantees. RPE grantees are state health departments funded for the primary prevention of SV. Suggested citation: CDC.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a comprehensive}} planning model {{to determine the}} level of citizen participation The purpose of this thesis was to document ways in which a local government can be a partner with its community development corporations (CDCs) rather than an obstacle. The paper used Indianapolis' CDCs and their support network as a case study. The research identified four needs of a CDC to build capacity: <b>funding,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> political networking, and internal management. This document intended to find the sources of support to meet these needs in Indianapolis. In the end, the primary focus was not necessarily what local government gave to the CDCs, but how they delivered the needed resources. Interviews were conducted with several individuals in Indianapolis to explore the support network available to CDCs. Members of the Indianapolis support network included the Department of Metropolitan Development [...] Division of Community Development and Financial Services, the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership (INHP), the Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), and the Indianapolis Coalition for Neighborhood Development (ICND). The questions asked of these individuals focused on how they fulfill {{the needs of the}} CDCs, and their perspective on the efforts of the local government. There are several characteristics and components to this support network in which another city could learn from or replicate. For instance, the local government should not be a reluctant supporter of it's CDCs. Building trust and long term relationships benefits the partnership between the city and CDCs. It {{is in the best interest}} of the CDCs if a local government encouraged a charitable environment. The local government needs to realize that the partnership with a CDC only works if there is a shared vision between the two. Finally, each member of the support network for the CDCs need to define what is really meant by the concept of partnership. Department of Urban PlanningThesis (M. U. R. P. ...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIn view {{of ongoing}} {{pandemic}} threats {{such as the}} recent human cases of novel avian influenza A(H 7 N 9) in China, {{it is important that}} all countries continue their preparedness efforts. Since 2006, Central American countries have received donor funding and technical assistance from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to build and improve their capacity for influenza surveillance and pandemic preparedness. Our objective was to measure changes in pandemic preparedness in this region, and explore factors associated with these changes, using evaluations conducted between 2008 and 2012. MethodsEight Central American countries scored their pandemic preparedness across 12 capabilities in 2008, 2010 and 2012, using a standardized tool developed by CDC. Scores were calculated by country and capability and compared between evaluation years using the Student 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s t-test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, respectively. Virological data reported to WHO were used to assess changes in testing capacity between evaluation years. Linear regression was used to examine associations between scores, donor <b>funding,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and WHO reporting. ResultsAll countries improved their pandemic preparedness between 2008 and 2012 and seven made statistically significant gains (p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 05). Increases in median scores were observed for all 12 capabilities over the same period and were statistically significant for eight of these (p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 05) : country planning, communications, routine influenza surveillance, national respiratory disease surveillance, outbreak response, resources for containment, community interventions and health sector response. We found a positive association between preparedness scores and cumulative funding between 2006 and 2011 (R 222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 5, p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 01). The number of specimens reported to WHO from participating countries increased significantly from 5, 551 (2008) to 18, 172 (2012) (p 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 < 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 01). ConclusionsCentral America has made significant improvements in influenza pandemic preparedness between 2008 and 2012. U. S. donor funding and technical assistance provided to the region is likely to have contributed to the improvements we observed, although information on other sources of funding and support was unavailable to study. Gains are also likely the result of countries 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 response to the 2009 influenza pandemic. Further research is required to determine the degree to which pandemic improvements are sustainable...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} reasons for the under utilization of electronic information {{is the lack of}} requisite level of working knowledge and consumption skills among customers and information intermediaries. So, the conventional user education programmes need be redefined and reengineered with more emphasis on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It should be designed in such a way to provide confidence to the users in locating desired information. There are 38 Agricultural Universities functioning in India and they are formed by special Acts and Statutes, either of the Government of India or of different State Governments. The Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) is the only one such university in the State of Kerala. It has 10 constituent colleges, six Regional Agricultural Research Stations, 26 Research Stations, three Centres of Advanced Studies, 10 Instructional Farms and six specific Centres of Research and Studies. The KAU Library and Information System (KAULIS) has a three tier structure consisting of the University Library, College Libraries and Research Station Libraries. The University Librarian is the professional head the system. As modern libraries world over {{are on the verge of}} rapid changes, the KAULIS also had witnessed several changes in this line. Though there was some initial resistance to accept the changes and adopt the new technologies, the positive factors like easy availability, accessibility, flexibility, etc. of the digital documents have created an overwhelming response from the users and this has necessitated a total change in the tools and service procedures of the libraries. Consequently, several new skills, related to ICTs, have to be acquired by the users and staff. From the management side, the whole operations of the libraries need to be changed to suit the requirements warranted by the modern environment. The concepts such as library cooperation, centralized and cooperative classification and cataloguing, etc. have emerged in different forms. Online Journals and Library Consortia became a prominent and effective approach now. Here, the library management and professionals could play an important role to manage the changes in an effective way. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the controlling agency for agricultural universities in India, has implemented a special project with the assistance of the World Bank to modernize the Library and Information Systems of all agricultural universities and the ICAR Institutes in the country. The project included special <b>funding,</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and training for the library staff, teachers and students. Substantial improvement in the operations and performance has been achieved with this project. The university libraries could automate most of their operations and many of them developed digital libraries of theses and dissertations. Academic Role of Library and Information Professionals As part of this project, several training programmes have been conducted in KAU to orient teachers and research students in the modern methods of information management. As an ex-officio member of the Academic Council, the University Librarian is actively participates in the process of designing course curriculum, academic regulations, etc. of the university. Through this, he gets an effective chance to assist in the implementation of library centered education in the university. The information science professionals working in the constituent colleges are also take active role in the education and research programmes. The syllabus for the undergraduate, postgraduate and research courses contains modules such as library classification, cataloguing, online and CD-ROM databases, library and information technologies, information retrieval, etc. In some other agricultural universities, this education is offered as a full credit course as part of the curriculum. This is a better opportunity to educate and train the students in their effort to search and retrieve the required information. Regular and special training courses of short duration are also being conducted by the KAULIS to prepare students, teachers and library staff to orient them in the changing environment. Objective and Methodology of the Study In order to assess the effectiveness and relevance of these academic and short term programmes, a study was conducted among the teachers, students and library staff of KAU. It was also intended to review the involvement of the library and information science professionals in academic programmes. The utility of such programmes to re-design the operations of the library and information system for the modern environment is also examined. The study was mainly based on personal interview, discussions, observing the library users and staff, review of literature, etc. Data was also collected from participants of the short term courses on Information Retrieval, conducted by the university during the last three years. Records of library services and operations were also compared to validate the facts received. Major Findings 1. 	Ninety per cent of the users have some knowledge on modern ICTs and digital information resources. But, all of them are admitted that this knowledge is highly inadequate to locate desired information from CD-ROM databases or Internet. It was also disclosed by many users that lot of time is being wasted by the inefficient methods of information retrieval. 2. 	All teacher as well as student users stressed the need for regular library instruction / user orientation courses and such programmes should be more oriented towards the application of modern ICTs with topics such as database search, information retrieval, search engines, retrieval softwares, formulation of search strategies, sorting, printing and downloading of records, etc. 3. 	Seventy per cent of the total respondents revealed that these programmes had helped to increase the efficiency in searching the databases. Eighty five per cent of the students expressed that the formal academic programmes as part of course curriculum are very helpful to locate the documents from the libraries and retrieve information from digital databases. 4. 	All library staff stressed the need for formal as well as short term courses for all types of users. They felt that such courses are helpful for the users to raise the reference queries clearly. This can also provide a platform to establish close relationship with the users. 5. 	Sixty five per cent of the library staff opined that these courses helped to update their technical knowledge and service efficiency. But, fifteen per cent has pointed out the problem of increase in the work load for preparing for classes and study materials, organizing work for short term courses, etc. 6. 	There is a normal tendency by the users and staff to resist the changes in the beginning and when convinced and accustomed by sufficient induction, orientation and training programmes, all are becoming happy to adapt to the modern technologies. 7. 	Detailed study of the topics such as ICTs, content development, digital libraries, knowledge management, online journals, digital document delivery, etc. should be included in the courses designed for the users and staff. More stress should be given for practical training. It was also observed that a frequent revision is needed in the topics included in such courses. The study revealed that there is a strong relationship between the user orientation and use of information resources, particularly the digital resources. It is also realised that many of the problems created by the transition of information documents from print to electronic medium could be better managed with the help of proper user education courses with stress on ICTs. Because of this, the teachers and students have shown special interest to absorb knowledge on modern methods of information retrieval. Academic courses as part of the curriculum will add weight and importance to such programmes. The library and information science professionals are also opined that such programmes will help in re-defining and re-engineering the Library and Information System for the modern era. Their involvement as teachers and trainers will have an over all impact on improving the performance of the libraries and ultimately the user satisfaction. This paper provides a detailed account of the study and its findings.
