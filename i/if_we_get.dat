We'll play both in the same set <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

[...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells you where to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E
500|$|February saw Arsenal's title {{challenge}} take a {{turn for}} the worse, with consecutive defeats. The first came at Valley Parade, away to Bradford City. Striker Dean Saunders scored the match winner in the 57th minute, which marked Arsenal's fifth defeat in a dozen away league games. The team then lost to Liverpool at home a week later, who moved into third place. Wenger said it [...] "had been a very bad week" [...] for Arsenal, and noted [...] "qualification for third place [...] not over … it's still possible <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> our players back in the right shape". The month ended with a 3–1 win against Southampton, in which Bergkamp and Kanu returned to the starting line-up.|$|E

500|$|Although Miller was on {{the roster}} for all three series in the Cardinals' 2013 postseason run, manager Mike Matheny did not place him in the {{starting}} rotation. [...] Instead, he totaled a single inning in one relief appearance against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2013 National League Division Series (NLDS), in which he gave up one home run. [...] Matheny rebuffed the suggestion {{that he was a}} [...] "misspent asset" [...] on the 25-man roster. [...] He specified that, [...] "He's going to be a guy we’re going to use <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> into a situation where we’ve got a bunch of innings to eat up, whether it's at the front end or back.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{reflected}} on the film's themes, writing [...] "Little Miss Sunshine shows us {{a world in which}} there's a form, a brochure, a procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'" [...] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: [...] "Little Miss Sunshine teaches us to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone prettier, smarter, or just plain luckier, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> up on that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the National Action Plan, a variety of people and organizationsincluding First Nations, human trafficking victims, law enforcement, and victim service providerscriticized Canada for failing to have such a plan. Charles Momy, president of the Canadian Police Association, said that despite existing efforts from local law enforcement agencies, Canada lacked and required [...] "a coordinated response to ensure the offenders are prosecuted, and put a stop to this modern day form of slavery." [...] In October 2008, John Fenn of Toronto's Streetlight Support Services expressed his frustration that there was still no national action plan on this subject despite the passing of the corresponding motion the previous year. Fenn said, [...] "Even if we make a muck of the thing <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> started, let's get started." [...] Benjamín Santamaria of Project Desert Roses, another Toronto-based organization, voiced the same complaint.|$|E

Nonetheless, he was reappointed as Minister of Finance on 23 September, as part of the Tsipras' second cabinet. Chouliarakis, the interim Minister of Finance, was retained in the finance ministry as an Alternate Minister of Finance. Later in September, {{in an interview with the}} Financial Times, Tsakalotos said that it was [...] "absolutely critical that we get something on debt relief." [...] He added: [...] "By the second quarter of 2016, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a positive review, bank recapitalisation and debt relief, I don’t see any reason why there shouldn’t be a return to growth." [...] He also said that the new government would make serious attempts to crack down on tax evasion: [...] "It will be a central aspect of our policies, which will determine the success of the government, because it’s the only way the Greek people will accept difficult measures that show we’re all in the same boat." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the news confirming the development of HeartGold and SoulSilver, fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that {{the primary reason for}} the updated games was to be compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, [...] "For me, Gold/Silver were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the Pokémon games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." [...] He reminisced over the qualities that made Gold and Silver truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, [...] "so far I like what I see, even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point." ...|$|E

500|$|As October {{passed without}} major headway, Rudd grew anxious {{to return to}} the Witswatersrand gold mines, but Rhodes insisted that he could not leave Bulawayo without the concession. [...] "You must not leave a vacuum," [...] Rhodes instructed. [...] "Leave Thompson and Maguire if {{necessary}} or wait until I can join... <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> anything we must always have someone resident". Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour. Charles Helm, a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including [...] "that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people." ...|$|E
500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers {{did not want to}} build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I hope it will be more painterly. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> it right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E

[...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us to be thinking about history. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E

500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E

On the subject of troop numbers Kemp stated [...] "It’s impossible to hold the ground without more men. But the Americans have promised thousands more this summer, so there’s hope on that front." [...] and that [...] "I wouldn't say the war is winnable in Afghanistan — that's the wrong word.

2500|$|Eventually, actors Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law {{were cast}} to replace Heath Ledger in certain scenes, portraying the new idea of {{transformed}} versions of Ledger's character travelling through magical realms, while the footage shot with Ledger {{would remain in}} the film as his character's [...] "real-world" [...] appearance. Gilliam told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Then we made the quantum leap: What <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> three actors to replace him? [...] Johnny {{was the first person}} I called. He said, 'Done. I'm there.' Same with Jude and Colin." [...] Depp, a friend of Gilliam's who starred in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the aborted The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, had been compared to Ledger by cinematographer Nicola Pecorini. Law was also a friend of Ledger's and had been considered for the role of Tony, and Farrell had also been friends with Ledger.|$|E
2500|$|Manhattan Valley has gentrified {{significantly}} {{since the}} 1980s. With this gentrification, rents {{in the area}} rose. The population of estimated Latino residents was fast dwindling by 1987. Meanwhile, nonprofit groups started to renovate many structures that were owned by the city, as well as build housing on previously vacant tracts of land. Reactions to this gentrification were mixed. In 1990, one resident stated, [...] "The crime situation is our biggest threat [...] but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> rid of it, we're also faced with gentrification." [...] Coinciding with this gentrification in 1990, crime was declining steeply, although drug dealings were still common; one large drug arrest {{had been made in}} December of that year. The Frederick Douglass Houses, which had become frequented by drug dealers, was thought to be stymieing the development of new housing in the area, which included two apartment towers that had been constructed in the preceding two years.|$|E

She noted that school prayer was [...] "not unlike the tuition tax credit issue. Politically we win <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> votes on the Senate floor". In 1985, she sent the anti-abortion film The Silent Scream, which was a documentary of an ultrasound abortion at three months produced in 1984 by anti-abortion activist and former NARAL founder Bernard Nathanson, to every member of Congress and arranged for a screening at the White House at which Nathanson presented the film.|$|E
