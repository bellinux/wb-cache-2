5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem.</b> In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part in the overall effect of many poems.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Winnowing fan: Contemporary to {{the rotary}} air {{conditioning}} fan invented by Han dynasty mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) is a pottery tomb {{model of a}} crank-operated rotary winnowing fan from the Han Dynasty, used for separating chaff from grain. The winnowing fan was first described by the Tang Dynasty writer and linguist Yan Shigu (581–645), in his commentary on the Jijiupian dictionary written earlier in 40 BC by Shi Yu; it was also mentioned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> by the Song Dynasty artist Mei Yaochen in about 1060. The earliest known drawn illustration of the winnowing fan comes from the Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by Yuan dynasty inventor and politician Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333).|$|E

5|$|He {{started his}} career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his {{teachers}} in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE when al-Maʿarri was still a child. Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> of his Risālat al-ghufrān. Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, Al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.|$|E
5|$|Heliade {{was aware}} of the often {{negative}} response to his work: <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> dedicated to the memory of Friedrich Schiller, he expanded on the contrast between creation and social setting (in reference to mankind, it stressed Te iartă să faci răul, iar binele nici mort—"They forgive the evil committed against them, but never the good"). A noted author of satire, he used it as a vehicle to criticize social customs of his day, as well as to publicize personal conflicts and resentments. As a maverick, he attacked political figures on both sides: conservatives who mimicked liberalism were the subject of his Areopagiul bestielor ("The Areopagus of the Beasts"), while many other of his post-1848 prose and poetry pieces mocked people on the left wing of liberalism, most notably C. A. Rosetti and his supporters. During and after his exile, his conflicts with Cezar Bolliac and Ion Ghica also made the latter two the target of irony, most likely based on Heliade's belief that they intended to downplay his contributions to the Wallachian Revolution of 1848.|$|E

The destruction of the Karaite community in Derazhne in 1649 is described <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> (both in Hebrew and Karaim language) by {{a leader of the}} congregation, Hazzan Joseph ben Yesh'uah Ha-Mashbir.
