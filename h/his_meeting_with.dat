5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He was surprised to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. <b>His</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E

5|$|A meeting {{among the}} party leaders, {{including}} Whitlam and Fraser, {{to resolve the}} crisis {{on the morning of}} 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13December. Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and handed him a letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.|$|E
5|$|At 01:00 the Soviet forces {{picked up}} a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps {{requesting}} a cease-fire. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head. The last defenders {{in the area of}} the bunker complex, French SS volunteers of the 33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French) remained until the early morning. The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00 and <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Chuikov ended at 8:23. Johannes Hentschel, the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either committed suicide or left, as the field hospital in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May. The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the Vorbunker, with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.|$|E
5|$|Chandler, who {{was also}} {{allegedly}} at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview. In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey's story, although he placed the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in January 1947. He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came {{to his home in}} Kentucky to discuss the matter further. According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson's transfer unless he had Chandler's full support, which Chandler subsequently pledged. Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, {{there is no evidence that}} <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and Washington Post sportswriter Bob Addie maintained that Robinson would not have played had it not been for Chandler's intervention.|$|E

5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. Orson Welles was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fröbe was cast because the producers saw his {{performance as a}} child molester in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fröbe, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, he had to double the speed of his performance {{to get the right}} tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed {{for the rest of the}} film by stage actor Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} shortly after taking off from Hitler's eastern {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg. Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had canceled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a late-night meeting with Hitler). Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In Inside the Third Reich, Speer recounts <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, saying that he only did so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that Hermann Göring raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented Göring with the fait accompli of Speer's appointment.|$|E
5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids Can Say No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was about the age of the children in Kids Can Say No! The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids Can Say No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E

5|$|The Smoking Man {{contacts}} Mulder, arranging {{a meeting}} at a nearby diner. There Mulder meets his sister Samantha, who calls The Smoking Man her father. Samantha claims to not remember anything about her abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her. The next day, The Smoking Man offers Mulder the truth if he quits the FBI and comes work for him; Mulder refuses. Mulder later meets with Blevins, who now has evidence Skinner was withholding information concerning Ostelhoff's death. Blevins tells Mulder he can help him if he names Skinner as the traitor in the FBI. Later, Mulder meets with Scully, telling her {{he was going to}} make the deal with The Smoking Man but now will not after <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Blevins. Despite Scully's pleas, he refuses to name Skinner as the traitor in the FBI.|$|E
5|$|With one day {{left before}} <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Lipnick {{to discuss the}} movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance.

When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears {{the sound of the}} mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{knew that}} Ott {{had no way}} out from Alessandria, {{but he had no}} idea of Melas's position. Following <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> the spy and fearing that the Austrian general might try to escape, Bonaparte spread his army out in a wide net by sending Louis Desaix with Divisional General Jean Boudet's {{division}} (6,000 men) south to Novi Ligure and Divisional General Jean François Cornu de La Poype (3,500 men) north on the other bank of the Po. Further north, from Vercelli to Lake Maggiore, were stationed the divisions of Antoine de Béthencourt and Joseph Chabran and, further to the rear, north of Piacenza, Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's division. Bonaparte's view was confirmed when General Claude Victor-Perrin, supported by Divisional General Joachim Murat’s cavalry, swiftly evicted FML Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough’s Austrian brigade from Marengo village that afternoon. Victor then deployed divisional generals Gaspard Amédée Gardanne and Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin's divisions along the Fontanone stream. Austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the French, but the lack of pontoons and time forced the Austrians to cross the river Bormida and then launch a single, direct assault across the Fontanone bridge.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid {{returned}} to Egypt, leaving the field {{open for the}} ambitious Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid forces left behind in Syria were relatively weak, and the Hamdanid leader, having gained {{the support of the}} Banu Kilab, had little difficulty in capturing Aleppo on 29 October 944. He then began extending his control over the provinces of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent an army under the eunuchs Abu al-Misk Kafur and Fatik against the Hamdanid, but it was defeated near Hama and retreated back to Egypt, abandoning Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then forced to once again campaign in person in April 945, {{but at the same time}} he sent envoys proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an agreement along the lines of the one with Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid prince would get to keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him an annual tribute for the possession of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla refused and reportedly even boasted that he would conquer Egypt itself, but al-Ikhshid held the upper hand: his agents managed to bribe several Hamdanid leaders, and he won over the citizens of Damascus, who barred their gates before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two armies met near Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were defeated. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be captured by al-Ikhshid.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, Sita has {{few other}} rakshasi benefactors besides Trijata. When Hanuman – the monkey-general of Rama who was tasked to find Sita – meets her in Lanka, {{she tells him}} that the wife of Vibhishana (the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama in the war) sent her {{daughter}} Kala (in other recensions of the Ramayana, known as Nanda or Anala) to proclaim Ravana's intention to not surrender Sita to Rama, despite {{the advice of the}} wise minister Avindhya and Vibhisana. Another friend, Sarama, consoles Sita when Ravana shows Sita an illusory severed head of Rama. She also informs her of Rama's well-being and his entry in Lanka with his army. In some versions of the Ramayana, an interpolated canto mentions how Sarama also tells Sita of the burning of Lanka by Hanuman after <b>his</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> Sita. Ravana's wife Mandodari is described to have rescued Sita in some versions, when Ravana tries to kill Sita. In later Rama-centric literature, Sarama was identified as Vibishana's wife, while Trijata was regarded as his daughter.|$|E
5|$|Janáček {{came from}} a region {{characterized}} by its deeply rooted folk culture, which he explored as a young student under Pavel Křížkovský. <b>His</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>with</b> the folklorist and dialectologist František Bartoš (1837–1906) was decisive in his own development as a folklorist and composer, and led to their collaborative and systematic collections of folk songs. Janáček became an important collector in his own right, especially of Lachian, Moravian Slovakian, Moravian Wallachian and Slovakian songs. From 1879, his collections included transcribed speech intonations. He {{was one of the}} organizers of the Czech-Slavic Folklore Exhibition, an important event in Czech culture at the end of 19th century. From 1905 he was President of the newly instituted Working Committee for Czech National Folksong in Moravia and Silesia, a branch of the Austrian institute Das Volkslied in Österreich (Folksong in Austria), which was established in 1902 by the Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Janáček was a pioneer and propagator of ethnographic photography in Moravia and Silesia. In October 1909 he acquired an Edison phonograph and {{became one of the first}} to use phonographic recording as a folklore research tool. Several of these recording sessions have been preserved, and were reissued in 1998.|$|E
