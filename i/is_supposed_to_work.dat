25|$|There is {{no formal}} {{document}} or white {{paper from the}} government of Ontario actually explaining how the current system <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Although the provincial government officially describes the system it has established as a 'hybrid' of planning and market models, debates {{on the merits of}} a centrally planned system versus a competitive market approach persist.|$|E

2500|$|Another former ACA official, Abdul Razak Idris, disputed Ramli's {{view of the}} {{interrogation}} process, saying: [...] "The Act provides that we can interview anytime. Investigators <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 24 hours." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "This is how grassroots, {{democratic}} politics work. To a certain extent, {{this is how}} {{democratic politics}} <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in general. You convince people {{of the validity of}} your ideas. You have {{to go out there and}} convince people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix {{seems to}} have come from nowhere and <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as [...] a {{watchman}} in a garage. One morning, Maria is kidnapped by a military squad in civilian clothes in front of her mother and is taken to the garage Olimpo, one of the many well-known torture places in the middle of Buenos Aires, which operate to the general indifference of the local citizens.|$|E
60|$|Ole grunted, puffed {{away at his}} pipe, {{and went}} on greasing. The captain of a bay {{schooner}} <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with his hands {{just as well as}} the men.|$|E
60|$|Captain. You are {{determined}} to proceed then in your own system? Are you aware that an unworthy motive may be assigned for this rapid succession of publication? You will <b>be</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> merely for the lucre of gain.|$|R
50|$|Dean, who {{was trying}} to find {{potential}} buyers for his technology, was secretive about the details of how it <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but it <b>was</b> said to contain asymmetrical rotating weights and to generate a great deal of vibration.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} month of flight, the probe's main {{structures}} would be deployed, the nuclear reactor activated, and the thrusters tested.

6000|$|... "Help me? Why, {{you work}} like a nigger--like a nigger <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but doesn't. No one--whatever we paid him--would do half as much. I don't {{want to make}} your head more swollen than it is, young woman, but you have talent; I am not sure it is not genius." [...] Peter felt the little hands tighten upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|So it {{has been}} with socialism. No single {{influence}} ever brought its ideas and its propaganda so forcibly and clearly before the public mind as Mr. Edward Bellamy's brilliant novel, [...] "Looking Backward," [...] published some thirty years ago. The task was arduous. Social and economic theory is heavy to {{the verge of being}} indigestible. There {{is no such thing as}} a gay book on political economy for reading in a hammock. Yet Mr. Bellamy succeeded. His book is in cold reality nothing but a series of conversations explaining how a socialist commonwealth <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Yet he contrives to bring into it a hero and a heroine, and somehow the warm beating of their hearts and the stolen glances in their eyes breathe into the dry dust of economic argument the breath of life. Nor was ever a better presentation made of the essential program of socialism.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to physical violence, inmates subject to [...] "reeducation" [...] <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for exhausting periods in humiliating jobs (for example, cleaning {{the floor with}} a rag clenched between the teeth). Inmates were malnourished and kept in degrading and unsanitary conditions.|$|R
50|$|The device <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> using a spoked, rimless wheel {{that allows}} cables {{to pass through}} as it rotates. The ends of the spokes are widened, and the cable is held {{together}} by a short curved sleeve through which these spoke ends slide.|$|R
50|$|A grill on a {{postage stamp}} is an {{embossed}} pattern of small indentations intended to discourage postage stamp reuse. They <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> by allowing the ink of the cancellation to be absorbed more readily by the fibres of the stamp paper, making it harder to wash off the cancellation.|$|R

50|$|Dean's {{patented}} devices, and {{his explanation}} of how his Drive <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>were</b> later shown to develop no net weight loss over time and do not violate Newton's third law of motion. Many other inventors claim to have invented similar devices, and they all still remain unproven, and lacking a solid theoretic basis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{connectors}} {{are defined}} {{so that if}} a plug fits a jack, the connection <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Cables have {{the same type of}} plug at both ends, so that each standard has only one type of cable. [...] "Extenders" [...] are defined as two-ended jacks that connect two standard cables.|$|E
5000|$|In the Review of Metaphysics, Christos Evangeliou {{said that}} if the reader [...] "had {{expected}} to find in this book concretely how a revived Aristotelian tradition <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in order to shape ethically and rationally the irrational and disorderly modern world", they [...] "may be a little disappointed in their expectations".|$|E

50|$|Deutsch's final fate is uncertain. Among {{theories}} {{which have}} been proposed by various authors, Deutsch {{was said to have}} been captured and shot by the Nazis after parachuting into Austria; or as having drowned when his ship was sunk by a U-boat while en route to New York, where he <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with NKVD recruits.|$|R
5000|$|After no more {{groups could}} be created, {{knowledge}} of how they <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>was</b> progressively lost, rule changes during the merger and product changes phases did {{not keep up with}} the features of the product so that there arose an increasing grey area where the society rules were no longer clear about how they should be operated.|$|R
30|$|Human errors can {{be defined}} as any human actions, both {{cognitive}} and physical, that potentially or actually result in negative effects on system’s normal functions [6]. As power systems become more complex, human operators <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in various situations, and they may encounter all kinds of emergencies. If human behaviors exceed an acceptable limit, it could lead to a disaster.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike earlier authors, Branca did {{not claim}} to be the creator of many of the {{machines}} and in one instance is even uncertain over how the machine in question <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> In the words of historian Alex Keller, his machines [...] "look like armchair inventions which seldom ever had any three-dimensional working counterparts".|$|E

50|$|A {{theory of}} {{operation}} is {{a description of}} how a device or system should work. It is often included in documentation, especially maintenance/service documentation, or a user manual. It aids troubleshooting by providing the troubleshooter with a mental model of how the system <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> The troubleshooter can then more easily identify discrepancies, to aid diagnosis of problem.|$|E
50|$|In his {{election}} capitulation (Wahlkapitulation) Henry covenanted {{to accept the}} privileges of the Estates of the Prince-Archbishopric (Stiftsstände) and the existing laws.

For the time being Henry <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> towards his papal confirmation as archbishop.|$|R
