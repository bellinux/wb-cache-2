5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons running <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Canyon slope {{in the wrong}} {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|In September 1870, Garfield, who {{was then}} {{chairman}} of the House Banking Committee, led an investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Friday Gold Panic scandal. The committee investigation into corruption was thorough, but found no indictable offenses. Garfield blamed the easy availability of fiat money greenbacks for financing the speculation {{that led to the}} scandal.|$|E

5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea, {{where it is}} blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement {{of gold in}} the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills.|$|E
5|$|After the defeats at {{the battles}} at Ostrach and Stockach, and the Army of the Danube's retreat <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command {{of both the}} Army of Switzerland and the Army of the Danube to André Masséna. Protecting the {{northern}} access to Zürich, Masséna gathered {{some of the best}} commanders he had available; eventually, three of them would become Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a dependable General of Division.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham Metropolitan College {{is one of}} {{the largest}} further {{education}} colleges in the country, with fourteen campuses spread across Birmingham and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Country and Worcestershire. South & City College Birmingham has nine campuses spread throughout the city. Bournville College is based in a £66 million, 4.2 acre campus in Longbridge that opened in 2011. Fircroft College is a residential college based in a former Edwardian mansion in Selly Oak, founded in 1909 around a strong commitment to social justice, with many courses aimed at students with few prior formal qualifications. Queen Alexandra College is a specialist college based in Harborne offering further education to visually impaired or disabled students from all over the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Despite her out-dated design, Démocratie {{served with}} the French Mediterranean Fleet {{throughout}} her career, including during World War I. She participated in the Battle of Antivari in late August 1914, and spent {{the majority of the}} war based on the coast of Greece, in Corfu and Mudros, to keep the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman navies bottled up in port, though she saw no further action. After the end of the war, she went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea to assist in the enforcement of the terms of the Armistice with Germany. Démocratie was stricken in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|From 21 February 1917, Bodrog and Körös were {{deployed}} as guardships at Brăila. On 1 March, Bodrog became stuck in ice at nearby Măcin. LSL Guido Taschler took command of Bodrog in 1918. That year's spring thaw saw Bodrog, Körös, Szamos, Bosna {{and several other}} vessels sent through {{the mouth of the}} Danube <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea as part of Flottenabteilung Wulff (Fleet Division Wulff) under the command of Flottenkapitän (Fleet Captain) Olav Wulff, arriving in Odessa on 12 April. On 15 July, she and Bosna sailed to the port of Nikolaev, and from 5 August, Bodrog was stationed at Cherson. On 12 September, she returned to Brăila along with other vessels.|$|E
5|$|In March 1919, Iron Duke was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she again served as flagship. The ship went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea in April to participate in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. While en route, the ship stopped in Constantinople on 7 April. There, Iron Duke was involved in the destruction of warships and other materiel that might be used by the Bolsheviks. On 12 May, Iron Duke travelled from Constantinople to Smyrna, where she provided a landing party to occupy some of the city's outer forts. She returned to the Black Sea, where she remained until June, when she returned to the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The Rus' {{launched}} the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern {{shores of the}} Caspian Sea through the country of the Khazars.

They sailed down the Dnieper River <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea, then into the Sea of Azov, then up the Don River past the Khazar city of Sarkel, and then by a portage reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It Moves are {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{received}} 15,000 {{tickets for}} the final from the Football Association. Birmingham distributed their share by ballot among those supporters who had followed the team in the earlier rounds of the competition; 22,000 had attended the semi-final, so many thousands were left disappointed. Of the remaining tickets, 4,640 were allocated to the FA, 40,640 to County Associations, 20,090 to Football League clubs, 2,550 to FA members and 2,080 to the FA Council and stadium authorities. An enquiry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> market held following the previous year's Cup Final meant ticket touts kept a lower profile than usual. However, in the week {{leading up to the}} game, the cheapest standing tickets, originally sold for 3s6d, were changing hands in Birmingham for twenty times face value, or 35%of a manual worker's weekly earnings.|$|E

5|$|Following General Grant's 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were {{firmly in}} charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this {{time away from}} the {{sensitive}} assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the Department of Dakota. The Department covered Minnesota, Montana, and the Dakotas. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent. Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed a massacre against the Blackfeet. Relations with the Sioux also became contentious as a result of white encroachment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills, in violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie. Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was peaceful.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard, a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E

Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role, later revealed to be Quentin Beck / Mysterio.

Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess. However, several years later, in 2013, Raimi stated that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made. Concept art revealed in June 2016 showed the inclusion of an opening montage of Spider-Man going up against C and D-list villains, such as Mysterio, the Shocker, the Prowler, and the Rhino, with the Vulture serving as the main antagonist.|$|E
