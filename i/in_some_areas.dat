Wearing sterile gloves is required by law for professional piercing procedures <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas,</b> such as the states of Florida and South Carolina. Tools and jewellery should be sterilized in autoclaves, and non-autoclavable surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectant agents on a regular basis and between clients.|$|E
