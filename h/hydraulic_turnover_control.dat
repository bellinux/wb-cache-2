The {{geometric}} {{models of}} the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turnover</b> device are constructed by using three-dimensional modeling software UG, and then they are induced into simulation software ADAMS by a sharing data format. By using ADAMS, models are further simplified and the virtual prototype is established. By using the associated model, the simulation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turnover</b> device is analyzed in ADAMS. Compared with the traditional methods of using physical prototypes, the movement processes and relevant parameters of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turnover</b> device can be effectively obtained by means of this method. Furthermore, {{the quality of the}} constraint relations between the parts is very important in terms of the accuracy of the model simulation analysis. This simulation results accord with the practical situation, which indicates that the operation is stable and the efficiency is high. It provides a theoretical basis for the practical design of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turnover</b> device, which shows that the combination of ADAMS and UG works well...|$|R

The results of our study generally supported the earlier suggestion by many authors that the waterbodies with longer hydraulic retention time retain the higher percentage of the externally received phosphorus. We could also partly confirm our hypothesis that the waterbodies with the bigger relative depth might retain higher proportion of the external phosphorus than larger and shallower waterbodies with lower relative depth. The latter assumption was, however, valid only in some specific type of waterbodies ¿ small and medium-sized with the intensive <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turnover.</b> The lakes that received higher areal loading of P also retained more P per m 2 but the proportion of the retained external P loading remained generally independent from the amount of areal P input that waterbody received.

40|$|Immobilized {{bacteria}} {{have been}} shown in the laboratory to effectively remove glyphosate from wastewater effluent discharged from an activated sludge treatment system. Bacterial consortia in lab columns maintained a 99 % glyphosate-degrading activity (GDA) at a hydraulic residence time of less than 20 min. In this study, a pilot plant (capacity, 45 liters/min) was used for a field demonstration. Initially, activated sludge was enriched for microbes with GDA during a 3 -week biocarrier activation period. Wastewater effluent was then spiked with glyphosate and NH 4 Cl and recycled through the pilot plant column during start-up. Microbes with GDA were enhanced by maintaining the pH at less than 8 and adding yeast extract (less than 10 mg/liter). Once the consortia were stabilized, the column capacity for glyphosate removal was determined in a 60 -day continuous-flow study. Waste containing 50 mg of glyphosate per liter was pumped at increasing flow rates until a steady state was reached. A microbial GDA of greater than 90 % was achieved at a 10 -min hydraulic residence time (144 <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turnovers</b> per day). Additional studies showed that microbes with GDA were recoverable within (i) 5 days of an acid shock and (ii) 3 days after a 21 -day dormancy (low-flow, low-maintenance) mode.

Deletion of genes encoding COP 9 signalosome (CSN) subunits 1, 2, 4, or 5 resulted in identical blocks in fruit body formation.

Six CSN subunits interacted in a yeast two-hybrid analysis, and the complete eight-subunit CSN was recruited by a functional tandem affinity purification tag fusion of subunit 5 (CsnE). The tagged CsnE was unable to recruit any CSN subunit in a strain deleted for subunit 1 or subunit 4. Mutations in the JAMM metalloprotease core of CsnE resulted in mutant phenotypes identical to those of csn deletion strains.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} time-series {{patterns of}} job and worker flows {{in a newly}} industrializing economy (NIE). Using plant-level data from the Taiwan manufacturing sector, the cyclical behaviour of job reallocation and its relation with worker turnover is analysed. It is found that job reallocation and labour turnover are procyclical, at both the aggregate and (two-digit) industry levels. The share of worker turnover caused by gross job reallocation is 17 %, suggesting the majority of observed worker turnover reflects rotations of positions that are neither created or destroyed. There is substantial heterogeneity in plant-specific job and worker turnover patterns. Job creation and job destruction rates are higher among small plants and private-sector plants. The private plants are more dynamic than public plants in terms of worker <b>turnover.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for year and industry effects, {{it is found that}} job creation and worker turnover are both higher in export-oriented industries. ...|$|R

Our proxy for CEO centrality is the fraction of the top-five compensation captured by the CEO. We find that CEO centrality is negatively associated with firm value (as measured by industry-adjusted Tobin's Q). Greater CEO centrality is also correlated with (i) lower (industry-adjusted) accounting profitability, (ii) lower stock returns accompanying acquisitions announced by the firm and higher likelihood of a negative stock return accompanying such announcements, (iii) greater tendency to reward the CEO for luck in the form of positive industry-wide shocks, (iv) lower likelihood of CEO <b>turnover</b> <b>controlling</b> for performance, and (v) lower firm-specific variability of stock returns over time.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} compares {{three of}} the leading theories on wage and promotion dynamics, tournament theory, job assignment theory, and signaling theory, via their predictions {{on the impact of}} promotion on employees' turnover behavior. In the first chapter entitled "Theory on Promotion and Turnover", I incorporate turnover into all three theories through an employeremployee specific match factor and generate three predictions from each theory. The first two are similar among the theories and the third distinguishes among them. Specifically, all the theories predict that promotions are positively correlated with wage levels and that performance ratings are positively related to the probability of promotion. Regarding promotion and turnover dynamics, the tournament model predicts that promotion is negatively related to turnover, while the job assignment model predicts that neither promotion nor the wage is related to turnover. Further, under certain conditions, the signaling model predicts that promotion is positively related to turnover and that the wage is negatively related to <b>turnover</b> <b>controlling</b> for promotions. In the second chapter entitled "Theoretical Extensions on Promotion and Turnover," I further extend both tournament and job assignment theories by adding firm specific human capital. These extensions enrich the predictions of both theories regarding promotion and turnover dynamics. Specifically, the further extended tournament theory predicts that promotion is negatively correlated with turnover while the wage is negatively correlated with <b>turnover</b> <b>controlling</b> for promotions. On the other hand, the further extended job assignment theory predicts that promotion is positively correlated with turnover while the wage is negatively correlated with turnover given promotions. In the third chapter of my dissertation entitled "Evidence on Promotion and Turnover," I test these predictions using a dataset on employees from a single firm in the financial services industry in the U. S. I first show that tournament theory better captures the promotion-turnover dynamics in the full sample. I then conduct further tests by breaking up the sample into a high level subsample and a low level subsample. I find that tournament theory better explains the promotion-turnover dynamics in higher level jobs, while both signaling theory and job assignment theory with firm specific human capital better explain the dynamics in lower level jobs. I interpret this finding as evidence consistent with both an incentive argument related to Rosen (1982) and Baker, Jensen, and Murphy (1988) and the hybrid approach discussed in Waldman (2013). 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R

Here, we show that PIP 2 visualized by expressing a fusion protein of the pleckstrin homology domain from PLC � and green fluorescent protein (PH-GFP), colocalized with Arf 6 at the PM and on tubular endosomal structures. Activation of Arf 6 by expression of its exchange factor EFA 6 stimulated protrusion formation, the uptake of PM into macropinosomes enriched in PIP 2, and recycling of this membrane back to the PM. By contrast, expression of Arf 6 Q 67 L, a GTP hydrolysis-resistant mutant, induced the formation of PIP 2 -positive actin-coated vacuoles that were unable to recycle membrane back to the PM. PM proteins, such as � 1 -integrin, plakoglobin, and major histocompatibility complex class I, that normally traffic through the Arf 6 endosomal compartment became trapped in this vacuolar compartment. Overexpression of human PIP 5 -kinase � mimicked the effects seen with Arf 6 Q 67 L.

Given these realities, the present study identifies characteristics of internal and external variables that influence international and U. S. faculty turnover intentions in a large public South Eastern research university. To understand the variations in short-term and long-term <b>turnover</b> levels while <b>controlling</b> for various demographic, structural, and external variables, eight Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression analysis were performed using turnover intentions as the dependent variables. Distributive justice has the strongest negative effect on short-term turnover, and communication openness has the strongest negative effect on long-term <b>turnover.</b> After <b>controlling</b> for job satisfaction and organizational commitment, the effect of communication openness on short-term turnover and the effect of distributive justice on long-term turnover are not statistically significant. This suggests that communication openness and distributive justice might affect turnover through job satisfaction and/or organizational commitment. Job satisfaction has the strongest negative effect on short-term turnover and organizational commitment has the strongest negative effect on long-term <b>turnover</b> after <b>controlling</b> for internal and external variables. In addition, this study aims to analyze the differences in internal and external factors that impact faculty turnover by international status. In achieving this aim, international faculty were compared to the U. S. faculty on the afore-mentioned internal and external factors that were shown in the literature to impact turnover. The result shows that structural variables such as autonomy, communication openness, and procedural justice play a bigger part in how international faculty evaluate their career with the current university than it does for U.

The level of the NPP transcripts transiently decreased after hepatectomy, but NPPalpha mRNA was also lost after sham operation, which suggests that it may belong to the negative acute-phase proteins. The loss of the beta- and gamma-transcripts after hepatectomy was not due to a decreased NPP gene transcription or an increased turnover of the mature transcripts. However, hepatectomy also caused a similar loss of the nuclear pool of the NPPbeta and NPPgamma mRNAs.

Because the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR 1) activation appears to play {{a pivotal role in}} spermiogenesis, the developmental stage where DNA is remodeled, we hypothesized that CNR 1 receptors might also influence chromatin quality in sperm. We used Cnr 1 null mutant (Cnr 1 -/-) mice to study the possible role of endocannabinoids on sperm chromatin during spermiogenesis. We demonstrated that CNR 1 activation regulated chromatin remodeling of spermatids by either increasing Tnp 2 levels or enhancing histone displacement. Comparative analysis of wild-type, Cnr 1 +/-, and Cnr 1 -/- animals suggested the possible occurrence of haploinsufficiency for Tnp 2 <b>turnover</b> <b>control</b> by CNR 1, whereas histone displacement was disrupted to a lesser extent. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the genetic loss of Cnr 1 decreased sperm chromatin quality and was associated with sperm DNA fragmentation. This damage increased during epididymal transit, from caput to cauda. Collectively, our results show that the expression/activity of CNR 1 controls the physiological alterations of DNA packaging during spermiogenesis and epididymal transit. Given the deleterious effects of sperm DNA damage on male fertility, we suggest that the reproductive function of marijuana users may also be impaired by deregulation of the endogenous endocannabinoid system.

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, chromatin reorganizes within {{promoters of}} active genes {{to allow the}} transcription machinery and various transcription factors to access DNA.

In {{the case of the}} human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, specific transcription factors are apparently underrepresented with regards {{to the size of the}} genome, and mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation are controversial. Here, we investigate the modulation of DNA accessibility by chromatin remodeling during the parasite infection cycle. We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome occupancy across the parasite erythrocytic cycle using two complementary assays [...] the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements to extract protein-free DNA (FAIRE) and the MNase-mediated purification of mononucleosomes to extract histone-bound DNA (MAINE), both techniques being coupled to high-throughput sequencing. We show that chromatin architecture undergoes drastic upheavals throughout the parasite's cycle, contrasting with targeted chromatin reorganization usually observed in eukaryotes. Chromatin loosens after the invasion of the red blood cell and then repacks prior to the next cycle. Changes in nucleosome occupancy within promoter regions follow this genome-wide pattern, with a few exceptions such as the var genes involved in virulence and genes expressed at early stages of the cycle. We postulate that chromatin structure and nucleosome <b>turnover</b> <b>control</b> massive transcription during the erythrocytic cycle.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether basal phosphoinositide turnover {{plays a role}} in metabolic regulation in resting rabbit aortic intima-media incubated under steady state conditions, we used deprivation of extracellular myo-inositol as a potential means of inhibiting basal phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthesis at restricted sites and of depleting small phosphoinositide pools with a rapid basal turnover. Medium myo-inositol in a normal plasma level was required to prevent inhibition of a specific component of basal de novo PI synthesis that is necessary to demonstrate a discrete rapidly turning-over [1, 3 - 14 C]glycerol-labeled PI pool. Medium myo-inositol was also required to label the discrete PI pool with [1 - 14 C]arachidonic acid (AA). The rapid basal turnover of this PI pool, when labeled with glycerol or AA, was not attributable to its utilization for polyphosphoinositide formation, and it seems to reflect basal PI hydrolysis. Depleting endogenous free AA with medium defatted albumin selectively inhibits the component of basal de novo PI synthesis that replenishes the rapidly turning-over PI pool. A component of normal resting energy utilization in aortic intima-media also specifically requires medium myo-inositol in a normal plasma level and a free AA pool; its magnitude is unaltered by indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or Ca 2 +-free medium. This energy utilization results primarily from Na+/K+ ATPase activity (ouabain-inhibitable O 2 consumption), and in Ca 2 +-free medium deprivation of medium myo-inositol or of free AA inhibits resting Na+/K+ ATPase activity to a similar degree (60 %, 52 %).

50|$|A {{relatively}} {{remote location}} in Norfolk, RAF Fersfield, was the launch site. Initially, RAF Woodbridge {{had been selected}} for its long runway, but {{the possibility of a}} damaged aircraft that diverted to Woodbridge for landings colliding with a loaded drone caused concerns. The remote control system was insufficient for safe takeoff, so each drone was taken aloft by a volunteer pilot and a volunteer flight engineer to an altitude of 2,000 ft (600 m) for transfer of control to the CQ-17 operators. After successful <b>turnover</b> of <b>control</b> of the drone, the two-man crew would arm the payload and parachute out of the cockpit. The 'mothership' would then direct the missile to the target.|$|R
50|$|Particular laws {{apply to}} {{financial}} requirements, construction defects {{and other matters}} concerning the developer of associations with applicable deadlines and various statutes of limitations. E.g., Fla. Stat. sec. 718.301(4)(c)(90-day deadline following <b>turnover</b> of <b>control</b> for the developer of a condominium to pay for and provide an independent audit of the financial records); e.g., Fla. Stat. sec. 718.203(developer warranties). Even a conversion of an older building to condominium can subject the developer to providing warranties to its owners. E.g., 718.618(6). Thus, following the transition of the association from the developer to unit owners other than the developer, {{the board of directors}} has the exceedingly important task of timely evaluating same through expert and legal advice.|$|R
40|$|Background: Swimming, a sport {{practiced in}} hypogravity, has {{sometimes}} been associated with decreased bone mass. Aim: This systematic review aims to summarize and update present knowledge {{about the effects of}} swimming on bone mass, structure and metabolism in order to ascertain the effects of this sport on bone tissue. Methods: A literature search was conducted up to April 2013. A total of 64 studies focusing on swimmers bone mass, structure and metabolism met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Results: It has been generally observed that swimmers present lower bone mineral density than athletes who practise high impact sports and similar values when compared to sedentary controls. However, swimmers have a higher bone <b>turnover</b> than <b>controls</b> resulting in a different structure which in turn results in higher resistance to fracture indexes. Nevertheless, swimming may become highly beneficial regarding bone mass in later stages of life. Conclusion: Swimming does not seem to negatively affect bone mass, although it may not {{be one of the best}} sports to be practised in order to increase this parameter, due to the hypogravity and lack of impact characteristic of this sport. Most of the studies included in this review showed similar bone mineral density values in swimmers and sedentary controls. However, swimmers present a higher bone <b>turnover</b> than sedentary <b>controls</b> that may result in a stronger structure an...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough it {{is known}} that {{multiple}} interactions among plant functional traits, microbial properties, and abiotic soil parameters influence the nutrient turnover, the relative contribution of each of these groups of variables is poorly understood. We manipulated grassland plant functional composition and soil nitrogen (N) availability in a multisite mesocosm experiment to quantify their relative effects on soil N turnover. Overall, root traits, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization, denitrification potential, as well as N availability and water availability, best explained the variation in measured ecosystem properties, especially the trade-off between nutrient sequestration and plant biomass production. Their relative contributions varied with soil N availability. In relatively N-poor soils (10 – 20 μg·N·g − 1 soil), N <b>turnover</b> was mainly <b>controlled</b> by microbial properties and abiotic soil parameters, whereas in the relatively N-rich soils (110 – 120 μg·N·g − 1 soil), N <b>turnover</b> was mainly <b>controlled</b> by plant traits and microbial properties. This experiment is a strong demonstration of the importance of functional characteristics of both plants and soil microbes, and their interplay with soil N availability, for N turnover in grassland soils...|$|R
