2500|$|Songun {{politics}} have also thrived on the ongoing nuclear crisis. [...] For the United States, given that its primary {{concern is the}} <b>denuclearisation</b> of the peninsula, the concept of military-first politics and ideology is a troubling one. Songun also seems to fit very well with the possession of nuclear weapons, and {{can be seen as}} a way of making such weapons central to the government's guiding ideology of self-governance. This leads to the concern that, the longer military-first ideology guides the North Korean government, the less likely it will be that the United States will be able to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme. A similar concern is that North Korea could perceive attempts at <b>denuclearisation</b> and normalisation of affairs with the United States as a threat to the primacy of the military within North Korea and, thus, a threat to songun ideology, a fear which puts into doubt the idea that North Korea may be(come) willing to give up its nuclear weapons programme.|$|E

40|$|North Korea is {{unlikely}} to relinquish its nuclear program because of its importance to the perpetuation of the Kim regime. This conclusion arises from the observation that the nuclear program has been a long-term project spanning several decades, culminating in <b>denuclearisation</b> negotiations, which have followed a cyclical pattern in which the North has provoked crises to extract concessions and gain leverage vis-a-vis regional states. It {{is clear that the}} nuclear program has great intrinsic value to Pyongyang. First, this paper argues that the sunk costs of previous investment in the nuclear program, as evidenced by the infrastructure for the country's nuclear fuel cycle, create forward momentum favouring continuation of the nuclear program. Second, it argues that the nuclear program solidifies Kim regime rule as an institutional buttress, as a prop for the domestic economy, and as a vehicle for ideological legitimation. The paper is a unique contribution, which explicitly links the Kim regime's proliferation calculus to the economic and bureaucratic imperatives of regime perpetuation, as well as the sunk cost of previous investment in the nuclear program. It provides a coherent explanation for North Korea's consistent unreliability in negotiations, and offers insights into future prospects of the <b>denuclearisation</b> process.

40|$|North Korea is an outlier on the {{periphery}} of the East Asian economic miracle and simultaneously a key strategic actor amid the dance of regional great power competition. This article investigates the factors constraining North Korea's further integration into the Northeast Asian region and the implications of the maturation of its nuclear weapons program for regional security. These findings suggest that North Korea's doctrine of simultaneous nuclear weapons and economic development heralds the end of regional <b>denuclearisation</b> politics, which in turn is shaping the nature and extent of North Korea's integration into Northeast Asia. North Korea's nuclear gambit and the failure of regional states to adjust to North Korea as a nuclear weapons power may increase the danger of conflict escalation and expanded regional horizontal nuclear proliferation.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} analyse and explain Libya’s {{pursuit of a}} nuclear weapons {{capability}} and the factors that ultimately influenced Qaddafi’s regime to dismantle the nuclear weapons programme. Driven by the core motive to deter external threats to its security {{and the desire to}} become a regional power, Libya for over three decades sought to acquire nuclear weapons, but failed to obtain them ‘off the shelf’. From the 1970 s until 2003, Libya sought to acquire key elements of nuclear components. After many years Qaddafi transformed his foreign and security policies, which for several decades had resulted in rogue behaviour {{on the part of the}} state machine. This transformation applied to the ideological motivations that had generated the regime’s aggressive approach in the realm of international relations. Focusing on the Libyan case study, in three different periods has allowed the key factors influencing Libya’s pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and simultaneously its decision to denuclearise, to be unravelled. The empirical findings demonstrate that external and internal pressure provides a satisfactory explanation for the reorientation of Libya’s policies. This thesis confirms that Qaddafi’s regime dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 was influenced by the domestic factors such as public pressure, and external factors such as stringent economic sanctions, international isolation and the very genuine threat of military action. This in turn reflected the fact that the Libyan case can be better explained from a realistic point of view. Indeed, the study found that the reaction of the Libyan government was not a response to the regional and international norms, but it was rather a consequence of domestic and external pressure. By arguing this, <b>denuclearisation</b> occurs when regimes comes under internal and external pressure, particularly from powerful actors by using coercion tools such as international isolation, economic sanctions and threat of military action. This thesis contributes to broader theoretical debates surrounding non-proliferation and <b>denuclearisation.</b> This study concludes that states can give up their nuclear weapons programmes under certain internal and external factors...|$|E
40|$|North Korea is {{unlikely}} to willingly relinquish its nuclear program because of its importance to {{the political economy of}} the DPRK state and the perpetuation of the Kim regime. Two observations give rise to this conclusion: First, the development of North Korea’s nuclear program has been a long-term project spanning several decades. At no stage has Pyongyang shown a commitment to its dismantlement. Second, <b>denuclearisation</b> negotiations have followed a cyclical pattern in which the North has provoked crises to make new demands and gain leverage in negotiations. By inference {{it is clear that the}} nuclear program has great intrinsic value to Pyongyang. This paper argues that the nuclear program has value as a bargaining chip in international diplomacy to extract economic inputs for its moribund economy, in domestic politics as vehicle for bureaucratic interests, and as a rallying symbol of the country’s hyper-nationalist ideology, as well as its role as a defensive deterrent and important cog in Pyongyang’s offensive asymmetric war strategy. For these reasons, the Kim regime {{is unlikely}} to seriously entertain nuclear disarmament...|$|E

Hamel-Green concludes by stressing the need for work towards a Nuclear Weapons Convention framework as "a way of addressing the threat of a nuclear holocaust through an agreed reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons while maintaining mutual security for all states and peoples at each stage of the process. ...|$|E
40|$|African {{efforts to}} denuclearise Africa {{originated}} in the 1960 s in response to French nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert and to apartheid South Africa’s nuclear weapons programme. The Organisation of African Unity joined the UN in the mid- 1960 s to denuclearise the continent. With international opposition to its apartheid policies, the South African government became increasingly isolated; a situation which worsened as confirmation of the country’s nuclear capabilities revealed the extent of its nuclear weapons programme. By the end ofthe 1980 s, the apartheid government under President F. W. de Klerk decided to terminate the South African nuclear weapons programme {{as well as its}} apartheid policies; a decision which accelerated the <b>denuclearisation</b> of Africa. Once South Africa’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation became evident, the continent included it in negotiations on an African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty (Pelindaba Treaty). With the treaty’s entry into force in July 2009 and South Africa’s subsequent election to leadership positions in the treaty’s compliance mechanism, South Africa’s nuclear diplomacy with Africa entered a new phase which continues to pose challenges to the continent’s commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.

40|$|MA, School of Social Sciences, Faculty of Humanities, University of the WitwatersrandThis paper {{studies the}} North Korean Six-Party Talks This {{negotiation}} concerned the <b>denuclearisation</b> of North Korea. This is the overarching {{goal of the}} Six-Party Talks – to get North Korea to denuclearise. However, each party has their own personal objective {{that they would like}} to achieve. The paper discusses the negotiation process by looking at the strategies utilised by the members to achieve their outcomes, as well as the intervening variables (culture and environment) that affect the strategy and outcome of talks. However, the goal of this paper is to design a model based on the Six-Party Talks to simulate future negotiated outcomes. The paper does not purport that the Six-Party Talks is successful, as this cannot be claimed until the talks come to a close. What it does argue is that the talks have achieved a measure of success, proven by the achievement of two agreements and its continuance. Therefore, the paper believes that the Six-party negotiation is moving towards success. With that said, the paper examines the applicability of the model by discussing it with regards to the minor case study, Iran. This paper is distributed into six sections. Section One, is the Introduction, it situates the research problem. Section Two and Three, is Chapters One and Two respectively. Chapter obstacles to negotiating. Section Four and Five, is Chapters Three and Four respectively. Chapter Three is dedicated to the main case study the North Korean Six-Party Talks, it looks at the context in which the talks are occurring, as well as the delegates involved and their objectives for the negotiations. It then discusses the strategies used in the negotiation and then depicts the model. Chapter Four focuses on Iran, discussing the context of talks with Iran by the various concerned parties and following this is the discussion of the model with respect to Iranian talks. The Sixth and Final section, Section Six is the Conclusion which draws a close the discussion of the Six-Party Talks. One explores negotiations, from the definition of negotiation to the theories applied in negotiation. While, Chapter Two discusses negotiation strategy, by looking at the styles and tactics used in negotiations, as well as the influence of culture on negotiations and the that began in 2003 and are still ongoing...|$|E
