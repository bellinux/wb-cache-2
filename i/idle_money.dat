The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes with huge amounts of <b>idle</b> <b>money</b> entering the housing market. However, if the stock market grows stronger, it will undoubtedly attract idle capital. In terms of investment, the domestic rival markets of the bourse are the Iranian real estate market, cars and gold (with gold {{being used as a}} store of value, a hedging tool against hyperinflation and the devaluation of the Rial). According to Goldman Sachs, Iran is forecast to reach the highest economic growth between 2015 and 2025 and join the world's largest economies (world's 12th economy by 2025). Since 2012, TSE has served as a safe heaven against international sanctions and inflation.|$|E

[...] By the heel of the Paternosters--there isn't a chance to mistake-- [...] And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break! [...] Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the stanchest freighter afloat, [...] And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat! [...] He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone; [...] He knows what I want o' the Mary.... I'll do what I please with my own. [...] Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more; [...] I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door.... For my son 'e was never a credit: 'e muddled with books and art, [...] And 'e lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart. [...] There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done-- [...] The only one you left me, O mother, the only one! [...] Harrer an' Trinity College! Me slavin' early an' late, [...] An' he thinks I'm dyin' crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait! [...] Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen, [...] That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then, [...] But--cheap repairs for a cheap 'un--the doctors said I'd do: [...] Mary, why didn't you warn me? I've allus heeded to you, [...] Excep'--I know--about women; but you are a spirit now; [...] An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man. That's how. [...] An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand; [...] But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand. [...] Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me, [...] For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be? [...] I believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain, [...] But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again. [...] For the heart it shall go with the treasure--go down to the sea in [...] ships. [...] I'm sick of the hired women--I'll kiss my girl on her lips! [...] I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well, [...] And the wife of my youth shall charm me--an' the rest can go to Hell! [...] (Dickie, he will, that's certain.)

The housing industry {{is one of the}} few segments of the Iranian economy where state capital shares as little as two per cent of the market, and the remaining 98 per cent is private sector investment. There is little red tape or hurdles and, as a result, through launching mass development projects, the use of new technologies and fast-pace project execution, a larger portion of the housing market is accessible. This is also true for new construction materials and technological advances.|$|E

These excess money balances would therefore be spent and hence aggregate demand would rise. Similarly, if the money supply were reduced people would want to replenish their holdings of money by reducing their spending.

40|$|This is {{a comment}} {{on the work of}} Rocheteau and Wright (2005) who have {{recently}} introduced competitive search into monetary economics. We extend their work by eliminating the restriction that the fees market makers charge to enter a submarket must be either non-negative or identical for buyers and sellers. Without this restriction, buyers pay a positive fee to enter the submarket they visit and nothing else when they meet a seller. Sellers are remunerated by the market makers from the entry fees collected from the buyers. This trading arrangement allows buyers to perfectly predict their expenses, so the opportunity cost of holding <b>idle</b> <b>money</b> balances is eliminated. competitive search, monetary search. ...|$|E

In recent years, new markets such as bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, Negotiable Certificates of Deposit and the external extension of the New York market into Euro-dollars have have been established. Despite the growth in some of these markets, however, the main markets in the U. S. remain those in Government securities and Federal funds. It is through these markets that <b>idle</b> <b>money</b> in the U. S. is mobilised and distributed across the country as a whole. In this context, full use is made of correspondent relationships and both the banks and the dealers attempt to tap every possible source of funds. The intensity of this search for new sources of money has had the effect of binding together much more closely the various parts of the financial mechanism and has made it much more sensitive to Federal Reserve action.   JEL: E 44, E 58 </p...|$|E
40|$|The dissension on the {{mechanism}} of determination of interest rate is always {{in the center of}} much confusion and many controversies of monetary economics. Keynes’s liquidity preference theory remains {{at the core of the}} center. This paper starts off with analyzing the inherent logic of liquidity preference theory and presents a new interpretation of the theory in a more logical and clear manner. The reinterpretation clearly indicates the necessity of introducing liquidity preference analysis into determination of interest rate, arguing that it is the liquidity preference analysis based on finance motive, rather than on transactions motive, that plays a more fundamental role in determining interest rate. The paper then points out a crucial and unsolved mistake in Keynes’s liquidity preference theory, i. e. interest rate is indeterminate, which is revealed by introducing finance motive into the theory. Further, the paper develops a logically consistent and integrated model of determination of interest rate on the basis of the liquidity preference analysis centered on finance motive. In this model, interest rate is not determined by the demand for and supply of money, but determined by the demand for and supply of <b>idle</b> <b>money.</b> Liquidity preference theory, Finance motive, IS-LM model, Determination of interest rate...|$|E
40|$|The Great Recession of 2007 – 2009 and the Great Depression of the 1930 s were {{triggered}} {{by the collapse of}} asset-price bubbles. However, preexisting structural imbalances in the US economy were the reason why the burst of speculative bubbles induced a general economic collapse. This article argues that the imbalance created by the combination of stagnant labor earnings and surging corporate profits not only played {{a leading role in the}} run-up to the downturns but also was chiefly responsible for the slow recoveries. On the one hand, the relative stagnation of labor income represented a key factor behind rising income inequality and a potential drag on consumption which was temporarily alleviated by credit expansion; hence, the rising household debt levels eventually became unsustainable. On the other hand, rising corporate profits created an overhang of <b>idle</b> <b>money,</b> eager to lend itself to speculative ventures, which played a key role in fueling the stock market bubble of the 1920 s and the housing bubble of the 2000 s. The article further argues that despite various superficial and deeper similarities between the circumstances surrounding the Great Recession and the Great Depression, some fundamental differences in the structure of the US economy then and now suggest vastly different future prospects for American capitalism...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to acquire}} {{adequate}} revenues to administer {{public education in}} the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presents a multitude of problems that are far from resolved. The ability to invest <b>idle</b> <b>money</b> for maximum efficiency can improve revenues without adding to the tax burden. The years 1980 and 1981 have seen unprecedented fluctuations in interest rates. In any investment climate, assessment methods for investing are important, but in the current money market their importance is greatly amplified. This research study develops and tests an efficiency ratio {{that can be used}} to measure effectiveness of investment practices by Pennsylvania school districts. Although there has been research concerning investment efficiency, these studies have not resulted in any consistent body of knowledge that has practical application. ^ The purpose of the research is to determine the relationship between balances available for investment, and interest earned on investment and to develop and test a ratio. Financial data from formal school district reports and a questionnaire were used to answer the following questions: (1) What is the relationship between the amount of principal invested and effectiveness as measured by the ratio? (2) What is the relationship between interest on selected investments and effectiveness as measured by the ratio? (3) What is the relationship between the length of time an investment is held and effectiveness as measured by the ratio?^ Simple regression was performed on the three independent variables of principal, rate and time with the dependent variable (the effectiveness ratio). The calculated effectiveness ratios had no significant differences by class, which implies use as a comparative tool among all districts. The ratio was sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates which is important for values as an assessment tool. There was no significant statistical relationship found between the ratio and the variables of rate and time. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{remember}} {{clearly the}} day I was offered my first credit card. It was in Berkeley, CA in 1985. I was walking on Sproul Plaza and I saw a booth manned by two students. They were giving out {{all kinds of}} swag, so I walked over {{to see what was}} to be had. T-shirts, I think. I asked them if I could get a credit card, sure that the answer had to be 2 ̆ 2 no. 2 ̆ 2 But the answer was an enthusiastic 2 ̆ 2 yes. 2 ̆ 2 I asked them if they understood that: a) I had no income beyond a tiny graduate student stipend; b) that I was carrying a debt from college that had been kindly 2 ̆ 2 deferred 2 ̆ 2; and c) that my long-term prospects, money-making wise, were poor (the market in early Russian history degrees not being very hot). They said they didn 2 ̆ 7 t know any of that, but it didn 2 ̆ 7 t matter. All I had to do was to fill out a form and the card would arrive in the mail. I declined. As Louis Hyman tells us in his excellent and important Debtor Nation: The History of America in Red Ink (Princeton UP, 2011), it wasn 2 ̆ 7 t always so. Before the 1920 s, most people could get no credit at all, least of all from a financial institution. But then, thanks to a confluence of odd interests, consumer credit expanded mightily. Companies that made expensive stuff (cars) and companies that handled large pools of <b>idle</b> <b>money</b> (banks) found, much to their surprise that if you lent ordinary folks large sums of money at moderate interest, they would pay it back. The producers and banks lent more; consumers borrowed and bought more; and, in turn, the producers and banks used higher profits to increase productivity, putting still more money in the pockets of consumers. And so the cycle continued, ultimately fostering the largest expansion in production and consumption the world had ever seen. Whether it will continue is a subject of some dispute today...|$|E
