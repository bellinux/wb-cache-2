50|$|Most nuclear {{reactors}} are hence operated in a prompt subcritical, <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> condition: the prompt neutrons alone {{are not sufficient}} to sustain a chain reaction, but the delayed neutrons make up the small difference required to keep the reaction going. This has effects on how reactors are controlled: when {{a small amount of}} control rod is slid into or out of the reactor core, the power level changes at first very rapidly due to prompt subcritical multiplication and then more gradually, following the exponential growth or decay curve of the <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> reaction. Furthermore, increases in reactor power can be performed at any desired rate simply by pulling out a sufficient length of control rod. However, without addition of a neutron poison or active neutron-absorber, decreases in fission rate are limited in speed, because even if the reactor is taken deeply subcritical to stop prompt fission neutron production, delayed neutrons are produced after ordinary beta decay of fission products already in place, and this decay-production of neutrons cannot be changed.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> experiment {{was performed in}} 1981 at Pacific Northwest Laboratory with a cylindrical tank of plutonium-uranium nitrate solution. During this experiment, various methods to determine the critical height were used, including (1) extrapolation of the usual plot of inverse count rate vs. height, which estimates the <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> height (DCH); (2) the inverse count rate vs. height divided by count rate, which corrects somewhat for the change in inherent source size as the height changes; (3) ratio of spectral densities vs. height, which extrapolates to DCH; (4) extrapolations of prompt neutron decay constant vs. height, which extrapolates to the prompt critical height (PCH); and (5) inverse kinetics rod drop (IKRD) methods, which measure {Delta}k/k{Beta} very accurately for a particular solution height.

Steady-state measurements were made with the AGN in various <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> configurations. These <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> configurations are defined by moving the coarse and fine control rods to unique positions in the core. These experiments also provided data for control rod integral and differential reactivity worth estimates. Thermal flux measurments taken radially in the glory hole region of the AGN reactor were also compiled for this work. A series of time-dependent experiments were performed {{in conjunction with the}} steady-state measurements that involved prompt jump measurements, operations at <b>delayed</b> <b>critical,</b> and prompt drop measurements. A total of 36 steady-state and 11 time-dependent configurations were compiled for this work. The EVENT (EVEn parity Neutron Transport) radiation transport code was chosen to analyze and verify the steady-state and time-dependent experimental configurations on the AGN. Complex AGN models were developed to test the EVENT code and the case-dependent multigroup cross- sections. The neutron cross-section libraries used are based on the ENDF/B- VII. 1 library. The AGN EVENT model results compared well to the steady-state and time-dependent experimental configurations. The EVENT analysis for the AGN <b>delayed</b> <b>critical</b> configurations resulted in an average computational bias of - 0. 0048 % for P 11 calculations and + 0. 0119 % for P 13 calculations utilizing 2 -group neutron cross sections. The AGN EVENT thermal flux calculations also compare well to the experimental data, although the magnitude of the maximum thermal and total flux results calculated by EVENT are somewhat greater than expected. The EVENT transient calculation results using the diffusion theory approximation (P 1) and 2 -group cross sections compare well with the 11 AGN time-dependent experimental configurations. Rod drop configurations with EVENT indicate six-group Keepin and Brady data are consistent with the AGN experimental data. The EVENT radiation transport code has proven to be an excellent tool for AGN research reactor analysis. More experiments are recommended to provide additional data for more rigorous analyses using the EVENT code. It is recommended these analyses consider AGN geometric and material uncertainties to allow for more complex analyses to be peformed on the AGN research reactor.

The XIX- 2 assembly is a plutonium/natural uranium system comprised of plutonium/natural uranium core surrounded by a depleted uranium dioxide blanket (referred to as the soft blanket). The soft blanket is surrounded by an outer blanket comprised of depleted uranium dioxide blanket (referred to as the depleted blanket). Because the neutron lifetime in the soft and depleted blankets are significantly larger than the neutron lifetime in the core region, multiple decay modes were observed during this experiment. The first decay mode was measured with reasonable accuracy; however, because of the high intrinsic source strength produced by the large amounts of Pu- 240 contained in the core region, the intrinsic source background was reached very rapidly, thus precluding the second decay mode from being resolved well enough to estimate the average system lifetime.
