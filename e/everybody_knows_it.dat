500|$|In 2005, Doc Severinsen, Carson's bandleader {{starting}} in 1967, said the song {{worked so well}} because it was [...] "accessible. People could understand what it was, and it was associated with Johnny." [...] Larry King called it [...] "one of the most familiar themes in American television history." [...] Paul Anka said the song was played for {{only a short time}} each night, [...] "but <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> Simplicity is indeed royal." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{completed}} his medical in June, Chelsea announced on 1 July 2014 {{that they had}} agreed to meet the £32million buy-out clause in Costa's contract. On 15 July, Chelsea confirmed {{the completion of the}} signing of Costa, who signed a five-year contract on a salary of £150,000 a week.

Having played against Chelsea last season I know the high quality of the squad I am joining". Following the departure of former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, Costa inherited his number 19 shirt, the same number he wore at the 2014 World Cup for Spain and previously at Atlético.|$|E

60|$|The {{fight was}} really between Smith and Bagshaw, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> from the start.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody would <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> so {{that you}} need care about it. What would <b>it</b> matter if <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it?</b> We are not proposing {{anything}} improper;--are we, Mrs. Broughton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Peter. I'll {{tell you}} the story, because it will do you good to hear <b>it.</b> I {{supposed}} <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> All birds do. That is why we all look up to King Eagle," [...] replied Sammy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you be a}} fool, Kla'uns, {{and leave}} it there! You have done your work of fighting--mighty good fighting, too,--and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> You've earned a change. Let others take your place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Says he's goin' down, sir," [...] the {{signaller}} replies. What {{the submarine}} had spelt out, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> was: [...] "Cannot approve of this extremely frightful weather. Am going to bye-bye." ...|$|E
60|$|BANNAL. There can be {{no doubt}} of that: <b>{{everybody}}</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> But Shaw doesnt write his plays as plays. All he wants to do is to insult everybody all round and set us talking about him.|$|E
5000|$|According to Page, [...] "Jerry Manfredi, Steve George {{and myself}} were writing {{all the music}} but it just didn't sound right. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> but it was left unspoken {{for a long time}} because of that {{lingering}} bond. With Charles and George everything went perfect for the first time. The potential was just staring us in the face".|$|R
60|$|The saises {{looked at}} each other gravely as they rubbed their ponies' legs. This was the time when long purses began to tell, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> Kittiwynk and the others came back, the sweat {{dripping}} over their hooves and their tails telling sad stories.|$|R
60|$|There was no doubt, of course, {{as to the}} cause. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> It {{was simply}} a {{question}} of men, and, as everybody said, one had only to compare the two men conducting the churches to see why one succeeded and the other failed.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. [rising restlessly] I cant. I keep fancying <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> and is sniggering about it. I'm {{at peace}} nowhere but here. It's a comfort {{to be with}} you. It's a torment to be with other people.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's lots {{of things}} can't be explained, sir," [...] was Tom Spink's answer. [...] "Who can explain the way the Finns plays tom-fool tricks with the weather? Yet <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> Why are we havin' a hard passage around the Horn, sir? I ask you that. Why, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{thought you}} were. And {{let me tell}} you, that when you've got a husband of your own, you won't find it so easy to keep {{everything}} straight. That's the worst of these lodgings; {{if there is any}} little thing, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> Don't they, Miss Spruce?" ...|$|E
50|$|He's {{got good}} style, too. Yeah, yeah, I {{used to see}} him when he was, like, eleven, twelve years-old—he lived in Lakeland and I lived in Fort Myers, like, three hours away. Yeah, I {{remember}} he killed <b>it,</b> and, ah, <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> too. He was, he was always great.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{shows the}} Arrowpoints' good sense, however, to {{have adopted the}} affair, after the fuss in the paper," [...] said Sir Hugo. [...] "And disowning your own child because of a mésalliance is {{something}} like disowning your one eye: <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it's</b> yours, {{and you have no}} other to make an appearance with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{have that}} quite in mind, {{but it will}} do. I'd prefer doing the brazen thing and having <b>everybody</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> to doing the furtive thing and being found out. Not that I'm asking {{to be invited to}} lunch," [...] she added, with a smile; [...] "but I'm sure you {{understand}} my position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I am sure it is,' resumed my mother; 'and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is. I profit {{so much by}} it myself, in many ways--at least I ought to--that {{no one can be}} more {{convinced}} of it than myself; and therefore I speak with great diffidence, my dear Jane, I assure you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Blacky the Crow is {{a shrewd}} fellow. He {{is one of}} the smartest and shrewdest of all the little people in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> And because of this, all his neighbors {{have a great deal of}} respect for him, despite his mischievous ways.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naw!" [...] replied Judkins, scornfully. [...] "Jane {{turned his}} head. He's mad in love over her--follers {{her like a}} dog. He ain't no more Lassiter! He's lost his nerve, he doesn't look like the same feller. It's village talk. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> He hasn't thrown a gun, an' he won't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, now, {{his case}} is curious! There wasn't {{a human being}} in this town but knew that that boy was a perfect chucklehead; perfect dummy; just a stupid ass, as you may say. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>everybody</b> said it. Well, if that very boy isn't the first lawyer in the State of Missouri to-day, I'm a Democrat!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{narrow street}} {{with the single}} boardwalk was crowded with people, some well dressed {{and others in the}} roughest of costumes. There was loud talking and jesting, and most of the {{pedestrians}} seemed to be in good humor, although occasionally they would pass a group evidently out of luck and willing to let <b>everybody</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Both were swaggering {{around as}} if they had plenty of money and wanted <b>everybody</b> to <b>know</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm no knocker," [...] {{said that}} lady, [...] "and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> So, when I say that Clarice falls down every time in that scene I'm judging her art and not herself. She was great in it once. She does it {{something}} fierce now. It'll dope the show if she keeps it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, you two," [...] Wild Water {{said in a}} {{burst of}} confidence. [...] "I'll be {{perfectly}} honest with you, an' don't let it go any further. You know Miss Arral an' I was engaged. Well, she's broken everything off. You know it. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> It's for her I want them eggs." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that was}} needed to {{rehabilitate}} it was the discovery that the glove fight is a more trying and dangerous form of contest than the old knuckle fight. Nobody knew that then: <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> or ought to know it, now. And, accordingly, pugilism is more prosperous to-day {{than it has ever}} been before.|$|E
50|$|On the {{two faces}} of the cards, there is the {{illustration}} of a simple villager. So, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>it's</b> a simple villager.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe in}} {{shielding}} him," [...] cried {{one man who}} had chased Davenport and who wore several soldier's medals on his vest. [...] "He's a swindler, and <b>it's</b> best <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> He was {{on the point of}} lighting out for parts unknown with all the money that was put into his oil wells up on the Spell ranch." ...|$|R
6000|$|She went on: [...] "No, I don't {{blame you}} or any one for {{avoiding}} me. But I {{wish they would}} let me {{have one or two}} friends. But they won't. Lots of people like me at first, but they surely find out after a while, and then they change towards me. Sometimes I think I might as well publish my name as a medium and let <b>everybody</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{dialogue}} goes on {{for some}} time. Mrs. Harding keeps shaking her head and saying that Sir John must not go to Kafoonistan, and Sir John says she must not go to Balla Walla. He protests {{that he wants to}} work and she claims that she wants to try to think clearly. But it is all a bluff. They are not going. Neither of them. And <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> Presently Mrs. Harding says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{there is}} no mistake. Of course you wish to hide the truth, and smooth matters over, but it won't go with me, nor with Professor Blackie, either," [...] stormed Professor Sharp. [...] "We know what we see and what we smell. You young fellows are a disgrace to Brill, and the sooner <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> the better. Now, then, march to the roadway, every one of you, and no more back talk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{delivered}} {{her sentence}} quickly. [...] "She loves Ben. Haven't you seen it? She has loved him {{from their first}} meeting. I have known {{it for a long}} time, almost from the first; now <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it,</b> and the society reporters are beginning their innuendoes. The next thing will be her picture in the sensational press, and a scandal. Don't you know this? It must not happen! We must make way for them--you and I. We cumber the path." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] replied Fisher, with a sigh; [...] "the plain truth is, of course, that it's a bad {{business}}. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it's</b> a bad business who <b>knows</b> {{anything about}} <b>it.</b> But it's always happening, {{and in one}} way one can hardly blame them. They get stuck on to a foreign princess that's as stiff as a Dutch doll, and they have their fling. In this case {{it was a pretty}} big fling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry, dear," [...] said Cecily, {{who always}} poured balm. [...] "If you can't collect any money <b>everybody</b> will <b>know</b> <b>it</b> isn't your fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the king}} {{might have gone}} on, still happy and unsuspecting, {{to the end of}} his days, but for one of your modern {{improvements}} --the stock-board. When you left, three miles of the London, Canterbury and Dover were ready for the rails, and also ready and ripe for manipulation in the stock-market. It was wildcat, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> The stock was for sale at a give-away. What does Sir Launcelot do, but--" ...|$|R
