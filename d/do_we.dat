5|$|Despite the splendidly sized new {{building}} (albeit a plain one), the church declined in {{status as the}} college gradually died. It {{is possible that the}} community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> know whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Dilling co-founded the Paul Reveres, an anti-communist {{organization}} with headquarters in Chicago which eventually had 200 local chapters. She left in 1934, after {{a dispute with}} the co-founder Col. Edwin Marshall Hadley, and it folded soon after {{due to lack of}} interest. With McCord's encouragement, her lectures were published in a local Wilmette newspaper in 1932, and then collected in a pamphlet entitled Red Revolution: <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> Want It Here? Dilling claimed that the DAR printed and distributed thousands of copies.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> not?

We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we <b>do,</b> <b>we</b> also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

The plot follows the fictional {{story of a}} photographer as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world.
