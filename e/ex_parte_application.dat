At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the former raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this manner, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and diminishings of the stature, as baffled every conjecture that might be made as to his dimensions. If to this be added the fact that, in consequence of the <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> of the spur, one side of the mare appeared to journey faster than the other; and that the aggrieved flank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy tail, we finish the picture of both horse and man.|$|E

50|$|An <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> or {{unilateral}} <b>application</b> is {{an application}} {{in which the}} applicant is the only party before the court. As a rule, in fact, when only one person is before the court as a litigant, the application procedure is always appropriate, as {{the possibility of a}} dispute of fact does not exist.|$|R
2500|$|The Court then {{considered}} {{a line of}} English cases where the application was dismissed {{for a lack of}} standing. In R. v. Legal Aid Board, <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> Hardiman, an <b>application</b> was dismissed after leave was granted due to a change of factual circumstances. The Court held that the principal relief sought would have been [...] "entirely a purposeless exercise" [...] for the applicant. Furthermore, in R. v. Head Teacher of Fairfield Primary School, <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> W, the action was denied as there would be [...] "no practical benefit" [...] to the applicant.|$|R
50|$|The other use means 'on the {{application}} of' {{when used in}} the case name where prerogative relief is sought, such as a writ of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus. Thus for example the case name in the Boilermakers' case is R v Kirby; <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> Boilermakers' Society of Australia as the case concerned a writ of prohibition that was sought against Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner, who were judges of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, on {{the application}} of the Boilermakers Society of Australia. While the case name is 'ex parte' it was not heard {{in the absence of a}} party, with the judges being represented by D I Menzies QC who also represented the Commonwealth Attorney-General. Similarly the case of Re Wakim; <b>Ex</b> <b>parte</b> McNally concerned <b>application</b> of McNally for a writ of prohibition in relation to proceedings in the Federal Court that were commenced by Wakim. Both McNally and Wakim appeared in the High Court. There was however no appearance for the first respondents in the bankruptcy cases, the judges of the Federal Court.|$|R

50|$|Gagnon also {{filed an}} <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> {{requesting}} a continuance {{to obtain the}} backup tapes of AMS's computers because they might contain email evidence establishing AMS's allegedly unlawful solicitation of Gagnon’s employees, and would help establish {{the location of the}} source code at all relevant times. However, this request was denied for several reasons. First, the district court had already determined that the non-competition clause in Gagnon's employment agreements was unenforceable under California law, any evidence showing solicitation was irrelevant. Second, since Gagnon had already acknowledged that the source code was located on AMS's computers, providing conclusive evidence proving the location of the source code was unnecessary. Finally, the <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> was untimely because Gagnon did not submit it until after the motion for summary judgment was fully briefed by both parties, and the district court declared the case submitted.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with the audi alteram partem principle, and as a general rule, justice and fairness demand that the court should not make an order against any person unless the affected person has received proper notice of the legal relief sought. The <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> represents a departure from this rule. The courts will examine such an application very carefully, that the interests of affected persons may be properly safeguarded.|$|E

5000|$|The {{applicant}} is {{obliged to}} observe the utmost good faith in placing all material facts before the court. If the court makes an order pursuant to an <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application,</b> and it subsequently emerges that material facts, which might have influenced {{the decision of the}} court, were not disclosed, the court has the discretion to set the order aside on the grounds of non-disclosure. This applies irrespective of whether the failure to disclose was mala fide or negligent.|$|E
5000|$|State courts vary {{in their}} use of ex parte {{proceedings}} (for example, in custody cases, replevin cases and other civil matters), though most have it in one form or another. For example, in the States of California and Illinois, ex parte proceedings are available if notice is given before 10 a.m. the previous court day, or even shorter upon showing of emergency need. [...] As most courts in these two states hold law and motion hearings in the early morning, this notice is typically confirmed by facsimile although oral notice may be effective. Some courts in California have procedures to allow opponents to appear telephonically, while other courts do not allow any oral argument and only consider written papers. In California, party who files an <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> must file a declaration showing compliance with these requirements, and no relief may be granted absent such declaration. In addition to the notice requirements, an <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> must contain an affirmative actual showing in a declaration based on personal knowledge of [...] "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte".|$|E

Under the section 487.055(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, the Crown applied for an <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>application</b> for the DNA sample. Rodgers challenged the application on the basis that the enabling Code provision violated the rights within Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E

The order, referred to as an Anton Piller order by counsel, was granted by the High Court. The order provided for the removal of goods by the sheriff and the handing over of those goods to the appellant.

5000|$|The {{test for}} whether leave should be granted to an {{applicant}} was {{expressed by the}} High Court in Lai Swee Lin Linda v.

50|$|The {{removal of}} and {{amendments}} to a restrictive condition {{can occur in}} a number of different ways, most broadly by court application and by statute.

As the Supreme Court's description of nineteenth century practice in Ex parte Milligan shows, however, such proceedings were not ex parte in any significant sense.
