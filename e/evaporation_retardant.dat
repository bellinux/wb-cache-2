Results with the Du Pont “aca ” and Technicon continuous-flow systems were compared to the ABA- 100 in terms of upper limits of linearity, inter-run coefficient of variation, and results for samples from patients. The upper limits of linearity for the methods on the ABA- 1 00 exceeded all of those for the continuous-flow systems, except for urea nitro-gen. Precision of the ABA- 100 was as good as or better than that of the aca for all determinations, except for glucose in a normal control serum and creatine kinase and creatinine in an above-normal control serum.

40|$|Clean {{fresh water}} is the most {{precious}} natural resource available to mankind. People must have water for personal, municipal, industrial and recreational use. At the present time, most of the available fresh water in the United States is used {{in some way or}} another, treated and returned to streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs for reuse. Terrain, geographic location, climate and economics dictate that most of our usable fresh water be retained in lakes and reservoirs. This type of water storage allows for the greatest loss of water by evaporation. The increasing demand for municipal, industrial and recreational fresh water has set in motion a vast impoundment program in the United States that will accelerate water evaporation control measures in the immediate future. According to Smerdon,l water loss by evaporation in the United States actually exceeds by over 1 O times the total amount of water needed for municipal and Industrial usage. In the United States alone, five billion acre-feet of water falls as precipitation each year. Of this amount over 3. 5 billion gallons of water is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation or transpiration. Americans are now consuming 355 billion gallons of water per day and this amount is expected to increase to 6 OO billion gallons per day by 198 O. Home use of water represents less than 1 O% of the national consumption. Nearly half of the water is used for irrigation and the remaining 4 O% is used by industry. Water conservation is a necessity in arid states that have scant rainfall and high evaporation losses. Eaton 3 reported that approximately 11. 5 million acre-feet of water is lost due to evaporation each year in our eleven western states. Scientists and engineers have considered many physical and chemical methods in an attempt to reduce water evaporation losses from lakes and reservoirs. One OT the new and most promising techniques is the application of a thin chemical film {{on the surface of the}} water to retard evaporation. An array of evaporation reduction chemicals has been utilized on reservoirs and lakes in different manners by Mansfield, 4 Cruse and Harbeck, 5 Timblin, Florey and Garstha, 6 and Meinke and Waldrip 7 to suppress evaporation and conserve water. One of the most promising of the current <b>evaporation</b> <b>retardant</b> chemicals is a blend of hexadecanol and octadecanol (Durham and McArthur). 8 These longchain fatty alcohols form a monomolecular film on the water surface that is self-healing at wind speeds of up to eight miles per hour (Gilby and Heymann) 9 and is capable of reducing water evaporation by 30 to 50 % under ideal conditions. According to Ludzack and Ettinger, 10 and Chang, et al. 1 l the monolayer is biodegradable and can be assimilated by bacteria in the water as food. According to Wiltzius, 12 hexadecanol and octadecanol are nontoxic and do not present a health hazard in potable water. However, research indicates that monolayers change some of the physical and chemical characteristics in the treated aquatic environments. A monolayer will calm the water surface and form a slight diffusion barrier to the transfer of gases into and out of the water environment. The film will also decrease the surface tension of the water surface by 50 % or more from a normal 60 to 72 dynes per centimeter to less than 4 O dynes per centimeter. Furthermore, the film causes a slight temperature increase in the water immediately below the film. All of these factors may significantly affect the ecology of ponds, lakes and reservoirs. While field studies have shown hexadecanol and octadecanol films to be successful in suppressing water evaporation, the ecological studies of such treated water have not been adequate. A comparative evaluation of the biologic effects due to complete coverage of water by an <b>evaporation</b> <b>retardant</b> monolayer has not been possible under field conditions. The day-to-day environmental conditions of rapid temperature changes, wind, dust, rain, light fluctuations and other unpredictable factors do not allow a realistic evaluation of the ecological changes that may be caused by a continuous water-saving film. The small laboratory ecosystem has long been a fundamental tool in the development of comparative ecology. These systems have also been called microcosms by Odum and Hoskins 13 and laboratory microecosystems by Beyers. These small ecosystems may be used to study changes in water quality and population characteristics under controlled conditions obtained only in the laboratory. With the microcosm, one does not experience the complexity, environmental variation, difficulty of replication, and handicap of sheer size presented by natural ecosystems. However, unnatural environmental conditions must be recognized when small laboratory ecosystems are used. Laboratory studies in experimental microcosms can not duplicate the complex ecosystem present in lakes and reservoirs. An intensive literature survey has revealed no prior attempt to evaluate the ecological impact of a continuously applied evaporation reduction film on a laboratory experimental microcosm. The objectives of this research have been to evaluate, under laboratory controlled conditions, the ecological changes caused by the continuous application of a hexadecanol and octadecanol evaporation-suppression film on experimental ecosystems.

40|$|The tear film {{lining the}} ocular surface {{consists}} of three qualitatively different layers. The hydrated (i) mucous matrix, which is composed of the epithelial glycocalyx and secreted gel-like mucins, continues as a concentration gradient into the overlaying protein-rich (ii) aqueous layer, which is {{largely responsible for the}} hydration, nutrition, and host defence of the ocular surface. Finally, the air-tear interface is lined with a thin (iii) tear film lipid layer (TFLL), which is considered to stabilise the entire tear film and is thought to retard evaporation from the air-tear interface. Meibum, an oily secretion produced by meibomian glands, is considered largely as the source of the TFLL lipids. The integrity of the tear film is vital for the ocular surface, and disturbances in any of the aforementioned sections typically result in dry eye symptoms. Despite the extremely low evaporation rates measured from the ocular surface in vivo, no evaporation-retarding mechanism of TFLL has been shown in vitro. Altogether, due to the co-operative character of lipids, the function and behaviour of the TFLL and similar lipid layers are largely defined by their lipid composition. To understand the behaviour of complex lipid layers on the molecular level, the composition of the layer should be determined. Therefore, the first aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the lipid composition of tear fluid. Because most of the lipids are considered to be located in the TFLL, the aim was to create TFLL-like lipid compositions for in vitro experiments. Finally, the aim was to investigate the evaporation-retarding effect of such lipid layers to better understand the potential mechanism of <b>evaporation</b> <b>retardant</b> in vivo TFLL. A modern mass-spectrometric platform, namely ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, was employed for the tear fluid lipid analysis. In contrast to the widely recognised meibum lipid composition, the tear fluid samples contained a considerable amount of phospholipids. Unfortunately, most of the non-polar lipids, such as the cholesteryl esters and the wax esters typically present in meibum, could not be detected using this mass spectrometric platform; however, they were detected with enzymatic assays and thin layer chromatography. In addition, we demonstrated that the phospholipids function as a spreading aid facilitating the uniform spreading of the hydrophobic non-polar lipids at the air-water interface. Based on the tear fluid lipid composition, we created TFLL-like lipid compositions and investigated their ability to retard evaporation from the air-water interface in vitro. A custom-built system was assembled for evaporation rate determination, and Brewster angle microscopy was employed to observe the interfacial organisation of the lipid layer at the air-water interface. It was found that very specific lipids and very definite lipid compositions are needed to retard evaporation from the air-water interface. None of the complex TFLL-like lipid compositions retarded evaporation. However, a specific class of TFLL lipids, namely wax esters (WEs), were shown to be efficient evaporation retardants, but layers composed of WEs mixed with large proportions of other TFLL lipids did not retard evaporation. WEs, however, did not retard evaporation under all conditions, but only in a defined phase of the layer. This phase and therefore the evaporation-retarding effect was dependent on the melting point of the specific WE and the temperature of the air-water interface. The WEs that were close to their bulk melting temperature retarded evaporation, whereas the WEs in their solid or liquid states lacked this property. In their solid state, the WEs did not spread as a uniform layer at the air-water interface, whereas in their liquid state, the WEs formed very fluid layers, and therefore, the water molecules diffused through the loosely packed lipid layer. We also investigated the surface-active properties of WEs and noted that WEs are expectedly poor surfactants compared to phospholipids; they are extremely prone to aggregation and are poorly compressible, especially when the layer is in the evaporation-retarding phase. These results support the theory suggested in our lipid composition study: hydrophobic lipids need to be mixed with a certain amount of amphiphilic lipids to form rapidly spreading films at the air-water interface. In summary, this thesis project concentrated on providing an in vitro model for linking certain functions, properties, and behaviours of TFLL to the composition of such layers. In short, amphiphilic phospholipids seem to be a vital component of the TFLL, although possibly in a smaller proportion than originally hypothesised, providing aid for non-polar lipid spreading. The evaporation-retarding effect is largely dependent on the composition. Pure WEs turned out to be effective evaporation-retarding TFLL lipids, but only in a certain temperature-dependent phase. Therefore, WEs are most likely the lipids that provide the evaporation-retarding effect of the TFLL; however, such complex evaporation-retarding lipid composition is yet to be determined in vitro. The results of this thesis suggest that the compositional changes affect the behaviour, such as spreading and the evaporation-retarding effect, of TFLL. Defects in such properties may result in accelerated evaporation from the ocular surface and, consequently, in dry eye symptoms. Kyynelneste muodostaa silmän pinnalle vain mikrometrien paksuisen kalvon. Sen päätehtäviä on kosteuttaa ja ravita silmän pintaa sekä suojata silmää fyysisesti ja biokemiallisesti. Yhtenäinen kalvo takaa myös valon esteettömän pääsyn silmään. Kyynelnestekalvon pinnalla olevan vain kymmenien nanometrien paksuisen rasva- eli lipidikalvon rakenne ja toiminta tunnetaan yhä huonosti. Nykykäsityksen mukaan lipidikalvo alentaa kyynelnestekalvon pintajännitystä ja hidastaa ohuille nestekalvoille tyypillistä repeämistä. Kyynelnestekalvolta mitattujen haihtumisnopeuksien perusteella sen on ajateltu myös hidastavan kyynelnesteen haihtumista silmän pinnalta. Kuivan silmän syndrooma on yksi tyypillisimmistä syistä hakeutua silmälääkärin vastaanotolle. Oireita ovat ärsytys, vetistys, hiekantunne ja polttava tai pistävä tunne silmän pinnalla. Vaikeimmissa tapauksissa potilaat ovat alttiita silmien tulehduksille, haavaumille ja pysyvälle arpeutumiselle. Kuiva silmä voi aiheutua monesta syystä; yksi mahdollisista syistä on lipidikalvon alentunut kyky hidastaa haihtumista. Tämä johtuu mahdollisesti lipidikalvon muodostavien rasva-aineiden normaalista poikkeavasta erityksestä silmäluomien alapinnalla sijaitsevissa Meibomin rauhasissa. Lipidikalvon ominaisuuksien laajempi tuntemus voi auttaa paremmin ymmärtämään kuivasilmäisyyden syitä ja voi siten mahdollistaa uusien hoitomuotojen kehittämisen. Tässä tutkimuksessa perehdyttiin kyynelnestekalvon rasvakoostumukseen tutkimalla silmän pinnalta kerättyjä kyynelnestenäytteitä ensisijaisesti nestekromatografia massaspektrometrisesti. Koostumuksen perusteella saatiin selville, että lipidikalvo sisältää merkittävän osan fosfolipidejä jo aiemmin löydettyjen kolesteryyliesterien, vahaesterien ja triglyseridien lisäksi. Tutkimuksemme perusteella fosfolipidit ovat todennäköisesti ratkaiseva rasva-aine tasaisesti levittäytyvän ja siten toimivan lipidikalvon muodostumisessa. Rasvakoostumuksen perusteella tutkittiin laboratoriotekniikoin kyynelnesteen lipidikalvoa muistuttavien kalvojen kykyä estää haihtumista veden pinnalta. Kyseiset useasta rasvasta muodostuneet kalvot eivät yllättäen estäneet haihtumista merkittävästi. Toisaalta erään kyynelnesteessä esiintyvän yksittäisen rasva-aineen, vahaesterien, todettiin hidastavan haihtumista jopa yli 50 %, mutta vain silloin kuin yli 90 % lipidikalvosta muodostui vahaesteristä. Lisäksi vahaesterien haihtumisenestokyky oli jyrkästi riippuvainen lämpötilasta: vahaesterikalvot hidastivat haihtumista vain silloin kun lämpötila oli lähellä niiden sulamispistettä. Yhteenvetona voidaan päätellä, että fosfolipideillä on merkittävä vaikutus tasaisesti leviävän lipidikalvon muodostumiseen ja, että lipidikalvon haihtumisenestokyky on erittäin riippuvainen sen rasvakoostumuksesta. Vahaesterit ovat todennäköisesti merkittävin haihtumisenestokykyyn vaikuttava rasva-aine kyynelnesteen lipidikalvossa. Muiden rasva-aineiden osallisuus haihtumisen estämisessä on vielä epäselvä ja vaatii siten lisätutkimusta. Kyynelnesteen lipidikalvon oikeanlainen toiminta on erittäin riippuvainen sen koostumuksesta ja häiriöt kalvon rakenteessa saattavat johtaa kyynelnesteen liialliseen haihtumiseen ja mahdollisesti kuivan silmän oireisiin...|$|E

As the chemical is dispensed from the airplane. the fine particles drift with the wind and in some instances are carried onto the land areas surrounding the lakes.

50|$|When {{creating}} hydrophobic concrete {{through a}} coating process, a coating is sprayed or brushed onto a porous surfaces. In most cases, it {{is applied to}} a regular concrete slab that then undergoes a corrosive process to expose more of the concrete’s capillaries. This {{can be achieved by}} water blasting the surface at about 3,000-4,000 psi. Sandblasting and acid etching are also suitable processes. The addition of water is the next step. It can be applied either vertically or horizontally, but temperatures should not go below 33 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent freezing. Excessive evaporation should also be avoided. In areas with high evaporation rates, this process often takes place overnight when temperatures are cooler. Once the pores are saturated as much as possible with water, the coating is applied. Hydrophobic chemicals are in a powder form and mixed with water at a ratio of five parts powder to two parts water for application by brush. For spray application, the ratio is five parts powder to three parts water. The coating is applied between 1.25-1.5 lb per square yard and continues until the whole surface is covered. If the surface requires another coat, it must be applied within forty eight hours of the initial application of the hydrophobic mixture. Once applied, the concrete must cure in a moist environment two to three hours after the application. This is achieved by spraying the surface with water {{at least three times a}} day for a few days. <b>Evaporation</b> <b>retardants</b> are also ccasionally used. Depending on the climate, the curing process may take longer and require more frequent wetting. Once the concrete is cured, it sits for two to three weeks before the process is complete.|$|R
