50|$|DIRCM, or <b>Directional</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Countermeasures,</b> {{avoid this}} {{potential}} drawback by mounting the energy source on a movable turret (much like a FLIR turret). They only operate when cued by a missile warning system of a missile launch, {{and use the}} missile plume to accurately aim at the missile seeker. The modulated signal can then be directed at the seeker, and the modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat a variety of seekers. Countermeasure success depends on a threat's tracking techniques and requires a proper analysis of the missile's capabilities. Defeating advanced tracking systems requires {{a higher level of}} DIRCM power. Issues of Laser Safety are also taken into account.|$|R

50|$|A {{more modern}} {{laser-based}} technique removes the scanning and instead uses some {{other form of}} detection to identify the missile and aim the laser directly at it. This blinds the seeker continually, and is useful against even modern imaging seekers. These <b>directional</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (DIRCMs) are very effective, they are also very expensive and generally only suitable for aircraft that are not maneuvering, like cargo aircraft and helicopters. Their implementation is further complicated by placing filters {{in front of the}} imager to remove any off-frequency signals, requiring the laser to tune itself to the frequency of the seeker or sweep through a range. Some work has even been put into systems with enough power to optically damage the nose cone or filters within the missile, but this remains beyond {{the current state of the}} art.|$|R

25|$|Despite these concerns, the USAF {{decided to}} proceed with {{modernization}} of the current force. The Air Force stated it is to build 37 MC-130Js to replace its MC-130Es and MC-130Ps, {{both of which were}} 40 years old. Based on the KC-130J tanker operated by the United States Marine Corps, the new MC-130J has added features for both combat search and rescue and special operations missions, introducing major modifications to the Block 6.5 KC-130J. The MC-130J adds an Enhanced Service Life Wing, an Enhanced Cargo Handling System, a Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI) boom refueling receptacle, more powerful electrical generators, an electro-optical/infrared sensor, a combat systems officer (CSO) station on the flight deck, provisions for the Large Aircraft <b>Infrared</b> <b>Countermeasures</b> <b>System,</b> and armor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of shoulder-launched missile attacks against {{civilian}} passenger and cargo airliners in the early 2000s, various agencies investigated the feasibility of equipping countermeasures such as chaff and flares. Many commercial carriers found the estimated price of countermeasures to be too costly. However, the Israeli airline El-Al, having {{been the target of}} the failed 2002 airliner attack, in which shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles were fired at an airliner while taking off, began equipping its fleet with radar-based, automated flare release countermeasures from June 2004. This caused concerns in some European countries, regarding the possible fire hazard at civilian airports, resulting in banning such aircraft from landing at their airports. In 2007, Saab announced a new <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasure</b> <b>system</b> called CAMPS that does not use pyrotechnic flares, thereby directly addressing these concerns.|$|R
25|$|The AN/AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System (MWS) {{is used on}} {{slow moving}} {{aircraft}} such as helicopters and military transport aircraft to notify the pilot of threats and to trigger the aircraft's <b>countermeasures</b> <b>systems.</b> Its main users are the U.S Army, Navy and Air Force, but is also operated by other countries. Originally developed by Loral Space & Communications, it has been solely a product of ATK since 2002. The AN/AAR-47 passively detects missiles by their infrared signature, and uses algorithms to differentiate between incoming missiles and false alarms. Newer versions also have laser warning sensors and are capable of detecting {{a wider range of}} threats. After processing the nature of the threat, the system gives the pilot an audio and visual warning, and tells the direction of the incoming threat. It also sends a signal to the aircraft's <b>infrared</b> <b>countermeasures</b> <b>system,</b> which can then for example deploy flares. The development of the original AN/AAR-47(V)1 began in 1983 by Loral. ATK became a second production source in the mid 90s and eventually became the primary contractor. In 1998 ATK began production of the improved AN/AAR-47(V)2, which added laser warning functionality.|$|R
5|$|The C-130Js {{have been}} updated since {{entering}} service. All {{of the aircraft}} were fitted with radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft <b>Infrared</b> <b>Countermeasures</b> <b>systems</b> by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|R

500|$|The RAAF's Globemasters have {{supported}} Australian military deployments worldwide. The Air Mobility Control Centre manages the tasking of the Globemasters, {{and tries to}} allocate them to missions {{for which they are}} the most cost-effective option. As of September 2008, No. 36 Squadron was conducting fortnightly flights to transport supplies from Australia to bases in the Middle East; at this time the supplies were moved into the combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan using C-130 transports. Direct C-17 flights into the major Australian base at Tarin Kot in Afghanistan began in July 2009. As No. 36 Squadron's structure does not enable it to permanently station Globemasters in the Middle East, the usual practice has been for one of the types to carry a load of cargo from Australia and then conduct missions in the region for several days before returning to Amberley. In a speech delivered in early 2013, Smith stated that during the previous year the Globemasters had supported operations in the Middle East by flying [...] "60 missions, about 330 hours of flight time, during which the C-17As moved 190 vehicles, 1,800 passengers and over 3,600 tonnes of cargo and conducted 20 aeromedical evacuations". In late 2013 a detachment of two Globemasters, three aircrews and many other personnel from No. 36 Squadron was established at Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. This detachment {{was the first time that}} Australian C-17s had been deployed away from Amberley for more than two weeks and was established to transport ADF equipment out of Afghanistan as part of the reduction of the Australian force in the country. Overall, around 100 Globemaster sorties were conducted to fly equipment out of Tarin Kot between November 2012 and the end of 2013.
