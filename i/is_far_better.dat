25|$|In response, the Republicans {{appealed to}} {{democratic}} principles. Samuel Smith of Maryland {{argued that the}} presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than having five, because {{it is possible to}} have the fifth best candidate become President otherwise. Also, designation itself would drastically cut down the number of elections that would reach the house, and the President is then {{much more likely to be}} the people’s choice. Another of Smith’s arguments was simply the election of 1800. William Cocke of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.|$|E

25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few inches of the top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than no bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E

[...] Another rapper, Common, has praised Chief Keef's contributions to rap, stating, [...] "I think Chief Keef brought something that nobody else was doing and he brought it raw. He brought it real. With that, I have to respect that as an artist that he has come and brought that." [...] Other rappers, such as Rhymefest and Lupe Fiasco, however, have been critical of Chief (see controversies section below).|$|E

The story was broken by The Sunday Mirror; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as [...] "secret", while writers for The Daily Mail claimed that the lessons were [...] "likely to upset fellow contestants", and were evidence that Smith was [...] "already being groomed for stardom". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but {{she and her family}} turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said [...] "We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, the big man, says your daughter is special, you listen."

Sify praised the performance of Mohanlal and the humour of Siddique and Soubin Saheer but criticized the script, saying, [...] "Loham is about a topical subject, but it is far from engaging".

2500|$|These {{lines are}} less scathing than the {{repetition}} of the anecdote of the Ephesian lady (from Juvenal) who would meet her lovers at her husband's tomb, the statement that women envy the greatness of Eve's sin, and that a prostitute <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than a wife, since she only damns the soul, while a wife will damn the soul and destroy all happiness. [...] The poem is a merging of many tropes that were well established attacks on womankind before Gould, and the poem is programmatic in that it takes up the pride, then inconstancy, then lust of women (exactly as its title dictates). [...] However, there is a remarkable amount of invention and specificity in each section, and those topoi he adapts from Classical and other poetry are always given a Restoration application. [...] The particular vehemence in these scourges, along with the relentless pacing of the critique, make the poem stand out in its age and as an epitome of misogyny.|$|E

In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable. Felt sad & lonely, thinking of the blessed happy past with dearest Albert, who always had wished to build here, in this favourite spot. I could not have lived again at Alt na Guithasach now, alone, & it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> to have built a totally new house, but the sad thought struck me, that it was the first widow's house, – not blessed by him."

2500|$|The movement's name {{is derived}} from the {{combination}} of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California Abstract Expressionist Jay Meuser, who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting Mare Nostrum, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." [...] Pollock's energetic [...] "action paintings", with their [...] "busy" [...] feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque Women series of Willem de Kooning's figurative paintings and the rectangles of color in Mark Rothko's Color Field paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.|$|E

2500|$|The last of McManaman's caps came in 2001 when Sven-Göran Eriksson {{utilised}} him for {{his first}} games in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, including a game back at Anfield against Finland – where McManaman set up David Beckham's winner– but then apparently {{left a message on}} McManaman's answering machine to inform him {{that he was not going}} to be in the final World Cup squad in early 2002. Despite the pleas of McManaman's Real Madrid team mates Zidane and Fernando Hierro for McManaman's case, McManaman said he never ever heard from or met Eriksson again. Zidane went on to state England had made a mistake, and described McManaman with a rare passion as one of the highest quality players he ever played with: [...] "I was surprised when McManaman was left out of the last England squad. I couldn't believe they would ignore a player of his quality. Now people are talking about the fact that maybe he will get his chance because David Beckham is injured. But McManaman <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>better</b> than just being a replacement for Beckham. McManaman should be in the starting line-up anyway." [...] Support for McManaman also came before the 2002 World Cup in the British media, after Sky Sports published an article based on OPTA statistics, revealing that despite a poor goalscoring record, McManaman had in fact an 88% dribbling completion rate (having embarked on a run every 17 minutes), and an 84% pass completion rate, all three of which were higher by over 15% than any English midfield Premiership player at the time.|$|E
