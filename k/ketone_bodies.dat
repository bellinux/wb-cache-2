5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies),</b> were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study is}} the first {{comparative}} investigation of hepatic blood flow and oxygen metabolism during normothermic and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary bypass operations were randomly divided into 2 groups according to their perfusion temperatures, either normothermia (36 °C) or hypothermia (30 °C). The clearance of indocyanine green was measured at 3 points. Arterial and hepatic venous <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> ratios (an index of mitochondrial redox potential) and hepatic venous saturation were measured. Results: Hepatic blood flow in both groups was identical before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass (normothermia, 499 ± 111, 479 ± 139, and 563 ± 182 mL/min, respectively; hypothermia, 476 ± 156, 491 ± 147, and 560 ± 202 mL/min, respectively). The hepatic venous saturation levels were significantly lower during cardiopulmonary bypass in the normothermic group (normothermia, 41 % ± 13 %; hypothermia, 61 % ± 18 %; P 0. 7) until the second postoperative day. However, the reduction in arterial <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> ratio was less severe in the normothermic group. The difference in hepatic venous <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> ratios was more obvious, and the hepatic venous <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> ratios in the normothermic group were statistically superior {{to those of the}} hypothermic group throughout the course (P <. 05 -. 01). Conclusions: Normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass provides adequate liver perfusion and results in a better hepatic mitochondrial redox potential than hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Because arterial <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> ratios reflect hepatic energy potential, normothermia was considered to be physiologically more advantageous for hepatic function.

5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans can convert some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E
5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances.

5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and to confirm that the patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies).</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies.</b> The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether elevated plasma insulin or glucagon concentrations {{are capable of}} modifying hepatic ketogenesis independently of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations, <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> production was determined by [3 - 14 C]acetoacetate infusions in overnight-fasted normal subjects during exogenous supply of FFA (Intralipid and heparin infusion). When plasma FFA concentrations were elevated from 0. 73 +/- 0. 07 to 1. 53 +/- 0. 16 mmol/l during low insulin concentrations (approximately equal to 13 microU/ml) in group A (n = 7), total <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> production increased from 3. 6 +/- 0. 6 to 8. 2 +/- 1. 0 mumol. kg- 1. min- 1 (P less than 0. 001). When plasma FFA were similarly elevated during raised plasma insulin concentrations (approximately equal to 110 microU/ml) in group B (n = 5), total <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> production was only 3. 8 +/- 0. 8 mumol. kg- 1. min- 1 (P less than 0. 01 vs. group A).

5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that their children would tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E
25|$|After 2 or 3 days of fasting, {{the liver}} begins to {{synthesize}} <b>ketone</b> <b>bodies</b> from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown.

Physiological elevations of plasma glucagon concentration were produced by a constant infusion of hormone, and increased plasma-free fatty acid availability was produced by simultaneous heparin injection to induce intravascular lipolysis. In the five insulin-dependent subjects studied, when plasma glucagon concentration remained at the normal basal level of 72 +/- 14 pg/ml during control saline infusion, the heparin-induced increase in free fatty acid availability resulted in approximately a 20 % increase in plasma <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> concentration. In contrast, when plasma glucagon concentration was elevated by hormone infusion to the physiological level of 215 +/- 35 pg/ml, the heparin-induced increases in free fatty acid availability resulted in approximately an 80 % increase in plasma <b>ketone</b> <b>body</b> concentration.

Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta-oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway.

500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate {{diet that}} in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children.

There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective.
