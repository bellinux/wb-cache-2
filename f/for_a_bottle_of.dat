5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
25|$|After her husband's death, Laura Upthegrove {{lived under}} an assumed name in western Florida for a time. In {{the next two}} years, she was arrested on several {{occasions}} before eventually opening a gas station at Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee. She later {{moved in with her}} mother in Upthegrove Beach. On August 6, 1927, she died during an argument with a man trying to buy moonshine from her. In the heat of the moment, she swallowed a bottle of disinfectant and died within minutes. It is unclear whether it was an accident, as some claim she mistook it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> gin, but it was widely reported that she had committed suicide. She was 30 years old.|$|E
500|$|The works Banksy has {{included}} in Better Out Than In primarily consist of stencil graffiti, {{much of which}} are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned [...] "the street is in play", depicted a child reaching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> spray paint on a sign reading [...] "graffiti is a crime". The sign was stolen and later replaced by Queens-based graffiti group Smart Crew with a new sign that read [...] "street art is a crime". Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll-free 800 number.|$|E

500|$|The crowd became {{steadily}} younger over time. In the 1990s, {{when her}} parents still operated the bar, Barisich {{asked if she could}} sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, [...] "I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of a buck a bottle. My dad said that people would never pay that much <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell." [...] Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment.|$|E
500|$|One of the Silence calls Rory [...] "the man who {{dies and}} dies again", a {{reference}} to the many times he appears to die. The episode's main plot centres around the damage caused by River when she tries to re-write a fixed point in time. The concept of [...] "fixed points" [...] in history which may not be altered, even by the Doctor or his companions, was introduced in The Aztecs (1964) and was named and explored in the new series with episodes such as [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] and [...] "The Waters of Mars". When River meets Amy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> wine, she is wearing military fatigues and says that she [...] "just climbed out of the Byzanthium", and that she saw Amy there. This refers to events in [...] "Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] (the [...] "crash of the Byzanthium" [...] first being mentioned in [...] "Silence in the Library".) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} U2 have {{undertaken}} {{a number of}} side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song [...] "In a Lifetime" [...] with the Irish band Clannad. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film Captive in 1986, which included a vocal performance by Sinéad O'Connor that predates her own debut album by a year. Bono and the Edge wrote the song [...] "She's a Mystery to Me" [...] for Roy Orbison, which was featured on his 1989 album Mystery Girl. In 1990, Bono and the Edge provided the soundtrack to the Royal Shakespeare Company London stage adaptation of [...] (one track, [...] "Alex Descends into Hell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bottle</b> <b>of</b> Milk/Korova 1", was on the b-side to [...] "The Fly" [...] single). That same year, Mullen co-wrote and produced a song for the Republic of Ireland national football team {{in time for the}} 1990 FIFA World Cup called [...] "Put 'Em Under Pressure", which topped the Irish charts for 13 weeks.|$|E
50|$|The Adelphi Distillery was a Scotch whisky distillery, {{which was}} founded in 1826 in Glasgow and closed in 1907. The name was revived in 1993, <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{independent}} <b>bottler</b> <b>of</b> Scotch whisky.|$|R
50|$|Jayer made limited {{quantities}} {{of all of}} his wines (only about 3,500 <b>bottles</b> <b>a</b> year); today, you'll pay around $8,300 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> 2001 (his last vintage) Henri Jayer Vosne Romanée Cros Parantoux.|$|R
5000|$|In Caernarfon's heyday as a port-town, Northgate Street - {{on which}} the Black Boy Inn is {{situated}} - was {{the heart of the}} red-light district. Northgate Street's Welsh name Stryd Pedwar a Chwech translates to [...] "Four shillings and Six pence Street": what the sailors are reputed to have paid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> room, <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> gin, and the services of <b>a</b> woman <b>for</b> the night.|$|R
2500|$|... "Alex Descends into Hell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Bottle</b> <b>of</b> Milk / Korova 1" [...] - a music {{piece by}} Bono and the Edge, {{taken from the}} score for the Royal Shakespeare Company's {{production}} of [...] "A Clockwork Orange". This was {{the only part of}} the score which was officially released. The author of the original book, Anthony Burgess was reportedly very unsatisfied with the soundtrack. This song was also featured on the soundtrack to the movie Johnny Mnemonic.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, the FDA {{reported}} {{shortages of}} some, but not all, forms of doxycyline [...] "caused by increased demand and manufacturing issues". Companies involved included an unnamed major generics manufacturer that ceased production in February 2013, Teva (which ceased production in May 2013), Mylan, Actavis, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals. The shortage {{came at a}} particularly bad time, since there were also shortages of an alternative antibiotic, tetracycline, at the same time. The market price for doxycycline dramatically increased in the United States in 2013 and early 2014 (from $20 to over $1800 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> 500 tablets), before decreasing again.|$|E
2500|$|Faber {{published}} {{the book in}} 1936. Though reviews treated it as a major work of art, the book did not sell well. Barnes received no advance from Faber and the first royalty statement was for only £43; the U.S. edition published by Harcourt, Brace the following year fared no better. Barnes had published little journalism in the 1930s and was largely dependent on Peggy Guggenheim's financial support. She was constantly ill and drank more and more heavily—according to Guggenheim, she accounted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> whiskey a day. In February 1939 she checked into a hotel in London and attempted suicide. Guggenheim funded hospital visits and doctors, but finally lost patience and sent her back to New York. There she shared a single room with her mother, who coughed all night and who kept reading her passages from Mary Baker Eddy, having converted to Christian Science. In March 1940 her family sent her to a sanatorium in upstate New York to dry out. Furious, Barnes began to plan a biography of her family, writing to Emily Coleman that [...] "there is no reason any longer why I should feel for {{them in any way}} but hate." [...] This idea would eventually come to fruition in her play The Antiphon. After she returned to New York City, she quarreled bitterly with her mother and was thrown out on the street.|$|E

50|$|A beer pocket {{is a small}} pocket {{within a}} jacket or vest sized {{specifically}} <b>for</b> transporting <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> beer.

5000|$|The word [...] "Cheburashka" [...] is {{also used}} in a figurative sense to name objects that somehow {{resemble}} the creature (such as an An-72 aircraft which, when seen from the front, resembles the character's head) or are just as pleasing as it is (e.g. <b>a</b> colloquial name <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> lemonade - from the brand name [...] "Cheburashka").|$|R
5000|$|On December 5, 1985, Kip Forbes {{paid the}} highest price ever {{recorded}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> wine. Hardy Rodenstock put one of the 'recently discovered' [...] "Th. J." [...] (Thomas Jefferson) bottles up for auction at Christie's in London: <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> 1787 Château Lafite engraved [...] "1787 Lafitte Th. J.". The bottles {{had been found in}} a walled-up old cellar, and were engraved with vintage years from the late 18th century. This had in itself been <b>an</b> interesting find <b>for</b> <b>a</b> collector of old wines, but the bottles were also engraved with the initials [...] "Th. J.", which was taken as an indication that they had belonged to Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson was an active oenophile and wine collector, who spent much time in France in the 1780s and whose interest in wine is well documented. The auction catalogue simply listed the value as [...] "inestimable", and it was sold for 105,000 pound sterling, which as of 2007 still remains the worldwide auction record <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> wine. Christopher Forbes was bidding against Marvin Shanken of Wine Spectator Magazine, with Michael Broadbent handling the gavel at the auction.|$|R
60|$|I {{have nothing}} more to say of Arezzo, except that, finding the {{ordinary}} wine very bad, as black as ink, and tasting {{as if it had}} tar and vinegar in it, we called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> Monte Pulciano, and were exceedingly gladdened and mollified thereby.|$|E

60|$|She {{went off}} {{at this point}} into a {{rippling}} laugh, which, being infectious in its nature, also set her companion off, but {{the entrance of the}} landlord checked them both.

50|$|Set in the 1933, {{the film}} {{takes up the}} story of Grace and her father after burning the town of Dogville {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} film.
