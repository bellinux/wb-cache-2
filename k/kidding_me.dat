500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you <b>kidding</b> <b>me?</b> When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'"

500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of The Avengers. In the film Tony Stark {{experiences}} PTSD-like symptoms following the Battle of New York in The Avengers. Black explained, [...] "that's an anxiety response to feeling inferior to The Avengers, but also to being humbled by sights he cannot possibly begin to understand or reconcile with the realities he's used to... There's a line in the movie about 'ever since that big guy with the hammer fell out of the sky, the rules have changed'. That's what we're dealing with here." [...] Bruce Banner appears in a post-credits scene, with Ruffalo reprising the role. About the scene, Ruffalo said [...] "They were about to wrap the movie and I saw Robert [...] at the Academy Awards... and he said, 'What do you think about coming and doing a day?' I said, 'Are you <b>kidding</b> <b>me?</b> Bang, lets do it!' We sort of spitballed that scene, then I came in and we shot {{for a couple of hours}} and laughed." ...|$|E
500|$|Manning and the Colts {{introduced}} their now-signature no-huddle offense, {{and used}} it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks) the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a win over Buffalo, behind Manning's 421yards passing. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. However, the Colts lost the following week to New England, and continued their slide, losing their following two games. The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40–21 home loss to the 49ers. After Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in that game, coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous [...] "Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs. Are you <b>kidding</b> <b>me.</b> Playoffs? I'm just hoping we can win a game, another game" [...] press conference. Despite the 6–10 record, Manning finished the season with , , and 4 rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league. However, the defense allowed the most points and Jim Mora was fired after the season.|$|E

500|$|The {{first single}} off Blood Sugar Sex Magik was [...] "Give It Away", which reached {{number one on}} the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in late 1991. The band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] being as successful, but {{understood}} the potential commercial viability. Warner Bros. Records sent representatives to a Chili Peppers concert to determine which song should be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue and the entire audience began singing the song instead.

[...] "Under the Bridge" [...] became the album's second single in March 1992; upon release, journalist Jeff Apter noted that it [...] "was the bona fide, across-all-formats radio hit that the band had been working towards for seven years." [...] It spent twenty-six cumulative weeks on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number two, being one of the several songs stuck behind Kris Kross' 8-week reign of [...] "Jump". The single has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E
500|$|As they {{completed}} the song's demo, Tommy Mottola, CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Carey's fiancé, {{walked into the}} studio. After hearing the rough version of the song, on which they were still working on, he became interested in it, asking what project the song belonged to. Carey explained to him the concept and how the song {{would be used for}} the film Hero. Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song, responding, [...] "Are you <b>kidding</b> <b>me?</b> You can't give this song to this movie. This is too good. Mariah, you have to take this song. You have to do it." [...] Initially, Carey was guided by the subject of the film, but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it, altering some of the lyrics, key and instrumentation. After their decision to keep [...] "Hero," [...] Afanasieff went back to the staff at Epic and told them that they had failed {{to come up with a}} song for the soundtrack.

2500|$|Reggie Miller {{recalled}} his encounter with Larry Bird's legendary trash talking ability {{in his book}} I Love Being the Enemy.

To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you <b>kidding</b> <b>me?</b> It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flea {{has been}} very outspoken towards guns and gun violence, {{sometimes}} speaking about it during Chili Peppers shows. He often expresses his anger on his Twitter page.
