40|$|The {{cardinal}} {{objective of}} this research has been to investigate cross- culturally the performance of Egyptian and English children of age’s 5 to 15 on science conceptualization {{in the light of}} Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Two integrated empirical studies were administered to a total of 891 subjects from the two countries. The preliminary study assessed the preoperational children's (ages 5 to 11) understanding of the concepts of life and death. The 389 children who participated in this study of animism showed no evidence that animism is a spontaneous tendency of the preoperational child's mental structure universally demonstrated. Chi-square analysis revealed some small significant differences between Egyptians and English, and no significant differences between sexes. Kurskal-Wallis One-Way Anova indicated that there was a correlation^ between ages and correct responses. A sample of 502 subjects (270 Egyptians, 232 English) of ages 11, 13, and 15 participated in the second study of the development of science concepts in the concrete and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> children. Nonparametric statistical technique of Mann- Whitney U test was used to compute the data obtained. The results revealed that a small proportion of children attained the late concrete and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stages,</b> that the attainment of the stages was in correlation with age levels, that there was no definite age at which a child attained a specific developmental stage, that there were very slight variations between Egyptian and English children's attainment of the late formal stage, that there was a relationship between gender and the attainment of late formal operation stage, and that the educational system was a factor in the performance of the children on science concepts.

40|$|M. A. Jean Piaget (1896 - 1980) {{played a}} major role in laying the groundwork for many of our current beliefs about {{cognitive}} development. By examining children's answers to particular questions and how they reached those answers, Piaget concluded that children's thinking was qualitatively different from adults and that it had its own special logic. Piaget was concerned with explaining the universal aspects of cognitive development rather than individual differences between people. While specific beliefs and ideas of different cultures may vary, Piaget posited that the stages of cognitive development, namely, sensori-motor, preoperational, concrete <b>operational</b> and <b>formal</b> <b>operational,</b> unfold in the same sequence at roughly the same ages, irrespective of cultural and educational background. The new political changes in South Africa have transformed the education policies from the content-orientated, rote-learning based curriculum of the past, to a skills-based, interactive learning approach called OutcomesBased Education (OBE). OBE aims to move away from the old 'tabula rasa' education policy towards a dynamic learning system that involves learners at a critical level of intelligence. OBE presents itself as compatible with developments in cognitive psychology, particularly Piaget's theory of intellectual development. The aim of this study was to explore, on a theoretical level, whether OBE is a marked improvement on the old system, particularly with regard to cognitive development, or whether the old system is equivalent to or better than OBE as a facilitator of the development of the concrete <b>operational</b> and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stages.</b> As this was a literature survey, an extensive theoretical analysis on Piaget's theory as well as on the premises of OBE was done, in order to determine whether there are theoretical links between OBE and Piaget's theory. Theoretical links were found between OBE and Piaget's theory, hence the pertinent and salient aspects of both Piaget's theory and the premises of OBE were reformulated in terms of the following hypotheses for the next stage of the research: • Children exposed to OBE will show an accelerated cognitive development when compared to children who have not been exposed to OBE. • There is a relationship between OBE and cognitive development. These hypotheses will have to be followed up by an empirical study where the cognitive development of learners from an OBE system will have to be compared with the cognitive development of learners from a non-OBE system. The research design of such a study will have to be such that the proposed hypotheses could be tested...|$|R

The new political changes in South Africa have transformed the education policies from the content-orientated, rote-learning based curriculum of the past, to a skills-based, interactive learning approach called Outcomes-Based Education (OBE). OBE aims to move away from the old ¡¥tabula rasa¡¦ education policy towards a dynamic learning system that involves learners at a critical level of intelligence. OBE presents itself as compatible with developments in cognitive psychology, particularly Piaget¡¦s theory of intellectual development. With the recent change in curriculum, this research investigated whether children in South Africa have attained concrete and formal operations as OBE purports to encourage. The research takes a closer look at children¡¦s cognitive abilities as assessed by Piaget¡¦s theory of development. With reference to South African education ¡§as part of the far-reaching political, social and economic changes, aimed at an egalitarian and healthy society, the new political dispensation has replaced the previous education policy with a constructivist, Outcomes Based Educational approach. ¡¨ (Skuy et al, 1999, p. 3). This study was conducted on children from grades one through to grades five, at two primary schools. One of the schools implemented OBE „b 4 years ago (experimental group), whilst the other has not as yet implemented OBE (control group). The measuring instruments consisted of Piaget¡¦s cognitive tests for assessing the concrete and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stages.</b> Piaget¡¦s tests are designed to look for a particular type of understanding/reasoning that typifies a particular developmental stage (Bybee & Sund, 1982). The tests consisted of one-to-one interviews designed to evaluate concrete, transitional and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> patterns of thought. Due to the relatively small sample group (ten participants per group) and the fact that the data is ordinal, the analysis was carried out using non-parametric and descriptive statistics. Thus, the results of Piaget¡¦s tests were compared to OBE related marks and academic marks using Spearman¡¦s Correlation Coefficient for ranked data, in order to better understand the nature of the relationship between OBE and cognitive development. Since the data is categorical, i. e., categorised as concrete <b>operational</b> and <b>formal</b> <b>operational,</b> the results of each child in the OBE school were also compared to the results of each child in the non-OBE school using the Mann-Whitney-U test (Howell, 1995) in order to determine whether there is a difference between OBE-cognitive development and Non-OBE-cognitive development. The aim of this study was to establish whether O. B. E is indeed a better approach than other methods of teaching with reference to cognitive development. The conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that O. B.

50|$|Another {{approach}} to viewing {{the ways in}} which information is processed in humans was suggested by Jean Piaget in what is called the Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory (Presnell, 1999). Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2-6 years), concrete operational (6-11 years), and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last <b>stage</b> is the <b>formal</b> <b>operational,</b> in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments.|$|R
50|$|In Piaget’s {{model of}} {{intellectual}} development, {{the fourth and}} final stage is the <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage.</b> In the classic book “The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence” by Jean Piaget and Barbel Inhelder formal operational reasoning takes many forms, including propositional reasoning, deductive logic, separation and control of variables, combinatorial reasoning, and proportional reasoning. Robert Karplus, a science educator in the 1960s and 1970s, investigated all these forms of reasoning in adolescents & adults. Mr. Tall-Mr.Short {{was one of his}} studies.|$|E
5000|$|According to Alberts, Elkind, and Ginsberg the {{personal}} fable [...] "is the corollary to the imaginary audience. Thinking of {{himself or herself}} {{as the center of}} attention, the adolescent comes to believe that it is because he or she is special and unique". It is found during the <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> in Piagetian theory, along with the imaginary audience. Feelings of invulnerability are also common. The term [...] "personal fable" [...] was first coined by the psychologist David Elkind in his 1967 work Egocentrism in Adolescence.|$|E
50|$|The {{onset of}} {{adolescent}} egocentrism tends to occur at about age 11-13 {{which is considered}} early adolescence. Since an adolescent is thought to develop the <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> of thinking during this time, the personal fable phenomenon is thought to develop as well. There are studies that support this hypothesis, showing that it is during early adolescence that the personal fable is most prominent (this includes both the uniqueness and invulnerability aspects of personal fable). It {{has also been shown}} that both feelings of uniqueness and invulnerability increase significantly from age 11 to age 13.|$|E
5000|$|Elkind’s {{work with}} the {{personal}} fable stemmed from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which describes egocentrism {{as a lack of}} differentiation in a given area of subject-object interaction. According to Elkind, in conjunction with Piaget’s theory, adolescent egocentrism is to be understood in the context of ontogeny (referring to the development of an organism across its lifespan). These ontogenetic changes in egocentrism are thought to drive the development of logical and <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> thinking. Elkind described an operation as a “mental tool whose products, series, class hierarchies, conservations, etc., are not directly derived from experience.” However, a child in the concrete <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> is not able to differentiate between these mental constructs and reality (their experiences). For instance, a child in the concrete <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> may understand that a dog is an animal, but not all animals are dogs; however, the child is not able to grasp a hypothetical concept such as “suppose that dogs were humans”. The child is likely to respond “but dogs aren’t humans, they are animals.” ...|$|R

Some theorists believe the <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> can be divided into two sub-categories: early formal operational and late formal operation thought. Early formal operational thoughts may be just fantasies, but as adolescents advance to late formal operational thought the life experiences they have encountered changes those fantasy thoughts to realistic thoughts.|$|E
5000|$|Piaget's theory {{stops at}} the <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage,</b> but other {{researchers}} have observed the thinking of adults is more nuanced than formal operational thought. This fifth stage has been named post formal thought or operation. Post formal stages have been proposed. Michael Commons presented evidence for four post formal stages in the model of hierarchical complexity: systematic, meta-systematic, paradigmatic, and cross-paradigmatic (Commons & Richards, 2003, p. 206-208; Oliver, 2004, p. 31). There are many theorists, however, who have criticized [...] "post formal thinking," [...] because the concept lacks both theoretical and empirical verification. The term [...] "integrative thinking" [...] has been suggested for use instead.|$|E
5000|$|Adolescents {{also are}} {{changing}} cognitively {{by the way}} that they think about social matters. [...] Adolescent egocentrism governs the way that adolescents think about social matters, and is the heightened self-consciousness in them as they are, which is reflected in their sense of personal uniqueness and invincibility. Adolescent egocentrism can be dissected into two types of social thinking, imaginary audience that involves attention-getting behavior, and personal fable, which involves an adolescent's sense of personal uniqueness and invincibility. These two types of social thinking begin to affect a child's egocentrism in the concrete stage. However, it carries over to the <b>formal</b> <b>operational</b> <b>stage</b> when they are then faced with abstract thought and fully logical thinking.|$|E
