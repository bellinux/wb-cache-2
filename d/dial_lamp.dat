50|$|Many design tricks {{were used}} to reduce {{production}} costs of the five-tube radio. The heaters of all the vacuum tubes had to be rated {{to use the same}} current, so they could be operated in series from line voltage. The rectifier and audio output tube required more heater power, so dropped a larger voltage than the other tubes. In many designs the rectifier tube had a tap on the heater to power a dial light. The plate current was routed through that portion of the rectifier heater, in order {{to make up for the}} current diverted to the <b>dial</b> <b>lamp.</b> If the <b>dial</b> <b>lamp</b> failed, that part of the rectifier heater would have a larger current which could burn out the tube in a few months. Early radios had a resistor network to minimize the problem but this was soon eliminated as the cost of replacing the tube was not the manufacturer's problem. As with Christmas tree lights, if one tube heater failed, none of the tube heaters would operate.|$|E
50|$|Though four wires are {{typically}} used in U.S. phone cabling, only two {{are necessary for}} telecommunication. In the event that a second line is needed, {{the other two are}} used. They are also sometimes used to provide power for telephone <b>dial</b> <b>lamps</b> (6 volts AC, as in the Princess phone), or other features.|$|R
50|$|Nissan-Datsun New Zealand had the four-door manual sedans {{assembled}} locally from 1968, replacing {{two generations}} of Bluebirds (the name continued on 1600s sold in Japan) with the new 1600 export badge. Local content was about 40% and included glass, wiring, batteries, radiators, carpet and interior trim. Locally made radios were a dealer-fit accessory. The cars were built under contract at Campbell Motor Industries in Thames; the preceding Bluebird had been built at NZ Motor Bodies in Auckland. The 1968 1600s/510s had 'clap-hand' wipers that parked in {{the centre of the}} windscreen and a rectangular speedometer; wipers soon were changed to a parallel action that cleared more glass, reversible for LHD versions. The 1970 facelift brought a new safety-style dashboard with recessed round <b>dials,</b> larger tail <b>lamps</b> with additional chrome trim in the lens and detail changes to the grille. Automatic versions were a special import, built up, and only if (limited) import license was available, and a few 'SSS' sedans were also imported fully assembled. The 1600, popular for modification and racing, not least due to its independent rear suspension (when contemporary rivals like the Ford Cortina and Toyota Corona had live, leaf-sprung rear axles), was replaced by the 180B in 1972 and was sought after used for many years afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In the Trimline version {{designed}} for connection to an RJ11 telephone jack, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry very low voltage AC or DC power. While {{the phone line}} itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the phone line could supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near one telephone jack, wired to supply power to just that telephone (or {{to all of the}} jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices). It is now usually recommended that only the one local jack used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that might be using pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow pair) in jacks {{in other parts of the}} house. The early Trimline and Princess phone <b>dial</b> light incandescent <b>lamps</b> were rated at 6.3 Volts, 0.25 Amp and the transformer output is approximately 6-8 Volts AC. Later Trimline versions had LED light sources, powered directly from the phone line, and the last Western Electric-made Princess version had no dial light.|$|R
