40|$|Resistance (R) {{genes and}} the {{proteins}} they encode are {{key components of}} the defense system of plants. The exploration of R gene diversity enables the study of R gene evolution and may facilitate the isolation of new and functional alleles. Most cloned R genes occur in clusters of related sequences. Thus, {{the development of a}} tool <b>for</b> reliable <b>recovery</b> of orthologous <b>R</b> gene sequences to the exclusion of paralogous sequences will facilitate R gene diversity analysis. The late blight resistance gene RB is a single functional locus embedded within a cluster of related sequences. Previously, the functional RB allele was cloned from wild potato using a Long Range-PCR (LR-PCR) technique, suggesting this method may be a promising tool <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> of <b>R</b> gene orthologs in other genotypes. Using the RB gene as a model, we explored the limitations and improved three technical aspects of LR-PCR for multi-genotype applications. We present improved primers <b>for</b> the <b>recovery</b> of the RB locus and have identified efficient DNA extraction procedures and reliable amplification systems. We document that consensus sequences built from three independently generated LR-PCR clones can be up to 100 % accurate. Our results show encouraging advances toward successful application of LR-PCR for isolating alleles from orthologous R gene loci.

They were priced at Rs. 51 per share and market rate according to appellant on 27. 7. 1992 was Rs. 130 per share. Appellant asked respondent no. 1 to credit Rs. 79 per share for five lakh shares of SAIL to the account of appellant. By letter dated 17. 9. 1992, respondent no. 1 resiled from the contract regarding sale of shares of SAIL. On 27. 5. 1993 respondent no. 1 issued a notice demanding an amount of Rs. 2. 56 crores.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} <b>for</b> evaluating <b>recovery</b> and {{its contribution to}} uncertainty budgets for analytical methods are considered in detail. The <b>recovery,</b> <b>R,</b> <b>for</b> a particular sample is considered as comprising three elements, łRm, Rs and Rrep. These relate to the <b>recovery</b> <b>for</b> the method; the effect of sample matrix and/or analyte concentration on recovery; and how well the behaviour of spiked samples represents that of test samples. The uncertainty associated with R, u(R), will have contributions from u(łRm), u(Rs) and u(Rrep). The evaluation of these components depends on the method scope and the availability, or otherwise, of representative certified reference materials. Procedures for evaluating these parameters are considered and illustrated with worked examples. Techniques discussed {{include the use of}} certified reference materials and spiking studies, and the use of extraction profiling to predict recoveries. All the approaches discussed evaluate the recovery and its uncertainty for the analytical method as a whole. It is concluded that this is a useful approach as it reduces the amount of experimental work required.

The sample comprised 925 normally-hearing and hearing-impaired working adults (aged 18 - 65 years) participating in the National Longitudinal Study on Hearing. Hearing status was determined using the national hearing (speech-in-noise) test over the internet. Psychosocial work characteristics and need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> were assessed using the job content questionnaire and the Dutch questionnaire on the experience and assessment of work.

40|$|To better {{understand}} how stigma resistance impacts functioning-related domains, we examined mean effect sizes between stigma resistance and: 1) symptoms (overall, positive, negative, and mood symptoms); 2) self-stigma; 3) self-efficacy; 4) quality of life; 5) recovery; 6) hope; 7) insight, and 8) overall outcomes (the average effect size across the constructs examined in each study). The mean effect size between stigma resistance and overall outcomes was significant and positive (r = 0. 46, p < 0. 001, k = 48). A large, negative effect size was found between stigma resistance and self-stigma (r = − 0. 57, p < 0. 001, k = 40). Large, positive effect sizes were found with self-efficacy (r = 0. 60, p < 0. 001, k = 25), quality of life (r = 0. 51, p < 0. 001, k = 17), hope (r = 0. 54, p < 0. 001, k = 8), and <b>recovery</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 60, p < 0. 001, k = 7).

40|$|Relatively {{few studies}} have {{examined}} recoveries from source waters by using Environmental Protection Agency method 1623 with organism spike doses that are environmentally realistic and at turbidity levels commonly found in surface waters. In this study, we evaluated the filtration capacities and recovery efficiencies of the Gelman Envirochek (standard filter) and the Gelman Envirochek high-volume (HV) sampling capsules under environmental conditions. We also examined the performance of method 1623 under ambient conditions with matrix spike experiments using 10 organisms/liter. Under turbid conditions, the HV capsule filtered approximately twice the volume filtered by the standard filter, but neither could filter 10 liters without clogging. In low-turbidity waters, oocyst, but not cyst, recoveries were significantly higher when the HV capsule was used. In turbid waters, organism recoveries were lower than those in nonturbid waters and were not significantly different for the different filters. When the HV capsule was used, Cryptosporidium recoveries ranged from 36 to 75 %, and Giardia recoveries ranged from 0. 5 to 53 %. <b>For</b> both organisms, <b>recoveries</b> varied significantly by site. Turbidity could explain variation in Giardia <b>recoveries</b> (<b>r</b> 2 = 0. 80) but not variation in Cryptosporidium <b>recoveries</b> (<b>r</b> 2 = 0. 16). The inconsistent recoveries across sites suggested that the background matrix of the ambient water affected recovery by method 1623. A control sample collected {{at the height of the}} winter rainy season detected one organism, highlighting the difficulty of using this method to accurately measure pathogen abundance under natural conditions. Our findings support the use of the HV filter under field conditions but suggest that designing a cost-effective and statistically valid monitoring program to evaluate sources and loads of protozoan pathogens may be difficult...|$|R

The model that was proposed incorporated the hours spent driving as a measure of workload, both adaptive and maladaptive driver coping styles, and self-report measures of need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> (i. e., fatigue), positive and negative affect (PA and NA), and physical symptoms. The results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the workload was a significant predictor of drivers' need <b>for</b> <b>recovery,</b> but not of their PA and NA nor of their physical symptoms. Need <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> was in turn a significant predictor of PA and NA and of their physical symptoms, indicating that it mediates the influence of workload on PA and NA and physical symptoms.

Fromanother form, namely E =-C(d ~ C,) //l. Li’s, Akulov’s and McLean’s equations are obtained. These and other equations which are obtained are thus systemati-cally related to each other. The physical bases of several derivations are also shown to be similarly related. During the deceleration from the initial creep rate to the final rate E, there develops not only {{a balance between the}} rate of <b>recovery,</b> <b>r,</b> and the strain hardening coefficient, h, so that C + r/h, but also a decrease in r and an increase in h which prolongs primary creep. This paper shows how {{to take into account the}} changes in rand h, and that equations which do so, whether implicitly or explicitly, describe experimental creep strain/time curves quite well. It is thus shown that behind the present bewildering profusion of apparently unrelated equations and physical models describing creep there is a simpler situation, in which the creep equations can be systematically derived in a physically significant manner from a single expression <b>for</b> <b>recovery</b> creep. The simplification achieved is expected to have a pedagogical and a practical value for engineers and metallurgists interested in creep. ...|$|R
