She reveals to Lucy {{that she was an}} unintended pregnancy and that she wants nothing to do with her, and Lucy leaves the house heartbroken. Promptly arriving at the motel, Ben comforts her. The following day, Lucy rejoins the others and goes on to Los Angeles. When they arrive, Kit brings Mimi along to surprise her fiance, Dylan. While alone in the hotel, Lucy gives her virginity to Ben and they fall in love with each other. When Kit and Mimi arrive to Dylan's place, it is revealed that he is cheating on Kit after they see another girl in his apartment. Already upset, Kit suddenly realizes that it was Dylan who raped Mimi and got her pregnant, and she punches him. Scared, Mimi runs away, and falls down the stairs. Consequently, she loses her baby. Because of this, Lucy decides to call her father to take her and the girls back home. However her father is still putting pressure on Lucy to do what he wants.

According to Pro Wrestling Insider, members of the Chikara roster were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements before the pay-per-view to help keep future developments a secret. Chikara remained largely quiet the days following the iPPV, responding only to some of the rumors with the statement [...] "there is no issue regarding ownership of the Chikara name, brand, its assets or intellectual properties.

They made their way through the thick forest from Kanchanaburi, a small town northwest of Bangkok, to the Burmese border.

From the source of the River Kwai they floated down the river on a handmade raft, capsizing at times on unexpected steep rapids. It was supposed to be a seven-day adventure trip. No one <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> exactly they were and how many more days were needed to get back to the office. Being late or absent was a serious offense in a tightly run Swiss office. They got finally back five days late and paid the price - a cut in holidays and bonuses. An image that Rolf Schnyder took during this adventure appeared on the cover of the Swiss magazine, Schweizer Illustrierte. An account of this trip, penned by Schnyder, could be found within its pages. It was the first of many travel reports published in Swiss and other European papers and magazines. In the next few years, Schnyder continued to explore Thailand, Laos, Bali, Cambodia and South Vietnam, where the war had just started.|$|R

As soon as the beds were made up, I crept into my berth, and my new friend Elsie took her place on the sofa below me. I lay awake long and thought over the situation. The more I thought of it, the stranger it all seemed. I tried hard to persuade myself I was running some great danger in accepting the Cheritons' invitation. Certainly, I had behaved with consummate imprudence. Canada is a country, I said to myself, where they kidnap and murder well-to-do young Englishmen. How much easier, then, to kidnap and murder a poor weak stray English girl! I was entirely {{at the mercy of}} the Cheritons, that was clear: and the Cheritons were Dr. Ivor's friends. As I thought all the circumstances over, the full folly of my own conduct came home to me more and more. I had let these people suppose I was travelling under an assumed name.

Since Prateeksha needs the sign of the minister (who is Milind now) because her aunt wanted to make her house into an orphanage and Prateeksha is going complete that dream. Devika announces she and Milind are getting married during the party which was thrown by her dad. Araina doesn't want that. Ariana comes into the study thinking Devika is there but it's actually Prateeksha. Coming out of the party Prateeksha bumps into Shashank and runs away but not before Shashank sees her. Araina finds out that Sumo (Suhani) is dead, and becomes very upset about that. Shashank follows Prateeksha's cab and keeps on stopping in front of her. Prateeksha changes cabs to get away from Shashank and then the cab driver is actually a thief and at knife point he robs Prateeksha. Shashank saves her but in return he gives away all priceless possessions (car, watch, etc...) to save her. They get stranded in the jungle and in the morning rescued by the police who found their car. Meanwhile, Araina is depressed over Sumo's death and is trying to cope but it is too hard. Prateeksha asks the police to drop her off at a hotel and she tells Shashank that his and her paths are different. In the hotel the police gives her back her mangalsutra and Raunak is back, but with a twist to the story because he is now Prateeksha's husband. Shashank tells Araina about him and Prateeksha. Araina is ready for revenge and has thrown a party to reveal to Shushank that Prateeksha is married. Araina has been wondering why Prateeksha is hiding {{the fact that she is}} married.

2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>where</b> it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but where is it really going?" [...] That is {{precisely the kind of}} question that is scientifically meaningless. That {{is the nature of the}} world we live in.
