5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> party leaders were {{made aware of}} these plans and actions. Thus, {{it would be impossible}} for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1847 the North Staffordshire Railway Act was passed. The act was {{necessary}} {{was because of}} problems encountered {{with the construction of}} the Crewe branch. The opportunity was taken to authorise several other deviations and small branches. It also consolidated the previous acts and importantly, forced the NSR to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> lines were completed by specifying that ordinary dividends were not to exceed 5% until the Churnet Valley and Willington lines had been opened.|$|E

5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident.

The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the storm, oil {{and mining}} {{operations}} in threatened regions were temporarily shut down. Already {{suffering from the}} impacts of Cyclones Clare and Daryl, residents were warned about the likelihood of flooding due to the already saturated grounds. The Bureau of Meteorology also issued tropical cyclone warnings {{for most of the}} Pilbara coastline on 28 February. The same day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Residents in these areas were advised to evacuate if necessary and <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> cyclone preparations had been completed. Shelters were also opened for residents who sought need for one. Schools throughout the Pilbara region were also closed for several days {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his many}} successes, {{during the last}} twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh {{measures}} he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. Conscription was introduced, causing resentment among the peasantry, despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army. In order to restore the imperial treasury, Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed. In order to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the coinage, issuing a new gold hyperpyron (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury has a non-selective {{education}} system, {{assessed by}} the SATs exam. There are seven primary schools and two state comprehensive secondary schools. The Barlow RC High School {{is one of those}} chosen by Manchester Council to benefit from funding made available in wave 4 of the government's Building Schools for the Future programme, a national scheme for the refurbishment and remodelling of every secondary school in England. It is planned to replace all the current buildings, which date back to 1951. Parrs Wood and The Barlow were two of only six schools in Manchester to achieve the Manchester Inclusion Standard in 2007, awarded by Manchester Council to those schools doing innovative work to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> their pupils are able to participate fully in the school's activities.|$|E
5|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the {{techniques}} used. Each morning, 36 chickens were roasted for their juices rather than the meat being used on the menu. Each chicken was pressed in a colander to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the liquid was expressed. These juices were mixed with those from the roasting trays after they had been deglazed with Madeira wine and then added a small amount of veal stock. The actual roasted chickens ended up being too dry to serve following the process, and so were used for staff lunches or were discarded. These 36 chickens produced enough juice for the sauces to accompany 30 chicken dishes. Similar processes were conducted with lamb shoulders, where they were pressed only for the creation of sauces.|$|E

5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{once was}} {{credited}} with creating 300 new vicarages within the diocese, largely {{on the basis of}} his surviving documents dealing with this, known as the Liber Antiquus. Further research has shown that a number of the vicarages he was once assumed to have founded were instead earlier foundations that Hugh either augmented or reassessed. Hugh also worked to improve the educational level of this clergy, even refusing to allow some candidates to benefices to be installed because of their lack of education. The bishop also worked to improve the conditions of the poorer clergy in his diocese, attempting to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> the clergy in his diocese had enough to live on. Previously, it was thought that Hugh had sent out a set of articles of inquiry to his diocesan clergy, but these articles are now shown to have been produced by Hugh's successor, Robert Grosseteste.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Jenner debuted her {{new name}} and image, and began {{publicly}} using feminine pronoun self-descriptors. Jenner held a renaming ceremony in July 2015, adopting the name Caitlyn Marie Jenner. Prior to her 20/20 interview, a two-part special titled Keeping Up with the Kardashians: About Bruce was filmed {{with the family}} in which she answered questions, and prepared her children for the personal and public aspects of the transition. In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized {{that there is no}} one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> her children were independent first before focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.|$|E

5|$|In response, a 5 September news {{briefing}} at the Pentagon by Press Secretary Geoff Morrell {{stated that}} {{at no time}} was the public in any danger and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times. The USAF announced that {{within days of the}} incident, the USAF relieved the Minot munitions squadron commander of duty and eventually disciplined 25 airmen. USAF Major General Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident. The USAF inventory of nuclear warheads was checked to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> warheads were accounted for. In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel, called the Defense Science Board, would study the mishap {{as part of a larger}} review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons. On 28 September, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General John Corley, effective 2 October.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, {{saw to it that}} there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable boys for the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E
