5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet {{over her shoulder and}} messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
25|$|Early {{recordings}} {{were made}} entirely acoustically, the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus. Sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was very irregular, giving acoustic recordings an instantly recognizable tonal quality. A singer practically {{had to put}} his or <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recording horn. Lower-pitched orchestral instruments such as cellos and double basses were often doubled (or replaced) by louder instruments, such as tubas. Standard violins in orchestral ensembles were commonly replaced by Stroh violins, which became popular with recording studios.|$|E

25|$|Tomoki Nagamine {{attempts}} to confess his love to an upperclassman named Sayuki Ayase; however, {{he does not}} succeed in doing so, being caught off by a sad expression on <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, he works alongside his crush Sayuki in the library committee. One day, the library manager Misuzu gives Tomoki a diary, telling him that the book chose him. A cute girl introducing herself as Yua—who is the goddess of happiness—comes bursting out of the book, and informs Tomoki that all his happiest memories will be recorded in his diary. The story mostly revolves around Tomoki interacting with the four heroines (in later versions, seven) and eventually forming a romantic relationship with one.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Sasha Banks and Becky Lynch {{faced each}} other on the January 25 Raw in a match which ended in {{disqualification}} after Charlotte attacked both women. After Banks confirmed her intentions of going after the Divas Championship and split from Team B.A.D on the February 1 Raw, she faced Lynch that night in a rematch which ended with Banks winning by disqualification after Team B.A.D members Naomi and Tamina attacked her, turning <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Lynch helped Banks fend off Naomi and Tamina leading to a temporary and uneasy alliance between the two. Also that same night Charlotte lost a non-title match to Brie Bella by roll-up. This led to a title match between the two for the Divas Championship scheduled for Fastlane, which Charlotte won.|$|E
25|$|This {{season of}} Big Brother Australia {{proved to be}} highly controversial. Big Brother – Adults Only ended its run early after {{politicians}} warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms. An alleged sexual assault during which John (real name Michael Bric) held down Camilla Severi on her bed while Ashley (Michael Cox) pushed his crotch into <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house on 1 July 2006 resulted in the ejection of the pair from the show. The incident sparked calls for the series to be investigated for possible breaches of broadcasting laws, and calls for the cancellation of the series by several commentators and politicians, including then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and opposition leader Kim Beazley. The incident {{and in particular the}} Prime Minister's comments, were reported internationally, running on CNN and the BBC and in various other international publications.|$|E

500|$|During {{the bridge}} of the song, the {{contestant}} is then visible at a hospital where a plastic surgeon injects botox into <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> scene, Beyoncé is pictured in a white straight jacket. She is then shown in another segment, being spray tanned in a bikini. At the end of the music video, Beyoncé loses the contest to a woman with albinism after which she happily congratulates her. The last scene depicts the singer looking happy and smiling with little make-up on her face. The final 30 seconds of the clip are intercepted into footage of Beyoncé, as a child, winning an award for Female Pop Vocalist on a television show. She appears onstage saying: [...] "I {{would like to thank the}} judges for picking me, my parents who I love. I love you Houston".|$|E
2500|$|Lise, {{also known}} as Lise with a Parasol, is an oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, created in 1867 during his early Salon period. [...] The full-length painting depicts model Lise Tréhot posing in a forest. She wears a white muslin dress and holds a black lace parasol to shade her from the sunlight, which filters down through the leaves, contrasting <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow and her body in the light, highlighting her dress rather than her face. After having several paintings rejected by the Salon, Renoir's Lise was finally accepted and exhibited in May 1868.|$|E
2500|$|The Ditchley Portrait {{seems to}} have always been at Lee's home in Oxfordshire, and was likely painted for (or commemorates) her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. [...] In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire. [...] The {{painting}} has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete. [...] Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel {{in the form of}} a celestial or armillary sphere close to her left ear. [...] The new portrait aesthetic did not please the aging queen, and in the many versions of this painting made with the allegorical items removed, likely in Gheeraerts' workshop, Elizabeth's features are [...] "softened" [...] from the stark realism of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original. One of these was sent as a diplomatic gift to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and is now in the Palazzo Pitti.|$|E

2500|$|The Ditchley Portrait {{seems to}} have always been at the Oxfordshire home of Elizabeth's retired Champion, Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley, and likely was painted for (or commemorates) [...] her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. The {{painting}} is attributed to Marcus Gheerearts the Younger, and was almost certainly based on a sitting arranged by Lee, who was the painter's patron. [...] In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire. [...] The painting has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete. [...] Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel {{in the form of}} a celestial or armillary sphere close to her left ear.

2500|$|The American Society for Psychical Research wanted further investigation. In 1926, a {{committee}} of three professors (Knight Dunlap, Henry C. McComas and Robert Williams Wood) was sent to Boston. Crandon had a luminous star attached to her forehead, identifying the location of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. After a few minutes, a narrow dark rod appeared over a luminous checkerboard which had {{been placed on the}} table opposite Crandon. It moved from side to side and picked up an object. As it passed in front of Wood he lightly touched it with the tip of his finger and followed it back to a point very near Crandon's mouth. Wood thought it probable she was holding the rod by her teeth. He took hold of the tip and very quietly pinched it. It felt like a knitting needle covered with one or two layers of soft leather. Though the committee had been warned that touching the ectoplasm could result in the illness or death of the medium, neither Crandon nor the [...] "ectoplasm" [...] rod showed any reaction to Wood's actions. At the end of the sitting, Wood dictated his actions to the stenographer. Upon hearing this, Crandon gave a shriek and fainted. She was carried {{out of the room and}} the committee was asked to depart. Wood was never invited again.|$|E
