25|$|The common {{mountain}} or <b>forest</b> <b>pasture</b> {{used for}} transhumance in summer is called seter or bod / bua. The same term {{is used for}} a related mountain cabin, which {{was used as a}} summer residence. In summer (usually late June), livestock is moved to a mountain farm, often quite distant from a home farm, in order to preserve meadows in valleys for producing hay. Livestock were typically tended for summer by girls and younger women, who also milked and made cheese. Bulls usually remained at the home farm. As autumn approached and grazing became in short supply, livestock are returned to a home farm.|$|E
25|$|However, when a {{significant}} {{destruction of the}} vegetation takes place (of natural origin such as an avalanche or human origin), the disturbance undergone by the ecosystem is too important. In this latter case, erosion {{is responsible for the}} destruction of the upper horizons of the ground, and is at the origin of a phenomenon of reversion to pioneer conditions. The phenomenon is called retrogression and can be partial or total (in this case, nothing remains beside bare rock). For example, the clearing of an inclined ground, subjected to violent rains, can lead to the complete destruction of the soil. Man can deeply modify the evolution of the soils by direct and brutal action, such as clearing, abusive cuts, <b>forest</b> <b>pasture,</b> litters raking. The climax vegetation is gradually replaced and the soil modified (example: replacement of leafy tree forests by moors or pines plantations). Retrogression is often related to very old human practices.|$|E

30|$|Predators are not evenly {{spread in}} Sweden but are {{concentrated}} to central and northern Sweden, overlapping precisely {{with the area}} where traditional farming with <b>forest</b> <b>pasturing</b> is practised by some 250 farmers as of 2010 (Figure 2). Bears have remained {{a part of the}} Swedish fauna all through the twentieth century, even though their numbers have fluctuated, but wolves have slowly re-established since the 1970 s, following a period of near extinction. Predator encounters are much more common in traditional farming with <b>forest</b> <b>pasturing</b> than in conventional farming. Around 18 % of all predator attacks in 2009 occurred on <b>forest</b> <b>pasturing</b> (Viltskadecenter 2009), while farms practising <b>forest</b> <b>pasturing</b> make up around 0.0035 % of Sweden's 72, 000 farms (Jordbruksverket 2011). The total number of predator attacks on domestic animals in 2009 was 687, 493 by wolves and 99 by bears (Viltskadecenter 2009). As the wolf population in Sweden was an estimated 186 to 215 individuals in 2010 (Wabakken et al. 2010) compared with a bear population of an estimated 3, 221 in 2008 (Kindberg et al. 2009), it is clear that wolves cause more problems to farmers both in total numbers and in relative numbers.|$|R

30|$|On the 250 summer {{farms that}} exist in Sweden today, the {{production}} system differs. Some are focused on milk production from cows or goats, others on meat production from cattle or sheep. While some are open for tourists and offer attractions such as cafes and guided tours, others are private, closed enterprises. <b>Forest</b> <b>pasturing</b> is generally based on Swedish common pasture rights (Ã¤gofredslagen and mulbetesrÃ¤tten) and thus represents a non-exclusive right of access. Multiple land uses are frequent in areas where <b>forest</b> <b>pasturing</b> is carried out, such as reindeer herding, hunting, various leisure activities and, above all, forestry. All of these are sources of conflict for farmers in the region, whose animals are sometimes said to hinder the activities of other land users.|$|R

All traces of former Polish autonomy were removed and the kingdom was divided into ten provinces, each with an appointed Russian military governor and all under complete control of the Governor-General at Warsaw. All former Polish government functionaries were deprived of their positions and replaced by Russian officials.|$|E
