5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan Ponce de León {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic digital computer. Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals should be included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše in the 14th century BC, Qatna may {{have become part of}} his kingdom. In 1977, Astour {{considered}} Qatna a constitutent part of the lands of Nuhašše, and identified a king of Qatna named Adad-Nirari with the Nuhaššite king. Astour was followed by Thomas Richter in 2002, who considered Qatna to be a secondary city <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> <b>of</b> the Nuhaššite king. The tablets of Qatna mention a šakkanakku (military governor) named Lullu, and Richter considered him an official of Nuhašše. The hypothesis of Richter is debated; a number of scholars accept it, for example Pfälzner, who suggested that the Nuhaššite king may have resided in Qatna's royal palace. Richter dated the rule of the Nuhaššite king to the period preceding the Hittite king Šuppiluliuma I's first Syrian war, during which Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše opposed the Hittites, was defeated, and, according to Richter, had his kingdom split between different Hittite puppets including Idanda of Qatna.|$|E

Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E

Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre and other city locations, is among the top four events of the international fashion calendar, along with the fashion weeks in Milan, London and New York.

40|$|Background/Aim. The general {{problems}} {{of persons with}} malignant diseases (stages of asthenia, chronic fatigue and exhaustion, followed by depression and anxiety) lead to a decrease in functional abilities and a declining quality of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the level of difficulty, the type of required assistance and the level of satisfaction that derives from maintaining life habits. The study also examined the correlation between the level of accomplishment of life habits and the level of satisfaction with how they are maintained. Methods. The research was conducted at the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> “Get Together” Association of Women with Breast Cancer from June to September 2012 on a sample of 30 women. A standardised questionnaire, Assessment of Life Habits - LIFE-H v. 3. 0, was administered. Results. The lowest level of maintaining normal activities was related to education, housing and recreation. The greatest need for support to maintain normal activities was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> housing, interpersonal relationships and employment. <b>The</b> greatest satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accomplishment of normal activities was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> mobility, nutrition and housing, and the lowest level <b>of</b> satisfaction was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> recreation, communication and interpersonal relationships. The correlation between the level of accomplishment of normal activities and the level of satisfaction was <b>the</b> highest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> general physical activity, responsibility and life <b>in</b> a community; <b>the</b> lowest level was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> <b>of</b> personal hygiene, housing, mobility, employment and recreation (p < 0. 001). Conclusion. The results indicate that research participants found it more difficult to maintain their social activities than their everyday activities. This clearly indicates the necessity to develop and implement special advisory and educational programs aimed at preventing social exclusion and to strengthen and support personal resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of the social roles of women with breast cancer...|$|R
