25|$|During spinal shock, {{the bladder}} is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, a spinally {{mediated}} voiding reflex ensues, {{although there is}} no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers. Some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs, provoking a mild mass reflex. In some instances, the voiding reflex becomes <b>hyperactive.</b> <b>Bladder</b> capacity is reduced and the wall becomes hypertrophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder. The reflex hyperactivity is made worse, and may be caused, by infection in the bladder wall.|$|E

40|$|Voiding {{dysfunction}} is {{a common}} problem in pediatrics. <b>Hyperactive</b> urinary <b>bladder</b> is the most frequent cause of voiding dysfunction. Macholinolytic drugs are the first choice treatment for urinary bladder hyperactivity. The «urination pathology» center has investigated the efficacy of an macholinolytic, oxybutynin. The study included 25 children (aged 6 – 14) with different causes of voiding dysfunction and bladder hyperactivity. Oxybutynin was administered with a dosage of 5 mg twice a day, the follow up period was 8 weeks. The control evaluation of urodynamics (voiding rhythm, uroflowmetry, residual urine volume) was performed at 4 – 8 weeks. Symptoms of bladder hyperactivity have been eliminated in 50 % of patients, the bladder capacity has increased in 70 % of cases, the frequency of night and day incontinence has diminished. The report demonstrates that oxybutynin has been most effective in patients with urinary bladder volume between 80 and 100 ml. the side effects, as dryness of mucous membranes and voiding difficulties, have been rarely observed. These side effects could be avoided by individual dose titration. Key words: voiding dysfunction, urinary bladder hyperactivity, oxybutynin, children. </p...|$|R

40|$|Components of the {{so-called}} endocannabinoid system, i. e., cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids, as well as enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation, have been identified both in the gastrointestinal and in the urinary tract. Evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system is implicated in many gastrointestinal and urinary physiological and pathophysiological processes, including epithelial cell growth, inflammation, analgesia, and motor function. A pharmacological modulation of the endocannabinoid system might be beneficial for widespread diseases such as gastrointestinal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, cystitis, and <b>hyperactive</b> <b>bladder.</b> Drugs that inhibit endocannabinoid degradation and {{raise the level of}} endocannabinoids, non-psychotropic cannabinoids (notably cannabidiol), and palmitoylethanolamide, an acylethanolamide co-released with the endocannabinoid anandamide, are promising candidates for gastrointestinal and urinary diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the strategies that nurses use to manage urinary incontinence (UI) in the elderly. An integrative literature review was performed on the following databases: WEB OF SCIENCE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and CINAHL, in the period from 2006 to 2010. A total of 186 articles were located, and after excluding duplicates and performing a careful reading of the full articles, the sample was comprised of seven articles. Most studies utilize an overall approach to urinary incontinence, without characterizing the type or the subjects' claims. Only one study addressed the management of urinary incontinence in the elderly with dementia; another specified the type (<b>hyperactive</b> <b>bladder).</b> Therefore, there is a need for further clinical nursing studies regarding the management of urinary incontinence, aiming to provide scientific evidence to support this practice...|$|E

40|$|Neurogenic hyperactiv e bladder in {{different}} clinical variations is a characteristic com plication of restorativ e and residual periods of ischemic stroke {{and an important}} diagnostic criterion in vascular dementia. Mechanisms of formation of individual symptoms included in this syndrome is due to ischemic damage to cortical, subcortical and brainstem (the nucleus of Barrington) centres of urination and associative areas of the brain, and the functional dissociation of these structures due to demyelination of the Central conductors of the afferent and efferent impulses.

40|$|Overactive bladder is a {{specific}} syndrome characterized by bladder dysfunction that is clinically manifested by imperative urination (pollakiuria, urgency, urgent incontinence and nocturia). This state is very widely spread among children: every fifth child aged 4 to 7 shows typical bladder dysfunction. Quite often if urinary distresses are not studied well enough such children are falsely diagnosed with monosymptom enuresis, which, according to our information, actually happens in only 3, 9 % of cases. When examining children with urinary disorders {{it is reasonable to}} be geared to the protocol of European urologist association. According to this protocol, treatment should be started with antimuscarinimedications. The only antimuscarinic medication for treating children with <b>hyperactive</b> <b>bladder</b> that is legal in Russia is oxybutinin (Driptane), that is presently considered to be the «golden standard» of pharmaceutical treatment of overactive bladder for patients of any age. This statement is based on the modern idea of overactive bladder pathogenesis, that presupposes detrusorhypersensibility to acetylcholine. However, in some cases it might be reasonable to use some other medications, physiotherapy, sometimes as part of complex therapy. If individual dosage is observed, which will enable preventing or significantly lowering possible side effects, oxybutinin will be still considered «the golden standard» for treating overactive bladder for years to come in cases when detrusor hypersensibility to acetylcholine is the key component of bladder dysfunction pathogenesis.

40|$|Background: Urinary {{incontinence}} UI is {{an involuntary}} leakage of urine due to loss of bladder control {{which is a}} common and often embarrassing problem that may cause tremendous emotional distress. Prevalence and risk factors depend on baseline physiological mechanisms, including weakness of pelvic floor muscles, <b>hyperactive</b> <b>bladder</b> that may result in urge UI, poor urethral sphincter function associated with stress UI, and impaired structural and functional integrity of pudendal nerve activity, associated with Pelvic floor muscle weakness {{plays an important role}} in UI etiology. Pelvic floor muscles work to support the bladder neck in the intra- abdominal cavity and maintain urinary continence. Weakness of these muscles leads the bladder to shift to the extra-abdominal cavity and thus a change in the urethra-vesicle angle occurs. Methods: Group (A) twenty participants who received behavioral training (BT) pelvic floor exercises (PFE) and interferential current, group (B) twenty participants who received BT, PFE and posterior tibial nerve stimulation, and group (C) twenty participants who received BT, PFE and placebo interferential current. Urodynamic and cystometric measures including bladder volume at first desire to void, maximum cystometric capacity, and pressure at maximum flow rate were measured before and after intervention. Results: Results of this study revealed that there was a statistical significant difference in bladder volume at first desire to void, maximum cystometric capacity, and pressure at maximum flow rate in favor of participants who received a combination of BT, PFE and interferential current compared with those who received a combination of BH and PFE with either posterior tibial nerve stimulation or placebo interferential current. Conclusion: Interferential current is better than posterior tibial nerve stimulation in the rehabilitation of urinary incontinence...|$|E
40|$|Transplantation {{of neural}} {{progenitors}} remains a promising therapeutic approach to {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI), but the anatomical and functional evaluation of their effects is complex, particularly when using human cells. We investigated the outcome of transplanting human glial-restricted progenitors (hGRP) and astrocytes derived from hGRP (hGDA) in spinal cord contusion with respect to cell fate and host response using athymic rats to circumvent xenograft immune issues. Nine days after injury hGRP, hGDA, or medium were injected into the lesion center and rostral and caudal to the lesion, followed by behavioral testing for 8 weeks. Both hGRP and hGDA showed robust graft survival and extensive migration. The total number of cells increased 3. 5 -fold for hGRP, and twofold for hGDA, indicating graft expansion, but few proliferating cells remained by 8 weeks. Grafted cells differentiated into glia, predominantly astrocytes, and few remained at progenitor state. About 80 % of grafted cells around the injury were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -positive, gradually decreasing to 40 – 50 % {{at a distance of}} 6 [*]mm. Conversely, there were few graft-derived oligodendrocytes at the lesion, but their numbers increased away from the injury to 30 – 40 %. Both cell grafts reduced cyst and scar formation at the injury site compared to controls. Microglia/macrophages were present at and around the lesion area, and axons grew along the spared tissue with no differences among groups. There were no significant improvements in motor function recovery as measured by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and grid tests in all experimental groups. Cystometry revealed that hGRP grafts attenuated <b>hyperactive</b> <b>bladder</b> reflexes. Importantly, there was no increased sensory or tactile sensitivity associated with pain, and the hGDA group showed sensory function returning to normal. Although the improved lesion environment was not sufficient for robust functional recovery, the permissive properties and lack of sensory hypersensitivity indicate that human GRP and astrocytes remain promising candidates for therapy after SCI...|$|E
