5|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A critic from Billboard liked Streisand's tone and vocals, but others <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> album was ultimately forgettable. Barbra Streisand...and Other Musical Instruments is Streisand's lowest selling studio album of her entire career; {{it is also}} one of four studio albums released by the singer not to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. However, it peaked in the lower positions of both Canada and the United States. The album was eventually released as a CD in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The new name, Project Blue Book, was {{selected}} {{to refer to the}} blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the Aerial Phenomenon Branch.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final pay grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E

Jefferies said: [...] "At the time it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait. It {{was a form of}} psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable." ...|$|E
500|$|Personal {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with some critics noting {{similarities between the}} group and Boyz II Men. Some critics <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> material was unmemorable versions of Boyz II Men songs, while others felt that Personal was highly different from the music at the time. The album only managed to chart in the United States, where it peaked at 14 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums, 29 on the Billboard R Albums and 186 on the Billboard Top 200. Two singles were released to promote the album: [...] "House Keeper" [...] and [...] "Do Thangz". The former was a commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the U.S. Billboard Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and at 67 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of PCD (2005), {{and over the}} course of two years (2005–07), Scherzinger recorded 75-100 songs for Her Name Is Nicole, her planned solo debut album. [...] Her work as lead singer furthered Scherzinger's popularity as she began work on her own music. She stated that she enjoyed collaborating with many different artists, and that although she had been writing songs for over ten years, {{she felt as if she}} was at a different level while working with such A-list writers and producers. Following the moderate success of [...] "Baby Love", the complete lack of success of the singles such as [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] and numerous push backs, Scherzinger decided to put the release of the on hold. She then returned her focus back on the Pussycat Dolls, and recording commenced for their second studio album. Scherzinger cited that she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> songs were more suited as a Pussycat Dolls song than her own.|$|E

500|$|The 2nd Law was {{primarily}} recorded at AIR Studios in London, England and Eastwest Studios in Los Angeles, California, with additional recording {{taking place at}} Shangri La Studios in Malibu, California and Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. In an interview with Billboard on 18 October 2011, the band's manager Anthony Addis revealed that Muse had begun recording their sixth album in London and that he {{expected it to be}} released by October 2012. Muse bassist Christopher Wolstenholme had stated in an interview with BBC Radio 1 that they had aimed to begin recording The 2nd Law in either September or October 2011. During the recording of the album, band frontman Matt Bellamy jokingly described the album as a [...] "christian gangsta rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia" [...] on his Twitter account. In an interview with Kerrang! on 14 December 2011, Wolstenholme stated that the next Muse album would be [...] "something radically different" [...] from their prior releases. He also said that it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> band were [...] "drawing a line under a certain period" [...] of their career with their sixth album. In another interview Chris mentioned that the band had experimented with music and sounds in particular. It was revealed via Muse's publicist Tom Kirk on his Twitter account that composer David Campbell was helping the band compose the album. In an interview in the April 2012 issue of NME, Bellamy said that the band were set to include elements of electronic music, with influences coming from acts such as French house duo Justice and UK dance-punk group Does It Offend You, Yeah?.|$|E
500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure {{seem to be having}} a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend described [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as [...] "one of the most random episodes of The Office." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E

[...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away.

2500|$|The EL {{served as}} a {{facelift}} of its predecessor, the EF Falcon, which began production in 1994. The [...] "E-series" [...] architecture can trace its roots back to 1988 with the EA. Ford spent million {{for the development of}} the EL. Ford introduced a number of improvements aimed at extending the life of the [...] "E-series" [...] body while the AU Falcon was being developed. Most of the handling and steering problems with the EF were rectified in the EL. Critics at the time stated the EF Falcon was hard to handle and it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> front suspension of the vehicle wasn’t optimally setup to work with the geometry of the live-axle rear end (the AU would be the first Falcon to offer an independent rear end). Ford addressed these concerns making the EL far more responsive than the EF (see below).|$|E

2500|$|Lopez's first {{greatest}} hits album, Dance Again... the Hits, {{was released on}} July 24, 2012 in the United States. It was released by Epic Records, as Lopez owed them one final album to end her contract, despite previously announcing that she had fulfilled her contract with the label. Lopez, who {{was going through a}} divorce with Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> album's sole single, [...] "Dance Again", had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In", a single from the soundtrack of the dance film Step Up Revolution, both {{reached the top of the}} Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs, giving Lopez her twelfth and thirteenth number one on that chart, respectively. nuvoTV announced in September its premier partnership with Lopez, that will see her work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing in network programming.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} {{structured}} into two halves: the first having a consistent dance flow, beginning {{from what the}} band saw as a [...] "deep" [...] place ("Inori"), rising towards the album's [...] "summit" [...] song [...] "Aoi". From [...] "Aoi", the songs begin to adopt a [...] "deep" [...] and varied tone, until they reach what the band saw as the deepest place on the album, [...] "Asa no Uta". Yamaguchi chose {{the order of the}} three beginning tracks ("Intro", [...] "Inori" [...] and [...] "Music"), which he linked due to the songs' high tempos, and also the link between [...] "Structure" [...] and [...] "Asa no Uta". He asked the other band members to decide the order of the other songs. The final track list that they chose was extremely similar to how Yamaguchi envisioned (the only difference being that [...] "Boku to Hana" [...] and [...] "Mellow" [...] were switched). Personally, Yamaguchi <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> first half was emotional and Sakanaction-like, while the second half had a more entertaining sound.|$|E
2500|$|Kiyohiko Koike for Listenmusic {{felt the}} song was an [...] "aggressive number erupting all the band member's fervour" [...] created by aspects such as the [...] "quick beat, {{growling}} bass line and Ringo's freaky passionate voice". He felt {{the song was}} not a song you could call a single feeling it had an [...] "eccentric spirit of adventure", but praised Sheena {{being used as a}} resource by her bandmates in the production of a song, and felt that the [...] "mental aspects" [...] of the band had evolved. Hot Express reviewer Tetsuo Hiraga praised Sheena's [...] "charming" [...] vocals in the song, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> song were exploding from every direction. He believed that this [...] "broken" [...] Sheena had not been seen in her previous works before. CDJournal reviewers noted the song's structure, describing it as [...] "developing into a constantly changing song, as if many songs were in a single song." [...] Reviewer Naoko Saito was very positive on the song, praising the [...] "exploding tricky band sound", calling the song [...] "full of thrills and excitement, like looking at something you shouldn't be". What's In? reviewers called the song a [...] "wild rock tune", noting its [...] "bewildering structure".|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Grahame was worried about Don Martin. The flowers, plates of fruit, and tall wine carafes {{obstructed}} his view, {{but he could see}} that Sarmiento had not come in.

2500|$|In the humiliating {{aftermath}} of Suez in 1956, Lady Avon's most famous public remark {{to a group}} of Conservative woman that, [...] "in the past few weeks I have really <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Suez Canal was flowing through my drawing room", was widely reported. Lady Avon has since described this observation as [...] "silly, really idiotic", though it remains probably the most quoted utterance of the whole crisis. One example of its durability was a journalist's observation some 54 years later, with reference to the Iraq War of 2003, that [...] "if, as Clarissa Eden remarked, the Suez Canal ran through her drawing room, Iraq and the decisions that flowed from it still haunt [...] Labour [...] and stir up antipathies and discomforts". Another instance was in 2013 when options for airport expansion around London were being debated. Journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of London's mayor Boris Johnson, recalled Lady Avon's remark and added, [...] "But for those of us in West London, any further expansion to Heathrow and the airport really will be in our back yards". More directly, The Times newspaper cited Lady Avon's words in 2011 in connection with a call by the outgoing Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus (later Lord) O'Donnell for Prime Ministerial spouses to receive greater support from public funds: [...] "In a constitutional monarchy, the consort of the prime minister is not an official role ... Yet, as the Countess of Avon so vividly pointed out, it can be impossible to keep public scrutiny at bay altogether". In Lady Avon's view, both she and her husband [...] "were quite naive about how the press works. Neither of us should have been, but we were." ...|$|E
