I find that the highly publicized negative expense-performance relationship disappears among funds that cater to a sophisticated clientele of investors. I find that mainstream investors can use the existence of a share class with a high minimum initial purchase requirement as a signal of competitiveness. My results highlight the important influence investor monitoring has on the competitiveness of financial products. © 2012 Academy o...|$|R
40|$|I explore investors’ welfare losses {{when they}} {{restrict}} themselves {{to invest in}} either stocks only or bonds only, but not in both. The restriction gives investors sub-optimal asset allocations that result in welfare losses. To measure these welfare losses I compare “only stock indices and Treasury bills” optimal portfolios and “only bond indices and Treasury bills” optimal portfolios with “stock and bond indices and Treasury bills” optimal portfolios using the concept of proportionate opportunity cost along with various CRRA utility functions. The original historical asset returns data set is used with a VAR in generating joint returns distributions for the portfolio formation period. <b>I</b> show that <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> {{with low levels of}} risk aversion welfare losses do not exceed 1. 5 % of initial wealth when they invest sub-optimally. <b>For</b> <b>investors</b> with medium and high levels of relative risk aversion, suboptimal portfolios of only one type of assets, stocks only or bonds only, along with Treasury bills, give expected utility about as high as optimal portfolios that include both types of assets, stocks and bonds. probability distribution function of stock returns, proportionate opportunity cost, optimal portfolio strategy, investors´welfare losses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the valuation of risky projects {{in a setting}} where the <b>investor’s</b> probability estimates <b>for</b> future states of nature are ambiguous and {{where he or she}} can invest both in a portfolio of projects and securities in financial markets. This setting is relevant to investors who allocate resources to industrial research and development projects or make venture capital investments whose success probabilities may be hard to estimate. Here, we employ the Choquet-Expected Utility (CEU) model to capture the ambiguity in probability estimates and the investor’s attitude towards ambiguity. Projects are valued using breakeven selling and buying prices, which are obtained by solving several mixed asset portfolio selection (MAPS) models. Specifically, we formulate the MAPS model <b>for</b> CEU <b>investors,</b> and show that a project’s breakeven prices <b>for</b> (<b>i)</b> <b>investors</b> exhibiting constant absolute risk aversion and <b>for</b> (ii) <b>investors</b> using Wald’s maximin criterion can be obtained by solving two MAPS problems. We also show that breakeven prices are consistent with options pricing analysis when the investor is a non-expected utility maximizer. The valuation procedure is demonstrated through numerical experiments...|$|R

30|$|Assuming {{that the}} central {{government}} has a strong ability to supervise and regulate local officials and has a certain policy orientation for economic growth, the local decentralization level has {{a significant impact on}} the degree of property rights protection. In particular, the resistance costs <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> are higher when decentralization is only to provincial level, making it difficult <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> to influence the behavior of provincial officials through the use of protests and complaints, resulting in a lower degree of property rights protection for private businesses. The resistance costs <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> are lower when decentralization is to the prefectural (county) level, so it is easier <b>for</b> <b>investors</b> to influence the behavior of provincial level officials through protests and complaints, leading to a higher degree of property rights protection for private businesses.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} limited {{investor}} attention {{and its effects}} on capital markets, has increasingly captured the focus of researchers in recent literature. According to the studies, observed market underreactions to various corporate announcements may be attributable to reduced levels of investor attention. In these models, investor attention is regarded as a cognitive limited resource, whereby the presence of external stimuli and conditions can lead to a situation where investors do not pay the optimal amount - or what standard models assume - attention to relevant information. In this thesis, <b>I</b> test <b>for</b> the effects of limited investor attention in the context of stock swap merger announcements, using the same measure of investor distraction as Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh (2009). More specifically, I test whether acquirers exhibit a muted short-term price and volume response to stock swap merger announcements of public and private targets, when there are larger amounts of same-day quarterly earnings announcement releases. Additionally, <b>I</b> test <b>for</b> the <b>investor</b> inattention hypothesis presented by Louis and Sun (2010), whether there is a muted short-term market reaction to stock swap mergers that are announced on Fridays. I find partial evidence for a muted price and volume response in regard to announcements of stock swap mergers that are made on both high-distraction days and Fridays. However, the results are not very robust and consistent across the whole sample and different categories of targets, to warrant strong support <b>for</b> the <b>investor</b> distraction and inattention effects, in the context of stock swap merger announcements...|$|R
