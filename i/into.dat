5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia on April3 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying <b>into</b> a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified <b>into</b> an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar near Diego Suarez. It weakened {{upon entering the}} Mozambique channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking Madagascar again near Majunga. Kamisy quickly crossed the country and quickly weakened <b>into</b> a {{tropical disturbance}}. After emerging <b>into</b> the Indian Ocean off {{the east coast of}} Madagascar, the system re-intensified <b>into</b> a moderate tropical storm before dissipating on April16.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave developed <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3, 115mi (185km/h) east of Dominica. The depression rapidly intensified <b>into</b> {{a tropical}} storm, and {{was classified as}} Tropical Storm Klaus only six hours later. Because Klaus was {{in an area of}} weak steering current, it was drifting west-northwestward. On October 5, Klaus briefly intensified <b>into</b> a hurricane, and passed only 12mi (19km) east of Barbuda later that day. By the following day, Klaus had weakened back <b>into</b> a tropical storm. After weakening to a tropical storm, Klaus began to accelerate, while turning westward. Klaus became significantly affected by wind shear, as it weakened to a tropical depression to the north of Puerto Rico on October 8. Later that day, deep convection began to re-developed near the low-level circulation of Klaus, and it had re-intensified <b>into</b> a tropical storm. As Klaus tracked northwestward near the Bahamas on October 9, it was absorbed by an area of low pressure, which would eventually develop <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Marco.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave in {{the western}} Caribbean organized <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Twenty on October 1. Off {{the coast of the}} Yucatán Peninsula, it strengthened <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Stan on October 2. Stan made landfall on the Yucatán and weakened to a tropical depression, but upon reemerging <b>into</b> the Bay of Campeche it quickly strengthened <b>into</b> a hurricane on October 4. Stan made landfall later that morning on the east-central coast of Mexico, south of Veracruz, as a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided <b>into</b> arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated <b>into</b> two sides. Instead, it is separated <b>into</b> three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously <b>into</b> the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|After CR35, NY78 bends {{northwest}} out of Strykersville, crossing <b>into</b> {{the rural}} sections of Sheldon surrounding the hamlet. Near the intersection with Chester Street, NY78 crosses the county line <b>into</b> Erie County and <b>into</b> {{the town of}} Wales.|$|E
5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are injected <b>into</b> the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed <b>into</b> double-strand DNA, which is then integrated <b>into</b> a host chromosome.|$|E
5|$|After being {{educated at}} Harrow School, Pilcher joined the Dublin City Artillery, a Militia unit, {{and from there}} {{transferred}} <b>into</b> the regular Army.

5|$|After repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 25 April to 26 July, Yorktown retraced her route {{south and}} sailed again around Cape Horn back <b>into</b> the Pacific. She then moved north to resume patrolling the Bering Sea. She {{protected}} seal rookeries <b>into</b> 1894 {{before returning to}} Mare Island for repairs which lasted <b>into</b> mid-September.|$|E
5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report <b>into</b> the possibility of converting Marylebone <b>into</b> a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted <b>into</b> a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and been converted <b>into</b> a road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted <b>into</b> Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have {{been taken over by}} London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E
5|$|After the {{momentary}} reduction in speed, the train {{turns to the}} right and descends <b>into</b> a downward 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs <b>into</b> an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill <b>into</b> the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|Americium-243 {{transforms}} by α-emission <b>into</b> 239Np, which converts by β-decay to 239Pu, and the 239Pu changes <b>into</b> 235U by emitting an α-particle.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved <b>into</b> O. aksuaticus, which evolved <b>into</b> C. auriculatus, and then <b>into</b> C. angustidens, and then <b>into</b> C. chubutensis, and then finally <b>into</b> C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E

5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien <b>into</b> the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it <b>into</b> space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to crawl <b>into</b> one of the engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien <b>into</b> space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat <b>into</b> stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E

5|$|As {{the weather}} synoptics of the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean transitioned <b>into</b> a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, convection from the monsoon trough extended {{to the east of}} the International Date Line. During late November, a westerly disturbance developed <b>into</b> twin troughs {{on opposite sides of the}} equator; the one in the Southern Hemisphere ultimately developed <b>into</b> Tropical Cyclone Pam, while the one in the Northern Hemisphere formed <b>into</b> an area of convection about 2000km (1240mi) southwest of Hawaii. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on November 28 it developed <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Five-C about 465km (290mi) west-northwest of Palmyra Atoll. Operationally, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until December 2.|$|E

5|$|Banton is {{politically}} subdivided <b>into</b> 17 barangays. In 1954, the sitios of Mahaba, Angomon, Solocan, Kapanranan, and Yabawon were consolidated <b>into</b> the barangay known as Yabawon.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the ability}} to shapeshift <b>into</b> human form, encantados {{frequently}} wield other magical abilities, such as the power to control storms, enchant humans <b>into</b> doing their will, transform humans <b>into</b> encantados themselves, and inflict illness, insanity, and even death. Shamans often intervene in these situations.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass <b>into</b> cellulosic ethanol. This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose <b>into</b> sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars <b>into</b> ethanol. Microbes also produce {{a variety of sources}} of bioenergy including methane and hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went <b>into</b> chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% <b>into</b> metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% <b>into</b> bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% <b>into</b> research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{from here}} drains <b>into</b> {{the left and}} right {{transverse}} sinuses. These then drain <b>into</b> the sigmoid sinuses, which receive blood from the cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The sigmoid drains <b>into</b> the large internal jugular veins.|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus <b>into</b> an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus <b>into</b> the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water <b>into</b> the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries <b>into</b> the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely <b>into</b> the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon {{has four}} {{patterns}} of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the Ntem, Nyong, Sanaga, and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward directly <b>into</b> the Gulf of Guinea. The Dja and Kadéï drain southeastward <b>into</b> the Congo River. In northern Cameroon, the Bénoué River runs {{north and west}} and empties <b>into</b> the Niger. The Logone flows northward <b>into</b> Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.|$|E

5|$|Catawissa Creek {{starts in}} Luzerne County, {{not far from}} Hazleton. It flows west and {{slightly}} south <b>into</b> Schuylkill County before flowing north <b>into</b> Columbia County and then west to the Susquehanna River, which it flows <b>into</b> at Catawissa. It parallels Catawissa Mountain for {{a significant portion of}} its course.|$|E
5|$|Costa Rica is {{administratively}} divided <b>into</b> seven provinces {{which are}} subdivided <b>into</b> 82 cantons, {{and these are}} further subdivided <b>into</b> districts. Cantons are the only administrative division in Costa Rica that possess local government {{in the form of}} municipalities. Each municipality has its own mayor and several representatives, all of them chosen via municipal elections every four years.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and <b>into</b> two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off <b>into</b> narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then <b>into</b> even narrower tertiary airways, and then <b>into</b> other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back <b>into</b> the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E

5|$|Early Greek {{sources have}} it that Philomela was turned <b>into</b> a swallow, {{which has no}} song; Procne turns <b>into</b> a nightingale, singing a {{beautiful}} but sad song in remorse. Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela was turned <b>into</b> a nightingale, and Procne <b>into</b> a swallow. Eustathius' {{version of the story}} has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E
5|$|Early on September5, {{reconnaissance}} found {{a central}} barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg), the lowest recorded {{in relation to}} the storm. Around this time, Babe also intensified <b>into</b> a hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h). Later that day, Hurricane Babe made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana and quickly weakened to a tropical storm. By landfall, the eye of Babe had contracted to roughly 14mi (23km). On September6, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression and was moving northeast <b>into</b> Mississippi. The system continued this movement for the following two days. While crossing South Carolina, forecasters thought that the system would emerge <b>into</b> the Atlantic Ocean and regenerate <b>into</b> a tropical depression. However, the remnants of Babe dissipated shortly before crossing <b>into</b> North Carolina early on September9.|$|E
5|$|East River, {{formally}} East River Sheet Harbour, is {{the other}} main river that discharges <b>into</b> Sheet Harbour.
