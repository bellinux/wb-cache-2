The figures provided above for {{the weight of the}} various pounds used in the Netherlands can be divided by 16 to obtain the weights of the various ounces in use. After the metric system was introduced, the word ons continued to be used, but for 100 g. The ons was eliminated as a formal unit of measurement in 1937, but it is still used today in everyday parlance to refer to 100 g.

40|$|Observing {{artificial}} satellites is {{a relatively}} new and unique branch of astronomy that is very interesting and dynamic. One specific aspect of observing these objects is that although they appear amongst the celestial background, as deep-sky objects do, their apparent locations amongst this background <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are standing <b>on</b> Earth at a given time. This effect is known as parallax. When a satellite is observed at a specific time from a specific location, the satellite's equatorial coordinates can be determined using astrometric means. Its range from the observer, however, is still unknown unless the observer knows the satellite's precise orbit elements or has easy access to a radar station. However, when two or more observers, separated by some distance, observe the same satellite at the same time, their observations can be used to determine the range of the satellite using the satellite's observed trigonometric parallax.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that small differences in health-related {{quality of life}} (HR-QOL) may be statistically significant yet clinically unimportant.

We argue that the attempt to define a single MCID is problematic {{for a number of reasons}} and recommend caution in the search for the MCID holy grail. Specifically, absolute thresholds are suspect because they ignore the cost or resources required to produce a change in HR-QOL. In addition, there are several practical problems in estimating the MCID, including: (i) the estimated magnitude varies <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the distributional index and the external standard or anchor; (ii) the amount of change might <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the direction of change; and (iii) the meaning of change <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> start (baseline value).

There are also volcanoes in other places: along other plate boundaries on the sea-floor and in island chains throughout the Pacific. One of the unanswered questions in geology is: why are there volcanoes in some places? In my own work, I turn the question around and ask: why aren’t there volcanoes everywhere?
