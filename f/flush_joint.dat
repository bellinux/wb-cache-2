50|$|This is {{the point}} where the neck meets the body. In the {{traditional}} Spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or <b>flush</b> <b>joint.</b> These joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. Recently many manufacturers use bolt on fasteners. Bolt on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. Some people believed that the Spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.While most traditional Spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, Fleta, a prominent Spanish builder, used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.One reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was {{to make it easier to}} repair necks. This is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings, which have about half the string tension. This is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either.|$|E

40|$|A modular {{multilevel}} system was adapted for high-resolution, depth-discrete monitoring of hydraulic head and ground water quality in rotasonic boreholes or boreholes produced with similar dual-casing drilling methods. The system accommo-dates up to 15 monitoring intervals within one hole {{and can be}} used to monitor overburden and/or bedrock to depths of 100 m (330 feet) or more. It is most effective where static water levels are shallower than 9 m (30 feet) below ground surface. Sand packs around each monitoring port define the monitoring interval, and bentonite seals placed above and below each sand pack isolate the intervals. Each sand and bentonite layer has a practical minimum length of 0. 5 m (1. 6 feet); therefore, a 15 port system can monitor, with maximum detail, a minimum vertical span of 15 m (50 feet). All system components, primarily <b>flush</b> <b>joint</b> polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casing segments, stainless steel ports, Teflon tubing, and PVC centralizers, are commercially available and require little preconstruction. An open 6 -mm (-inch) inner diameter tube is connected to each port for manual hydraulic head measurements and water sampling with a peristaltic pump. To assess installation and performance of the new system, nine rotasonic holes in overburden and bedrock between 20 - and 30 -m (65 - and 100 -feet) deep were monitored at two sites. This detailed vertical monitoring provided important information on hydraulic head and contaminant distributions that would have been missed with fewer monitoring intervals. The monitoring system offers unique advantages where detailed monitoring in heterogeneous settings is needed to understand ground water flow and contaminant migration or evaluate the performance of remediation efforts...|$|E
40|$|Flush {{repairs to}} {{military}} aircraft {{are expected to}} become more prevalent as more thick skin composites are used, particularly {{on the surface of}} the fuselage, wings and other external surfaces. The use of these repairs, whilst difficult to manufacture provide an aerodynamic, “stealthy” finish that is also more structurally efficient than overlap repairs. This research was undertaken to improve the design methodology of scarf repairs with reduced material removal and to investigate the damage tolerance of scarf repair to low velocity impact damage. Scarf repairs involve shallow bevel angles to ensure the shear stress in the adhesive does not exceed allowable strength. This is important when repairing structures that need to withstand hot and humid conditions, when the adhesive properties degrade. Therefore, considerable amounts of parent material must be machined away prior to repair. The tips of the repair patch and the parent laminate are very sharp, thus a scarf repair is susceptible to accidental damage. The original contributions include: •	Developed analytic means of predicting the stresses within optimised scarf joints with dissimilar materials. New equations were developed and solved using numerical algorithms. •	Verified using finite element modelling that a scarfed insert with dissimilar modulus subjected to uniaxial loading attracted the same amount of load as an insert without a scarf. As such, the simple analytic formula used to predict load attraction/diversion through a plate with an insert may be used to predict the load attraction/diversion into a scarf repair that contains a dissimilar adherend patch. •	Developed a more efficient <b>flush</b> <b>joint</b> with a doubler insert placed near the mid line of the parent structure material. This joint configuration has a lower load eccentricity than external doubler joint. •	Investigated the damage tolerance of scarf joints, with and without the external doubler. The results showed that scarf joints without external doublers exhibited a considerable strength reduction following low velocity impact. Based on the observations, the major damage mechanics in the scarf joint region following impact have been identified. These results demonstrated that it is important to incorporate damage tolerance in the design of scarf repairs...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the existing flush rivet inspection criteria and inspection methods to establish a norm for commercial <b>flush</b> riveted <b>joints.</b> Studies were made of thirty-four <b>flush</b> riveted <b>joint</b> load deformation curves to obtain their general characteristics and to establish some correlation of yield load as defined in ANC- 5 and as defined in Report on <b>Flush</b> Riveted <b>Joint</b> Strength by ARC Rivet and Screw Allowables Subcommittee (Airworthiness Project 12). The specimens corresponding to the load deformation curves were comprised of 18 machine countersunk joints, 12 double dimple joints and four sub-countersunk joints. Within each type of joints the specimen varied in series of sheet material and thickness, rivet material and rivet size. It is shown that yield load, defined as load giving four percent of rivet diameter joint set, is dependent on d/t ratios, the yield load lowering at increasing d/t values. Also, there are indications that as softer rivet material is used with a given sheet material, the increasing d/t ratios have less adverse effects. There could be made no particular correlation of yield load as defined by load at. 005 " set with any of the varying parameters. In the case of the double dimple and sub-countersunk joints, no particular conclusions could be reached as the test data was confined to a small range of d/t values. It was concluded from the countersunk rivet data that permanent set based on rivet diameter is a more reasonable yield criterion than permanent set based on an arbitrary constant. ...|$|R

We studied Scytomonas and Decastava ultrastructure. Scytomonas saepesedens feeds when sessile with actively beating cilium, and has five pellicular strips with <b>flush</b> <b>joints</b> and Calycimonas-like microtubule-supported cytopharynx. Decastava, sister to Keelungia forming new clade Decastavida on 18 S rDNA trees, has 10 broad strips with cusp-like joints, not bifurcate ridges like Ploeotia and Serpenomonas (phylogenetically and cytologically distinct genera), and Serpenomonas-like feeding apparatus (8 – 9 unreinforced microtubule pairs loop from dorsal jaw support to cytostome). Hsp 90 and 18 S rDNA trees group Scytomonas with Petalomonas and show Entosiphon as the earliest euglenoid branch. Basal euglenoids have rigid longitudinal strips; derived clade Spirocuta has spiral often slideable strips. Decastava Hsp 90 genes have introns. Decastava/Entosiphon Hsp 90 frameshifts imply insertional RNA editing. Petalomonas is too heterogeneous in pellicle structure for one genus; we retain Scytomonas (sometimes lumped with it) and segregate four former Petalomonas as new genus Biundula with pellicle cross section showing 2 – 8 smooth undulations and typified by Biundula (=Petalomonas) sphagnophila comb. n.

The blocks were fit together like a puzzle, forming load-bearing joints {{without the use of}} mortar. One common engineering technique involves cutting the top of the lower stone at a certain angle, and placing another stone on top of it which was cut at the same angle. The precision with which these angles have been utilized to create <b>flush</b> <b>joints</b> is indicative of a highly sophisticated knowledge of stone-cutting and a thorough understanding of descriptive geometry.

The blocks were so precisely cut as to suggest the possibility of prefabrication and mass production, technologies far in advance of the Tiwanaku’s Inca successors hundreds of years later. Some of the stones are in an unfinished state, showing some of the techniques used to shape them. They were initially pounded by stone hammers, which can still be found in numbers on local andesite quarries, creating depressions, and then slowly ground and polished with flat stones and sand.|$|R

30|$|Although AET {{can improve}} {{disease-free}} survival {{in breast cancer}} patients, some studies indicated that it is associated with considerable side effects that negatively impact women’s well-being (von Blanckenburg et al. 2013). During AET, many breast cancer patients can experience a range of physical and psychological side effects such as hot <b>flushes,</b> <b>joint</b> pain and emotional distress (ED) (Rosenberg et al. 2015; van Londen et al. 2014; Bower 2008). Distress is a multifactorial unpleasant emotional experience of a psychological, social and/or spiritual nature that may interfere {{with the ability to}} cope effectively with cancer, its symptoms and its physical treatment (National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2011). While most of the previous studies focused on the physical adverse effects in women taking AET, very few studies addressed the emotional problems such as anxiety and depression among these patients (Rosenberg et al. 2015). From these limited studies, Ploos van Amstel et al. 2013 conducted research among breast cancer survivors of whom 37  % were still treated with hormonal therapy and showed that one-third of all cancer survivors experienced distress. However in a different study, it was reported that depression scores were within the normal range in patients treated with tamoxifen or raloxifene in comparison to healthy women in similar age group (Land et al. 2006). More specifically, Schilder et al.

40|$|Traditionally, steel joints are {{calculated}} by the calculation rules {{described in the}} Eurocode 3 : NEN-EN 1993 - 1 - 8. Effective lengths are important parameters to determine the different resistances of the components in the steel joint.

This thesis reports on a comparative study of the traditional calculation method and a method which is using partial FEA for determining the resistance of joints.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} European historical log construction has heightened the need for comprehensive studies {{in different parts of}} the continent to view both the common features and the particular ones. The advanced Scandinavian research has revealed the problems of studying in depth and maintaining the log heritage when links to traditional carpentry are lost. One of the fortunate places where the log building was not interrupted and where a rich heritage in wood survives is the historical region of Maramures, today partitioned between Ukraine and Romania. The main purpose of this work is to trace the tradition of building wooden churches in central and southern Maramures from the beginning of the 16 th century to the turn of the 18 th century. Since the knowledge used to build the local wooden churches circulated throughout the European continent their understanding is of high interest long outside the region. For the present work the main sources of information are the 42 extant wooden churches, about one third of their total two centuries ago, and the outcome highly relies on their intimate reading. Another major source of knowledge is still saved by a decreasing number of practicing senior carpenters with relevant knowledge and skills in traditional carpentry. The present research was naturally concentrated on the fieldwork, where the investigation of all the extant wooden churches was complemented by interviews with active craftsmen. In search for the main sizes with relevance for their characteristic design, of central importance was to measure at the very base of each construction, the place where the builder evidently had to take key decisions. The present work is arranged in a triangle with the intention to approach the wooden churches from the following three perspectives: the local vernacular architecture, the builders and the commissioners. The first chapter is primarily concerned with the individuality of the wooden churches within the local vernacular building tradition, challenging for the first time the earlier conception of uniformity. From the Middle Ages until the turn of the 18 th century the skills, knowledge and experience to build ample log structures with plane and well sealed walls, as well as with <b>flush</b> <b>joints,</b> were performances out of the ordinary. The craftsmen from Maramures who were able to reach such levels were not simple peasants but well specialised church carpenters who inherited and maintained this advanced knowledge to exclusively build houses of worship. Since the local tradition to erect wooden churches depended on those who build and used, it is fundamental to identify the local builders and founders. The earlier blurred distinction between them veiled their separate roles in shaping the wooden churches and hindered us from a clear understanding of the results. For this reason the following two chapters are concerned with the church carpenters and the founders of churches as well as their general contribution to the local wooden churches. The extant wooden churches from Maramures reveal the existence during the 17 th and 18 th centuries of at least two main family schools of church carpenters. There are further distinguishable three main itineraries and numerous smaller ones, indicating the work of some of the most important church carpenters ever active in the region and in some cases even shifts among generations. In general, the church carpenters stood for the technical performances, the high quality of the wood work and the artistic refinement. In a long perspective, the true creators of the local wooden churches were actually the commissioning founders. Especially the role of the noble founders of Eastern rite was decisive in the formation of a regional character among the local wooden churches. The wooden churches from Maramures closely mirror the local society of modest country landlords, manifesting themselves along several centuries in their double condition of Eastern Christians and Western nobles. The wooden churches from Maramures open necessary connections with similar performances throughout Europe. Seemingly the local distinction made between sacred and profane rooms was characteristic for many other rural regions on the continent. The highest knowledge in log building seems to have had a sacred purpose with wide continental circulation and therefore in many places requires distinction from the more regionally rooted vernacular one...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{communication}} the recent works {{done by the}} Rheumatism Research Group of Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Okayama University, are described. The principal findings may briefly be summarized as follows. 1. Pathohistological pictures of the synovial membrane are classified into six types. Among them, Fibrinoid type and Follicular-Fibrosis type are the representative ones of chronic rheumatoid arthritis. 2. For {{the evaluation of the}} systemic as well as the local activities in rheumatoid arthritis and for judging the therapeutic effect, some indices have been established. 3. Injection of steroid hormones into the local joints fails to give satisfactory results in advanced, chronic rheumatoid arthritis. In such instances the <b>flushing</b> of the <b>joint</b> with physiological saline solution is effective. 4. In the case of chronic rheumatoid arthritis where the inflammation of hand and phalangeal joints is marked, RA-test gives rapid and more intense reaction, and most of such cases are of Follicular-Fibrosis type. 5. When lymph follicles appearing in the synovial membrane are stained when methyl green pyronine, the arrangement of lymphoid cells and plasma cells becomes distinctly clear. By micro-autoradiographic observations {{it can be seen that}} ³H-thymindine injected into the joint cavity is mostly ingested by the lymphoid cells in lymph follicles. 6. In the observation by the fluorescent antibody method multinuclear leucocytes found in the joint fluid and in the peripheral blood react with 19 S and 7 S-gamma-globulins. 7. When the serum and the joint fluid of the patient with rheumatoid arthritis are fractionated, they separate into three peaks at 19 S, 7 S, and 4 S. Both S. S. C. A. -test and L. F. T. tests reveal the peak at 19 S. The serum of chronic hepatitis positive to RA-test and the serum of rheumatoid arthritis are found to react immunologically the same to anti-&# 946; 2 M globulin sheep serum. 8. When the reticulo-endothelial system of rat is blocked by 900, 000 molecules of poly-vinyl-pyrroridon, the ability of antibody production is diminished. 9. Chemical synovectomy of injecting osmic acid is effective to FibrinoidCoating type. Its action mechanism lies in the complete cleaning of the surface of synovial membrane. 10. By radiating synovectomy with 193 Au a fairly good result can be expected. 198 Au is ingested by those cells in the surface layer of the synovial membrane and also by histiocytes in the synovial membrane. When 5 mc of 198 Au are injected into the knee joint, a marked necrosis of the synovial membrane occurs. When 198 Au is added to the ascites cells of rabbit during the tissue culture, in the concentration of over 14 &# 956;C degeneration of these cells can be recognized. 11. From the examination results of prognosis on those 25 cases with 41 rheumatoid knee joints after surgical synovectomy, it is considered that this method is indicated for Follicular-Fibrosis type. Ones with rheumatoid knee joint of Fibrinoid-Coating type gold sol treatment should be resorted to. In the cases of hand joints, surgical synovectemy is to be recommended at a relatively early stage. </p...|$|R
