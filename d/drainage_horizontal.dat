50|$|During the 17th century {{there were}} several {{measures}} taken to improve the situation {{and some of the}} mine shares were taken over by the state treasury but mining only developed very slowly after that. In the 18th century, the Slavkov and Krásno mining areas underwent a number of changes aimed at reconstructing the old mining works and reviving mining under a new policy. There was some modernization of operations, fundamental changes in mine <b>drainage,</b> <b>horizontal</b> transport, the introduction of trolleys and piece rates. At the beginning of the 8th century, the state invested around {{a quarter of a million}} guilders in the mines but this money was not used with great efficiency. The necessity of making savings became evident and the relatively spendthrift activities in operation were soon restricted so that by the end of the 1670s they had come to a complete halt. Only one undertaking remained in continuous operation and this was progressively assigned to various owners and modernized. The proceeds from mining did not match the costs and so it went bankrupt several times. After the First World War, the significance of the Slavkov-Krásno mining area increased again; an especially promising area was the mining of wolfram ore and tin. A new shaft was sunk but in 1920 work was again stopped. Prospecting work was carried out progressively but until the Second World War the mines remained out of active operation.|$|E

The outbreak {{occurred in the}} ICU of a Spanish hospital from March 2009 to November 2011 and evolved over four waves. Forty-two patients were affected. First basic (active surveillance, contact precautions and reinforcement of surface cleaning) and later additional control measures (nurse cohorting and establishment of a minimum patient/nurse ratio) were implemented. Screening of ICU staff was repeatedly negative. Initial environmental cultures, including dry surfaces, were also negative. The above measures temporarily controlled cross-transmission but failed to eradicate the epidemic MDRKO strain that reappeared {{two weeks after the}} last colonized patients in waves 2 and 3 had been discharged. Therefore, an occult environmental reservoir was suspected. Samples from the drainpipes and traps of a sink were positive; removal of the sink reduced the rate number but did not stop new cases that clustered in a cubicle whose <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> system was connected with the eliminated sink. The elimination of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> system finally eradicated the outbreak. In conclusion, damp environmental reservoirs (mainly sink drains, traps and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> system) could explain why standard cross-transmission control measures failed to control the outbreak; such reservoirs should be considered even when environmental cultures of surfaces are negative...|$|R

40|$|When {{estimating}} the time-rate of settlement for foundation soils treated with vertical drains, understanding the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> {{behavior of the}} soil is important because the time of consolidation settlement may be critical to the overall construction schedule and sequencing.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{extensively}} {{studied in}} the past, drainage of aqueous foams still offers major unaddressed issues. Among them, the behaviour of foam films during drainage has great significance as {{the thickness of the}} films is known to control the Ostwald ripening in foams, which in turn impacts liquid drainage. We propose a model relating the films' behavior to the liquid flow in foam channels. It is assumed that Marangoni driven recirculation counter flows take place in the transitional region between the foam channel and the adjoining films, and the Gibbs elasticity is therefore introduced as a relevant parameter. The velocity of these counter flows is found to be proportional to the liquid velocity in the channel. The resulting channel permeability is determined and it is shown that Marangoni stresses do not contribute to rigidify the channel's surfaces, in strong contrast with the <b>drainage</b> of <b>horizontal</b> thin liquid films.

40|$|Piezometric {{fluctuations}} {{may affect}} {{the stability of the}} riverbanks by determining suffusion, i. e. the removal of fine particles from the soil when the filtration rate is high. Suffusion, or underground erosion, can reduce the mechanical properties of the soil and promote its landslide. A huge number of Lombardy Valley (Northern Italy) is affected by problems related to the progressive degradation of the mechanical strength of the alluvial deposits due to underground erosion or piping In some cases it results in the formation of large cavities whereas in other ones the phenomenon is limited to a removal of fine particles (overall silty sands and silt). The critical velocity able to trigger suffusion is exceeded when the hydraulic gradient is particularly high, i. e. due to piezometric fluctuations during flood. Therefore, <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> systems can be installed nearby riverbanks in order to reduce these fluctuations in piezometric levels during the floods of watercourses. The goal of this research project was to investigate the effectiveness of <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> arranged parallel to the river to reduce piezometric oscillations in the riverbanks in transient state and considering the position of drainage system respect to the bedrock. The new analytical formulation proposed in this paper allowed to design a drainage system that can increase the slopes stability, reducing suffusion occurring in the riverbanks.

40|$|AbstractA {{laboratory}} test {{was performed to}} assess the effectiveness of vacuum preloading incorporated with electroosmotic (EOM) treatment on silty clay (combined method) for reclamation projects like new disposal ponds, where the horizontal electrode configurations beneath the soil layer were possible and the drainage pipes and the prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) system could be easily installed in advance before the sludge dragged from sea bed or river bed was filled into the site. Three groups of tests were conducted on the silty clay from Qinhuai River in Nanjing, China. The model is able to apply vacuum pressure {{at the bottom of}} the soil layer and a direct current electric field simultaneously. It is also possible to measure the pore pressures at different depths of soil column, and the changes in settlement and volume with the elapsed time. In this study, the vacuum preloading method, vacuum preloading applied at the bottom (VAB method), was applied and the cathodes were installed beneath the soil layer. The results obtained indicate substantial reduction in water content, and increases in dry density and undrained shear strength in comparison with those obtained by the vacuum preloading only, particularly at the positions close to the anode. The combined method utilizes the vertical drainage flow created by the electroosmosis integrating the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> flow created mostly by the vacuum pressure. The total drainage flow can be calculated as a result of the vertical drainage flow by electroosmosis only and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> flow by the vacuum preloading only. The way of placement of the cathode and the anode in the combined method also overcomes the disadvantage of EOM method itself, i. e. the appearance of cracks between the anode and the surrounding soil. Moreover, it is observed that the vacuum preloading plays a primary role in earlier stage in deduction of free pore water; meanwhile, the electroosmotic method is more efficient in later stage for absorbing water in the diffused double layers of soil...|$|R
40|$|Vertical drains {{increase}} {{the rate of}} consolidation in soft soils by facilitating faster dissipation of excess pore water pressure through short, <b>horizontal</b> <b>drainage</b> paths. This paper presents an analytical solution for non-linear radial consolidation under equal-strain conditions incorporating smear but ignoring well resistance.

The analytical solution to non-linear radial consolidation can explicitly capture the behaviour of both overconsolidated and normally consolidated soils. For non-linear material properties, consolidation may be faster or slower {{when compared with the}} cases with constant material properties. The difference depends on the compressibility/ permeability ratios (Cc/Ck and Cr/Ck), the preconsolidation pressure and the stress increase.
