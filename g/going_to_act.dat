25|$|Due to post 1978 festival {{intimidation}} by {{the media}} concerning the public smoking of marijuana at Nambassa, and whether the police were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on it in 1979, 58 people were arrested for cannabis {{on the first day}} of Nambassa 1979. As a response, tens of thousands of festival goers marched up the hill of the main auditorium to the police compound, threatening to storm it if the arrests did not cease. Festival organiser Peter Terry arranged a meeting with the police principals and advised them that they had made their point. He told the police that they themselves had become the focus of disruption, threatening the peaceful outcome of the event. He advised the police that if the arrests continued then he too would join the civil disobedience campaign to have them removed from the festival site. The police discontinued their arrest policy. Peter Terry was advised that the New Zealand Defence Force had been placed on standby as a precaution to any further protest directed at the police.|$|E

500|$|Late at night, while {{investigating}} an orchard, Mulder is sprayed by a crop-dusting {{helicopter and}} {{ends up in the}} hospital. There, Mulder sees the message [...] "Do It Now" [...] on a TV and realizes that when people are exposed to the pesticide, which contains a chemical called LSDM designed to provoke fear in insects, they see these subliminal messages, and their phobias are exacerbated enough to cause them to kill. Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> on his paranoia. Funsch positions himself {{at the top of a}} clock tower overlooking a blood drive and begins shooting randomly. Mulder climbs up to Funsch and overpowers him; Funsch is taken away on a stretcher. Mulder makes a call to Scully and sees the message [...] "All done. Bye Bye" [...] on his cell phone display. Scully calls out to Mulder but he is speechless.|$|E

2500|$|In winter 755, An, finally {{feeling he}} had no choice but to rebel, did so. [...] The {{imperial}} officials were all apprehensive, because An had the strongest troops of the realm at the time, except for Yang, who believed that An could be suppressed easily. [...] However, An's forces roved through the region north of the Yellow River easily, reaching Luoyang around the new year 756 and capturing easily despite the efforts of Feng Changqing to defend it. [...] In response, Emperor Xuanzong considered passing the throne to Li Heng and personally lead the troops against An—a proposal that Yang feared, believing that Li Heng would then take actions against the Yangs. [...] He had Consort Yang dissuade Emperor Xuanzong from both actions. [...] Meanwhile, Geshu was summoned to Chang'an to command the forces against An—and Geshu was then able to manufacture evidence that An's stepfather's nephew An Sishun, whom Geshu also disliked, was complicit in An Lushan's rebellion, and An Sishun was executed. [...] Yang, after this incident, began to be apprehensive of Geshu as well. [...] When Geshu subsequently took defensive position at Tong Pass and refused to engage An's forces, reasoning that as long as he kept Chang'an secure, the other generals Li Guangbi and Guo Ziyi would soon be able to capture An's power base at Fanyang and render An harmless. [...] Yang, however, feared that Geshu was instead plotting against him. [...] (Geshu's deputy Wang Sili (王思禮) did suggest to Geshu that he kill Yang when he could, but Geshu refused.) [...] Yang therefore sent his associate Du Qianhui (杜乾輝) with a separate army command to the front as well to watch Geshu, and Geshu, in turn apprehensive that Yang was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> against him, found an excuse to execute Du, further causing Yang's suspicions. [...] Yang therefore had Emperor Xuanzong order Geshu to engage An's forward commander Cui Qianyou (崔乾祐), despite Geshu's repeated protestations that a battle was inadvisable. [...] Once the armies engaged, Tang forces were crushed by Cui's forces; Geshu was captured, and Tong Pass fell on July 10.|$|E
