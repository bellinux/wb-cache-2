40|$|ABSTRACT Laminar {{flow through}} a conduit {{is equal to}} the mean {{velocity}} times the cross-sectional area of the orifice. Therefore, volume {{is equal to the}} time-velocity integral multiplied by the cross-sectional area. In aortic stenosis, flow in the stenotic jet is laminar and the aortic valve area should be equal to the volume of blood ejected through the <b>valve</b> <b>divided</b> by the time-velocity integral of the aortic jet velocity recorded by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. To test whether this concept can be used to accurately determine aortic valve area noninvasively by the Doppler method, 39 patients (age 35 to 82 years, mean 63) underwent pulsed Doppler combined with two-dimensional echocardiog-raphy for measurement of stroke volume at the aortic, pulmonic, and mitral anulus as well as continu-ous-wave Doppler recording of the aortic jet. Aortic valve area determined at cardiac catheterization by the Gorlin equation ranged between 0. 4 and 2. 07 cm 2 (mean 0. 89 + 0. 45). Doppler-derived valve area, determined with the stroke volume value from either the aortic, pulmonic, or mitral anulus, correlated well with the area determined at cardiac catheterization (r =. 95,. 97, and. 96, respectively). A simplified method for measuring aortic valve area derived as the cross-sectional area of the aortic anulus times peak velocity just proximal to the aortic <b>valve</b> <b>divided</b> by peak aortic jet velocity correlated well with measurements obtained at cardiac catheterization (r =. 94). An excellent separation between critical and noncritical aortic stenosis was seen using either one of the Doppler methods. Thus, combined pulsed and continuous-wave Doppler can be used to accurately measure valve area in adult patients with aortic stenosis...|$|R

40|$|The {{members of}} the order Callipodida are best {{recognized}} by their putative apomorphies: a divided hypoproct, <b>divided</b> anal <b>valves,</b> long extrusible tubular vulvae, and, as in all other helminthomorph milli-pede orders, a characteristic conformation of the male gonopods. As in Polydesmida, only the first leg pair of the 7 th body ring is transformed into gonopods, which are retracted inside the body. Body rings are open ventrally and are not fused with the sternites, leaving the coxae of the legs free. Legs in the anterior half of the body carry coxal pouches. The small collum does not overlap the head. Callipodida are of uniformly cylindrical external appearance. The number of body rings is only sometimes fixed in species and usually exceeds 40. There are nine antennomeres, as the 2 nd antennomere of other Diplopoda is subdivided (= antennomere 2 and 3 in Callipodida). The general struc-ture of the gnathochilarium is shared with the Chordeumatida and Polydesmida. Callipodida {{are said to be}} characterised by longitudinal crests, which gives the order the common name “crested millipedes”. Although crest are present in most species, some genera (e. g.

40|$|The aortic <b>valve</b> <b>divides</b> {{the left}} {{ventricular}} outflow tract (LVOT) from the ascending aorta and its normal or abnormal function {{has a great}} impact on regulating physiological hemodynamic parameters. It is well known that the presence of aortic valve stenosis or insufficiency results in impaired hemodynamics with direct and dire consequences on the left ventricle. On the other hand, when normal, the valve and the root have long been perceived as a type of passive gate dividing the left ventricle from the ascending aorta and preventing any reversal of flow, with minimal effect on valve hemodynamics. However, two points need to be stressed. First, the aortic valve has to be considered a complex unit along with the other components of the aortic root, the sinuses and the sino-tubular (ST) junction (1).

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} the accuracy and utility of single-plane transesophageal echocardiography in analyzing atrioventricular (AV) septal defect, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was performed {{before and after}} institution of cardiopulmonary bypass in 16 patients (age 24 days to 14 years, weight 3 to 47 kg). Prebypass transesophageal echocardiography (including two-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler color flow mapping and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound) correctly diagnosed <b>divided</b> AV <b>valve,</b> common AV valve and unbalanced AV valve, as well as atrial or ventricular septal defect, or both, in all cases. It correctly analyzed AV valve regurgitation in all 10 patients with right and all 14 with left AV valve regurgitation and correctly analyzed 30 of 33 additional cardiac anomalies. Transesophageal echocardiography was able to detect the absence of normal pulmonary venous connections but failed to demonstrate all of the complex anomalous pulmonary venous connections in three patients with atrial isomerism. Postbypass transesophageal echocardiography documented {{the absence of a}} significant residual shunt in 11 of 11 patients undergoing corrective surgery and verified residual AV valve regurgitation in 7 of 9 patients with tricuspid regurgitation and 11 of 13 with mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiographic information that altered or refined the surgical treatment was obtained in 5 (31 %) of 16 patients. Epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography results were concordant in all 13 patients in whom both were performed.

40|$|The flow {{downstream}} from the St Jude valve prosthesis is studied in vitro in both steady and pulsatile flow. Conditions for the pulsatile flow studies approximate the in vivo resting state. Laser-Doppler anemometry (LDA) {{is used to}} measure instantaneous point velocities at numerous locations pre-selected to conform to a systematic, flow-mapping measurement methodology. Overall, {{the results for the}} St Jude valve indicate a relatively undis-turbed forward flow through the prosthesis. The acceleration ratios, defined as the maximum mean axial velocity for the St Jude <b>valve</b> <b>divided</b> by that for no valve obstructing the flow, are small, being 1. 2 and 1. 4 for steady and pulsatile flow, respectively. Both the secondary flow structure and the flow disturbance produced by this valve are minimal. Maximum mean velocities in the radial and azimuthal directions are only about 5 - 10 per cent of that in the axial direction. There is. however, notable evidence of flow wakes generated by the valve’s opened leaflets. Velocity defects caused by these wakes are found to be as much as 50 per cent. The bulk flow through this valve is in this sense quite unlike that reported by others for the natural aortic valve studied in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Calculated valve area depicts {{anatomical}} stenosis {{but does}} not quantify hemodynamic impairment. We propose that hemodynamic resistance, defined as the mean pressure gradient across the <b>valve</b> <b>divided</b> by mean flow rate during systolic ejection, gives a better indication of hemodynamic obstruction. This index was compared with Gorlin valve area in 40 patients with aortic stenosis. Calculated area ranged from 0. 22 to 1. 26 cm 2, and mean transvalvular resistance ranged from 117 to 1, 244 dyne. sec. cm 5. In general, resistance varied inversely with calculated area, but there was substantial variation about the mean relation. All of the variation could {{be accounted for by}} variations in the pressure gradients at each value of calculated area. Resistance was higher in proportion to area when flow and pressure gradient were high. Analysis of five published studies of a total of 83 valves showed that calculated area changed at least three times more than resistance when pressure gradient was varied. The utility of resistance as an index of stenosis is demonstrated by example calculations that show how during exercise a stenotic valve increases the ventricular work rate out of proportion to the work done on the peripheral resistance. These calculations are possible because hemodynamic resistance defines functional impairment in units commonly used for quantification o...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{mortality}} following {{repair of}} atrioventricular septal defects has fallen {{dramatically in the}} last 4 decades, but reoperation for late regurgitation across the left atrioventricular valve has remained disconcertingly stagnant. Seeking potential structural causes, we compared the morphology of the surgically created septal leaflet of the left valve following repair of atrioventricular septal defects to the aortic leaflet of the normal mitral valve. MethodsWe compared the mitral valves of 92 normal hearts to the left ventricular components of the bridging leaflets of hearts with atrioventricular septal defect with common atrioventricular junction, determining {{the shape of the}} leaflets and the arrangement of the subvalvar apparatus. ResultsThe aortic leaflet of the mitral valve is triangular compared with its rectangular septal counterpart after repair of atrioventricular septal defect. The cordal arrangement in the mitral valve is well organized, compared with the deficient cordal arrangement of the abnormal valve. A greater proportion of cords in the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>divide</b> to 3 generations (55. 5 % compared with 8. 7 %; P <. 001), and a higher percentage of cords remain undivided in atrioventricular septal defects (60. 8 % compared with 25 %; P <. 001). ConclusionsNot only is the annular component in the left atrioventricular valve abnormal, but the subvalvar apparatus is characterized by deficiency and disarray. Furthermore, the axis of cordal insertion may potentiate to separation over the long term of the leaflets joined surgically. Valvar repair in this setting will never restore the arrangement of the normal mitral valve...|$|R

Shell is thick and {{rectangular}} {{in shape and}} can be compressed or inflated; umbos do not extend above the hinge line (Cicerello, R. and Schuster, G. 2003). The cardinal teeth are large and serrated, while the lateral teeth are long and curved. Shell color ranges from dark brown to black and is covered with small bumps and has fluted ridges: nacre is white to gray color.Life Cycle:Megalonaias nervous mussels are sexually mature around 8 years of age, they are late tachytictic breeders. From July to October the males are mature, while they female contain eggs from August through October (Hollandbartels, L. 1993). Megalonaias nervosa males release sperm and the females collect the sperm through the incurrent siphon. The eggs are fertilized internally. Megalonaias nervosa has a parasitic larva stage called glochidia, the mussel uses a lure to attract fish and then releases the glochidia when the fish is close enough. The glochidia latch onto the gills or fins of the fish and remain there feeding of {{the blood of the}} fish until the glochidia reach the juvenile stage. Known host species for Megalonaias nervosa include longnose gar (Lepisosteus ossues), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), slender-head darter (Percina phoxocephala), and log perch (Percina caprodes) (O’Dee, S. and Watters, T. 1998). Parent mussel provides no care once the glochidia are released. Megalonaias nervosa are filter feeders, waste is released through the excurrent siphon. They are sedentary creatures and are anchored to the substrate or buried in the substrate. Studies had shown water temperature plays a role in reproduction, if the water temperature is too low, the mussels will not reproduce.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{intracardiac}} assist devices is expanding, {{and correct}} position {{of these devices}} is required for optimal functioning. The aortic valve is an important landmark for positioning of those devices. It would be of great value if the device position could be easily monitored on plain supine chest radiograph in the ICU. We introduce a ratio-based tool for determination of the aortic valve location on plain supine chest radiograph images, {{which can be used}} to evaluate intracardiac device position. Retrospective observational study. Large academic medical center. Patients admitted to the ICU and supported by an intracardiac assist device. We developed a ratio to determine the aortic valve location on supine chest radiograph images. This ratio is used to assess the position of a cardiac assist device and is compared with echocardiographic findings. Supine anterior-posterior chest radiographs of patients with an aortic valve prosthesis (n = 473) were analyzed to determine the location of the aortic valve. We calculated several ratios with the potential to determine the position of the aortic valve. The aortic valve location ratio, defined as the distance between the carina and the aortic <b>valve,</b> <b>divided</b> by the thoracic width, was found to be the best performing ratio. The aortic valve location ratio determines the location of the aortic valve caudal to the carina, at a distance of 0. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 05 times the thoracic width for male patients and 0. 28 [*]±[*] 0. 05 times the thoracic width for female patients. The aortic valve location ratio was validated using CT images of patients with angina pectoris without known valvular disease (n = 95). There was a good correlation between cardiac device position (Impella) assessed with the aortic valve location ratio and with echocardiography (n = 53). The aortic valve location ratio enables accurate and reproducible localization of the aortic valve on supine chest radiograph.

40|$|The {{off-cycle}} {{refrigerant mass}} migration {{has a direct}} influence on the on-cycle performance since compressor energy is necessary to redistribute the refrigerant mass. No studies, as of today, {{are available in the}} open literature which experimentally measured the lubricant migration within a refrigeration system during cycling or stop/start transients. Therefore, experimental procedures measuring the refrigerant and lubricant migration through the major components of a refrigeration system during stop/start transients were developed and implemented. Results identifying the underlying physics are presented. The refrigerant and lubricant migration of an R 134 a automotive A/C system-utilizing a fixed orifice tube, minichannel condenser, plate and fin evaporator, U-tube type accumulator and fixed displacement compressor-was measured across five sections <b>divided</b> by ball <b>valves.</b> Using the Quick-Closing Valve Technique (QCVT) combined with the Remove and Weigh Technique (RWT) using liquid nitrogen as the condensing agent resulted in a measurement uncertainty of 0. 4 percent regarding the total refrigerant mass in the system. The determination of the lubricant mass distribution was achieved by employing three different techniques-Remove and Weigh, Mix and Sample, and Flushing. To employ the Mix and Sample Technique a device-called the Mix and Sample Device-was built. A method to separate the refrigerant and lubricant was developed with an accuracy-after separation-of 0. 04 grams of refrigerant left in the lubricant. When applying the three techniques, the total amount of lubricant mass in the system was determined to within two percent. The combination of measurement results-infrared photography and high speed and real time videography-provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of refrigerant and lubricant migration during stop-start operation. During the compressor stop period, the primary refrigerant mass migration is caused by, and follows, the diminishing pressure difference across the expansion device. The secondary refrigerant migration is caused by a pressure gradient as a result of thermal nonequilibrium within the system and causes only vapor phase refrigerant migration. Lubricant migration is proportional to the refrigerant mass during the primary refrigerant mass migration. During the secondary refrigerant mass migration lubricant is not migrating. The start-up refrigerant mass migration is caused by an imbalance of the refrigerant mass flow rates across the compressor and expansion device. The higher compressor refrigerant mass flow rate was a result of the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator. The lubricant mass migration during the start-up was not proportional to the refrigerant mass migration. The presence of water condensate on the evaporator affected the refrigerant mass migration during the compressor stop period. Caused by an evaporative cooling effect the evaporator held 56 percent of the total refrigerant mass in the system after three minutes of compressor stop time-compared to 25 percent when no water condensate was present on the evaporator coil. Foam entrainment led to a faster lubricant and refrigerant mass migration out of the accumulator than liquid entrainment through the hole {{at the bottom of the}} U-tube. The latter was observed for when water condensate was present on the evaporator coil because-as a result of the higher amount of refrigerant mass in the evaporator before start-up-the entrainment of foam into the U-tube of the accumulator ceased before the steady state refrigerant mass distribution was reached...|$|R
