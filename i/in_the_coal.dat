30|$|<b>The</b> maceral-mineral {{associations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> {{are called}} carbominerites. The association {{is related to}} the genesis of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> and <b>the</b> macerals <b>in</b> particular. <b>The</b> carbominerite has been characterized as carbargilite, carbankerite and carbopyrite with their quantitative assessment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> of Mand-Raigarh coalfield, carbominerite range from 0.94  % to 28.22  %, mean 9.11  %. This includes carbargilite from 0.37  % to 26.76  %, mean 8.18  %; carbopyrite from nil to 1.91  %, mean 0.50  % and carbankerite from nil to 5.10  %, mean 0.38  % (Table  3). The dominance of carbargillite is suggestive of enrichment of clastic minerals and high water cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basin.|$|R

5|$|Due {{to reduced}} demand for coal, {{resulting}} {{from an economic}} downturn, many of CF's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E
5|$|During the {{communist}} era, rapid urbanization {{and growth of}} heavy industry occurred. Whole villages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> mining areas were destroyed by the mining activity. These conditions quickened the assimilation of the Poles. Another cause of assimilation was {{the high rate of}} intermarriage. Besides Poles belonging to the minority, many more commuted across the border from Polish People's Republic to work in Czechoslovakia or {{to take advantage of the}} relative abundance of consumer goods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, {{to a lesser}} extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E
5|$|Born in Canada West (later Ontario), Cameron {{worked as}} a {{merchant}} in his birth province and Manitoba before coming to Edmonton in 1881. In Edmonton he continued as a merchant, owning and operating a store for 15 years. In Edmonton he quickly {{established himself as a}} prominent citizen, serving on the inaugural Edmonton Board of Trade as president, which he would remain for five years. Cameron also was involved {{in the development of the}} Edmonton Public School Board, serving on the board in the 1890s. He was also involved in the town's politics, winning election to Edmonton's first town council in 1892 and serving an additional term when elected in 1895. After this retirement from politics, he worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> and real estate business until his death in 1919, at the age of 73. Upon his death, he was lauded as one of the pioneer citizens of Edmonton; a street, neighbourhood and ravine were named for him.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the first}} National Study of Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP) and the U. S. Geological Survey {{database}} of coal quality, we show that the prevalence of CWP in seven coal mine regions correlates with levels of bioavailable iron (BAI) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> from that particular region (correlation coefficient r = 0. 94, p < 0. 0015). CWP prevalence is also correlated with contents of pyritic sulfur (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 0048) or total iron (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 016) but not with coal rank (r = 0. 59, p < 0. 16) or silica (r = 0. 28, p < 0. 54). BAI was calculated using our model, taking into account chemical interactions of pyrite, sulfuric acid, calcite, and total iron. That is, iron present in coals can become bioavailable by pyrite oxidation, which produces ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid. Calcite is <b>the</b> major component <b>in</b> <b>coals</b> that neutralizes <b>the</b> available acid and inhibits iron's bioavailability. Therefore, levels of BAI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> {{are determined by the}} available amounts of acid after neutralization of calcite and the amount of total iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals.</b> Using <b>the</b> linear fit of CWP prevalence and <b>the</b> calculated BAI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seven <b>coal</b> mine regions, we have derived and mapped the pneumoconiotic potencies of 7, 000 coal samples. Our studies indicate that levels of BAI <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> may be used to predict coal's toxicity, even before large-scale mining.

5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119µg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> and cement industries.|$|E
5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Icelandics were {{exported}} to Great Britain before the 20th century {{to work as}} pit ponies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> mines, because of their strength and small size. However, those horses were never registered and little evidence of their existence remains. The first formal exports of Icelandic horses were to Germany in the 1940s. Great Britain's first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program. Other breeders in Great Britain followed McKintosh's lead, and the Icelandic Horse Society of Great Britain was formed in 1986. The number of Icelandic horses {{exported to}} other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid-19th century. Since 1969, multiple societies have worked together to preserve, improve and market these horses {{under the auspices of}} the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations. Today, the Icelandic remains a breed known for its purity of bloodline, and is the only horse breed present in Iceland.|$|E

5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from hydrogen production plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled. Asbestos used in the stations was removed prior to the demolition of the stations' structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most {{of the increase}} came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. Part of this increase {{can be attributed to}} the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, including Italians, who migrated to South Wales. Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethno-cultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh.|$|E
5|$|The town lies on {{the ancient}} Watling Street, but is not {{recorded}} before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal mining industry, especially after it became linked to the canal and railway networks in the mid-19th century, {{and by the end}} of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town with a population of over , of whom the vast majority were employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> industry. Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day. The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and leisure facilities.|$|E

5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1900, Kaiser Friedrich III {{replaced}} Kaiser Wilhelm II as the I Squadron flagship; the latter, as {{the fleet}} flagship, remained {{assigned to the}} squadron for tactical purposes. From 4 to 15 December, Kaiser Wilhelm II and the I Squadron went on a winter training cruise to Norway; the ships anchored at Larvik from 10 to 12 December. At 01:30 on 2 January 1901, she was steaming from Danzig to Kiel with Kaiser Friedrich III when the latter struck an underwater obstacle. The shock from the collision damaged the ship's boilers and started a fire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> bunkers. Kaiser Wilhelm II took her sister in tow, although the engines on Kaiser Friedrich III were restarted along the way. The ships eventually reached Kiel, where temporary repairs were conducted. Kaiser Wilhelm II went into drydock in January 1901 for overhaul and some modernization work. This included the reconstruction of a larger bridge {{and the removal of}} some of her searchlights. While the ship was laid up, Admiral Hans von Koester replaced Hoffmann as the fleet commander, a position he would hold until the end of 1906.|$|E
5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> and steel sector. Again, {{there were no}} national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E
30|$|The {{enrichment}} {{of arsenic}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> {{has generally been}} attributed to two genetic types: (1) terrigenous sediment region; (2) epigenetic mineralization, such as arsenic-rich hydrothermal fluids and sea water (Chen et al. 2002).
