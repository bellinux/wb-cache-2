50|$|Administrative {{controls}} are changes to workers' behavior to mitigate a hazard. They include training on best practices for safe handling, storage, {{and disposal of}} nanomaterials, proper awareness of hazards through labeling and warning signage, and encouraging a general safety culture. Administrative controls can complement engineering controls should they fail, or {{when they are not}} feasible or do not reduce exposures to an acceptable level. Some examples of good work practices include cleaning work spaces with wet-wiping methods or a HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner instead of dry sweeping with a broom, avoiding handling nanomaterials in a free particle state, storing nanomaterials in containers with tightly closed lids. Normal safety procedures such as hand washing, not storing or consuming food in the laboratory, and proper disposal of hazardous waste are also administrative controls. Other examples are limiting the time workers are handling a material or in a hazardous area, and <b>exposure</b> <b>monitoring</b> for the presence of nanomaterials.|$|E
5000|$|Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are {{preferred}} {{for establishing}} safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, {{the lack of}} publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers. Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often {{on the front line}} of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values. In the absence of OELs however, {{there are a variety of}} tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers. The [...] "Hierarchy of OELs" [...] provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable. These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods. These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods [...] Statistical tools are available to assess <b>exposure</b> <b>monitoring</b> data against OELs.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of personal exposure to particulate matter and its constituents requires samplers that are accurate, compact, lightweight, inexpensive and convenient to use. The Personal Particulate Organic and Mass Sampler (PPOMS) {{has been developed}} to meet these criteria. The PPOMS uses activated carbon-impregnated foam as a combined 2. 5 -µm size-selective inlet and denuder for assessment of fine particle mass and organic carbon. Proof of the PPOMS concept has been established by comparing mass and organic carbon in particles collected with collocated samplers in Seattle, at a central outdoor site and in residences. Daily particulate mass concentrations averaged 10. 0 ± 5. 2, 12. 0 ± 5. 3, and 11. 2 ± 5. 1 µg m- 3 for the Federal Reference Method, the Harvard Personal <b>Exposure</b> <b>Monitor,</b> and the PPOMS, respectively, for 10 24 -h sampling periods.

The analysis of VOC concentrations, the study of the topography of the city, and the use of different diagnostic ratios between the BTEX species showed that the vehicular traffic emissions were the predominant source of VOCs in the urban area of Modugno. Despite that the annual concentration of benzene is lower than the regulatory limit, the estimation of cancer risk showed that the global lifetime cancer risk attributed to the investigated VOC exposure was not negligible and therefore should be taken into account in future regulatory approaches...|$|R

Material and methods: Conducted is prospective, cross-section study by questionnaires in 2012. The survey included health profes-sionals in Primary Health Care Center in Tuzla. The final sample has 131 respondents (85 % women). Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS version 20. 0. Results: The prevalence rate of stab incidents throughout their career in our study was 66 %; while the rate of reported incidents was 4. 83 ~ 5 times lower than the actual prevalence. In 49 out of 87 cases this was a case of hollow needle prick. The most common causes of stab incidents are the time pressure, unforeseen reactions of patients and lack of concentration.
