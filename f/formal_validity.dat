40|$|Background: An {{essential}} {{characteristic of}} health impact assessment (HIA) {{is that it}} seeks {{to predict the future}} consequences of possible decisions for health.

Aims: To examine the philosophical basis for predictions and the relevance of different forms of validity to HIA. Conclusions: HIA is valid if <b>formal</b> <b>validity,</b> plausibility and predictive validity are in order. Both <b>formal</b> <b>validity</b> and plausibility can usually be established, but establishing predictive validity implies outcome evaluation of HIA. This is seldom feasible owing to long time lags, migration, measurement problems, a lack of data and sensitive indicators, and the fact that predictions may influence subsequent events.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For the Stoics, a {{syllogism}} is a formally valid argument; {{the primary}} function of their syllogistic {{is to establish}} such <b>formal</b> <b>validity.</b> Stoic syllogistic is a {{system of formal logic}} that relies on two types of argumental rules: (i) 5 rules (the accounts of the indemonstrables) which determine whether any given argument is an indemonstrable argument, i. e. an elementary syllogism the validity of which is not in need of further demonstration; (ii) one unary and three binary argumental rules which establish the <b>formal</b> <b>validity</b> of non-indemonstrable arguments by analysing them in one or more steps into one or more indemonstrable arguments (cut type rules and antilogism). The function of these rules is to reduce given non-indemonstrable arguments to indemonstrable syllogisms. Moreover, the Stoic method of deduction differs from standard modern ones in that the direction is reversed (similar to tableau methods). The Stoic system may hence be called an argumental reductive system of deduction. In this paper, a reconstruction of this system of logic is presented, and similarities to relevance logic are pointed out...|$|E

First, {{the place of the}} separability thesis in legal positivism will be explored, distinguishing between “standard positivism” and “post-Hartian positivism. ” Then I will consider various kinds of relations between law and morality that are worthy of jurisprudential interest, and explore, from a positivist point of view, what kind of relations between law and morality must be rejected, what kind of such relations should be taken into account, and what kind of such relations are indeed of no import at all. The upshot of this analysis consists in highlighting the distinction between two different dimensions of legal validity (<b>formal</b> <b>validity</b> and material validity respectively), and in pointing out that the positivist separability thesis can apply to <b>formal</b> <b>validity</b> only. On the other hand, when the ascertainment of material validity is at stake, some form of moral reasoning may well be involved (here and now, it is necessarily involved). The essay concludes with some brief remarks on the persisting importance of the positivist jurisprudential project...|$|E

Five anaesthetists then independently rated subsets of these videotapes. Results. There was good agreement between raters for medical management, behavioural attributes and overall performance. Agreement was high for both the initial judges and the ®ve additional raters. Conclusions. Using a global scale to assess simulator performance, we found good inter-rater reliability for scoring performance in a crisis. We estimate that two judges should provide a reliable assessment.
