By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time Carnation was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with <b>dry</b> <b>food</b> products for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel. Carnation International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's pet food products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others.|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and <b>dry</b> <b>food</b> is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E

In this chapter, we will explain {{a process of}} the examination in turn. We brainstorm {{on the theme of}} "dried foods" with proposer. We decided to take up three next characteristics. 1 Delicious 2 Characteristics and portability 3 Easy to cook Then, we established target people who spread. First requirement of proposer "We want to spread <b>dried</b> <b>foods</b> to people of the world". We returned to basics of the marketing and narrowed down an object and decided to assume an object a youth (From 20 generations to 30 generations). Probably we will ask their parents dish methods if they re interested in <b>dried</b> <b>foods</b> when they are going to learn all of dishes. And they should succeed to dish methods to children when they do children's care. We thought that <b>dried</b> <b>foods</b> spread in all generations. As a result of having performed discussion of several degrees eagerly in the H group to achieve an aim to spread <b>dried</b> <b>foods</b> while utilizing ALPS tool, we suggested two solution to young people. ・Product k-series ・Prototyping k-pod. We specified the stakeholders with CVCA and WCA. As a result, we understood that our stakeholders is "customer" "Shoku-no-tanteidan" and "dried foods retail stores" and "association of Japanese dried foods". We visualized relation of these stakeholders. Based on it, we analyzed the problem of <b>dried</b> <b>food</b> with "interview" and "to by using". A problem for immediate solution is eat less in the home. In order to get customers through publicity. We put new idea that change <b>dried</b> <b>food</b> package. The dicision to change <b>dried</b> <b>food</b> package is aimed at renewing image. We made an original product. We named it "k-BOX". Our strategy the customer who uses it has interest in <b>dried</b> <b>food.</b> Our customer said the following to interviewers. We carried out surveys about this box. An unexpected result,this box has little effect spread <b>dried</b> <b>food.</b> This is our oops. So far opinion and oops are foundations. And "use case" and "value graph" are used. Apparatus for exclusive use brings about a synergistic effect by offering the synthetic solution in all the scenes of using a <b>dried</b> <b>food.</b> Systematizing the whole promotes spread. This is our "eureka. "Next, a stakeholder's opinion was adopted. And requirements analysis was conducted. It has improved by creating a prototype several times based on the result. "k-pod" was produced from there. A package and usage are new prototypes. Furthermore, some apparatus for exclusive use of this series were devised. The whole tool for using a <b>dried</b> <b>food</b> was systematized. And the systematization strategy of "k-series" was produced. It is for using a <b>dried</b> <b>food</b> frequently in everyday life. "Exhibition in a contest", "market research", and "preparations towards sale in the company where a member works" are made in the future...|$|R

25|$|Taurine is an {{essential}} dietary requirement for feline health, since house cats (and {{all members of the}} cat family) cannot synthesize the compound. The absence of taurine causes a cat's retina to slowly degenerate, causing eye problems and (eventually) irreversible blindness– a condition known as central retinal degeneration (CRD), as well as hair loss and tooth decay. Decreased plasma taurine concentration has been demonstrated to be associated with feline dilated cardiomyopathy. Unlike CRD, the condition is reversible with supplementation. Taurine is now a requirement of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and any dry or wet food product labeled approved by the AAFCO should have a minimum of 0.1% taurine in <b>dry</b> <b>food</b> and 0.2% in wet food.|$|E
