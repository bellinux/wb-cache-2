40|$|Abstract. Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) show {{particular}} properties {{associated to}} their martensitic transformation between metastable phases. Their use in dampers requires a deep {{knowledge of the}} SMA behavior and its coherence with the application requirements. In <b>earthquakes</b> <b>engineering</b> standard conditions require that, after several years or decades at rest, an excellent performance is necessary {{for one or two}} minutes, i. e., nearly 200 working oscillations. When the target is the damping of stayed cables in bridges under the wind or rain actions, a larger number of oscillations is expected per each working day. This contribution analyzes the fatigue behavior of a CuAlBe alloy (appropriate for earthquakes) and discusses the results of some available experiments on a NiTi alloy for their eventual application to stayed cables. ...|$|R

25|$|Seismic {{performance}} assessment or seismic {{structural analysis}} {{is a powerful}} tool of <b>earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> which utilizes detailed modelling of the structure together with methods of structural analysis {{to gain a better}} understanding of seismic performance of building and non-building structures.

25|$|Seismic {{design is}} based on {{authorized}} engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to design or retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure. Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about <b>earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> structures. Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.|$|E
40|$|When {{subjected}} to {{events such as}} <b>earthquakes,</b> <b>engineering</b> structures typically exhibit a nonlinear and hysteretic behaviour with stiffness and strength degradations. Though a reliable evaluation of safety conditions should {{take into account the}} nonlinear dynamic and evolutionary nature of the structural response, the experimental identification of a nonlinear behaviour under dynamic and seismic loading is, to date, an open problem. The present research aims at evaluating the potential of different restoring force models for simulating the seismic response of hysteretic structural systems, with special emphasis on the two main problems encountered when applying this approach to full-scale structures under intense excitation: (a) a markedly time-dependent behaviour; (b) need to compare among different restoring force models, either expressed in a parametric or polynomial form. In particular, polynomial models will be formulated both in terms of restoring force and its derivative, in order to present a comprehensive discussion of different strategies. The nonlinear identification technique employed in this paper is required to account for a time-dependent behaviour. In fact, in presence of degradation or any other time-varying characteristics, instantaneous identification certainly constitutes an enhancement of the classical restoring force based approach, and may as well provide checks on the consistency of the assumed model...|$|R

25|$|<b>Earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> is an {{interdisciplinary}} branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall {{goal is to}} make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. <b>Earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and <b>earthquake</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{compelling}} seismogram from the 1940 event in El Centro, strong-motion seismology was not explicitly sought until later events occurred—the San Fernando earthquake made evident {{the need for}} more data for <b>earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> applications. The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program was initiated in 1971 with the goal of maximizing the volume of data by furnishing and maintaining instruments at selected lifeline structures, buildings, and ground response stations. By the late 1980s, the program had instrumented more than 450 structures, bridges, dams, and power plants. The 1979 Imperial Valley and 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquakes were presented as gainful events that were recorded during that period, because both produced valuable data that increased knowledge of how moderate events affect buildings. The success of the Imperial Valley event was especially pronounced because of a recently constructed and fully instrumented government building that was shaken to the point of failure.|$|E
25|$|Seismic {{retrofitting}} is the {{modification of}} existing structures {{to make them}} more resistant to seismic activity, ground motion, or soil failure due to earthquakes. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many {{other parts of the world}} (Turkey, China etc.), many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world – such as the ASCE-SEI 41 and the New Zealand Society for <b>Earthquake</b> <b>Engineering</b> (NZSEE)'s guidelines.

25|$|The {{large number}} of public school {{buildings}} in the Los Angeles area displayed mixed responses to the shaking, and those that were built after {{the enforcement of the}} Field Act clearly showed the results of the reformed construction styles. The Field Act was put into effect just one month following the destructive March 1933 Long Beach earthquake that damaged many public school buildings in Long Beach, Compton, and Whittier. The Los Angeles Unified School District had 660 schools consisting of 9,200 buildings {{at the time of the}} earthquake, with 110 masonry buildings that had not been reinforced to meet the new standards. More than 400 portable classrooms and 53 wood frame pre-Field Act buildings were also in use. All these buildings had been previously inspected with regard to the requirements of the Act, and many were reinforced or rebuilt at that time, but <b>earthquake</b> <b>engineering</b> experts recommended further immediate refurbishment or demolition after a separate evaluation was done after the February 1971 earthquake, and within a year and a half the district followed through with the direction with regard to about 100 structures.|$|E

40|$|We have {{compiled}} a GIS database of faults, <b>earthquakes,</b> <b>engineering</b> geology, slope instability, liquefaction, ground water, dam failure inundation, stream flooding, fire, wind, and subsidence for the County of Riverside. The hazard mapping provides overlays {{on which to}} conduct loss estimations related to existing infrastructure while attempting to minimize risk to new infrastructure. Eight scenario loss estimations associated with segments of the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Elsinore faults were calculated for Riverside County using HAZUSTM. Input parameters were adjusted based on our GIS database of soil, liquefaction and landslide mapping. The inventory exposure in Riverside County consists of 402, 000 buildings valued at over $ 61 billion, with a population exposure of 1. 2 million. Loss estimations for the eight scenario events varied from 1, 100 to 10, 500 casualties and $ 2. 2 to $ 13. 2 billion.
