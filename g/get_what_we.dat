We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500.

500|$|After {{news of his}} mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might {{attempt to}} escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, has him locked in the prison {{punishment}} box. After being released from the box, receiving word that his mother's burial is completed and being told to forget about her, Luke is determined to escape. Under {{the cover of a}} Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is later recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but not before one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies from strain caused by struggling through barbed-wire fences. After his capture and return, the Captain has Luke fitted with leg-irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, explaining, [...] "What we've got here is failure to communicate.

500|$|Musically, {{the songs}} on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, [...] while some of its songs {{incorporate}} elements of electro and electropop in its production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders are prominent. The album's title track, [...] "Cannibal", makes use of synth and dance driven backings while Kesha sings about maneater tendencies and makes a reference to serial-killer, Jeffrey Dahmer. Present throughout the song are snippets of Kesha yodeling. [...] "Blow" [...] shows a darker side of Kesha with lyrics like: [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want/ We do what you don't." [...] The song is more dominantly an electro infused track that uses a synth beat backing. Vocally the song uses snippets of Kesha's yodeling, combined with heavy use of auto-tune. [...] "Sleazy" [...] changes pace from Kesha's normally persistent [...] "talk-singing" [...] vocal style, to a more rap driven style. She raps over a thundering bass line and ticking beat backing, while the song speaks of wealthy men hitting on Kesha, trying to buy her attention. The song has been cited for drawing influence from multiple songs including; Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] for its [...] "swagga", Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Love Don't Cost a Thing" [...] for its [...] "attitude", as well as combining [...] "a touch of Lil Wayne's [...] "Milli".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} reference-point {{dependent}} model of social behavior where individuals maximize a three-term utility function: a consumption utility term and two “social” terms. One social term captures {{a preference for}} desert (i. e., others <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think they deserve) and the other term a preference for the satisfaction of other’s expectations, or to placate them (i. e., them <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> think they think they deserve). After motivating the modeling assumptions with findings from empirical moral philosophy and evolutionary psychology, I introduce the model and generate some simple comparative statics results, which I then test with experiments. I discuss how the model explains several paradoxes of empirical moral philosophy that are less explicable by current economic models of social preference focusing on outcomes and intentions...|$|R

500|$|While {{reviewing}} Cannibal, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine positively {{wrote that}} [...] "Blow" [...] was an undeniable [...] "stuttery club track". Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix {{wrote that the}} song was a [...] "club banger" [...] and that Kesha portrayed a bratty and cultural irritant attitude throughout the song referencing to the line, [...] "We are taking over — get used to it!" [...] Brockman commented that the song [...] "sends a shiver down your spine" [...] further complimenting the production of Dr. Luke. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News wrote that the song featured common Kesha elements citing her carpe diem attitude and grinding beats but noted that the lyrics also portrayed a darker side of Kesha, referring to the line, [...] "We <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want/ We do what you don't." [...] Vena also wrote that the song contained a [...] "scream-along party-anthem chorus". Scott Shetler from AOL Radio felt that Kesha's lyrical [...] delivery was both sassy and brash. In a separate review from AOL Radio, the song was ranked at position nine on the website's list of [...] "10 Best Songs of 2011". The review concluded that Kesha's strongest songwriting skills pertained to party anthems. The review compared the song to previous singles, [...] "Tik Tok" [...] and [...] "We R Who We R".|$|E
500|$|After Reading were promoted, Waller {{met with}} the players on 4 June 1976 to discuss their {{contracts}} for the 1976–77 season. The wages offered to the Reading players were far lower {{than they had been}} expecting, causing the team's morale to fall drastically. [...] "We got screwed by the club", midfielder Eamon Dunphy later claimed. [...] "We didn't <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had been promised." [...] Friday was so offended by the low salary offered that he handed in a transfer request, telling the Evening Post that the club's directors clearly did not share his ambition. [...] "They would be happy to stroll along in {{the bottom half of the}} Third Division forever", he said. The row over the new contracts continued throughout the off-season, while Friday planned his second wedding; he had been formally divorced from Maxine after years of separation, and subsequently engaged to Liza Deimel, a Reading-born university graduate. After the pay dispute was settled on 5 August, the couple were married in Reading three days later. The wedding was filmed by Southern Television, before whose cameras Friday, wearing an open-necked tiger-skin-pattern shirt, brown velvet suit and snakeskin boots, sat on the steps of the church and rolled a joint. Friday had invited about two hundred people, mostly friends and relatives from London, who joined in the drinking and drug-taking and ending up fighting each other and stealing the couple's wedding presents, one of which was a large quantity of cannabis. Liza later called the wedding [...] "the most hilarious thing ever". [...] "I have been to a few weddings", recalled Rod Lewington, [...] "but never one like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Armiger praised Suddenly, Feliu quoted him [...] " [...] {{still quite}} smooth, but it's less slick. There {{are a few}} groove songs, a couple almost reggaeish. When we did Don't Throw Stones we were just getting into things like reggae. This time it was much easier to play things like that". He {{described}} working with Cameron Allan, their producer on Sondra, to Susan Moore of The Australian Women's Weekly: [...] "we knew we could badger him to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted, if need be. We {{had more time to}} get the sound we wanted". The Sports broke up late in 1981 and Cummings went on to a solo career, while Armiger turned to record producing and session work.|$|E
2500|$|Spielberg {{suggested}} that Boam write the next draft, and Lucas agreed to it. Boam felt some nervousness {{going into the}} process. He joked that [...] "the battlefield was littered with writers before I came on to the scene. There were four or five before me. Each writer had their script next to them covered with blood." [...] Boam said that when Spielberg called to offer him the job, Spielberg said [...] "something like, 'You wanna get real rich?' and I said, 'Yeah, why?' and he said, 'I think you should do the next Indiana Jones movie.'" [...] Boam {{is reported to have}} replied to Spielberg's offer by saying, [...] "I just don't know why you didn't come to me before." [...] Boam spent two weeks filled with eight-hour days working with Lucas to develop the story. The two blocked out all other commitments to create the story, building it [...] "beat by beat". Lucas already knew many of the set pieces that were to be in the movie. During the two-week story conference, Boam worked to incorporate it all into the new narrative. [...] "Jeff was very collaborative," [...] Lucas said, adding, [...] "He'd try to include both Steven's ideas and my ideas, and tried to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted done." ...|$|E

As to the luggage, that must be sacrificed, so that the boatmen can go down with empty benches. It must be pitched overboard. The loss would be of no real consequence; everyone could manage with what they have on until we get to Allahabad.

6000|$|I have {{hitherto}} carefully restricted myself, {{in speaking}} of exchange, {{to the use}} of the term [...] "advantage;" [...] but that term includes two ideas: the advantage, namely, of <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> need, and that of <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wish for. Three-fourths of the demands existing in the world are romantic; founded on visions, idealisms, hopes, and affections; and the regulation of the purse is, in its essence, regulation of the imagination and the heart. Hence, the right discussion of the nature of price is a very high metaphysical and psychical problem; sometimes to be solved only in a passionate manner, as by David in his counting the price of the water of the well by the gate of Bethlehem; but its first conditions are the following:--The price of anything is the quantity of labour given by the person desiring it, in order to obtain possession of it. This price depends on four variable quantities. A. The quantity of wish the purchaser has for the thing; opposed to [Greek: a], the quantity of wish the seller has to keep it. B. The quantity of labour the purchaser can afford, to obtain the thing; opposed to [Greek: b], the quantity of labour the seller can afford, to keep it. These quantities are operative only in excess; i.e., the quantity of wish (A) means the quantity of wish for this thing, above wish for other things; and the quantity of work (B) means the quantity which can be spared to get this thing from the quantity needed to get other things.|$|R

60|$|And we who {{are coming}} to the holy communion this day--let us ask ourselves, What do we want there? Do we want to be made good men, true, honest, just? Do we want to be saved from our sins? or merely from the {{punishment}} of them after we die? Do we want to be made sharers in that everlasting righteousness of Christ, which sustains him, and sustains the whole world too, and prevents it from becoming a cage of wild beasts, tearing each other to pieces by war and oppression, falsehood and injustice? THEN we shall <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want; and more. But if not, then we shall not <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> want, not discerning that the Lord's body is a righteous and just and good body; and his blood a purifying blood, which purifies not merely from the punishment of our sins, but from our sins themselves.|$|E
