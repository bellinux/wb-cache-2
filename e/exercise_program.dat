5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe <b>exercise</b> <b>program</b> is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E
25|$|Extremity conditions. A 2011 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis {{concluded that the}} addition of manual mobilizations to an <b>exercise</b> <b>program</b> {{for the treatment of}} knee osteoarthritis resulted in better pain relief then a supervised <b>exercise</b> <b>program</b> alone and suggested that manual therapists consider adding manual mobilisation to optimise supervised active exercise programs. There is silver level evidence that manual therapy is more effective than exercise for the treatment of hip osteoarthritis, however this evidence could be considered to be inconclusive. There is a small amount of research into the efficacy of chiropractic treatment for upper limbs, limited to low level evidence supporting chiropractic management of shoulder pain and limited or fair evidence supporting chiropractic management of leg conditions.|$|E

40|$|Question: How has {{adherence}} {{been measured}} in recent prospective studies focusing on adherence to <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> among older people? What is {{the range of}} adherence rates? Which factors are associated with better adherence? Design: Systematic review of prospective studies that had a primary aim of assessing adherence to <b>exercise</b> <b>programs.</b> Participants: Older people undertaking <b>exercise</b> <b>programs.</b> Intervention: <b>Exercise</b> <b>programs.</b> Outcome measures: Measures of adherence, adherence rates and factors associated with adherence. Results: Nine eligible papers were identified. The most common adherence measures were the proportion of participants completing <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> (ie, did not cease participation, four studies, range 65 to 86 %), proportion of available sessions attended (five studies, range 58 to 77 %) and average number of home exercise sessions completed per week (two studies, range 1. 5 to 3 times per week). Adherence rates were generally higher in supervised programs. The person-level factors associated with better adherence included: demographic factors (higher socioeconomic status, living alone); health status (fewer health conditions, better self-rated health, taking fewer medications); physical factors (better physical abilities); and psychological factors (better cognitive ability, fewer depressive symptoms). Conclusion: Older people's adherence to <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> is most commonly measured with dropout and attendance rates and {{is associated with a}} range of program and personal factors.

Rockwood coined the term orthotherapy to describe this program which is aimed at creating an exercise regimen that initially gently improves motion, then gradually improves strength in the shoulder girdle. Each patient is given a home therapy kit, which includes elastic bands of six different colors and strengths, a pulley set, and a three-piece, one-meter-long stick.

25|$|A year long, moderate-intensity aerobic <b>exercise</b> <b>program</b> {{increased}} DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40–75, but had {{no effect}} on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen. In acute assessment of hormone levels in soccer players before, during and after a game, DHT and testosterone increased during the match, but returned to baseline after 45 minutes rest. Aerobic exercise in Japanese rats done on a rodent treadmill doubled local concentrations of DHT in calf muscles as assessed by protein assay. After intense aerobic effort, high endurance athletes were also found to have lower free testosterone the next day. In prolonged endurance exercise, such as a marathon, levels ultimately decrease. Similarly, DHT drops, while adrenal androgen and cortisol will increase with the stress response.|$|E

500|$|Exercise {{programs}} are recommended {{in people with}} Parkinson's disease. There {{is some evidence that}} speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an <b>exercise</b> <b>program</b> is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised <b>exercise</b> <b>program</b> at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, {{but are not limited to}} improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best. Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease, [...] deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity. Exercise may improve constipation.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that exercise is beneficial in patients with end-stage renal disease as in the general population, {{it is not easy}} to incorporate <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> into routine clinical practice. This review aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of exercise during hemodialysis and also to introduce various intradialytic <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> and their advantages as a first step in combining <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> into clinical practice. Aerobic and resistance exercise are beneficial not only in improving physical functioning, including maximal oxygen uptake and muscle strength, but also in improving anthropometrics, nutritional status, hematological indexes, inflammatory cytokines, depression, and health-related quality of life. However, it is not clear whether the beneficial effects of exercise are limited to only relatively healthy dialysis patients. Therefore, the effects of individualized <b>exercise</b> <b>programs</b> for elderly patients or patients with comorbid conditions need to be studied further.
