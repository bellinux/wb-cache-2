40|$|Stepwise and concerted {{mechanisms}} {{for the formation}} of mono-and <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> over ZSM- 5 zeolite were investigated. For the calculations, a T 128 cluster model of zeolite was used with a QM/QM scheme to investigate the reaction mechanism. The active inner part of zeolite was represented by a T 8 model and was treated at the DFT (BP 86) level, including D 3 Grimme dispersion, and the outer part of the zeolite was treated at the DFTB level. The solvent effects were taken into account by including explicitly water molecules in the cavity of the zeolite. The Gibbs energies were calculated for both mechanisms at 70 °C. In the case of the stepwise mechanism for the monopropylene glycol formation, the rate-limiting step is the opening of the epoxide ring. The activation energy for this process is 35. 5 kcal mol- 1, while {{in the case of the}} concerted mechanism the rate-limiting step is the simultaneous ring opening of the epoxide and the attack by a water molecule. This process has an activation energy of 27. 4 kcal mol- 1. In the case of the stepwise mechanism of the <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> formation, the activation energy for the rate-limiting step is the same as for the monopropylene glycol formation, and in the case of the concerted mechanism, the activation energy for the rate-limiting step is 30. 8 kcal mol- 1. In both cases (mono-and <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> formation), the concerted mechanism should be dominant over the stepwise one.

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Chemical engineering. The primary goal of this research was to find a renewable synthesis method for the production of propylene oxide. Significant quantities of glycerin are formed as a co-product when soybean oil is used to produce bio-diesel. This glycerin can be used to produce propylene glycol, which can undergo dehydration over basic catalysts to produce propylene oxide (PO), along with eight other products: acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acetone, 2 -propanol, 1 -propanol, allyl alcohol, acetol, and <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> A variety of catalysts were prepared for each set of reactions, and dehydration was carried out in a plug flow reactor. For this thesis, only three main catalysts are presented, such as Na/Al₂O₃ (sodium acetate on alumina), Cs-ETS- 10, and Na acac/MgO (sodium acetyl acetonate on nanocrystalline MgO). Dehydration reactions were performed with different masses of catalyst, reactor temperatures, and residence times to optimize the selectivity to PO. The highest selectivity to PO was obtained as 12. 33 % for Na acac/MgO catalyst at 400 _ C, 0. 1 g, and a N 2 flow rate of 20 SCCM. Even though Cs-ETS- 10 catalyst was active for PO production, it also produced higher amounts of <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (80 %). <b>Dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> appears to act as an active intermediate in the dehydration of propylene glycol to propylene oxide over Cs-ETS- 10 catalyst, which would limit PO selectivity to 50 %. The Na/Al 2 O 3 resulted in low selectivity of 2 % to PO, although it gave an appreciable selectivity of 60 % to propionaldehyde. The reaction pathway to PO over these catalysts was also studied. Dehydration of propylene glycol to propylene oxide over Na/Al 2 O 3, and Na acac/MgO catalysts appears to be a direct dehydration, rather than the involvement of a <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> active intermediate...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the age of}} an ink entry from a questioned document is often an essential problem and a controversial issue in forensic sciences. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the aging process of the different components found in ink. The aim of this work was to the study the drying process of ballpoint ink, characterised by the disappearance of volatile solvents from the ink entry. Phenoxyethanol is of particularly high interest as it is found in more than 80 % of the blue ballpoint pens at different concentrations. Liquid extraction followed by splitless gas chromatography / mass spectrometry in the selected ion mode was used to measure the quantitative decrease of solvents from ink entries made with a blue Parker® ballpoint pen. Quantities of ethoxyethoxyethanol, <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethoxyethanol were studied in ink entries up to one and a half years old, thus allowing to calculate aging curves for this particular pen. The low quantities of solvents (in the microgram range for a 1 cm ballpoint entry) were found to decrease quickly after deposition of the ink on paper through the competitive processes of evaporation and diffusion. Losses of up to 75 % of solvents were observed after a few seconds. The amount of ethoxyethanol stopped decreasing after about 10 days (quantities reached the nanogram range for a 1 cm ballpoint entry), while the aging curves of <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> phenoxyethanol and phenoxyethoxyethanol level off considerably after 2 weeks. It was observed that ethoxyethanol, <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and phenoxyethanol can also migrate from one sheet of paper to another if placed close enough (e. g. in a book or a stack of papers), therefore contamination from fresh ink stroke from other paper sheets has to be taken into account for those solvents.

40|$|Perchloroethylene (PCE) is {{a highly}} {{utilized}} solvent in the dry cleaning industry because of its cleaning effectiveness and relatively low cost to consumers. According to the 2006 U. S. Census, approximately 28, 000 dry cleaning operations used PCE as their principal cleaning agent. Widespread use of PCE is problematic because of its adverse impacts on human health and environmental quality. As PCE use is curtailed, effective alternatives must be analyzed for their toxicity and impacts to {{human health and the}} environment. Potential alternatives to PCE in dry cleaning include <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> n-butyl ether (DPnB) and <b>dipropylene</b> <b>glycol</b> tert-butyl ether (DPtB), both promising to pose a relatively smaller risk. To evaluate these two alternatives to PCE, we established and scored performance criteria, including chemical toxicity, employee and customer exposure levels, impacts on the general population, costs of each system, and cleaning efficacy. The scores received for PCE were 5, 5, 3, 5, 3, and 3, respectively, and DPnB and DPtB scored 3, 1, 2, 2, 4, and 4, respectively. An aggregate sum of the performance criteria yielded a favorably low score of “ 16 ” for both DPnB and DPtB compared to “ 24 ” for PCE.

Indeed, their global reactivity depends both on their chemical reactivity and physico-chemical properties. Glycolysis of model polyesters which are liquid at the reaction temperature, which allows us to overcome {{the problem of the}} polyesters' solubility, were studied to compare the chemical reactivity of these glycols. Three oligoesters were synthesized from dimethyl terephthalate and three different glycols namely triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol and hexanediol to form, respectively, PE 3 T, OET and PTRD. Results showed that the order of reactivity of the glycols is the same for PET, OET and PTHD but different for PE 3 T. Indeed, DPG without catalyst has a particular and unexpected behaviour: its reactivity seems to be strongly influenced by the presence of oxygen atoms in the chain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of DMMP and DPGME, however, the SnO 2 (C) sensor showed higher responses than those of the SnO 2 (P) sensors. In particular, the response of the SnO 2 (P) sensor increased as the calcination temperature increased from 400 °C to 800 °C.

Graft polyols (also called filled polyols or polymer polyols) contain finely dispersed styrene–acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile, or polyurea (PHD) polymer solids chemically grafted to a high molecular weight polyether backbone. They are used to increase the load-bearing properties of low-density high-resiliency (HR) foam, as well as add toughness to microcellular foams and cast elastomers. Initiators such as ethylenediamine and triethanolamine are used to make low molecular weight rigid foam polyols that have built-in catalytic activity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in the backbone.
