5000|$|A Zimbabwean woman won a {{legal case}} against a Cobra Group {{affiliate}} for unfair {{treatment in the}} workplace. She was awarded €5000 in compensation for [...] "harassment and discriminatory treatment" [...] and €45000 for <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissal.</b> The main argument the company used in defending its case was that the worker in question had been a self-employed sole trader and not actually an employee of his company. Prior to the dismissal the worker in question had been lauded as the highest fundraiser within Boss Worldwide Promotions Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|It was argued, {{following}} the obiter comments of Lord Hoffmann in Johnson v Unisys Ltd in March 2001, that claims {{could be made}} before an Employment Tribunal for injury to feelings arising from unfair dismissal. It was re-established {{that this was not}} what the law provided, in Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council, July 2004 wherein the Lords confirmed that the position established in Norton Tool v Tewson in 1972, that compensation for unfair dismissal was limited to financial loss alone. The compensatory award element for [...] "ordinary" [...] unfair dismissal is subject to a statutory cap set, from February 2014, at the lower of £76574 or 12 months gross pay. <b>Discriminatory</b> <b>dismissal</b> continues to attract compensation for injury to feelings and financial loss, and there is no statutory cap.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the analysis of the Precedent 443 of the Superior Labor Court, which deals with the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissal</b> presumption of those labor with social stigma diseases from the perspective of judicial activism in the brazilian labor law and its objective influence on law and labor procedure law from the {{from the perspective of a}} not univocal constitutional hermeneutics. It aims, also, to conceptualize the stability institute in order to configure the dangers and misconceptions arising from it. Therefore, it concludes that the analogy that embodied the repeated judicial position was excessive. The research points out the logical-deductive method operated by the aid of the literature review, case law and positioning applicable law...|$|E
30|$|The {{revision}} is extensive, {{with the}} aim of promoting conciliation and discouraging lawsuits, reducing their length (currently up to 6 - 7 years for the three levels of judgment), limiting the uncertainty about the costs of firing for firms, without restricting workers’ fundament rights. In order to achieve these goals, first, a preliminary conciliation procedure has been made compulsory and, second, different sanctions for illegitimate dismissals have been substituted for former unified sanctions, which typically were identified in the worker’s reinstatement. On the one hand, <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissals</b> (on the ground of race, gender or sexual orientation etc.) continue obviously to be prohibited and thus become null after a sentence has been delivered, so that the dismissal is regarded as if it had never occurred. On the other hand, the reinstatement of workers illegitimately dismissed for economic and disciplinary motives has been restricted to cases where the court recognizes the manifest nonexistence of the motive. In all other cases, it is replaced by a monetary compensation, ranging from 12 to 24  months of salary, depending on the employee’s length of service and other criteria.|$|R
40|$|Moving {{from the}} {{question}} “why everyone nowadays says that Italy needs {{to increase the}} women’ participation in the labour markets?”, the Author considers the different possible underlying reasons, the ethical case vs. the business case. As {{one of the goals}} targeted by the present Government is just the enhancing of women’ employment, the essay tries to evaluate if and how the recent policies engaged by the Labour Minister Fornero are consistent with this intention and differ from the ones of the past Government. The essay focuses on the recent Act n. 92 / 2012, a deep reform of the labour relationships {{as well as of the}} labour market, that directly or indirectly affects women. The main issues considered are the important changes in the dismissal law (Art. 18 Act. n° 300 / 1967, Statuto dei lavoratori), whose gender character is enlightened. According to the Author, the uncertain distinction between unjustified <b>dismissals</b> and <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissals,</b> together with the increased dramatic differences in the protection grant by Act n° 92 / 2012 in the two cases, could reduce the real protection against dismissals based on grounds of sex or maternity, on one hand, and could fail to increase the women’ employment on the other hand...|$|R
40|$|Equality is a {{fundamental}} constitutional value in the Constitution. Formal equality presupposes that all persons are equal bearers of rights and that inequality can be eliminated by extending the same rights to all. Formal equality is blind to social and economic differences between groups and individuals. Substantive equality, on the other hand, is receptive to entrenched, structural inequality, meaning that the equality clause of the Constitution must be read as founded on a substantive concept of equality. An employer can utilise the defence of an inherent requirement of {{a job in the}} case of an unfair-discrimination claim since the defence is available in terms of both the Employment Equity Act, in respect of employment discrimination, and the Labour Relations Act in respect of <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissals.</b> The defence is narrow in that only essential duties of a particular job will be taken into account to determine inherent requirements of a particular job. Reported judgments where this defence is used are scant. What makes the defence more onerous is that an employer has to show that the particular employee could not be reasonably accommodated, before the inherent-requirement defence will succeed. It is integral to the determination of whether there was unfair discrimination and whether such discrimination was justifiable. An important debate in our discrimination law relates to the question of whether any significance should be attached to the fact that only unfair discrimination is outlawed. Neither of the aforementioned pieces of legislation clearly state that affirmative action or an inherent requirement of a job are the only defences available to employers. Where these two defences are found to be not applicable, may the fairness be decided in terms of a general fairness defence? This question is also addressed in the present treatise. It is submitted that foreign law is a valuable interpretive tool, provided it is used wisely, in that judgments originating from courts and tribunals in the United Kingdom and Canada may assist to provide an understanding of the issues central to employment discrimination law and the parameters of the defence of inherent requirements of the job. Thus, in developing employment discrimination law in South Africa, consideration of foreign jurisprudence may prove informative...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the present}} state of the law of dismissal in Japan, Great Britain and the USA, with a view to evaluating the adequacy of regulation, accessibility of procedure and effectiveness of remedy in each of these systems from the perspective of employment protection. Possible improvements of these systems are considered, having regard to the policies underlying them. In the first chapter, the development of the law of dismissal in each country is briefly reviewed. The second chapter considers {{the extent to which the}} protection of the law of dismissal covers different forms of the termination of employment in each country. The third, fourth, and fifth chapters examine the general law of dismissal in these countries and identify what kind of regulation, procedures and remedies apply to dismissals in each case. The sixth chapter examines the legal status of provisions in collective agreements concerning dismissal in each country, and special attention is paid to how arbitration regulates dismissals in Britain and the US. The seventh chapter examines the grounds on which it is unlawful to dismiss employees, the administrative bodies which deal with <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissal</b> claims, and the procedures and remedies for discriminatory dismissals, in each country. Chapter eight examines the regulation, procedure and remedies applicable to dismissals for redundancy or economic reasons in each country. The ninth chapter examines the effectiveness of the legal systems of dismissal of each country from the view-point of the employee's protection, and the tenth chapter considers the policy behind the system of each country. The final chapter considers the prospects for improvement of the systems and reflects on Japanese employment law...|$|E
40|$|This Article, a {{third in}} a series of related works, explores the {{representation}} of sexual identity within Critical Race Theory and other forms of anti-racist discourse. I argue, after examining representative texts, that anti-racist discourse is often 2 ̆ 2 heteronormative 2 ̆ 2 [...] or centered around heterosexual experiences. Most commonly, anti-racist heteronormativity occurs when scholars and activists in the field fail to analyze the homophobic dimensions of acts or conditions of racial inequality and when they dismiss, either implicitly or explicitly, the 2 ̆ 2 morality 2 ̆ 2 of gay and lesbian equality claims. This Article recommends that scholars in Critical Race Theory and related fields adopt a more multidimensional lens for studying oppression and identity [...] one that treats forms of subordination and identity as interrelated, rather than as mutually exclusive and unconnected. While this Article is informed by a substantial body of scholarship, primarily in Feminist Legal Theory and Critical Race Theory, that explores the 2 ̆ 2 intersectionality 2 ̆ 2 of oppression and identity, my analysis expands this work both substantively and conceptually. This Article makes a substantive contribution to the intersectionality corpus (and to related works) because the latter has generally failed to engage in any significant examination of the relationship between heterosexism and other forms of oppression, such as racial subordination; instead, this work has been limited primarily to unveiling and analyzing the relationship between patriarchy and racial hierarchy. In addition, an embryonic intellectual movement that considers the relationship between heterosexism, gender hierarchy, and racial subjugation has taken place largely among scholars and commentators outside of the context of legal theory and analysis. By examining the synergistic relationship between class, race, gender, and sexual hierarchies and law and legal theory, this Article overcomes some of the substantive limitations of pre-existing work on the complexity of subordination. This Article extends the intersectionality scholarship conceptually because it treats the issue of multidimensional subordination as a 2 ̆ 2 universal 2 ̆ 2 concept, not one limited to a particular class of oppressed individuals who are currently excluded from equality discourse. Much of the intersectionality scholarship, by contrast, suggests that the phenomenon of complex subordination is experienced by certain discrete groups, particularly 2 ̆ 2 women of color. 2 ̆ 2 Conceptualizing multidimensional subordination and identity as universal experiences, however, permits a more nuanced examination of identity and oppression. For example, by analyzing the role of sexuality in the historical and ongoing marginalization of heterosexuals of color and in the anti-racist response to such 2 ̆ 2 sexualized racism, 2 ̆ 2 this Article reveals and questions the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>dismissal</b> of progressive gay and lesbian politics within contemporary anti-racist discourse. This Article concludes by considering what impact a de-essentialized depiction of racial subordination might have upon legal theory, law, and policy...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{describes}} the British system of Labour Tribunals. These Tribunals, which {{are composed of}} jurists and non-jurists have jurisdiction to hear claims dealing with unlawful <b>dismissal,</b> <b>discriminatory</b> practices and other such matters. Although the workload is impressive, there is {{easy access to the}} Tribunals and a flexible procedure is used. An appeal on questions of law is provided for from those Tribunals to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, which is composed of one judge and two non-jurists. The author has acted as chairman of the Employment Appeal Tribunal and is clearly in favor of such a mixed composition. The article describes the decision-making process of the Appeal Tribunal and its powers...|$|R
