40|$|Slat heater boxes {{have been}} invented for {{controlling}} the sink temperatures of objects under test in a thermal vacuum chamber, {{the walls of}} which are cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. A slat <b>heater</b> <b>box</b> (see Figure 1) includes a framework of struts that support electrically heated slats that are coated with a high-emissivity optically gray paint. The slats can be grouped together into heater zones {{for the purpose of}} maintaining an even temperature within each side. The sink temperature of an object under test is defined as the steady-state temperature of the object in the vacuum/ radiative environment during the absence of any internal heat source or sink. The slat <b>heater</b> <b>box</b> makes it possible to closely control the radiation environment to obtain a desired sink temperature. The slat <b>heater</b> <b>box</b> is placed inside the cold thermal vacuum chamber, and the object under test is placed inside (but not in contact with) the slat <b>heater</b> <b>box.</b> The slat heaters occupy {{about a third of the}} field of view from any point on the surface of the object under test, the remainder of the field of view being occupied by the cold chamber wall. Thus, the radiation environment is established by the combined effects of the slat <b>heater</b> <b>box</b> and the cold chamber wall. Given (1) the temperature of the chamber wall, (2) the fractions of the field of view occupied by the chamber wall and the slat <b>heater</b> <b>box,</b> and (3) the emissivities of the slats, chamber wall, and the surface of object under test, the slat temperature required to maintain a desired sink temperature can be calculated by solving the equations of gray-body radiation for the steady-state adiabatic case (equal absorption and emission by the object under test). Slat heater boxes offer an important advantage over the infrared lamps that have been previously used to obtain desired sink temperatures: In comparison with an infrared lamp, a slat <b>heater</b> <b>box</b> provides a greater degree of sink temperature uniformity for a test-object surface that includes multiple areas with differing optical properties...|$|E

40|$|The Analytical Development Section (ADS) of SRNL was {{requested}} {{to perform a}} waste disposal assay of two heater boxes which {{had been used in}} the HB Line dissolvers. They had been sent to SRNL for study to make recommendations on how to prevent future failure of the units when they were replaced. The study having been completed, the units needed to be characterized prior to sending to Solid Waste for disposal. An assay station consisting of a turntable, HPGe detector, CANBERRA Inspector, transmission source and a portable computer was set up to do the required assays. The assays indicate the presence of U- 235, Pu- 239 and Cs- 137. No measurable amounts of U- 235 or Pu- 239 were found. Therefore the Minimum Detectable Activities for U- 235 and Pu- 239 were calculated. For <b>Heater</b> <b>Box</b> 1, 0. 23 grams of U- 235 and 0. 24 grams of Pu- 239. For <b>Heater</b> <b>Box</b> 2, the results were 0. 21 grams of U- 235 and 0. 21 grams of Pu- 239. This paper describes and documents the assays employed to determine the amount of U, Pu and Cs contents of the heater boxes. The paper provides results of SNM assays using traditional calibration of the system and on one based on modeling. It also provides the scientific community with data that will assist the user in determining the method of choice for assaying items with irregular geometries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{explored}} repurposing discarded {{materials to}} construct simple, field expedient, solar heating devices capable of heating drinking {{water to water}} pasteurization temperatures. Results of different test configurations quickly constructed from junk material indicate important design parameters to include maximizing exposed container surface area and using transparent glass and dark absorbent material inside the solar <b>heater</b> <b>box.</b> The optimal configuration heated water to 69 °C {{in a few hours}} demonstrating that a field expedient, zero cost solar heater capable of pasteurizing water (65 °C) can be quickly assembled from discarded material. Translating these key design parameters, rather than the exact design itself, to people in developing countries via relief organizations could help improve drinking water quality, reduce respiratory distress from indoor biomass burning, and potentially reduce the time and household income devoted to acquiring traditional biomass fuels. Organizations that operate in austere or disaster prone regions where safe drinking water may be unavailable may also benefit from knowing these design principles...|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hot days during the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain filling period reduces wheat grain yield. Many genotypes never recover and finish kernel development after temperatures moderate. The objectives were {{to study the}} effect of short term heat stress during kernel development, to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} membrane thermostability test to predict wheat heat tolerance, and to study the effects on end-use quality. Wheat heads were treated during grain filling using heat chambers in a greenhouse with 12 h at 38 ∘, 12 h at 25 ∘C for a total of 96 hours. Leaf tissues of seedlings and plants during grain filling were heat treated for membrane thermostability at 48 ∘C for 1 h. For field trials, the heads were inserted to inverted glass flasks. The temperature differential between inside and outside the flasks was about 10 - 15 ∘C. ^ Grain weight gains to maturity were different among genotypes following treatment. This significant genotype by heat treatment interaction indicated response to heat stress is under genetic control. Heat tolerance could be identified at the kernel level using <b>heater</b> <b>boxes.</b> However, the level of tolerance was small, indicating it might be difficult to breed for heat tolerance. ^ Though the results were consistent within an environment, the results of membrane themostability test from seedlings versus hardened greenhouse plants and field plants did not agree. Genotypes responded differently to heat in each environment. The membrane thermostability test for heat tolerance should be used with caution as a predictor of heat tolerant wheat genotypes. ^ The effect of heat stress treatment on the end-use quality was significant. There was significant genotype by treatment interaction for protein content and mixing tolerance mainly due to changes in magnitude. Hence, the effect of heat stress on the end-use quality is under both genetic and environmental control. ^ The fluctuating heat treatment was similar to actual ambient temperature fluctuation. Comparisons could be made among genotypes with the same anthesis date or among genotypes with different anthesis dates if the ambient temperatures and solar radiation were similar. ...|$|R
40|$|A vacuum {{thermoforming}} machine works by heating a clamped polymer sheet and then engaging the tooling {{to form the}} desired shape when the plastic is at the proper temperature. The current {{vacuum thermoforming}} machine in the Trine University Plastics Lab possesses a single top‐side heater. With the current setup, thicker materials will be scorched on the material’s top side and while the bottom side is not heated enough. In order for thicker materials {{to be used by}} the machine and heated effectively, a second bottom‐side heater is needed. Since an off the shelf solution is not feasible, the second heater must be designed and fabricated. Before fabrication of the secondary thermoforming heater, several analyses were conducted to ensure that the heater would function within the necessary operating parameters. Using thermal simulation software, the designed <b>heater</b> enclosure <b>box</b> was tested to ensure that the correct thermal flow was provided as needed. Material properties were then applied to the CAD files and finite element analysis software was used to ensure that the new heating enclosure and track system would be structurally sound. Although variations of the heating enclosure setup were taken into account as part of these analyses, the results favored mirroring the existing heater layout with some adjustments. Instead of sixteen individual horizontal coils like in the top heater, three coils with three bends each were used. Testing showed that the same watt density could be achieved with only three coils using this design. The new heater was also made thinner in order to allow for more space for the mold. The heater tray was insulated {{in order to protect the}} mold which rests underneath and also for safety purposes. By providing Trine University with a second heater, the group hopes to expand the capabilities and learning possibilities that the plastics lab provide...|$|R

An R 22 ECU box currently used by the Army was tested and used as the baseline for comparison with the later R 744 testing. This baseline system is generally used where portable air conditioning is needed in the field; the box is also equipped with electric resistance <b>heaters.</b> The baseline <b>box</b> was found to outperform its rated capacity. An R 744 system was tested in a breadboard format, this system was comprised of components similar to what would be used in an ECU box if it were converted from R 22. This breadboard system was capable of operating as both an air conditioner and as a heat pump. A cooling COP approximately equal to the box system was attained with the breadboard. The breadboard did provide a HPF greater than unity for all heat pump tests, making it is more efficient than the electric resistance heaters found in the box system. Detailed comparisons were made between several R 744 heat exchangers in different orientations under varying operating conditions. Evaporators were tested in horizontal and vertical tube orientations. The flat top fin evaporator was found to work well in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The round top fin evaporator, which may have contained a manufacturing defect, performed much better with the tubes vertical, than with the tubes horizontal. Overall the best heat exchanger was the round top fin evaporator with the tubes vertical; however this heat exchanger performed the worst with the tubes horizontal. In air conditioning mode, both gas coolers performed similarly. In heat pump mode, the six-port tube heat gas cooler performed better in almost every regard {{in comparison to the}} four-port tube with the only exception being the air side pressure drop.

40|$|Electronics warming has broad {{applications}} in the aerospace industry, where electronics assemblies are subject to lower than recommended temperature environments. Prior to operation {{it is necessary to}} raise the temperature of the electronics to the minimum safe operating level, recommended by the manufacturer. This is managed by adding an electrical heater inside the electronics assembly enclosure. A very important characteristic of the heater is how quickly the desired temperature needs to be reached. Of course, this characteristic determines the size of the heater needed for the warm up process. Since relatively low failure mode temperatures are often required by the aerospace industry, there is an additional level of complexity involved in designing the optimum size of a heater. In a failure mode condition, the analysis requires a heater to be sized to produce a small amount of heat even under hot environmental conditions. The two requirements of fast warm up time and low failure mode temperatures seem contradictory. The art of the Thermal Management in this type of design is {{to come up with a}} specific optimum heater size that can satisfy a rapid warm up requirement and yet not exceed the maximum allowable temperature during a failure mode scenario. Often a thermal engineer needs to work with an electrical engineer to manipulate the control algorithm for the heater in order to satisfy these two requirements. This study will investigate how to approach such a problem and how one can size such heater. Also, optimization techniques are considered in order to choose the proper design among all available solutions. There are two different ways to achieve a desired warm up time of a cold soaked electronics assembly. The first approach may require some manipulation of the location of the <b>heater</b> inside the <b>box</b> or the addition of insulating materials. This approach captures the heat generated by the heater inside the enclosure in order to achieve quicker warm up period. However, the presence of an insulator increases the risk of dangerously high temperatures during a failure mode scenario. To alleviate the insulator effect, the external enclosure heat dissipation mechanism must be altered. This kind of modification is costly and requires additional design steps. This is where the benefit of the second approach comes in. Namely, the desired result of a fast warm up time and lower failure mode temperatures can be achieved by manipulating the heater controller and controlling the amount of power to the heater. A Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Controller can be used to control not only the amount of heat generated by a heater, but also the percentage of heater "on” time within one pulse width and therefore the warm up time. Having the ability to control the frequency of releasing heat into the cold enclosure allows us to indicate two new parameters : the amount of heat load and the heat load frequency of inserting heat. A thermal management scheme can be developed to optimize the most efficient pair of values that will meet warm up time and failure mode temperature criteria. An analytical model is developed to study the thermal management of such a problem. The analytical model is used to perform an optimization study and to recommend a heater controller design for a given required specification...|$|R
