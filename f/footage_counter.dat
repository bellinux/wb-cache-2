5000|$|Mitchell Standard {{35mm camera}} - The {{original}} Mitchell rackover pin-registered studio camera, introduced in 1920 as a hand-cranked silent film camera. (The rackover device allowed the camera portion with its side-mounted viewfinder to be [...] "racked over" [...] upon its base, either {{left or right}} of the taking lens by turning {{a handle on the}} rear of the camera base. By racking to the right, the operator would focus the lens upon a ground glass element seen through the viewfinder. By racking back to the left, the camera with its film would be brought into position to record the view of the now focused lens). This standard model came with a 4-lens turret, a matte box on rails mounted {{to the front of the}} camera, and options included a veeder film <b>footage</b> <b>counter,</b> behind the lens iris, 4-way adjustable frame mattes, automatic or hand dissolve, internal matte disk with 9 pre-cut mattes including 1/2 frame, circles, keyhole, binocular, and oval. Various improvements and available options on this model took place over subsequent years, including a frames-per-second film speed meter, addition of a side-view parallax finder with upright view, various electric motors including variable speed, constant speed, and synchronized motors. The talking pictures introduced in 1926 soon required this somewhat noisy camera to run quieter with the so-called [...] "silent" [...] film movements, and soon thereafter a higher-speed [...] "silent" [...] movement and follow-focus devices were made available.|$|E
50|$|On a {{practical}} level, synchros resemble motors, {{in that there}} is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter's shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, <b>footage</b> <b>counters,</b> and projectors.|$|R
5000|$|Millennium (1997): The Panaflex Millennium is a sync-sound 35 mm {{motion picture}} camera. Where the Panavision Platinum was mostly an {{evolution}} and refinement {{of the original}} 1972 Panaflex, the Millennium is a totally new design, having a new twin-sprocket drum incorporated with the movement, major electronics revisions, and a general weight reduction from 24 to 17 lb. The Millennium is capable of 3-50 fps forward and reverse, though reverse running requires a reversing magazine, {{and it has a}} focal-plane shutter, the aperture angle of which can be adjusted electronically while the camera is running, between 11.2° and 180°, allowing for four stops of exposure ramping within a shot with no iris adjustment. All of the focus, iris, and zoom motor controls have been moved to the camera's internal circuitry, removing the need for cumbersome external circuit boxes, and it has an integrated camera built into the lens light, allowing the first assistant camera to see witness marks without having to physically look at the lens. It also has a brighter viewfinder than the Platinum, multiple run switches, and <b>footage</b> <b>counters</b> {{on either side of the}} camera for easier readings.|$|R
30|$|This section {{provides}} a critical discourse analysis of dominant cultural narratives that shape {{the depiction of}} dairy farming. These narratives are shaped and disseminated by dominant legal, media, educational and economic institutions. It is these very narratives that activist video <b>footage</b> aims to <b>counter.</b> Witnessing is, {{in the words of}} Peters (2001) “an extraordinary moral and cultural force” for social change.|$|R
