5|$|Achievements in gliding {{have been}} marked by the {{awarding}} of badges since the 1920s. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{his fear}} of demagoguery and belief {{the people of the}} United States could be easily misled, Gerry also {{advocated}} indirect elections. Although he was unsuccessful in obtaining them <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> house of Congress, Gerry did obtain such indirect elections for the U.S. Senate, whose members were to be elected by the state legislatures. Gerry also advanced numerous proposals for indirect elections of the President of the United States, most of them involving limiting the right to vote to the state governors and electors.|$|E

5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> ranks the position is not certain. Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not were armed with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two.

The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.|$|E
5|$|Interior colour schemes {{varied from}} model to model, but {{shared a common}} design approach.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed in the later 1860s. At first, Rockport was intended as a deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E

5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's {{colleagues at}} the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about his invention of the fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee published a report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly discussing his idea for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also the inventor of a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> segment cesarean section.|$|E
5|$|Following Franklin's retirement, she {{and several}} other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto {{claiming}} it had been unjustly enriched by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> salaries and pensions they had received.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, in an {{interview}} given to the French weekly magazine Air et Cosmos, Jean-Charles Marcos, CEO of Akka Research, explained that once developed and marketed the Air-Cobot should cost between 100,000 and 200,000 euros. He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile platform <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> parts, and a drone for the upper parts.

5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and aid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against {{what he saw as}} the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century AD the Proto-Gothic {{people of}} the Wielbark culture began their own great migration, moving east, south and south-east. In {{the first half of}} the 3rd century they left most of Pomerania except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Vistula region, where a small Wielbark {{population}} remained; Pomerania west of there became mostly settled by the Dębczyn group. Also evacuated at that time northern Greater Poland was retaken by the Przeworsk culture people. The Wielbark people successively took over eastern Masovia, Lesser Poland, Podlasie, Polesie and Volhynia. They settled in Ukraine, where they encountered other peoples, which resulted in the early 3rd century AD in the rise of the Chernyakhov culture. This last culture, which in the 4th century encompassed large areas of southeastern Europe, was of a mixed ethnic composition; in the more western part it was made-up of the Wielbark culture people, as well as other Germanic people and the Dacians. It was within the Chernyakhov culture that the Gothic tribes assumed their mature form.|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
