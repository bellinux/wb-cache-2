25|$|Handspinners are split, when <b>spinning</b> <b>wool,</b> as {{to whether}} it is better to spin it 'in the grease' (with lanolin still in) or after it has been washed.

Spinners who <b>spin</b> very <b>fine</b> yarn may also prefer to spin in the grease as it can allow them to <b>spin</b> <b>finer</b> yarns with more ease. Spinning in the grease covers the spinner's hands in lanolin and, thus, softens the spinner's hands.|$|R
