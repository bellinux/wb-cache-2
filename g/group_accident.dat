A log-linear analysis is then used to examine first- and second-order effects within three-variable <b>groups.</b> <b>Accident</b> severity modelling revealed a significant second-order interaction between severity, driver age and two-wheeler engine size. On the contrary, no second-order effects were identified in fault risk modelling. Moreover, a significant effect of driver age on accident fault risk was identified.

40|$|Objective: Stress {{plays an}} {{important}} role in affecting adrenal gland anatomy and structure which may have connection with suicidal behaviour in depressed patients. The increase in adrenal cortical function is paralleled by increased adrenal weight and zone specific cortical width. Method: Adrenal glands from persons aged 20 - 85 years who died unexpectedly either from road traffic accident or committed suicide and died immediately, were obtained from mortuary of Medical college and Hospital, Kolkata, within 48 hours of death and without any gross sign of putrefaction. After overnight fixation, the adrenals were carefully cleaned of adherent fat, blotted dry, weighed on electronic weighing machine having the accuracy of ± 0. 1 gram. After proper fixation, paraffin blocks were prepared, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Widths of cortical zones were measured by means of a calibrated eyepiece micrometer under light microscope. Result: The weight of right and left, both adrenal glands are significantly higher for suicide group than the control group. The width of zona fasciculata of right and left, both adrenal glands are significantly higher for suicide <b>group</b> than the <b>accident</b> <b>group.</b> The total cortical width of right and left, both adrenal glands are significantly higher for suicide <b>group</b> than the <b>accident</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusion: Increased weight of adrenal glands in suicide victims is mainly due cortical hypertrophy with increased width of zona fasciculata...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Contributory {{factors to}} {{motorcycle}} crashes vary among populations depending on several aspects {{such as the}} users' profiles, the composition and density of traffic, and the infrastructure features. A better under-standing of local motorcycle crashes can be reached in those places where a comprehensive analysis is per-formed. This paper presents the results obtained from a case study analysis of 400 police records of accidents involving motorcycles in Bogota. Method: To achieve a deeper level of understanding of how these accidents occur, we propose a systemic approach that uses available crash data. The methodology is inspired by accident prototypical scenarios, a tool for analysis developed in France. Results: When grouping cases we identified three categories: solo motorcycle accidents, motorcyclist and pedestrian accidents, and accidents involving a motorcycle and another vehicle. Within these categories we undertook in-depth analyses of 32 <b>groups</b> of <b>accidents</b> obtaining valuable information to better comprehend motorcyclists' road crashes in a local context. Recurrent contributory factors in the <b>groups</b> of <b>accidents</b> include : inexperienced motorcyclists, wide urban roads that incite speeding and risky overtaking maneuvers, flowing urban roads that encourage high speed and increased inter- action between vehicles, and lack of infrastructure maintenance. Practical Applications: The results obtained are a valuable asset to define measures that will be conveniently adapted to the <b>group</b> of <b>accident</b> on which we want to act. The methodology exposed in this paper is applicable {{to the study of}} road crashes that involve all types of actors, not only the motorcyclists, and in contexts different than those presented in Bogot...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{retrospective}} study {{was performed to}} assess maxillofacial fractures in patients treated at a public hospital from 2002 to 2006. The data collected included age, gender, etiology, type of injury, treatment modalities and period of treatment. Causes were grouped into seven cat-egories: road traffic collisions, sports accidents, occupational accidents, gunshot fractures, falls, violence and other causes. The analyses involved descriptive statistics, the Chi-squared Test and the Fisher Exact Test. Re-cords from 132 patients sustaining 185 maxillofacial fractures were eval-uated. The mandible (54. 6 %) was the most commonly fractured bone in the facial skeleton, followed by the zygoma (27. 6 %). The {{mean age of the}} patients was 37. 7 years, and the male:female ratio was 4. 3 : 1. Most fractures occurred in adults with ages ranging from 18 to 39 years. A significant statistical relation was found between the age and the etiology of the trauma (p < 0. 05), and between the number of fractured sites and the age of the patient (p < 0. 05).

40|$|This {{study is}} to perform {{empirical}} analysis on observational before-after studies in Naive Method, Comparison Group(CG) Method and Empirical Bayes(EB) Method, and to compare with their results and to propose ways to apply to evaluation researches. For this purpose, the evaluation of road safety audit executed on Yŏng-dong freeway in 2005 and 2006 was performed. As a result, all three methods have showed improved effects due to safety treatments. The safety effectiveness of Naive method is the largest, CG Method is the second and EB method is the last. The results of Naive method are overestimated due to the trend of reducing traffic accidents and those of CG method {{are affected by the}} external casual effects of comparison group. In the EB method, as “regression to the mean ” phenomenon are controlled by reference <b>group’s</b> <b>accident</b> model, it’s result is relatively more accurate than that of other methods.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} risk of {{accidents}} in patients with uncontrolled seizures, in seizure-free patients, and in patients with chronic headache. METHOD: This was a prospective longitudinal case-controlled study with interviews.
