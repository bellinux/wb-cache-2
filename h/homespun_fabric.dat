60|$|Erling {{had thrown}} off his jerkin and {{rolled up the}} sleeves of his shirt of coarse <b>homespun</b> <b>fabric,</b> in order to give his thick muscular arms {{unimpeded}} play in wielding the hammer and turning the mass of glowing metal on the anvil. He wore woollen breeches and hose, both of which had been fashioned by the fingers of his buxom mother, Herfrida. A pair of neatly formed shoes of untanned hide--his own workmanship--protected his feet, and his waist was encircled by a broad leathern girdle, from one side of which depended a short hunting-knife, and from the other a flap, with a slit in it, to support his sword. The latter weapon--a heavy double-edged blade--stood leaning against the forge chimney, along with a huge battle-axe, within reach of his hand. The collar of his shirt was thrown well back, exposing to view a neck and chest whose muscles denoted extraordinary power, and the whiteness of which contrasted strikingly with the ruddy hue of his deeply bronzed countenance.|$|E
50|$|Shakers ran {{a variety}} of {{businesses}} to support their communities. Many Shaker villages had their own tanneries, sold baskets, brushes, bonnets, brooms, fancy goods, and <b>homespun</b> <b>fabric</b> that was known for high quality, but were more famous for their medicinal herbs, garden seeds of the Shaker Seed Company, apple-sauce, and knitted garments (Canterbury).|$|E
50|$|Quilting {{traditions are}} {{particularly}} {{prominent in the}} United States, where the necessity of creating warm bedding met the paucity of local fabrics {{in the early days}} of the colonies. Imported fabric was very expensive, and local <b>homespun</b> <b>fabric</b> was labor-intensive to create and tended to wear out sooner than commercial fabric. It was essential for most families to use and preserve textiles efficiently. Saving or salvaging small scraps of fabric was a part of life for all households. Small pieces of fabric were joined together to make larger pieces, in units called “blocks.” Creativity could be expressed in the block designs, or simple “utility quilts,” with minimal decorative value, could be produced. Crib quilts for infants were needed in the cold of winter, but even early examples of beautiful baby quilts indicate the efforts that women made to welcome a new baby.Quilting was often a communal activity, involving all the women and girls in a family or in a larger community. The tops were prepared in advance, and a quilting bee was arranged, during which the actual quilting was completed by multiple people. Quilting frames were often used to stretch the quilt layers and maintain even tension to produce high-quality quilting stitches and to allow many individual quilters to work on a single quilt at one time. Quilting bees were important social events in many communities, and were typically held between periods of high demand for farm labor. Quilts were frequently made to commemorate major life events, such as marriages.|$|E

Ferrous sulfate is {{a leading cause of}} stream {{pollution}} in the streams of Pennsylvania, but the small amounts found in the Copperas Rock area are not enough to cause a significant problem in Great Trough Creek. A small cave found near Copperas Rock is thought to have been carved out by early settlers who used the ferrous sulfate mordant to set dyes to <b>homespun</b> <b>fabrics.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Badley {{was a great}} educationalist, an able Classicist; tall {{handsome}} charismatic, leading through {{example and}} great personal authority. Integral to that persona though was the personal reserve and sexual repression characteristic of the English Public School system, coupled with the quaint and even cranky - to modern sensibilities at least - obsessions of 1890 Sandal Socialism and German Naturkultur: the emphasis on cold baths, earth closets, <b>homespun</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and [...] "unsilly" [...] (i.e. non-sexual) friendship between adolescent boys and girls. He was strict and he was obeyed; he neither smoked nor drank: [...] "When he came stalking with his quick, silent tread, into the classroom there was immediate silence; if there {{happened to be a}} piece of paper on the floor, he would point to it without deigning to say a word, and the boy nearest would hurriedly pick it up." ...|$|R

40|$|Pilling is {{a process}} in which {{friction}} causes the formation of fuzz, the fuzzy material gets entangled and forms pills, and those pills fall off through abrasion. <b>Homespun</b> <b>fabric</b> tends to form many pills because wool is already to a certain degree fluffy. This study examined the pilling characteristics of <b>homespun</b> <b>fabric</b> by conducting about 100 hours of pilling tests using an ICI-type tester to learn the relationship between time of pilling tests and changes in appearance. The following results were obtained: (1) During the test, <b>homespun</b> <b>fabric</b> formed a markedly large amount of pills within six hours. After 12 hours, pills had tangled with each other, forming larger, fluffier pills. (2) The time required for the pills to fall off depended on the type of wool used: 30 or more hours for merino wool and 66 or more hours for English wool. (3) After 54 hours, pills similar to the convex swellings in woven textiles were observed. In addition, the fluff decreased so greatly that the background design of the textile weaves were clearly seen, and the soft appearance characteristic of homespun wool disappeared. (4) After 102 hours, the number of pills decreased further, and the fluff and soft appearance disappeared completely. In addition, the weight of the wool decreased by 18 to 22 %, the thickness decreased by about 0. 13 to 0. 33 mm, and the compressive elasticity modulus decreased by 2 to 8 %. Thus, there was a significant degree of attrition...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The Cornett {{farm was}} settled in 1844 when northwestern Missouri was still frontier. The farm, its {{buildings}} and contents were {{donated to the}} University of Missouri in 1981. The house, built in 1884, contained three generations 2 ̆ 7 of belongings. Among them were 41 quilts made by various members of Cornett family between 1855 and 1940. This collection gives researchers valuable insights into the way people lived and how resources were utilized. Among the oldest quilts is one made entirely from handwoven homespun which was also home dyed. The fabrics were previously articles of clothing. A transitional quilt utilizes <b>homespun</b> <b>fabrics</b> which are hand-stitched on the face, while the backing is machine stitched of various homespun and commercial suitings of the 1870 - 90 period. Another group of quilts dating from the 1930 s utilizes pastel and floral printed cottons in patterns like 2 ̆ 2 Grandmother 2 ̆ 7 s Flower Garden 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Wedding Ring 2 ̆ 2 which {{were published in the}} Kansas City Star and other newspapers read by rural Missourians. The makers of this collection of quilts are firmly documented. The oldest utility quilt was made by a mother of five from materials at hand. The requirements of self-sufficient agricultural venture left meager cash resources to be squandered on bedding that could be acquired in other ways. The makers of the 2 ̆ 2 Grandmother!s Flower Garden 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 Wedding Ring 2 ̆ 2 quilts, on the other hand, were well-educated women with readily available cash supplies who could indulge in making attractive quilts in the latest style for recreation. Such products were used more for decoration than for warmth...|$|R
50|$|Vanderbilt's {{idea was}} to {{replicate}} the working estates of Europe. He asked Hunt and Olmsted to design a village with architecturally compatible buildings and picturesque landscaping {{as a source of}} income through building rental, a place to help carry out philanthropic programs, and an easy point of access between the estate and the train station. The result was Biltmore Village. The village included rental cottages complete with plumbing and central heating, a post office, shops, doctor's office, school, and a church, known today as the Cathedral of All Souls. Intending that the estate could be self-supporting, Vanderbilt set up scientific forestry programs, poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms, and a dairy. His wife, Edith, also enthusiastically supported agricultural reform and promoted the establishment of a state agricultural fair. In 1901, the Vanderbilts provided financial assistance to Biltmore Industries, started by Biltmore Village resident Eleanor Vance, which taught young people how to make hand-carved furniture, woven baskets, <b>homespun</b> wool <b>fabric,</b> and more.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - {{stretchy}} and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.Woven wraps are pieces of woven fabric of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton being the most common, but hemp, linen, silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are <b>homespun</b> or handwoven <b>fabrics</b> with simple over-under weaves, twills and jacquards. Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertaion. February 2012. Major: English. Advisor: Dr. Edward M. Griffin. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 227 pages. This study explores the colonial-based historical fiction of Melville (Israel Potter), Sedgwick (Hope Leslie), and Hawthorne (The House of the Seven Gables), and uses references to American textiles and apparel to analyze what John McWilliams calls "the problem of cultural memory" {{presented in the}} literature. The project, therefore, establishes clothing as an authentic repository of cultural history and demonstrates "textile analysis" [...] the methodology I employ for reading representations of textiles as historical text [...] as a productive mode of inquiry and a valuable pedagogical approach. Nineteenth-century American authors sought to fashion a useable past out {{of the history of}} British North America but often found the remnants of colonial dependency ill-suited to the independent frame of the United States. Although the nation longed to speed away from "colony" and toward "nation," the relative infancy of the United States forced authors to search for a myth of origin that would both predict the Revolution and present an established member of the family of nations. Sometimes with reverence but often with contempt, American authors ascended into the not-so dusty attic of colonial history to seek and to re-fashion truly American, while not always true, American stories. The fictional revisions woven from remnants of colonial dependency and newly-fashioned sovereign ideals altered American history through imaginative historical representation and, in so doing, effectively revolutionized cultural memory to fit a maturing nation. While the design of these fictional revisions depended on historical material, the physical material of colonial textiles and apparel provided the necessary shuttle between the mythic and the historical, the imaginary and the "real. " Weaving material relics with archival material effectively transforms fiction into history. References to apparel disguise literary invention as believable fact and establish an authentic conduit to historical memory, albeit mitigated by the nineteenth-century author. In antebellum fiction the entwining of history with <b>homespun</b> and other <b>fabrics</b> resurrects a proto-Revolutionary colonial history even as it exposes the complicated inheritance of "tenth-generation" Americans. In this fashion, and in a major variation to David Levin's terminology, the nineteenth-century Romantic artist becomes its historian...|$|R
