Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors). Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed {{by the end of the}} inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin.

40|$|Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) is {{the largest}} active {{volcanic}} belt in New Zealand, and has erupted > 10. 000 km 3 of dominantly rhyolitic magma during the last 1. 6 m. y. This study concerns the field relations, volcanology and petrology of two post-Whakamaru (330 ka) - pre-Mamaku (140 ka) ignimbrites, informally named as the Pokai and Chimp ignimbrites, occurring in a ca. 360 km 2 area SW and W from Rotorua in the north-western TVZ. The Pokai Ignimbrite has a minimum volume of ca. 33 km 3 DRE, whereas the older Chimp Ignimbrite has a minimum volume of only ca. 5 km 3 DRE. Of the two ignimbrites the younger Pokai Ignimbrite is better preserved and is thus the main emphasis in this thesis. The Chimp Ignimbrite is relatively pumice- and crystal-poor (1 - 2 vol. % phenocrysts), and the exposed flow units are relatively thin (4 - 6 m). A short plinian phase preceded the Chimp Ignimbrite, whereas the Pokai Ignimbrite {{is marked by a}} number of pre-ignimbrite air-fall pumice and ash layers. The Pokai Ignimbrite represents a multiple flow unit ignimbrite, with single flow units usually ranging from 6 - 30 m. Thick deposits (> 20 m thick) are usually welded in the upper middle part of the <b>deposit.</b> <b>Ground</b> deposits, i. e. layer 1 deposits, are rare. Field evidence suggest that the Pokai Ignimbrite originated from the Kapenga Volcanic Centre, a multiple caldera structure in the northern central TVZ. Two pumice types occur in the Pokai Ignimbrite; a crystal-poor type (2 - 3 % phenocrysts) and a crystal-rich type (6 - 12 % phenocrysts). Plagioclase is the dominant phenocryst throughout, with minor amounts of orthopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and quartz, which occurs in ca. 30 % of the pumices. Hornblende and clinopyroxene are present occasionally. The Pokai Ignimbrite ranges from mildly to strongly peraluminous, whereas the Chimp Ignimbrite is mildly peraluminous, both coinciding with other TVZ rhyolitic ignimbrites, but clearly differing from the rhyolitic lavas which are usually metaluminous to only mildly peraluminous. Whereas most TVZ rhyolitic eruptives have been regarded as relatively homogeneous, the Pokai Ignimbrite shows significant geochemical variation. The magma chamber was compositionally zoned from crystal-poor, high silica, low Sr (77 % SiO 2, 50 ppm Sr) rhyolitic top to more crystal-rich, low silica, high Sr (70 % SiO 2, 130 ppm Sr) rhyolite at the deeper levels. Prior to the eruption vigorous mixing of magma from different levels occurred, producing different pumice types in the airfall deposits, and multiple phenocryst populations in single pumice clasts. As the eruption progressed successively deeper levels of the magma chamber were tapped, the last eruption products representing the less evolved, crystal-rich magma. Least squares and Rayleigh fractionation models indicate that the Pokai, and the Chimp magmas most probably generated by AFC from TVZ andesitic magmas contaminated by Mesozoic basement sediments...|$|E

The research area included two sampling points located in the Iron Quadrangle, Cardoso river in Nova Lima MG and a tailing deposit located along the same river. The results {{under the influence of the}} physical chemical conditions of the river, show a presence of As (III) in the range of 40 % to 83 % relatively to total dissolved arsenic and 94 % of As (III) in a monitoring well from the mine tailing deposit.

40|$|Summary In {{the context}} of the reinterpretation of marine seismic data in the Ross Sea being made for the Vilmap PNRA project, newly {{acquired}} higher resolution single channel seismic lines (IT 02) allowed a detailed investigation of the Cenozoic glacial features present in the Wood Bay, coastal area of western Ross Sea between Cape Washington and Mariner/Borchgrevink Glaciers. The investigation focused on the dynamics of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, and, in particular, the local coastal glaciers that extend into the sea as ice tongues, contributing to drainage the East Antarctic Ice Sheet through the Transantarctic Mountains. The dynamics of the group of three valley and outlet glaciers, the Tinker Glacier, Aviator Glacier and Parker Glacier, is clearly shown in the investigated depositional features that include subglacial and proglacial progradational <b>deposits,</b> <b>grounding</b> zone wedges, a possible morainal bank complex, and in the erosional evidence of glacial unconformities and troughs...|$|R

40|$|Bouguer anomaly {{maps are}} {{powerful}} cartographic tools used mainly by geoscientists and natural resources' companies (oil, mining, etc.) since they reflect rock density distribution at different depths, allowing {{the identification of}} different tectonic features. At upper crustal levels, Bouguer anomaly maps can help, for instance, in characterizing possible ore <b>deposits,</b> <b>ground</b> water reservoirs, petroleum resources, CO 2 storage sites and sedimentary basins; at deeper crustal levels they can help to further refine seismic velocity models or other integrated geophysical models and thus help in deciphering the lateral density variations within the crust and the geometry of {{the base of the}} crust.
