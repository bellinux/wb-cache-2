40|$|The custom, largely {{adopted in}} many {{manufacturing}} districts, {{particularly in the}} north of Ireland, of manufacturers in the linen and damask trade giving out to weavers the materials for webs to be woven by them in their own homes, has been the origin of a small code of laws. The fact that property, representing a very large amount of capital, is entrusted during a considerable time to men generally poor, and is left during that time under their complete control, in danger of being lost or injured, not only by their dishonesty but also by their want of care or of industry, or even by their misfortunes, {{as well as by the}} dishonesty, negligence, or misfortune of the other inmates of their houses, has been considered sufficient to justify the existence of special laws, containing provisions intended to protect the interests of the owners of such property. These provisions, with others regulating the sale of flax and linen, and intended to protect buyers of such against <b>fraud,</b> <b>form</b> the contents of the Acts which are the subject of this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance {{theoretical}} understanding of the important role of both power and negotiation during online deception.   By so doing, the paper provides insight into the relationship between perpetrator and victim in Internet fraud. The growing prevalence of Internet Fraud continues to be a burden to both society and individuals. In an attempt to better understand Internet fraud and online deception, this article attempts to build an interactive model, based upon the dimensions of power and negotiation from the management and psychology literature. Using the model presented, the article examines the effects of the Internet on the communication process that takes place between perpetrator and victim. Finally, the article discusses some of the major tactics employed to appeal to each power type in predominant <b>fraud</b> <b>forms,</b> as well exploring future types of fraud. </p...|$|R

It is frequently used to fight public corruption because it is easier to prove than bribery or extortion. The term [...] "honest services" [...] is broad and open to jury interpretation, according to several legal experts.

50|$|Pratt, Holtfreter and Reisig 6 {{clarified}} {{that where}} street/violent crime targeted and victimized younger minority males, those targeted for Internet fraud {{tended to be}} younger and better educated. The more important finding is that both violent crime and Internet <b>fraud</b> <b>forms</b> of victimization still share the same underlying causal mechanism associated with the routine activities of potential crime targets. Criminologist Theorist Lynch 4 uses the routine theory to explain that people at work was {{a major determinant of}} victimization risk among employed persons, even when dangerousness of the work area was held constant. Moreover, the specific attributes of activities pursued at work exposure, guardianship, attractiveness—were all related to victimization in ways predicted by activity theory. Victimization is usually attributed to the carelessness of the person performing a specific occupational role. These findings indicate that differences in the risk of victimization at work are determined more by the task performed than the person in the occupational role. Moreover, these findings identify specific attributes of occupations that could be modified {{to reduce the risk of}} criminal victimization at work. Victimization of workers at work will decline if mobility, public accessibility, and handling of money as part of the occupational role are reduced. Hawdon 4 notes in his research that Hirschi found that routine activities were the best predictors of serious crime. Individuals engaged in routine patterns faced little social control and have higher rates of crime. Involvement in routine pattern with mixed levels of visibility and instrumentally, social, and athletic patterns has little effect on delinquency.|$|R
