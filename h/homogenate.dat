2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver <b>homogenate,</b> which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver <b>homogenate</b> indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|E

An abrupt drop in the relative participation by the phosphogluconate pathway in embryo heart <b>homogenates</b> occurs at about 5 to 7 days of incubation.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of prostaglandins F 2 alpha and E 2 by guinea-pig uterine <b>homogenates</b> was inhibited by p-bromophenacyl bromide (PBPAB), an inhibitor of phospholipase A 2. 2 Metabolism of prostaglandin F 2 alpha by uterine <b>homogenates</b> was undetectable; {{this was not}} affected by PBPAB. 3 There {{was no significant difference}} between the amounts of arachidonic acid released from uterine <b>homogenates</b> on days 7 and 1 k of the oestrous cycle.

50|$|The fourth paper {{published}} in this series, entitled “The Relationship of Epinephrine and Glucagon to Liver Phosphorylase: IV Effect of Epinephrine and Glucagon on the Reactivation of Phosphorylase in Liver Homogenates”, {{came out in}} 1956 and was the most influential and groundbreaking of those released. In this paper, Sutherland and associates furthered their investigation of epinephrine and glucagon. The key {{to the success of}} this experiment was the use a <b>homogenate</b> of liver cells rather than intact liver cells, as they had been doing in their previous experiments. The general consensus among researchers at that time was that the study of hormones was only possible using intact cells; this was the first instance that a hormone pathway was studied using a cell <b>homogenate.</b> Sutherland and his co-authors were able to observe similar effects in liver <b>homogenate</b> to what was observed in whole liver slices. More importantly, they were able to observe this response in two stages. This stage response was characterized by the particulate fraction producing an unknown heat stable factor {{in the presence of the}} hormones epinephrine and glucagon. This factor then stimulates the formation of liver phosphorylase in a fraction of the <b>homogenate</b> where the hormones are not present. This unknown heat stable factor, which was produced in the presence of hormones and ultimately led to the secondary formation of liver phosphorylase, was later termed cyclic AMP.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is a {{comparison}} of respiratory metabolic rates and anaerobic glycolytic activity (lactate accumulation) in <b>homogenates</b> of epididymides from normal, orchidectomized and testosterone replaced-orchidectomized mice. Animals subjected to vasa efferentiectomy were used to furnish sperm free <b>homogenates</b> as controls for the <b>homogenates</b> from orchidectomized animals, and to furnish estimates of the contribution of the spermatozoa to these metabolic parameters in <b>homogenates</b> of normal epididymides. Efferentiectomized mice yield <b>homogenates</b> with a significantly lowered rate of respiratory activity (30 %). Experiments with fractions of these <b>homogenates</b> showed this reduction in activity to be equivalent to the contribution of the spermatozoa in <b>homogenates</b> from normal mice. No significant difference in the rate of respiratory metabolism was observed among <b>homogenates</b> obtained from efferentiectomized, orchidectomized, testosterone replaced-orchidectomized, or testosterone injected-efferentiectomized mice. Efferentiectomy also resulted in a lowered rate of anaerobic glycolytic activity in vitro. No further reduction or elevation of this activity was observed in <b>homogenates</b> from orchidectomized or testosterone injected animals. Further study indicated this loss following efferentiectomy to be due to a reduced glycolytic activity in the epididymal epithelium rather than to the absence of spermatozoan contribution to the metabolism. The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that the presence of some component of the spermatozoa or the fluids in which they reside controls the activation or inhibition of a segment of the lactic dehydrogenase activity which is responsible for the secretion of lactic acid into the epididymal canal for spermatozoan utilization...|$|R

These Vaccinium berries contain high levels of flavonoids; however, the bioavailability of flavonoids is generally low. We investigated the in vitro effects of these berries on intestinal cells, focusing on mitigating oxidative stress and associated reactive oxygen species (ROS). First, we simulated the passage of CB and BB through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by treating berry <b>homogenates</b> to a battery of digestive enzymes. Then, Caco- 2 cells, a model of small intestine epithelial uptake, were exposed to these <b>homogenates</b> for 60 min.

However, both of the enzyme-treated <b>homogenates</b> were still able to counteract the ROS-generating ability of H 2 O 2 added exogenously to Caco- 2 cells. Berry <b>homogenates</b> also increased mitochondrial metabolic rates at 60 min posttreatment, as measured by MTT assays. Enzyme-treated CB (but not BB) <b>homogenates</b> increased the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) relative to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), a critical indicator of the cellular redox state (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{bile salt}} {{hydrolase}} activity in intestinal <b>homogenates</b> reflects composite {{activities of the}} gastrointestinal microbial consortia. We have proposed that specific transformations of conjugated bile acids by the intestinal microflora result {{in the production of}} metabolites which depress the growth of poultry. The influence of dietary carbohydrates on the physical and kinetic properties of cholyltaurine hydrolase activity, one such bile acid-transforming enzyme in gastrointestinal <b>homogenates</b> of young chickens, was characterized by using a sensitive radiochemical assay. Cholyltaurine hydrolase activity in crude extracts of ileal <b>homogenates</b> was increased twofold by 0. 25 % Triton X- 100 and a freeze-thaw cycle. The pH optimum for cholyltaurine hydrolase from ileal <b>homogenates</b> was very broad and reflected the pH range of poultry intestinal contents (i. e., 5. 8 to 6. 4). The carbohydrate component of the diet did not affect the apparent temperature optimum (41 degrees C) or stability profile, nor did it affect the apparent Km for taurocholic acid hydrolysis (approximately 0. 43 mM). The enzymes in intestinal <b>homogenates</b> were active on all taurine-conjugated bile acids tested. The carbohydrate component of the diet did, however, affect the specific activity of cholyltaurine hydrolase in ileal <b>homogenates</b> from chickens. The levels of cholyltaurine hydrolase activity (rye greater than sucrose greater than corn) in <b>homogenates</b> from birds fed the different diets were directly related to the amount of growth depression (rye greater than sucrose greater than corn) associated with feeding these dietary carbohydrates.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{explore the}} {{usefulness}} of fruit extracts as enhancers of the oral absorption of esterase-sensitive prodrugs. METHODS: Inhibition of esterase-mediated degradation by nature-identical fruit extracts was evaluated using 1) p-nitrophenylacetate (model substrate for esterase-activity) in rat intestinal <b>homogenates</b> and 2) bis(isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl) -(R) - 9 -[(2 -phosphonomethoxy++ +) propyl]adenine [bis(POC) -PMPA] (esterase-sensitive prodrug of the antiviral agent PMPA) in Caco- 2 cell <b>homogenates</b> and in intestinal <b>homogenates</b> from rat, pig and man. Subsequently, transport of the ester prodrug was studied across Caco- 2 monolayers in {{the presence or absence}} of fruit extracts. RESULTS: In <b>homogenates</b> from rat ileum, the esterase activity could be reduced significantly by the inclusion of fruit extracts (1 %) : the initial enzymatic degradation of p-nitrophenylacetate was inhibited by 77 % (strawberry), 16 % (passion fruit) and 57 % (banana). A similar inhibition of bis(POC) -PMPA metabolism by fruit extracts was observed in intestinal <b>homogenates</b> from several species and in <b>homogenates</b> from Caco- 2 cells. Transport of total PMPA across Caco- 2 monolayers was enhanced 3 -fold by co-incubation with strawberry extract (1 %). The fraction of intact prodrug appearing in the acceptor compartment increased from virtually zero to 67 %. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that co-incubation with nature-identical fruit extracts might be useful as a strategy to enhance the transepithelial transport of esterase-sensitive prodrugs through inhibition of intracellular metabolism of the prodrug. status: publishe...|$|R
