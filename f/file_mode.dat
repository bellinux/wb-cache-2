50|$|In computing, umask is {{a command}} that determines the {{settings}} of a mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created files. It also may {{refer to a}} function that sets the mask, or it may refer to the mask itself, which is formally known as the <b>file</b> <b>mode</b> creation mask. The mask is a grouping of bits, each of which restricts how its corresponding permission is set for newly created files. The bits in the mask may be changed by invoking the umask command.|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} the NASA's library network system, NALNET, the {{functions}} of the current book system, the products and services of a book system required by NASA Center libraries, and the characteristics of a system that would best supply those products and services were assessed. Emphasis was placed on determining the most cost effective means of meeting NASA's requirements for an automated book system. Various operating modes were examined including the current STIMS file, the PUBFILE, developing software improvements for products as appropriate to the Center needs, and obtaining cataloging and products from the bibliographic utilities including at least OCLC, RLIN, BNA, and STIF. It is recommended that NALNET operate under the STIMS <b>file</b> <b>mode</b> and obtain cataloging and products from the bibliographic utilities.
