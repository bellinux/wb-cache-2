25|$|The {{interaction}} of most ligands with their binding sites {{can be characterized}} {{in terms of a}} binding affinity. In general, high-affinity ligand binding results from greater <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> between the ligand and its receptor while low-affinity ligand binding involves less <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> between the ligand and its receptor. In general, high-affinity binding results in a higher degree of occupancy for the ligand at its receptor binding site than is the case for low-affinity binding; the residence time (lifetime of the receptor-ligand complex) does not correlate. High-affinity binding of ligands to receptors is often physiologically important when some of the binding energy can be used to cause a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in altered behavior of an associated ion channel or enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Proper use {{of these}} gas {{relationships}} requires the Kinetic-molecular theory (KMT). When gas particles possess a magnetic charge or <b>Intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> they gradually influence one another as the spacing between them is reduced (the hydrogen bond model illustrates one example). In {{the absence of any}} charge, at some point when the spacing between gas particles is greatly reduced they can no longer avoid collisions between themselves at normal gas temperatures. Another case for increased collisions among gas particles would include a fixed volume of gas, which upon heating would contain very fast particles. This means that these ideal equations provide reasonable results except for extremely high pressure (compressible) or high temperature (ionized) conditions. Notice that all of these excepted conditions allow energy transfer to take place within the gas system. The absence of these internal transfers is what is referred to as ideal conditions in which the energy exchange occurs only at the boundaries of the system. Real gases experience some of these collisions and intermolecular forces. When these collisions are statistically negligible (incompressible), results from these ideal equations are still meaningful. If the gas particles are compressed into close proximity they behave more like a liquid (see fluid dynamics).|$|E

5000|$|Nanoparticles can self-assemble as {{a result}} of their <b>intermolecular</b> <b>forces.</b> As systems look to {{minimize}} their free energy, self-assembly is one option for the system to achieve its lowest free energy thermodynamically. [...] Nanoparticles can be programmed to self-assemble by changing the functionality of their side groups, taking advantage of weak and specific <b>intermolecular</b> <b>forces</b> to spontaneously order the particles. These direct interparticle interactions can be typical <b>intermolecular</b> <b>forces</b> such as hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces, but can also be internal characteristics, such as hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. For example, lipophilic nanoparticles have the tendency to self-assemble and form crystals as solvents are evaporated.

50|$|In {{the natural}} sciences, an <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> is an {{attraction}} between two molecules or atoms. They occur from either momentary interactions between molecules (the London dispersion force) or permanent electrostatic attractions between dipoles.

50|$|The <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> is {{weaker than}} {{electrostatic}} charges. However, it still attracts microscopic-sized dust {{to the image}} sensor with infinitesimal force. While earthing (grounding) the camera can help reduce the problem of electrostatic dust it does not reduce intermolecular attraction. If, for example, flour were drizzled into the camera, it would still adhere {{to the surface of}} earthed metal. This kind of dust is attracted by <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force.</b> Liquid also adheres to the image sensor by <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> and such molecules adhere strongly due to their ability to get closer to the adhesion surface, making it harder for dust reduction systems to remove these type of contaminants completely. In such instances, wiping the optical elements in front of the image sensor with cleaning fluid may be necessary.|$|E

50|$|Metallic bonding {{refers to}} the {{specific}} bonding between positive metal ions and surrounding valence electron clouds. This <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> is relatively strong, and {{gives rise to the}} repeated crystalline orientation of atoms, also referred to as its lattice system. There are several types of common lattice formations, and each has its own unique packing density and atomic closeness. The negatively charged electron clouds of the metal ions will sterically hinder the adhesion of negatively charged protein regions due to charge repulsion, thus limiting the available binding sites of a protein to a metal surface.|$|E
50|$|As {{explained}} before, {{the normal}} force is a contact force, that is, the resultant {{of the forces}} between the constituents of the actual constraint, and the constituents of the object. When the object and the constraint (a wall, a table, another object, or any surface) are pressed against each other, the van der Waals force, a force that grows very large very quickly, opposes this {{and for this reason}} the two objects cannot penetrate each other. If the two objects are then separated, even by a very small distance, the normal force disappears. This is because the <b>intermolecular</b> <b>force</b> quickly vanishes past the point of equilibrium.|$|E

(If separations are further increased, all <b>intermolecular</b> <b>forces</b> fall off rapidly and may be totally neglected.) Repulsion and attraction are due, respectively, to the small defects or excesses of electron densities of molecular complexes {{in the space between}} the interacting molecules, which often result in interaction-induced electric dipole moments that contribute some to interaction-induced emission and absorption intensities. The resulting dipoles are referred to as exchange force-induced dipole and dispersion force-induced dipoles, respectively.|$|R
