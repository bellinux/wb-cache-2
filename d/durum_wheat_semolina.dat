40|$|Re-milled <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>semolinas</b> from Altamura, Laterza and Matera (Southern Italy), {{currently}} {{used in the}} production of traditional breads, were tested for quality. The re-milled semolinas exhibited variable technological quality, and different bread-making techniques were observed. Alveograph P/L ranged from 0. 34 to 2. 50 with W values from 71104 to 176104 J. The higher values were found in samples from Laterza, which gave breads with the lowest specific volumes, due to its excessive gluten tenacity. The P/L values were correlated to SDS sedimentation height; dry gluten was correlated to both wet gluten content and protein content, and was negatively correlated to P/L. Bread protein content was correlated to the protein content of the starting material and bread specific volumes were negatively correlated to alveographic P/L values. Significant differences were found between breads from different points of origin (attributable to differences in the bread-making processes), in terms of the level of total titratable acidity and the yellow pigment content of the crum...|$|R

Spaghetti was prepared with a micro-scale extruder and the cooked pasta evaluated for cooking loss, firmness, stickiness and water absorption. The null- 4 A lines had significantly lower (ca. 5 %) amylose content, higher starch peak viscosities and semolina swelling power. The pasta derived from the null- 4 A lines had lower cooking loss and in 1999 was more adhesive than the non-waxy lines. Cooking loss was correlated with amylose content, peak starch viscosity, swelling power of semolina and cooked pasta adhesiveness. Semolina swelling power was highly correlated with RVA peak viscosity.

40|$|<b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> quality {{criteria}} continually evolve {{in response to}} market pressure and consumer preference. Increasing demand for specific <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> quality attributes for different endproducts requires development of more rapid objective means to grade and classify wheat parcels {{on the basis of}} processing potential. Near-infrared spectroscopy and image analysis have considerable potential for rapid objective wheat grading and classification. Preprocessing (debranning before milling) enhances <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> milling performance. Surface discolourations, major factors in grading <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> because of negative impact on semolina colour and presence of visible specks, will become less important if preprocessing becomes more accepted by <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> millers. <b>Semolina</b> granulation has become finer to accommodate large high capacity pasta presses and Polymatik presses. The move to finer granulation, particularly when protein content is specified, makes hard vitreous kernel content of less importance to <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> millers.

40|$|Endoxylanases seriously {{affect the}} {{rheological}} properties of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum <b>durum</b> Desf.) <b>semolina</b> spaghetti doughs prepared with, and as evaluated, by the farinograph. Under the experimental conditions, control doughs (34. 9 % moisture content) made from two semolinas (semA and semB) yielded a maximal consistency of 525 and 517 farinograph units (FU), with, respectively, 19. 4 and 16. 4 % {{of the total}} level of arabinoxylans (TOT-AX) being water-extractable (WE-AX). When 75. 4 Somogyi units/ 50 g of semolina of the endoxylanases from Trichoderma viride (XTV), rumen microorganisms (XRM), Bacillus subtilis (XBS), and Aspergillus niger (XAN) were used, the maximal consistencies at 34. 9 % moisture decreased for semA to 467, 436, 448, and 417 FU, respectively. This was accompanied by increased WE-AX contents of 60. 8, 71. 2, 70. 7, and 73. 0 %, respectively. Similar results were observed for semB. By reducing the total water content of doughs, {{it was possible to}} recover the maximal consistency of the original doughs. Both the decrease in maximal consistency and the amount of water to be omitted were significantly related to the decrease in molecular weight (MW) of the WE-AX and the percentage of WE-AX solubilized {{as a result of the}} enzymic action. At the same time, it was clear that endogenous endoxylanase inhibitors were present in the <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>semolinas</b> and that they inhibited the endoxylanases used to different degrees. Part of the differences in effects between the different endoxylanases (decrease in maximal consistency, amount of AX solubilized, MWs of the WE-AX, and amount of water that could be omitted) could be ascribed. to the differences in inhibition of the endoxylanases by endogenous inhibitors. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{information}} {{on the effect of}} sulfuryl fluoride (SF) on <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> technological properties and products made from fumigated <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> <b>Durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and <b>semolina</b> were exposed to a range of SF applications under conditions that might be typically encountered in bulk storage facilities used in many countries. SF greatly reduced the germination percentage of fumigated <b>durum</b> <b>wheat,</b> with increasing impact under higher SF concentration, grain moisture content, and fumigation temperature. SF greatly reduced seed germination percentage, impacting more the higher the SF concentration. SF had little to no effect on grain test weight, 1, 000 -grain weight, hardness, protein content, semolina ash content, and mixograph properties. At the highest SF concentration (31. 25 mg/L for 48 h) there was a tendency for pasta cooking loss to be increased but still acceptable, and other pasta properties were largely unaffected. Fumigation with SF did not have any impact on the baking properties of a wholemeal durum flour-commercial flour mix. Therefore, SF is not recommended if the grains are to be used as seeds for agricultural production, but for the production of semolina, pasta, and bread, SF used under typical fumigation conditions has little to no impact on technological properties of <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> © 2016 AACC International, Inc...|$|R

40|$|During {{the filling}} of a {{container}} by a dry granular material (ex. storage in a silo, mixer container, packaging), the powder flow {{interacts with the}} side walls and {{the bottom of the}} bowl, and leads {{to the creation of a}} semi-confined free surface in the “feeding zone” and of particle jamming under the free surface. The “feeding zone” corresponds to a zone of strong energy dissipation induced by shocks and frictions between the grain bed formed, the particles in movement and walls of the bowl. The resultant free surface takes the shape of a heap and the surface rises upward the bowl with the powder filling. Once "buried" within the heap, particles are immobilized under the free surface. Particle jamming can be postponed according to the possible local mobility. The stabilization of the intergranular force network inside the heap leads to the establishment of a local stress field. The intensity and the distribution of these stresses can be very different according to the elastic and frictional properties of the particles and also according to the powder filling conditions (size of the bowl, mechanical properties of the walls, flowing properties of the particles, initial velocity of the particles, etc.). The knowledge of the local stress field is important for a mechanical stability of storages or a grain re-mobilization grains under the influence of a shear stress (mixing, flowing) or a compression stress (packing, tapping, compaction). This work concerns the experimental identification of the static mechanical state within an ensiled granular material by measuring the force applied on a sensor immersed inside the heap. The experimental analysis of the powder filling and of the stabilized bed formation is realized with granular materials of contrasted properties (<b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>semolinas,</b> agglomerates), which are poured according to a calibrated protocol in a cell in order to follow the evolution of the free surface by recording successive pictures. The results allow to characterize the formation of a heap with repose rest angle more or less important. This structure, which results from local granular arrangements, suggests the expression of two main modes of layout: the one by "layering" with a lateral homogeneity of the local stresses (at least until a certain distance of the side walls), the other one in "dune", (sloping heap) with a lateral heterogeneity of the local stresses. The joint analysis of the local vertical stresses in the granular bed, reveals a direct relation between the structure of the free surface and the distribution of the local stresses. Several modes of stress distribution could be distinguished and could be classified according to a parameter of uniformity and their gap from an ideal hydrostaticity...|$|R
