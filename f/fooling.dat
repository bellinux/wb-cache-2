5|$|On March 28, 2006, {{the cannon}} {{disappeared}} from the Caltech campus, having been taken by people posing as contractors, <b>fooling</b> a security guard with a phony work order. At the time, the cannon was not at its normal location outside Fleming House, where it is normally locked to the ground, due to ongoing renovations. The identity of the perpetrators was initially unknown, and there was speculation {{that it had been}} stolen by nearby Harvey Mudd College, who had been responsible for a well-known theft of the cannon almost twenty years prior.|$|E
5|$|These were {{years of}} tension in policy towards France, with Walsingham sceptical of the {{unpredictable}} Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford. Stafford, who was compromised by his gambling debts, {{was in the}} pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain. Walsingham may {{have been aware of}} Stafford's duplicity, as he fed the ambassador false information, presumably in the hope of <b>fooling</b> or confusing the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|While probing crevices {{with their}} head, banded sea kraits {{are unable to}} observe {{approaching}} predators and can be vulnerable. The snakes can deter predators, such as larger fish, sharks, and birds, by <b>fooling</b> them into thinking that their tail is their head, because the color and movement of the tail {{is similar to that}} of the snake's head. For example, the lateral aspect of the tail corresponds to the dorsal view of the head.|$|E

5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by <b>fooling</b> the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E
5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often <b>fooling</b> those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E

And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true <b>fool</b> natural.
