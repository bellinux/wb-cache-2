No significant damage was done to the plant's nuclear containment buildings. The plant was built to withstand winds of up to 235mph (380km/h), greatly exceeding the maximum winds recorded by most category 5 hurricanes.|$|E

Method : Design {{used in this study}} is a descriptive study with a qualitative approach. In the selection of informants using the snowball sampling technique, informants in this study amounted to seven people and for the selection of the building using purposive sampling. Result : The water is taken from retention ponds and Water Treatment Proces. There is already an exit but still do not have the sign yet. Testing of fire resistant building structure had not been done. Fire extinguisher only found in the rektorat buildings and chemical laboratories, hydrant and siemense conection only found in rusunawa buildings, alarms and fire detector only provided in clinics whereas there is no sprinkler at all.
