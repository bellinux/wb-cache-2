2500|$|Protons {{may also}} be used in {{radiosurgery}} in a procedure called Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) or proton therapy. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical synchrotron or cyclotron, and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> The phenomenon of the Bragg peak of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, {{since most of the}} proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the [...] "depth charge effect" [...] by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the optic chiasm or brainstem. The development of [...] "intensity modulated" [...] techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.|$|E

50|$|The acidity of hides {{once they}} have {{finished}} pickling will typically be between pH of 2.8-3.2. At this point the hides are loaded in a drum and immersed in a float containing the tanning liquor. The hides are allowed to soak (while the drum slowly rotates about its axle) and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full substance of the hide. Regular checks {{will be made to}} see the penetration by cutting the cross section of a hide and observing the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> Once an even <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> is observed, the pH of the float is slowly raised in a process called basification. This basification process fixes the tanning material to the leather, and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the hydrothermal stability and increased shrinkage temperature resistance of the leather. The pH of the leather when chrome tanned would typically finish somewhere between 3.8-4.2.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe last 20 {{years have}} {{presented}} a favorable scenario for {{the incorporation of}} renewable energy sources into the energy matrix of developing countries. This situation promoted grid connected photovoltaic generation systems (GCPVS) {{to become one of}} the main protagonists in this new concept of energy matrix. In some developing countries the use of such systems is in its beginning. Promotion policies and technical as well as regulatory conditions for their installation have just started to be defined. In this context, there exists in Argentina a legal and regulatory framework for the implementation of large photovoltaic plants but there is a lack of such legal framework for distributed generation (DG) by means of grid connected photovoltaic into the medium and low voltage distribution networks. This situation led research centers, together with private and provincial Energy Agencies to install pilot systems in order to identify and characterize their impact on the low voltage distribution network, taking into account the local grid capacity and characteristics of each province. In this paper the implications <b>of</b> different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> solar photovoltaic power generation evaluated using technical parameters of the network is presented. A set of examples of residential users connected to a distribution substation in the city of Corrientes is analyzed by means of a simulation using real grid data with the incorporation of GCPVS generation. The simulation results show that both the level <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> GCPVS systems as well as location where these distributed energy sources should couple to the distribution grid must be carefully assessed to maximize the benefits of the inclusion of distributed generation in urban environments...|$|R
50|$|Diffusion theory: The {{mechanism}} for diffusion involves polymer and mucin chains from the adhesive penetrating the matrix of the substrate and forming a semipermanent bond. As {{the similarities between}} the adhesive and the substrate increase, so does the degree of mucoadhesion. The bond strength increases with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration,</b> increasing the adhesion strength. The penetration rate is determined by the diffusion coefficient, the degree of flexibility of the adsorbate chains, mobility and contact time. The diffusion mechanism itself is affected by the length of the molecular chains being implanted and cross-linking density, and is driven by a concentration gradient.|$|E

50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leatherâand the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|E

40|$|The present work is an {{experimental}} investigation of turbulent mixing of two co-axial jets with low annular to core area ratio in a non-separating confinement. Experiments {{were conducted in}} a newly designed set-up having a duct to nozzle diameter ratio of 1. 19. Two centrifugal blowers driven by motors of 30 kW power each generated the air flow. Influence of chute geometry on the turbulent mixing of two co-axial streams is studied by using two chute mixer configurations having 10 degrees and 20 <b>degrees</b> angles <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the annular stream towards the core region at a velocity ratio of 1. 8. Contours of mean velocity and streamwise and transverse turbulence intensities were obtained by making measurements close {{to the point of}} injection with a very fine grid. The results show an improved mixing due to chutes. A stronger transverse turbulence component (w') is observed close to the injection points, which seems to enhance mixing. Profiles at the downstream locations show a faster approach towards uniform mean velocity and homogeneous turbulence intensity. With the chute model having 20 <b>degrees</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>penetration,</b> nearly complete mixing is achieved at a distance of 2. 2 duct radii itself, suggesting feasibility of shortening of the duct by about 50 %. However, a higher total pressure loss of about 1. 7 % is the penalty to be paid for enhanced mixing of the jets...|$|R
