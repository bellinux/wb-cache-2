5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{innovations}} in sculpture {{that occurred during}} the Middle Kingdom was the block statue, which would continue to be popular through to the Ptolemaic age almost 2,000 years later. Block statues consist of a man squatting with his knees drawn up to his chest and <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> on top his knees. Often, these men are wearing a [...] "wide cloak" [...] that reduces the body of the figure to a simple block-like shape. Most of the detail is reserved for the head of the individual being depicted. In some instances the modeling of the limbs has been retained by the sculptor. There are two basic types of block statues: ones with the feet completely covered by the cloak and ones with the feet uncovered.|$|E
2500|$|With Australians out {{for their}} third low score {{in a row and}} with no rain in sight England had every chance of making a large total on a good wicket and {{equalising}} the series. It was an opportunity they did not take as Ian Johnson caught Reg Simpson (4) off Keith Miller (2/39), who then took a magnificent driving catch to take John Dewes (8) off Bill Johnston (2/28). Cyril Washbrook was joined by Len Hutton – still batting in the middle order – to re-establish their old partnership and set about restoring the innings. Washbrook (21) made some charming cover-drives before he was given out lbw to Ray Lindwall (2/46), although only he and Don Tallon appealed and the other nine fielders remained silent. Jack Iverson was brought on and saw a ball flick off Hutton's pads as he checked a sweep (it was the over before lunch). Iverson yelled [...] "Catch it", Tallon dived forwards to take the ball an inch off the ground and the bewildered opener was given out for 12. Only Iverson appealed and [...] "Not even Tallon, {{one of the most notorious}} appealers of all time, asked for a catch". and Miller, standing four feet away at silly-leg [...] "stood there with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded,</b> feet wide apart, completely uninterested" [...] Hutton returned to the pavilion with a face like thunder and [...] Umpire Cooper was obviously upset that he so obviously disagreed with the decision and ended the over after only seven balls. One Yorkshireman was soon followed by another as Brian Close swished a ball to Sam Loxton and England went into lunch on 54/5. Captain Freddie Brown and Gilbert Parkhouse returned to the crease after lunch and made the best of things, but the Welshman's stilt-like footwork was his undoing and he was caught by Hassett off Miller. He was replaced by Trevor Bailey who steadfastly defended at one end while his captain brought the crowd to its feet hitting Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He hit three more boundaries in his 62 and they added 65 for the seventh wicket. Bailey was out first, bowled by Lindwall and Brown was caught by Johnson off Iverson. Godfrey Evans hit Lindwall straight to the boundary and took 8 runs off Miller, which resulted in a bouncer, which the keeper dodged like a boxer, and the bowler being booed. Evans cracked another four past point off Miller, who was removed from the attack, and passed 1,000 runs in Tests, but was [...] "c Johnson, b Iverson" [...] for 49 and was cheered by the crowd when he left. Alec Bedser (5 not out) had batted for nearly an hour helping Evans, but Doug Wright (2) only lasted five minutes and England were out for 197, exceeding Australia's First Innings by only 3 runs. This was both a failure and a relief, given how the innings had progressed.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood up}} in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She {{had a right to}} happiness. Frank would take her in <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>fold</b> her in <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> He would save her.|$|R
60|$|Redwood {{stood for}} nearly a minute with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> tightly <b>folded,</b> taking this in. Then his indignation found a voice.|$|R

60|$|Maurice {{straightened}} {{himself to}} attend, but kept <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded.</b>|$|E

60|$|Stanley at last {{took the}} chair {{he had so}} long refused. He sat with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded.</b>|$|E
60|$|When I reappeared I {{went out}} on deck with Euphemia. The boarder was there, {{standing}} by the petunia bed. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> were <b>folded</b> and he was thinking profoundly. As we approached, he turned toward us.|$|R
60|$|They {{was so busy}} talking that I crept {{along by}} the side of the wall and got to the office without their seeing me. I went into the private office and turned out the gas there, and sat down to wait for 'im. Then I 'eard a noise outside that took me to the door agin and kept me there, 'olding on to the door-post and gasping for my breath. The cook of the Saltram was sitting on a paraffin-cask playing the mouth-orgin, and the actor, with <b>'is</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> across <b>his</b> stummick, was dancing a horn-pipe as if he'd gorn mad.|$|R
60|$|He put out <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and <b>folded</b> {{her to his}} breast. And for a {{while she}} lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils. His mouth was set as steel.|$|R
60|$|The Senhor Antonio stood {{close behind}} the Irishman, with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> and a sarcastic {{smile on his}} countenance.|$|E
60|$|He broke off. Nostromo, {{leaning back}} against the table, <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> on his breast, nodded at him slightly.|$|E
60|$|But Beniah stood speechless, {{a strange}} {{expression}} on his face, his lips firmly compressed and <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> across his breast.|$|E
60|$|He {{had thought}} from the tread {{there were two}} with her. He {{answered}} 'Yes,' and she came in with Mr Meagles. Sun-browned and jolly Mr Meagles looked, and he opened <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and <b>folded</b> Arthur in them, like a sun-browned and jolly father.|$|R
60|$|Nan was {{polishing}} the tumblers at {{the pantry}} window, outside of which John Osborne was leaning among the vines. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> were <b>folded</b> {{on the sill}} and his straw hat was pushed back from his flushed, eager face as he watched Nan's deft movements.|$|R
60|$|A bony form strode {{along the}} {{curbstone}} {{from the river}} staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> a <b>folded</b> dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.|$|R
60|$|They meditated, Kipps with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> {{and pulling}} at his scanty moustache. Presently {{a faint smile}} came over his face.|$|E
60|$|George {{stood with}} his head drawn back, <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> tightly over his broad breast, and a bitter smile curling his lips.|$|E
60|$|Rigaud {{pushed his}} chair a little back; pushed his legs out {{straight}} before him; {{and sat with}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> over against her.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the lots}} were all drawn, and one man, {{apparently}} a young pirate, stepped out from among his fellows. His head was bowed, and <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> were <b>folded</b> across <b>his</b> manly chest. The captain spoke a few words, {{and the young}} pirate advanced alone {{to the side of}} the deep hole.|$|R
6000|$|The camp laborers gave {{themselves}} up for lost. The savants were sorely perplexed. Here was a marvel hard to account for. They thought and they talked, they talked and they thought. Finally the learned and aged Lord Grand-Daddy-Longlegs, {{who had been}} sitting in deep study, with his slender limbs crossed and <b>his</b> stemmy <b>arms</b> <b>folded,</b> said: ...|$|R
60|$|Erlito's {{eyes were}} full of sympathy. His head sank upon <b>his</b> <b>folded</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>His</b> {{thoughts}} travelled backwards. It was so many years ago, yet he could remember.|$|R
60|$|The old war-horse {{gathered}} {{himself up}} slowly and painfully, and with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> and his jaw protruding, he limped toward the umpire.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> her gently and with sympathy, and she {{acknowledged}} it with a happy movement and a brightening face.|$|E
60|$|We {{shall not}} pursue a lover's day-dream any farther. Mannering stood {{a minute with}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded,</b> {{and then turned to}} the ruined castle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep to your prayers, {{and let me}} go my own way, it's the shortest," [...] muttered Harry, {{with his}} face hidden, and his head down on <b>his</b> <b>folded</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, come hither," [...] resumed Spike, seating {{himself at}} his ease on the trunk, while Jack stood near by, <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> still <b>folded,</b> and <b>his</b> rotund little form as immovable, under the plunges that the lively brig made into the head-seas {{that she was}} obliged to meet, as if a timber-head in the vessel itself. [...] "You keep your sea-legs well, Jack, short as they are." ...|$|R
60|$|He rose, {{and finding}} {{his way to}} the refreshment-room, drank off a glass of champagne. Then he walked back to the main salon. Standing {{with his back to the}} wall, and half-hidden by a tall palm tree, was Densham. He was alone. <b>His</b> <b>arms</b> were <b>folded,</b> and he was looking out upon the dancers with a gloomy frown. Harcutt stepped softly up to him.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{peering through}} the tangle of brambles, she spied old Mr. Rabbit sitting on his broken-down {{doorstep}} with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> and fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|He was {{kneeling}} down {{and holding the}} end in his hand. Flannigan stood behind with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>folded,</b> and an air of grim resolution upon his face.|$|E

60|$|There was a minute's pause as Fan {{returned}} to her practising, and Tom relapsed into the reverie he was enjoying seated astride of a chair, with his chin on <b>his</b> <b>folded</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} leaned his head upon <b>his</b> <b>folded</b> <b>arms</b> and nothing stirred in the room, {{but the wind}} that stole in through the roses to fan the placid face upon the pillow.|$|R
