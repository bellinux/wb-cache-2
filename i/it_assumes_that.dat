5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E
5|$|Separate {{from the}} main campaigns, the player can raise Chao as virtual pets. They have five {{attributes}} (Swim, Fly, Run, Power and Stamina) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark. From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic. Playing with Chao increases affection, and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> form permanently. Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.|$|E
25|$|Non-relativistic {{classical}} mechanics treats time as {{a universal}} quantity of measurement which is uniform throughout space and which is separate from space.

25|$|Non-tomographic {{variants}} on this method, {{referred to}} as single particle analysis, use images of multiple (hopefully) identical objects at different orientations to produce the image data required for three-dimensional reconstruction.

25|$|The main {{advantage}} of the flux balance approach {{is that it does}} not require any knowledge of the metabolite concentrations, or more importantly, the enzyme kinetics of the system; the homeostasis assumption precludes the need for knowledge of metabolite concentrations at any time as long as that quantity remains constant, and additionally it removes the need for specific rate laws since <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> at steady state, there is no change in the size of the metabolite pool in the system. The stoichiometric coefficients alone are sufficient for the mathematical maximization of a specific objective function.|$|E
25|$|The {{materials}} balance method for an oil field uses an equation that relates {{the volume of}} oil, water and gas that has been produced from a reservoir and the change in reservoir pressure to calculate the remaining oil. <b>It</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that,</b> as fluids from the reservoir are produced, {{there will be a}} change in the reservoir pressure that depends on the remaining volume of oil and gas. The method requires extensive pressure-volume-temperature analysis and an accurate pressure history of the field. It requires some production to occur (typically 5% to 10% of ultimate recovery), unless reliable pressure history can be used from a field with similar rock and fluid characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The results {{uncovered}} by this study at least suggest some {{issues with the}} classic mirror test; primarily, that <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot {{did not lead to}} them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{field of}} behavioral neuroscience focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior. For example, physiological psychologists use animal models, typically rats, {{to study the}} neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses. Cognitive neuroscientists investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease. The biopsychosocial model is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. <b>It</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> any given behavior or mental process affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.|$|E
25|$|The Gross–Pitaevskii {{model of}} BEC is a {{physical}} approximation valid for certain classes of BECs. By construction, the GPE uses the following simplifications: <b>it</b> <b>assumes</b> <b>that</b> interactions between condensate particles are of the contact two-body type and also neglects anomalous contributions to self-energy. These assumptions are suitable mostly for the dilute three-dimensional condensates. If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for the condensate wavefunction acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms {{turns out to be}} infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial. The examples where this could happen are the Bose–Fermi composite condensates, effectively lower-dimensional condensates, and dense condensates and superfluid clusters and droplets.|$|E
