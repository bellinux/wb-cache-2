5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, non-reactive polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary <b>glues</b> and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from <b>glues</b> and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and <b>glues</b> them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E

Fugitive <b>glue</b> contains a high amount of alcohol and is delivered to the substrate at a <b>glue</b> station when wet. The type of bond it produces is temporary in nature and is intended to hold two pieces of material together through the duration of folding and <b>gluing</b> operations. It will eventually evaporate without causing damage to either one of the separated substrate.|$|R
5|$|Dielectric barrier {{discharge}} (DBD): {{this is a}} non-thermal discharge {{generated by}} the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics. The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, <b>glues</b> and similar materials to adhere. The dielectric barrier discharge {{was used in the}} mid-1990s to show that low temperature atmospheric pressure plasma is effective in inactivating bacterial cells. This work and later experiments using mammalian cells led to the establishment of a new field of research known as plasma medicine. The dielectric barrier discharge configuration was also used in the design of low temperature plasma jets. These plasma jets are produced by fast propagating guided ionization waves known as plasma bullets.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest <b>glues</b> and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E

50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the <b>glue's</b> open time does not allow the joint to be <b>glued</b> normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} to <b>glue</b> and clamp a top to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a bead of <b>glue</b> along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The top is then clamped to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the <b>glue.</b> When the <b>glue</b> is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the <b>glue</b> cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used to <b>glue</b> veneers to a substrate. The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide <b>glue.</b> Once the <b>glue</b> is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying <b>glue.</b> When the iron is removed, the <b>glue</b> cools, bonding the veneer to the substrate.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Glue</b> {{is highly}} {{effective}} for joining timber when both {{surfaces of the}} joint are edge grain. A properly <b>glued</b> joint may be as strong or stronger than {{a single piece of}} wood. However, <b>glue</b> is notably less effective on end-grain surfaces.

5000|$|Animal <b>glue,</b> {{especially}} hide <b>glue,</b> was {{the primary}} adhesive of choice for a great many types of woodworking, including furniture and lutherie, for many centuries. It is manufactured from rendered collagen from the skins (hides) of animals. It is chemically similar to edible gelatin and is non-toxic if ingested. Hide <b>glue</b> is still used today in specialized applications: musical instruments (lutherie), for replica furniture, and for conservation-grade repairs to antique woodwork. Hide <b>glue</b> is measured {{on the basis of}} its gel strength, a measure of how many grams of force it requires to depress a 1/2 in plunger 4 mm into a 12.5% protein solution of the <b>glue</b> at 10 C. <b>Glue</b> is manufactured in standard grades from 32 - 512 g. 192 g strength is the most commonly used for woodworking; 251 g is the highest normally used for instrument building; 135 g is the lowest used for general woodwork. <b>Glue</b> above 250 g strength requires excessive dilution and so leaves too little <b>glue</b> in joints for effective adhesion, so it is not commonly used. Liquid versions of hide <b>glue</b> are now available; typically they have urea added to keep the <b>glue</b> liquid at room temperature and to extend drying time. Examples of liquid hide <b>glue</b> are Old Brown <b>Glue</b> or Titebond Liquid Hide. Hide <b>glue</b> does not creep. Hide <b>glue</b> joints are easy to repair, by just heating and adding more hide <b>glue.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study <b>glue</b> {{operators}} used in component-based frameworks {{to obtain}} systems as {{the composition of}} atomic components described as labeled transition systems (LTS). <b>Glue</b> operators map tuples of LTS into LTS. They restrict the behavior of their arguments by performing memoryless coordination. In a previous paper, we have proposed a simple format for SOS rules that captures, in particular, <b>glue</b> operators from known frameworks such as CCS, SCCS, CSP, and BIP. This paper studies a new way for characterizing <b>glue</b> operators: as boolean <b>glue</b> constraints between interactions (sets of ports) {{and the state of}} the coordinated components. We provide an SOS format for <b>glue,</b> which allows a natural correspondence between <b>glue</b> operators and <b>glue</b> constraints. This correspondence is used for automated synthesis of <b>glue</b> operators implementing given <b>glue</b> constraints. By focusing on the properties that do not bear computation, we reduce a very hard (and, in general, undecidable) problem of synthesizing controllers to a tractable one. The examples in the paper show that such properties are natural and can be expressed as <b>glue</b> constraints in a straightforward manner. Finally, we compare expressiveness of the proposed formalisms with the <b>glue</b> used in the BIP framework and discuss possible applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Iatrogenic preterm prelabor rupture of {{membranes}} (iPPROM) {{remains the}} main complication after invasive interventions into the intrauterine cavity. Here, the proteolytic stability of mussel-mimetic tissue adhesive (mussel <b>glue)</b> and its sealing behavior on punctured fetal membranes are evaluated. The proteolytic degradation of mussel <b>glue</b> and fibrin <b>glue</b> were compared in vitro. Critical pressures of punctured and sealed fetal membranes were determined under close to physiological conditions using a custom-made inflation device. An inverse finite element procedure {{was applied to}} estimate mechanical parameters of mussel <b>glue.</b> Mussel <b>glue</b> was insensitive whereas fibrin <b>glue</b> was sensitive towards proteolytic degradation. Mussel <b>glue</b> sealed 3. 7 mm fetal membrane defect up to 60 mbar (45 mmHg) when applied under wet conditions, whereas fibrin <b>glue</b> needed dry membrane surfaces for reliable sealing. The mussel <b>glue</b> can be represented by a neo-Hookean material model with elastic coefficient C(1) = 9. 63 kPa. Ex-vivo-tested mussel <b>glue</b> sealed fetal membranes and resisted pressures achieved during uterine contractions. Together with good stability in proteolytic environments, this makes mussel <b>glue</b> a promising sealing material for future applications...|$|R
50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the <b>glue</b> begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may <b>glue</b> the center seams of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot hide <b>glue,</b> and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide <b>glue</b> starts to gel, {{at which point the}} <b>glue</b> becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the hide <b>glue</b> pulls the joint together as it hardens.|$|R
