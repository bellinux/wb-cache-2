Ten years…whew…what changes have we all seen in ten years in the reforestation industry!

These changes have continued with major private and public reorganizations and downsizing, the Forest Practices Code, Forest Renewal BC and aboriginal land claims. In the reforestation nursery industry, there has been the move to larger and new container stocktypes (i. e.
