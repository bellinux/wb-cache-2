5|$|Rewrite story {{revolves}} around the protagonist Kotarou Tennouji, a male high school student living in Kazamatsuri, and the story begins on October 3, 2010 on the Moon. Kotarou, who {{is interested in the}} mysteries of Kazamatsuri, especially the reports of unidentified mysterious animals, spends times with five girls in the occult research society at his school: Kotori Kanbe, Chihaya Ohtori, Sizuru Nakatsu, Lucia Konohana, and Akane Senri, who is also the club president. The club members spend fun, peaceful times together uncovering the supernatural mysteries of Kazamatsuri. During this time, Kotarou falls in love with each of them in separate plot lines determined by the choices the player makes. These plot lines represent various timelines in which the conflict between Gaia and Guardian occurs, although it is hinted that humanity <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> destroyed in every timeline.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces {{regional}} manager Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{that he needs}} to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.). Jim designs several Dwight-oriented challenges as tryouts for the position, and it <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> found that Dwight is the most qualified. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) is forced to bring her child, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, upon overhearing that Phillip has been eating the type of paper which he himself regards as the most flavorful, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. To test this theory, Dwight offers the child either a check for one million dollars or a beet; Phillip picks the beet. Dwight tells Angela that he will marry her if the child is his, but she denies that this is the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, asking whether he should propose to Angela or his girlfriend Esther, who he thinks is the more logical choice. Jim tells Dwight {{that he needs to}} put aside logic and follow his instincts. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son, explaining that she lied about his parentage in order to test Dwight's feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

25|$|Leopold Mozart's music <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> {{overshadowed by}} the work of his son Wolfgang, and in any case the father willingly sacrificed his own career to promote his son's. But Leopold's Cassation in G for Orchestra and Toys (Toy Symphony), once {{attributed}} to Joseph Haydn, remains popular, and a number of symphonies, a trumpet concerto, and other works also survive.|$|E

25|$|Parasitoids {{are mainly}} typical of wasps (order Hymenoptera), and some flies (order Diptera). Eggs are laid inside the larvae of other {{arthropods}} which hatch and consume the host from the inside, killing it. This unusual predator–host relationship {{is typical of}} about 10% of all insects. Many viruses that attack single-celled organisms (such as bacteriophages) are also parasitoids; they reproduce inside a single host that <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> killed by the association.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} deprotection of silyl ethers {{has been}} extensively reviewed. Although selective deprotections have been achieved under many different conditions, some procedures, outlined below, are more reliable. A selective deprotection will likely be successful {{if there is a}} substantial difference in sterics (e.g., primary TBS vs. secondary TBS or primary TES vs primary TBS) or electronics (e.g. primary TBDPS vs. primary TBS). Unfortunately, some optimization <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> required and it is often necessary to run deprotections partway and recycle material.|$|E
25|$|Van Stipriaan further {{reports that}} other tales {{describe}} river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit.

The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E

25|$|Passing a {{nasogastric}} tube (NGT) is useful both diagnostically and therapeutically. A long tube is passed {{through one of}} the nostrils, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. Water is then pumped into the stomach, creating a siphon, and excess fluid and material (reflux) is pulled off the stomach. Healthy horses will often have less than 1 liter removed from the stomach; any more than 2 litres of fluid is considered to be significant. Horses are unable to vomit or regurgitate, therefore nasogastric intubation is therapeutically important for gastric decompression. A backup of fluid in the gastrointestinal tract will cause it to build up in the stomach, a process that can eventually lead to stomach rupture, which <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> fatal.|$|E
25|$|Searches for Naultinus {{are often}} {{inconclusive}} because the animals simply avoid detection. Improved detection methods would allow scientists to monitor populations much more accurately {{and a number}} of different studies in recent years have been doing research into this area – some key ideas are a new type of cover mounted on trees for animals to hide in, pheremone lures and even terriers trained to pick up on the scent of native geckos. Naultinus have been reintroduced to some predator free areas and are present at other locations where their habitat is protected and where pest control is being carried out but because Naultinus have a very slow breeding rate, recovery of populations <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> a relatively slow and gradual process.|$|E
25|$|The Trans-Canada Highway {{was built}} some one {{kilometre}} {{to the south}} of both the CPR tracks and the old east-west highway, bypassing Qu'Appelle and significantly reducing traffic through the town. Highway 35 runs south to Weyburn unpaved and north to Fort Qu'Appelle; while no longer heavily trafficked since the opening of Highway 10 from Balgonie to the Valley, it is still paved on the northward sector, although with the drastically depleted traffic demand with reduced population both in town and on farms, largely eliminated Regina-to-Qu'Appelle Valley traffic and loss of grain elevators, gasoline and vehicle repair stations (into the 1960s there was still one gasoline station in town and one on each side of number 1 highway), retail stores, post office, bank, hospital, high school and movie theatre it <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> falling into reduced maintenance of pavement.|$|E

25|$|If herd {{immunity}} {{has been established}} and maintained in a population for a sufficient time, the disease <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> eliminated—no more endemic transmissions occurs. If elimination is achieved worldwide {{and the number of}} cases is permanently reduced to zero, then a disease can be declared eradicated. Eradication can thus be considered the final effect or end-result of public health initiatives to control the spread of infectious disease. The benefits of eradication include ending all morbidity and mortality caused by the disease, financial savings for individuals, health care providers, and governments, and enabling resources used to control the disease to be used elsewhere. To date, two diseases have been eradicated using {{herd immunity}} and vaccination: rinderpest and smallpox. Eradication efforts that rely on herd immunity are currently underway for poliomyelitis, though civil unrest and distrust of modern medicine have made this difficult. Voluntary vaccination, for a variety of reasons, may be an obstacle to eradication if not enough people become immune to a disease.|$|E
25|$|Since chance {{procedures}} {{were used by}} Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> linked to the performer's preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers {{had no knowledge of}} the instruments. In Inlets (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.|$|E
25|$|GM1 Storage Disease, one of {{a family}} of {{conditions}} called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that <b>is</b> <b>inevitably</b> fatal. It is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells. Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 Storage Disease carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed. All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 storage disease or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age. The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, paresis, and seizures. The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament. Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur. GM-1 storage disease is a recessive deficiency of betagalactosidase. The condition has been genetically identified and is no longer common.|$|E
