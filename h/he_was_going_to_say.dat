5|$|In {{his final}} days, Irwin sold his rights from his {{scoreboard}} business for $2000. Though he sent $1500 to May and only $500 to Elizabeth, his Boston widow {{was surprised at}} the gesture since Irwin rarely visited Boston and provided almost no financial support to their family. In fact, May said that he had not been away from New York {{for more than a few}} days at a time in 27 years. She said that his only long trips were baseball-related, when he would scout players in other cities. Before he left New York for the final time, he told May that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to friends in Boston and that he would return to New York. Though neither woman knew of the other, Irwin's New York son Harold learned about an unknown brother while he was visiting his father in the hospital just before Irwin's death.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting [...] "exactly like an officer of the British army" [...] in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> at the announcement the following day.|$|E
2500|$|Rogell's fiery {{demeanor}} was a {{stark contrast}} to the calm, quiet demeanor of Gehringer. [...] On one occasion, after both failed to cover second on a steal attempt, player-manager Mickey Cochrane charged out from behind the plate shouting at Rogell and Gehringer. [...] As reported in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract: [...] "Rogell, astonished, looked at Gehringer to see if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything. [...] Gehringer, of course, had nothing to say. 'Goddamn you,' yelled Rogell. [...] 'Don't you come charging out here telling me how to play shortstop. [...] You go back there and do the catching, and I'll play shortstop. [...] If I'm not good enough, you can find someone else.' [...] Cochrane went back to his own position." ...|$|E

6000|$|ALL the {{way home}} from Maine, Babbitt <b>was</b> certain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a changed man. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} <b>to</b> serenity. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cease worrying about business. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have more [...] "interests"--theaters, public affairs, reading.

2500|$|After he was {{reported}} in the press as saying homosexuals should [...] "repent and be changed", he made further comments in which he clarified his remarks. He stated that he had initially said to the journalist from the Telegraph that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in his sermon that all people, particularly churches and Christians, should repent, because there was a need [...] "to refocus on the faith of the church from down the ages and an authentic mission to the nations." [...] When asked specifically about whether this included homosexuals, he had said that yes, it included everybody and went on to give his interpretation of the Christian view of human sexuality, marriage and the family, saying that we were all sinners and in continual need of repentance for our shortcomings.|$|E
