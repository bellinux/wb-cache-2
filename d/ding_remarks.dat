It generalizes to the nonlinear case the results obtained in [11] for a linear switched system associated with a finite family of pairwise commuting Hurwitz matrices. It also extends the results obtained [13] for a switching system com-posed of a finite family of exponentially stable subsystems whose flows commute, and shows {{that in order to}} assure global stability, the global Lipschitz condition of the fields is superfluous. III. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have presented a sufficient condition for the global uniform asymptotic stability of an equilibrium of a switched system. We have shown that when the switched system is composed of a fi-nite family of subsystems, the global asymptotic stability of each sub-system and the pairwise commutativity of their flows are sufficient for the global asymptotic stability of the switched system. We have also shown, by combining this result with the converse Lyapunov theorem obtained in [9], that these conditions are also sufficient for the existence of a common Lyapunov function. The results here presented generalize those obtained in [11] for linear systems and those local ones obtained in [13] for exponentially stable systems...|$|R

40|$|In Hippocratic medicine, the {{physician}} {{is working for}} the good of the individual patient, and the voluntary nature of the patient-physician relationship is axiomatic. The New Ethics, however, is attempting to replace the Hippocratic model with a public health model. The emphasis is on prevention and on optimizing“population health,”not individual outcomes. A “right to healthcare ” is proclaimed, and few notice that the right to refuse healthcare is being overridden by a duty to accept it in the name of public health. An expert committee replaces the individual patient as the decisionmaker. Mandatory vaccination is the leading edge of the new ethic. The policy to require annual influenza vaccination as a condition of working in a medical facility illustrates the dogmatism of the public health model and how it trumps individual autonomy, the Hippocratic ethic, and also evidence-based medicine. At the 69 annual meeting of AAPS, past president Lee Hieb, M. <b>D.,</b> <b>remarked</b> that mandatory influenza vaccination violates the Nuremberg Code. This Code applies to human experimentation, and provides,, that: 1. The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved, as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that, before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject, there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person, which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity…. 3.

For example, the triplets (abe, ade, bdf, cef) form a tactical configuration having the symmetrical property that every letter occurs twice and every pair of sets has also only one letter in common.

50|$|All this, however, is {{no reason}} for attacking the {{above-mentioned}} assumption that the Sifra in its principal parts is a midrash of R. Judah's. <b>D.</b> Hoffmann <b>remarks</b> (l.c. p. 26) not incorrectly that Sifra, Nedabah, iv. 12 agrees with the views of R. Eliezer (Menahot 26a), whose decision R. Judah frequently accepts as handed down by his own father, R. Ila'i, a pupil of R. Eliezer (comp. Menahot 18a and Yoma 39a et passim). Similarly, Sifra, Emor, xvii. 4 et seq. agrees with R. Eliezer's view (Suk. 43a). Aside from R. Judah's midrash, R. Ḥiyya may have used also R. Simeon's midrash (comp. Hoffmann, l.c. p. 27), although some of the passages mentioned there (as, e.g., the comparison of Sifra, Nedabah, vi. 9 with Sifre, Deut. 78; Sifra, Nega'im, i. 9-10 with Sifre, Deut. 218; Sifra, Beḥuḳḳotai, viii. 2 with Sifre, Deut. 124) seem to prove little. More doubtful is the relation to R. Ishmael's midrash; and in this connection must be considered the question whether the citation of certain explanations of Leviticus introduced by the formula תנא דבי ר"י and actually found in Sifra is not in part due to confusion (comp. Hoffmann, l.c.; Levy, l.c. p. 28, note 2, and the interesting remark from Azulai quoted there).|$|R

The leaf, whose present location is unknown, belonged {{at that time to}} the collection of Ernst Fischer at Weinheim. Fischer dated its script, an Anglo-Saxon minuscule, to about AD 800, which, as Brandt observed, would mean that it antedated the earliest known manuscripts of the text, which are ninth-century. Although E. A. Lowe indicated in his Codices Latini Antiquiores that the fragment was lost, it has continued to attract scholarly attention. Professor Bernhard Bischoff suggested that the fragment could be identified with a copy of Justinus listed among the books of Gerward, palace librarian of Louis the Pious. This implied connection with the Carolingian court, taken together with Alcuin's naming of Justinus's work among the books described in the poem on York and his later association with the Carolingian court, has raised the possibility of an English origin for the Weinheim manuscript and therefore also for the earliest known branch of the text.

First, this is a revenue-neutral tax experiment in that changes in ϕ are accompanied by the necessary changes in parameter ξ, so that total tax revenues represent a constant fraction, γ, of aggregate output [see Eq.

Note, however, that the latter extreme case implies that marginal tax rates equal 1, so that the first order necessary condition in Eq. (10) admits no defined solution. And, third, as already mentioned in Sect. 2.2, the AK feature of the aggregate technology prevents the existence of transitional dynamic effects. Results follow in this order: individual, aggregate, and welfare effects.|$|R
40|$|In {{matters of}} {{economic}} policy, {{the institutions of}} the European Union exercise uncoordinated functions of observer, policeman and pilot. Under normal circumstances the EU institutions act as observer of the economic policies of the Member States. This “soft law” approach contrasts sharply with their role to act as “policemen” and as a pilot, when excessive debts arise in the Member States. The contrast is illustrated by the "friendly advice", given to Greece in 2009 and the peremptory command addressed to this country in 2010 / 2011. A stable legal framework would require the elimination - or at least, attenuation - of the mismatch between the feeble powers to shape policy and the robustness of the powers to intervene in case of excessive public deficit and to impose policy sanctions. EU action needs to be targeted at an earlier stage in the process, so that ex post facto intervention with sanctions can be avoided. Furthermore, the present rules on EMU place at risk the legitimacy of both the EU and Member States. Neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament are involved in the shaping of and the decision on Recommendations for economic policy. In the longer term, there is no alternative: the EU will have to be granted powers to take binding decisions in the area of economic policy, and, in parallel, to reconfigure the decision-making system so that economic and social policy measures have democratic legitimacy.

Dr. George Irumbayam is of {{the view that the}} romantic elements in the novel are intertwined with the realistic legibility of historical elements. The honest behavior of Mangoikkal Kuruppu to the prince, the anxious preparations of Karthyayani Amma to receive Padmanabhan Thambi, short-tempered reactions of Shanku Assan represent realistic aspects in the novel. N. Balakrishnan Nair states that the novel is a love story built around a serious period in the history of Travancore. The romance of Ananthapadmanabhan and Parukutty is presented as a supporting aspect to heroism in the novel, according to Dr. Poojapura Krishnan Nair. Ayyappa Paniker states that the romance between Ananthapadmanabhan and Parukutty gives a soul and emotional angle to the historical and political themes of the novel. According to Dr. George Irumbayam, the historical plot about power struggle between Marthanda Varma and rebels is presented as rich and active through the love story of Ananthapadmanbhan and Parukutty. The emotional factor of the novel is further emphasized with another plot of romance involving Ananthapadmanabhan with the unrequited love of Zulaikha, there by making the love story to be a triangular one. The story of Subhadra is also considered as a tragic love story, which strengthens the romantic {{aspects of the}} novel. The love failures of Subhadra and Zulaikha aid in creating a favorable surrounding for the romantic aspects of the novel. Dr. <b>D.</b> Benjamin <b>remarks</b> that the very first instance of romantic love is in this novel. The longing of Parukutty for the return of her lover, Zulaikha's love failure are seen as reminiscences of romantic love, and latter is considered as foremost romantic heroine of Malayalam literature in romanticism. The romantic aspects similar to that in Prometheus Unbound and in the apocalyptic poetry of William Blake are identified in the personality of Subhadra, with which the character coveys a conflict-oriented complexity of multi-colored romanticism.|$|R

In [7], we showed that D has the 2 -generator property- that is, each finitely generated ideal of D can be generated by two elements. Theorem 5. 6 of [7] shows that a positive integer n can, in fact, be chosen as one of two generators for each finitely generated ideal of D containing n. This property of being able to choose any nonzero element of a finitely generated ideal I of a Pnifer domain as one of two generators for I, for every I, has been considered in [6], [8] and [11], and it is natural to ask whether D satisfies the condition. We show in Section 1 that the answer is negative. First we introduce some terminology. Let I be a finitely generated ideal of the semisimpie commutative unitary ring R. We say that I is strongly 2 -generated if for each a • I 0), there exists b • I such that I = (a,b), and R is said to have the strong 2 -generator property if each finitely generated ideal of R is strongly 2 generated. Finally, an element r G R is a strong 2 -generator if r is one of two generators for each finitely generated ideal of R containing r; clearly this is equivalent to the condition that R/rR is a Bezout ring. Thus Theorem 5. 6 of [7] could be restated to say that each n C Z 0) is a strong 2 -generator in <b>D.</b> We <b>remark</b> that under the hypothesis that R is semisimpie, the notion of being strongly 2 -generated for I is the same as what Heitmann and Levy in [8] refer to as the 1 1 / 2 -generator property for I. There are two sections of the paper. For a square-free integer d, results of Section 1 imply that X 2 - d is not a strong 2 -generator in D if the class group of Q(x/d) is no...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method to compute the holonomic {{extension}} of a D-module from a Zariski open set in affine space to the whole space. A particular application is the localization of coherent D-modules which are holonomic on the complement of an affine variety. Throughout this article let R = K[x 1, [...] .,xn] be the ring of polynomials in n variables over the field K of characteristic zero and D = R〈∂ 1, [...] .,∂n〉 the n-th Weyl algebra over K. Here, ∂i = ∂. Suppose f ∈ R, let J be a ∂xi left ideal of D and set M = D/J. Let X = Kn, Y = V(f) ⊆ X, U = X Y and j: U ֒ → X the natural inclusion. In the landmark paper [K 2] M. Kashiwara proved that ∫ j j− 1 M is holonomic provided that M is holonomic on U, but not necessarily on all of X. In this note we make this important result algorithmic {{in the sense that}} we provide an algorithm that computes the module structure of ∫ j j− 1 M over <b>D.</b> We <b>remark</b> that U is affine and X = K n, and so ∫ j j− 1 M = Rf ⊗R M as D-module. An algorithm to compute Rf ⊗RM as a D-module has been given in [Oa 3] under the assumption that M is holonomic on K n and f-torsion free, and in [O-T 2] under the assumption that M is holonomic on K n. The advantage of our new algorithm, besides removing the requirement of holonomicity on V(f), is that the natural map M → Rf ⊗RM can be traced, which is an important property for other computations as local cohomology ([Oa 3], [W 1]) and de Rham cohomology ([O-T 1], [W 2]). 1. Description of the Algorithm We shall start with a motivating construction which will also provide a skeleton of the proof of the correctness of our algorithm. Assume that K is in fact the field C of complex numbers. Let s,v be two new variables and let Dv = D〈v,∂v〉. Notation 1. Throughout we will denote ∂f/∂xi by fi. If P ∈ Dv is an operator interpreted as a polynomial in ∂ 1, [...] .,∂n, we will simply write P(∂x). Similarly we will abbreviate P(∂ 1 − v 2 f 1 ∂v, [...] .,∂n − v 2 fn∂v) by P(∂x − v 2 fx∂v). Consider the ring Dv and the C-vectorspace Rf[s]⊗f −s. Here, f −s should be thought of as a symbol that behaves like the complex valued function f −...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{classical}} theorems of Grodal [Grodal, B., 1972. A second remark on the core of an atomless economy. Econometrica 40, 581 - 583] and Schmeidler [Schmeidler, <b>D.,</b> 1972. A <b>remark</b> on the core of an atomless economy. Econometrica 40, 579 - 580] on the veto power of small coalitions in finite dimensional, atomless economies can be extended (with some minor modifications) to include the case of countably many commodities. This paper presents a further extension of these results to include the case of uncountably many commodities. We also extend Vind's [Vind, K., 1972. A third remark on the core of an atomless economy. Econometrica 40, 585 - 586] classical theorem on the veto power of big coalitions in finite dimensional, atomless economies to include {{the case of an}} arbitrary number of commodities. In another result, we show that in the coalitional economy defined by an atomless individualistic model, core-Walras equivalence holds even if the commodity space is non-separable. The above-mentioned results are also valid for a differential information economy with a finite state space. We also extend Kannai's [Kannai, Y., 1970. Continuity properties of the core of a market. Econometrica 38, 791 - 815] theorem on the continuity of the core of a finite dimensional, large economy to include the case of an arbitrary number of commodities. All of our results are applications of a lemma, that we prove here, about the set of aggregate alternatives available to a coalition. Throughout the paper, the commodity space is assumed to be an ordered Banach space which has an interior point in its positive cone. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
