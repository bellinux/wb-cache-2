25|$|A {{factoring}} {{system was}} created for para-alpine skiing to allow the grouping of classifications into three general groups: sitting, standing and visually impaired. One medal event can then be held for each group {{even though there is}} a wide range of functional mobility and medical differences. The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels, where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number. The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used. This means the faster skier <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>hill</b> may not be the winner of an event.|$|E
