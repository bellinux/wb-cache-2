At the <b>end</b> <b>edge</b> of the tooth crown, inner and outer enamel epithelia form Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath (HERS). HERS extends along with dental follicular tissue for root formation. Ameloblastin (AMBN) is an enamel matrix protein secreted by ameloblasts and HERS derived cells. A number of enamel proteins are eliminated in root formation, except for AMBN. AMBN may be related to tooth root formation; however, its role in this process remains unclear. In this study, we found AMBN in the basal portion of HERS of lower first molar in mice, but not at the tip. We designed and synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting AMBN based on the mouse sequence. When AMBN siRNA was injected into a prospective mandibular first molar of postnatal day 10 mice, the root became shorter 10 days later. Furthermore, HERS in these mice revealed a multilayered appearance and 5 -bromo- 29 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) positive cells increased in the outer layers. In vitro experiments, when cells were compared with and without transiently expressing AMBN mRNA, expression of growth suppressor genes such as p 21 Cip 1 and p 27 Kip 1 was enhanced without AMBN and BrdU incorporation increased.

We also show that internal implicit nodes are separated from each other by explicit suffix tree nodes and that all external implicit nodes {{are related to the}} same periodicity. These new properties may be used {{to keep track of the}} waves of implicit node updates and to build the suffix tree on-line in amortized linear time, providing access to all the implicit nodes in worst-case constant time...|$|R

A linear forest is a graph whose connected components are chordless paths. A linear partition of a graph G is a partition of its edge set into linear forests and la(G) is the minimum number of linear forests in a linear partition.

Alternatively, they may remain unexpressed altogether, being introduced into the conceptual structure of a phrase by “rules of construal”. This shows that lexical semantics and phrasal semantics interpenetrate deeply, and that there is no strict one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and semantic structures. In addition, the analysis provides further evidence that natural language semantics must be based on a psychological view of meaning- it must be concerned with how language users are constructed to understand and schematize the world...|$|E

30|$|Several {{aspects of}} Think 3 d! provide {{embodied}} links to spatial thinking, both generally and in mathematics. For spatial thinking, generally, students physically transform the 2 D paper into a 3 D object {{and back to}} paper by both folding and unfolding. This embodies the classic Mental Paper Folding task (Shepard & Feng, 1972). As they construct the object, they rotate intermediate forms of it, similar to Mental Rotation (Shepard & Metzler, 1971) or Purdue Rotations tests (Guay, 1976). In other words, the actions result in internal-dynamic, 2 D-to- 3 D transformations seen in STEM contexts (Newcombe & Shipley, 2015). For spatial thinking within mathematics, children fold paper into fractional parts (e.g. in half) of the whole paper, pairing actions with fraction concepts that are further reinforced in diagrams. Their folds make different geometric shapes. They translate a diagram’s spatial instructions into actions and vice versa. Pop-up paper engineering actions differ when an object is symmetrical versus asymmetrical. In other words, the activities provide direct experience with mathematics concepts (Ionescu & Vasc, 2014). Supporting this, research shows that when talking about origami folding, people use spatial terms applicable to math (Taylor & Tenbrink, 2013; Tenbrink & Taylor, 2015). These include, {{but are not limited}} to spatial nouns such as angle, baselines, corner, crease, direction, <b>end,</b> <b>edge,</b> line, position, shape, side, symmetry, three dimensions, and way and spatial verbs such as bisect and intersect and other spatial terms that include center, close, diagonal, down, even, halfway, in half, into, open, opposed, outside, over, overlap, straight, symmetrical, three-dimensional, and vertical. For elementary-aged children, these activities are completed in a real-world context, as origami and paper engineering easily comprise regularly occurring activities for this age group.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} was testing of dowel-type connections using slotted-in steel plates in laminated bamboo loaded parallel-to-grain. Since laminated bamboo is a relatively new material, a proper design standard and design formulas have not yet been established. Strength testing of this material is currently being done by a number of research institutes. Those researches have already resulted in a range of properties and strength parameters. To analyse the possibility of calculating laminated bamboo connections with these already obtained strength parameters using timber design principles, this research focussed on strength testing of a variety of connections and comparing the obtained test results to expected capacities calculated from such timber design formulas. To calculate the expected capacity, design formulas from EC 5 were used. From EC 5 also the spacing requirements (<b>end,</b> <b>edge</b> and dowel spacing distances) were adopted into the test piece design. Several connection variants were designed and tested. These variants all made use of one dowel of a constant steel grade and dowel diameter. The connection variants were designed such that results were obtained in every failure mode. This thus included testing of three variants of one slotted-in plate (modes 1, 2 and 3) and six variants with two slotted-in steel plates. Of these six variants three displayed failure mode 1 in the middle member and three displayed mode 3 in the middle member (and 1, 2, and 3 in the outer members). This variety in test specimens made it possible to not only compare the measured capacities to design codes but also to compare the capacity and behaviour of connections with multiple slotted-in plates to that of connections with only one slotted-in plate. To make the best use of the available material and have as little wasted bamboo as possible, the test specimens were equipped with equal connections at both ends. So that when loaded, actually two results could be obtained. One of these results was the capacity of the connection that failed. The other result was the knowledge that the other connection was, at least, stronger than the measured capacity. The use of such symmetrically loaded specimens however also causes the average of all measured capacities to be somewhat lower than normal, since half of the fabricated connections were stronger and are still intact. To overcome this, a method was devised which was adopted into the result analysis and by which the measured capacities were adjusted so that a representative value for all connections was obtained. From the comparison of the adjusted test results and design codes then was concluded that all of the tested variants had a capacity that was well above the EC 5 value. This confirmed that the design of connections in laminated bamboo can safely be done using the design principles of EC 5 for timber. Although further research is necessary to determine the necessary minimum end and edge distances for laminated bamboo. The benefits of using multiple slotted-in plates were investigated in three ways. Final recommendations are to investigate a possible effective number of slotted-in steel plates by also testing connection variants using three slotted-in plates. Of course in this further research extensions can be made by testing multiple dowels or dowel diameters, different materials or even more specimens to reduce the natural variation in test results to get a more accurate number of effective slotted-in plates.
