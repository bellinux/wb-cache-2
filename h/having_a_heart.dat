It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack in 1955.|$|E

500|$|Morris had {{considered}} filming the Australian scenes in South Africa {{due to the}} comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor. While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey. During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley {{thought that he was}} <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack, which was in reality indigestion from chips and lager. Beesley considered it [...] "the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film". The water park scenes were filmed at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, which Thomas described as [...] "some quite challenging scenes".|$|E

Quagmire's taught self-control through operant conditioning by Peter and his friends, and is eventually allowed out in public. Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that a lady in a fitting room is <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life.
