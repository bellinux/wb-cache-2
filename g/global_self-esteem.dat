The campaign aimed to bring attention to the issue of the media waif and skeletal supermodels, associated eating disorders and extreme diets. Roddick argued that fashion stereotypes did nothing for a woman’s self-esteem and, in the long term, are seriously damaging for society. “Once upon a time we cut a suit to fit a body, now we cut bodies to fit suits”.

40|$|Previous studies {{revealed}} that low self-esteem is prospectively associated with depression. However, self-esteem {{has been shown}} to change over time. We thus hypothesized that not only level but also change in self-esteem affect depression. Using data from a 23 -year longitudinal study (N = 1, 527), we therefore examined the prospective effects of <b>global</b> and domain-specific <b>self-esteem</b> (physical attractiveness, academic competence) level and change on depressive symptoms 2 decades later. Self-esteem was assessed annually from age 12 to 16, and depression was assessed at age 16 and 35. Results from latent growth curve analyses demonstrated that both level and change in self-esteem served as predictors for adult depression. Individuals who entered adolescence with low self-esteem, and/or whose self-esteem declined further during the adolescent years, were more likely to exhibit symptoms of depression 2 decades later as adults; this pattern held both for <b>global</b> and domain-specific <b>self-esteem.</b> These findings highlight the importance of adolescent self-esteem development for mental health outcomes in adulthood...|$|R
50|$|Feminine beauty ideals {{have shown}} {{correlations}} to many psychological disorders, including lowered self-esteem and eating disorders. Western cultural standards {{of beauty and}} attractiveness promote unhealthy and unattainable body ideals that motivate women to seek perfection. Since 1972, {{there has been a}} dramatic increase in the percentage of women in the United States who experience dissatisfaction with their bodies. Research indicates that women's exposure to television, even for a very short time, can experience decreased mood and self-esteem. It has been consistently found that perceived appearance is the single strongest predictor of <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> among young adults. Awareness of the ideal female shape is linked to increasingly negative self-esteem. Through peer interaction and an environment of continual comparison to those portrayed in the media, women are often made to feel inadequate, and thus their self-esteem can decrease from their negative self-image. A negative body image can result in adverse psychosocial consequences, including depression, poor self-esteem, and diminished quality of life.|$|E
50|$|One {{aspect of}} the adolescence-adulthood {{transition}} that Donnellan has primarily focused on is self-esteem. He researched {{the pros and cons}} of high and low <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> which reflects a person’s overall evaluation of personal value and adequacy in relation to their ideal perception of who they are as a person. Individuals with high self-esteem benefit from having well-rounded coping mechanisms and display behaviors that facilitate productive achievement, such as occupational success and academic achievement. They are typically able to avoid mental and physical health problems, substance abuse and antisocial behavior. They are also more likely to have healthy social relationships, persevere during difficult situations, have a positive sense of personal well-being, and receive positive opinions by peers. On the other side of the spectrum, individuals with low self-esteem suffer from poorer mental and physical health, including depressive symptoms and health problems; experience worse economic prospects, occasionally illustrate antisocial behavior and tend to exhibit higher levels of criminal behavior during adolescence.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{well-known}} {{measures of}} self-esteem instabiity.The Harter Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (PSPCSA) {{can just be}} used for children aged 4 to 7. The PSPCSA is focused on four scales: cognitive competence, physical competence, peer acceptance, and maternal acceptance. Every scale contains 6 items and each item contains two pictures of a certain action or activities (for example, a child doing a puzzle or playing with other children). A pictorial format engages a young child's interest, is understandable, sustains the child's attention, and leads to more meaningful responses. For each item the tested child is read a brief statement about each child depicted in the pictures. The first task is to indicate {{which of the two}} children it is most like. The second task is to indicate how much it is like the child on the chosen picture, a lot (represented as a big circle) or a little (represented as a small circle). When conducting this test longitudinally (for example five days in a row) the stability of self-esteem can be measured, the higher the standard-deviation, the more unstable the self-esteem is.The second measurement is the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSES). This is a 10-item Likert-type scale designed to measure <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> but when taken longitudinally it {{can be used as a}} measure for self-esteem instability.|$|E

50|$|Self-esteem {{stability}} {{refers to}} immediate feelings of self-esteem which, generally, {{will not be}} influenced by everyday positive or negative experiences.In contrast, unstable self-esteem refers to fragile and vulnerable feelings of self-esteem which will be influenced by internally generated, such as reflecting on one's social life, and externally received evaluative information, for example a compliment or a failed course. Rosenberg makes a distinction of baseline instability and barometric instability. Baseline instability are long term fluctuations in self-esteem that occur slowly and {{over an extended period}} of time. For example, decreases in self-esteem level are common as children transition from the relatively safe environs of elementary school to the more turbulent middle school environment, often followed by slow but steady increases in self-esteem through the high school years. Barometric instability, on the other hand, reflects short term fluctuations in one’s contextually based <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> This means that someone with an unstable self-esteem will value him/herself positively on one day, but negatively on the other, this can even vary with every situation. One important feature of individuals with unstable self-esteem is how they can react very strongly on experiences that they view as relevant for their self-esteem, within this they can even see relevance for their self-esteem when there is not. Unstable self-esteem may take numerous forms. Some people may experience dramatic shifts from feeling very positively to very negatively about themselves, others may primarily fluctuate in the extent to which they feel positively or negatively about themselves.Another distinction made in the research on stability of self-esteem is between fragile and secure high self-esteem. Secure high self-esteem reflects positive feelings of self-worth that are well anchored and secure and that are positively associated with a wide range of psychological health and well-being indices. Fragile high self-esteem, however, reflects positive feelings of self-worth that are vulnerable to threat, as they require continual bolstering, protection, and validation through various self-protective or self-enhancement strategies.|$|E

When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

50|$|In {{another set}} of studies, done in the 1980s by Jennifer Crocker and colleagues, {{self-esteem}} was studied using minimal group processes {{in which it was}} shown that individuals with high self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept exhibit greater ingroup biases than people with low self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept. While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self-esteem and in-group bias, other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem have a higher prejudice to both in-group and out-group members. Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed a greater prejudice than did lower self-esteem groups. This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases. Alternatively, it is possible that researchers have used the wrong sort of self-esteem measures to test the link between self-esteem and in-group bias (<b>global</b> personal <b>self-esteem</b> rather than specific social self-esteem).|$|R

40|$|Since James (1890) {{introduced}} the psychological {{importance of the}} self, researchers have continued to debate several issues concerning self-concept and self-esteem. This study examined the ratings of multiple domains of self-concept, the importance of those domains, ratings of general self-concept, and self-esteem of 691 students from a North East school district in grades 4, 8, and 12. Students were chosen to represent three developmental levels: pre-adolescence, early adolescence, and late adolescence. All students completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, a form of the Harter Self-Perception Profile and its accompanying importance ratings. Significant age and {{gender differences in the}} ratings were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA design. The three-way interaction of Grade by Sex by Self-Concept Domain was found to be significant, indicating differences between males and females in athletic competence, physical appearance, and behavioral conduct at each of the three grade levels. When specific domains were examined, many of the gender differences in ratings of competency were in the direction of gender stereotypes. Significant Grade by Domain and Sex by Domain interactions of importance ratings were also found. Gender differences were found in <b>global</b> self-worth and <b>self-esteem,</b> with males consistently reporting higher ratings. Significant grade differences were also found in ratings of global self-worth. However, the predicted U-shaped trend in ratings of self-esteem was found for female participants but not for males. When domain and importance ratings were used in linear regression models to predict <b>global</b> self-concept and <b>self-esteem,</b> importance ratings were not found to reliably increase the predictability of either global measure. However, ratings of physical appearance were found to significantly predict global measures at each developmental level. Implications and possible interventions are discussed. ...|$|R

In this research, we examined the trajectories of self-esteem in 11 domains, moderators of the trajectories, and the age-graded relations of domain-specific self-esteem with <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and with the Big Five personality traits. Data come from a nationally representative Swiss sample of individuals aged 16 to 90 years (N = 1, 000). Depending on the specific domain, domain-specific self-esteem showed life-span trajectories that were quite different from the quadratic trajectory of <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> For example, self-esteem in the domains of physical appearance and physical abilities continuously decreased with age. Self-esteem in the domains of physical appearance, social relations, honesty, problem solving, and academic abilities explained a large amount of variance in <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> whereas self-esteem in the domains of religiosity, physical abilities, mathematics, and verbal abilities did not. Self-esteem in the domain of physical appearance was strongly correlated with <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> in adolescence and young adulthood, but the correlation significantly decreased with age. Controlling for self-esteem in the domain of academic abilities altered the trajectory of <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> suggesting that self-esteem changes in this domain account for the old-age decline of <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Controlling for the Big Five personality traits did not substantially alter the life-span trajectories of either global or domain-specific self-esteem.

40|$|Objectives: The Exercise and Self-Esteem Model {{is used as}} a {{theoretical}} framework to describe associations between <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and physical activity, mediated by perceived athletic competence. We know little about how these associations develop over time in elementary school children. We examined the change in, and associations between, <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> perceived athletic competence, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in children from kindergarten to grade 4. We also investigated if this change and these associations were different for boys and girls. Design: A prospective longitudinal cohort-sequential design that consisted of two cohorts of children. Method: Children in cohort I were followed from kindergarten to grade 2, and children in cohort II were followed from grade 2 to grade 4. <b>Global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> and perceived athletic competence were measured with the Self-Perception Profile for Children (SPPC) (n= 292; 148 boys), while MVPA was measured with proxy-reports for physical activity filled in by parents (n= 184; 88 boys). Results: <b>Global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> perceived athletic competence, and MVPA remained stable. <b>Global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> was the same in boys and girls, while boys reported higher levels of perceived athletic competence and were more physically active than girls.

A series of regression analyses were performed for boys and girls separately to obtain Cohen's (1992) effect size estimate (uniquely explained criterion variance expressed as a proportion of unexplained criterion variance) for various predictor variables. Cognitive predictors were verbal and non-verbal General Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. Non-cognitive variables included the hierarchical levels of self-concept: <b>global</b> (Rosenberg <b>Self-Esteem</b> Scale), and academic and mathematics self-concept (relevant scales of Brookover, Erickson and Joiner). Socio-economic predictors included home-related variables (parental education, parental occupation, family size) and school-related factors (class size, teacher's qualification, teacher's experience). Gender differences favouring boys were found. Non-verbal and verbal scholastic aptitude and teacher's general training correlated significantly with mathematics achievement for boys and girls, with non-verbal scholastic aptitude showing the highest correlation and effect size estimate for girls and teacher's general training occupying this position for boys. Teacher's mathematics training and class size showed correlations in excess of 0. 35 for boys but not for girls.

40|$|Whereas past {{researchers}} {{have assumed that}} global feelings of self-worth guide people’s feedback-seeking activities, the authors propose that people’s more specific feelings of self-liking and selfcompetence are crucial in this domain.

Men and women are equally inclined to display this tendency, {{and it does not}} matter whether the self-views refer to characteristics that are relatively immutable (e.g., intelligence) or changeable (e.g., diligence), or whether the self-views happen to be highly specific (e.g., athletic) or <b>global</b> (e.g., low <b>self-esteem,</b> worthlessness). Furthermore, when people chose negative partners over positive ones, it is not merely in an effort to avoid interacting with positive evaluators (that is, out of a concern that they might disappoint such positive evaluators).

Finally, recent work has shown that people work to verify self-views associated with group memberships.

40|$|International audienceOften {{taken for}} granted, the {{coexistence}} of {{benefits and costs}} of discounting and devaluing has never been tested. Yet, not only are there inconsistent findings about the relations between these processes and <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> but {{little is known about}} their relations to motivation and performance. Here we simultaneously examined how academic discounting and devaluing relate to <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> achievement goals, and grades. Conducted among a diverse sample of stigmatized secondary-school students, the present study showed that discounting was positively related to <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> (even more for students with lower academic self-esteem) and unrelated to achievement goals and grades. Devaluing was unrelated to <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> negatively related to all achievement goals, and associated with lower grades through mastery-approach goals. These findings suggest that discounting is a true self-protective strategy, buffering self-evaluation without decreasing achievement motivation. On the contrary, devaluing appears as a maladaptive strategy, with no benefit at all for self-evaluation and major costs for achievement motivation and grades...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} how adult romantic attachment (anxiety and avoidance dimensions), <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> {{and social and}} academic self-views relate {{to one another and}} how well they predict preference for a specific feedback type (enhancing, verifying, or no feedback) from a potential romantic partner in times of distress. It also investigated the relation between the type of feedback one receives and attraction to the partner who gives that type of feedback. Multiple regression analyses supported some predicted relations between romantic attachment and feedback preference. Neither <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> nor social and academic self-views predicted preference for a particular feedback type, nor did social self-views moderate the relation between attachment and feedback preference. Although <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> was found to moderate the relation between attachment style and feedback preference, the moderation effects were not in the predicted directions. However, academic self-views were found to moderate the relation between attachment and feedback preference. In addition, anxious and avoidant attachment related negatively to <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem,</b> social self-views, and academic self-view. <b>Global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> related positively to both social and academic self-views. Receiving one 2 ̆ 7 s preferred feedback predicted attraction to the potential romantic partner who gave that type of feedback. Limitations of the study and direction for future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{exercise}} programmes on psychosocial characteristics, namely self-esteem, {{of people with}} visual impairment (VI) is limited. Martial arts practice {{has been found to}} improve <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> among different age groups and among people with different abilities, but not for people with VI. This presents a notable gap in the research literature on people with VI. This thesis conducted three studies with the aim of investigating whether martial arts practice improves self-esteem in people with VI, including martial arts mechanisms and strategies for self-esteem improvement. Study one (n = 5) investigated the effect of a martial arts (karate) 10 -week programme on the exercise and self-esteem model components (EXSEM) in young adults with VI (age range 19 - 40 years) following a non-concurrent multiple baseline approach. Visual inspection and graphical approach analysis showed that four participants improved their <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem.</b> Physical self-worth improved for all five participants. Exercise self-efficacy was improved in three participants whereas the other two had high exercise self-efficacy before participation in the karate programme. Exercise self-efficacy and physical self-worth maintained higher scores than the baseline for all five participants for 3 months upon completing the programme. The 3 -month follow up results of <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> were lower than the baseline scores for two participants whereas the other three participants achieved higher <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> scores than the baseline scores. Study 2 (n = 12) aimed to identify the mechanisms for self-esteem improvement from the perspective of martial artists with VI following a narrative approach. Results identified two main factors that contributed in the improvement of self-esteem found in this group. Firstly, social self-esteem impacted <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> as instructors unconditionally accepted the martial artists with VI, motivated them and created relationships based on trust. In addition, participants reported that team work in the dojo, trustful relationships among martial arts peers, and feeling respected impacted their social self-esteem. The resultant was improved <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> of the martial artists with VI. The second factor identified showed that <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> improvement was related to intellectual self-esteem, as the martial artists increased their self-achievement awareness and body and spatial awareness and thus helped martial artists in achieving their maximal potential. Study 3 (n = 6) aimed to provide strategies that martial arts instructors utilize to improve self-esteem of their students with VI using an interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA). Participants reported that the first step for <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> improvement of martial artist with VI was social inclusion which needed to be rooted in a personal perception about the abilities of individuals with VI. Most of the strategies that were utilized by the instructors were focused either on social relationships, for example peer tutoring, or martial arts philosophy such as teaching real situations. Furthermore, instructors reported that improvement of the other cognitive and psychological characteristics, namely body awareness and self-confidence improvement, positively affected <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> of individuals with VI. Supporting the multidimensional hierarchical construct of self-esteem, this thesis reports a positive influence of martial arts styles on social self-esteem, physical self-worth, intellectual self-esteem, and consequently <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> in people with VI. Therefore, it is recommended that instructors focus on these three domains to improve <b>global</b> <b>self-esteem</b> of people with VI...|$|E
40|$|Self-esteem as {{measured}} by the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory [Coopersmith, S. (1967),The Antecedents of Self-Esteem, Freeman, San Francisco] and ego development {{as measured}} by the Washington University Sentence Completion Test [Loevinger, J., and Wessler, R. (1970),Measuring Ego Development, Vol. I, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco] were evaluated in three groups of early adolescents: diabetic patients, nonpsychotic psychiatric patients, and a nonpatient group of high-school students. We found that low levels of ego development were associated with low levels of <b>global</b> and domain-specific <b>self-esteem</b> in all three subject groups. Levels of self-esteem among diabetic patients were not significantly different from those of nonpatients. While psychiatric patients had significantly lower self-esteem levels than the other groups, this difference was accounted for by preconformists, i. e., those at the lowest stages of ego development. Psychiatric patients reaching higher ego levels showed self-esteem levels indistinguishable from those of the diabetics and nonpatients...|$|R

40|$|Objective. - Many {{studies have}} enlightened the {{relevance}} of deepening our knowledge of suicidal ideation among adolescents. However, research has given insufficient attention {{to the impact of}} time perspective on suicidal ideation: the present study confirms this relationship in a large sample of adolescents. Method. - A survey was conducted on a sample of 3700 Italian adolescents. We obtained data using a structured questionnaire addressing suicidal ideation, mental health status, self-esteem, individual and family characteristics, and time perspective (ZTPI) in three temporal frames: the past, present and future, and the attitude related to each one of them. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results. - Overall, 9. 2 % of the sample reported severe suicidal ideation during the past two weeks; 7. 6 % reported moderate suicidal ideation. Female adolescents {{were more likely to report}} severe suicidal ideation when compared to males (chi(2) ((2)) = 13. 38, P =. 001). There were no differences regarding age (chi(2) ((1)) = 2. 81, P =. 245) and SES (chi(2) ((2)) = 8. 67, P =. 08). The first discriminant function was mostly explained by psychopathological symptoms (General <b>Global</b> Index), <b>self-esteem</b> and two dimensions of the ZTPI (Negative Past and Fatalistic Present). Conclusions. - Differences in time perspective dimensions between moderate and severe ideators suggest that these groups should be considered and analyzed as two discrete groups in further research.
