As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude protein, 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash. The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic (43.9%), linoleic (38.3%), and palmitic (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of <b>food</b> <b>energy,</b> so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess <b>food</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are <b>food,</b> <b>energy,</b> materials and water.|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} common trend in {{inflation}} for consumer prices and consumer prices excluding prices of <b>food</b> and <b>energy.</b> Both the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) indexes {{and the consumer}} price indexes (CPI) are examined. The statistical model employed is a bivariate integrated moving average process; this model extends a univariate model that fits the data on inflation very well. The bivariate model forecasts {{as well as the}} univariate models. The results suggest that the relationship between overall consumer prices, consumer prices excluding the prices of <b>food</b> and <b>energy,</b> and the common trend has changed significantly over time. In the 1970 s and early 1980 s, movements in overall prices and prices excluding <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices both contained information about the trend; in recent data, the trend is best gauged by focusing solely on prices excluding <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices.

As a prebiotic fermentable fiber, its metabolism by gut flora yields short-chain fatty acids (see below) which increase absorption of calcium, magnesium, and iron, resulting from upregulation of mineral-transporting genes and their membrane transport proteins within the colon wall.

50|$|The core CPI index {{excludes}} goods {{with high}} price volatility, such as <b>food</b> and <b>energy.</b> This measure of core inflation systematically excludes <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices because, historically, {{they have been}} highly volatile and non-systemic. More specifically, <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices are widely thought {{to be subject to}} large changes that often fail to persist and do not represent relative price changes. In many instances, large movements in <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices arise because of supply disruptions such as drought or OPEC-led cutbacks in production. This was introduced in the early 1970s when food and especially oil prices were quite volatile, and the Fed wanted an index that was less subject to short term shocks. However, on January 25, 2012, the Fed announced they would stop using the core CPI and rely instead on the Personal consumption expenditures price index.|$|R
40|$|Many central bankers {{have made}} {{monetary}} policy decisions {{by focusing on}} core inflation data that exclude <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices from overall inflation. In this paper, estimation results from multivariate GARCH models show that food prices not only help forecast future core inflation, but their conditional variance also affects the conditional variance of core inflation. Energy prices, on the other hand, affect core inflation primarily through the GARCH-in-mean effect. To the extent that <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> prices affect the underlying trend and volatility of overall inflation, policymakers should not ignore these components in their assessment of future inflation risk. <b>food</b> and <b>energy...</b>|$|R

25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for <b>food</b> <b>energy</b> called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That {{is the key to}} why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|With {{high rates}} of food and nonrenewable fossil fuel {{consumption}} worldwide, we are facing great challenges in ensuring <b>food</b> and <b>energy</b> security to satisfy the world population. Intercropping, as an important and sustainable cropping practice in agroecosystems, has been widely practiced around the world.

25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they can come back with more <b>food</b> <b>energy</b> for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time.
