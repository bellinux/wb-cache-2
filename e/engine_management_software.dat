40|$|A Security Operation Center (SOC) {{is made up}} of five {{distinct}} modules: event generators, event collectors, message database, analysis <b>engines</b> {{and reaction}} <b>management</b> <b>software.</b> The main problem encountered when building a SOC is the integration of all these modules, usually built as autonomous parts, while matching availability, integrity and security of data and their transmission channels. In this paper we will discuss the functional architecture needed to integrate those modules. Chapter one will introduce the concepts behind each module and briefly describe common problems encountered with each of them. In chapter two we will design the global architecture of the SOC. We will then focus on collection & analysis of data generated by sensors in chapters three and four. A short conclusion will describe further research & analysis to be performed in the field of SOC design. 1 SOC Modules Security Operation Center is a generic term describing part or all of a platform whose purpose is to provide detection and reaction services to security incidents. According to this definition we can distinguish five operations to be performed by a SOC: security event generation, collection, storage, analysis and reaction.

40|$|The DoD has various vehicle {{platforms}} {{powered by}} high performance gas turbine engines {{that would benefit}} greatly from predictive health management technologies that can detect, isolate and assess remaining useful life of critical line replaceable units (LRUs) or subsystems. In order to meet these needs for next generation engines, dedicated prognostic algorithms must be developed {{that are capable of}} operating in an autonomous and real-time <b>engine</b> health <b>management</b> system <b>software</b> architecture that is distributed in nature. This envisioned prognostic and health management system should allow engine-level reasoners to have visibility and insight into the results of local diagnostic and prognostic technologies implemented down at the LRU and subsystem levels. To accomplish this effectively requires an integrated suite of prognostic technologies that can be applied to critical engine systems and can capture fault/failure mode propagation and interactions that occur in these systems, all the way up through the engine and eventually vehicle level. In the paper, the authors will present a generic set of selected prognostic algorithm approaches that can be applied to gas turbine engines, as well as provide an overview of the required reasoning architecture needed to integrate the prognostic information across the engine...|$|R

50|$|An ongoing {{problem with}} the engines was their {{propensity}} for surging or stalling with 68 incidents reported between 2003 and October 2016 though this rate had reduced after {{the introduction of the}} Block 3 engine version. The US Naval Air Systems Command intends to award Rolls Royce two contracts to examine the effectiveness of proposed reliability improvements, the first is a software tweak to the <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>software</b> for the compressor guide vanes that internal testing showed could improve surge margin by 0.8% at sea level and 3% at altitude. The second is the discovery that a temperature sensor at the inlet of the compressor sends incorrect readings leading to 2.5% out of 4% steady power shortfall at the compressors correct rotational speed again correctable with a software fix. In addition Bell-Boeing are developing an inlet barrier system to reduce the power loss from the engine ingesting dust and sand particles to supplement the engines existing centrifugal based particle separators as they {{can only do so much}} to improve the quality of air they receive.|$|E

50|$|This version makes 345HP and 369LBs Torque. The 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder is {{here and}} kicks out 20 {{additional}} horsepower and 15 lb-ft more torque compared to the same engine S60 R-Design. That’s a respectable output bump coming by way of massaged <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> <b>software,</b> a stainless exhaust with 2.5-inch pipes, new twin-scroll Borg Warner turbochargers and new intercooler. Polestar also did work to the transmission with new calibration for quicker gearshifts and launch control capabilities. The Haldex four-wheel-drive system also has Polestar tuning for more rear torque distribution, and the stability control system has been massaged. The chassis is firmer with a suspension that features Ohlin shock absorbers with 80 percent stiffer springs sitting on 20-inch wheels that would normally come wrapped with Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires from the factory. Brakes get a nice upgrade with 14.6-inch front discs (replacing 13.2-inchers on the R-Design) with six-piston Brembo calipers and 11.8-inch rear discs. Thinking back to our long-term S60 R-Design, the brakes were the weakest part of the package, getting cooked after one or two hot laps around a track. Visual changes include new front and rear splitters, rear spoiler and diffuser. Inside there’s a nice, thick-rimmed steering wheel and upgraded seats with suede inserts, suede door inserts and blue accent stitching throughout. The hard numbers, according to Volvo, are a 0 to 60 mph time of 4.7 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 155 mph (up from 130).|$|E
