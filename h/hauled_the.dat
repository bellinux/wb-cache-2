5|$|After the men <b>hauled</b> <b>the</b> Flyer {{back from}} its fourth flight, a {{powerful}} {{gust of wind}} flipped it over several times, despite the crew's attempt to hold it down. Severely damaged, the airplane never flew again. The brothers shipped it home, and years later Orville restored it, lending it to several U.S. locations for display, then to a British museum (see Smithsonian dispute below), before it was finally installed in 1948 in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., its current residence.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a crimson streamliner might have <b>hauled</b> <b>the</b> blue trainset. Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E

5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming <b>hauled</b> <b>the</b> ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|The club badge is in {{the form}} of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, {{is in the}} club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their {{traditional}} away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that <b>hauled</b> <b>the</b> first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly <b>hauled</b> <b>the</b> empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E
