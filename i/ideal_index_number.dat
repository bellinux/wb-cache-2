These exact indexes {{can be used to}} measure changes in a consumer’s cost of living or welfare. Two cases are considered: the case of homothetic preferences and the case of nonhomothetic preferences. In the homothetic case, exact <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> are obtained for square root quadratic preferences, quadratic mean of order r preferences and normalized quadratic preferences.

This paper presents the most comprehensive decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) to date. Starting from the Fisher <b>ideal</b> TFP <b>index,</b> we systematically isolate the productivity effects of changes in production technology, technical efficiency, scale efficiency, allocative efficiency, and the market strength. The three efficiency components further decompose into input- and output-side effects.

40|$|This short paper focusses on an {{apparent}} conflict between two results from {{different approaches to}} the problem of finding multilateral <b>index</b> <b>numbers.</b> The impossibility theorem of Van Veelen (2002) is an axiomatic result that rules out the existence of a multilateral index that satisfies four modest requirements. This also implies that no bilateral index can consistently be generalized to a multilateral setting. Adopting a revealed preference approach, Dowrick and Quiggin (1997) however construct a multilateral extention of Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s <b>ideal</b> <b>index,</b> which preserves a range of desirable properties.

40|$|Acquaye, Alston and Pardey {{report and}} discuss {{agricultural}} {{input and output}} price and quantity estimates for various spatial aggregates within the United States {{and a range of}} multi-factor productivity measures for the period 1949 - 1991. Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher <b>Ideal,</b> and Törnqvist-Theil <b>index</b> <b>number</b> procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity input and output aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91. The data file also includes various input and output subaggregates (see table 1 from Acquaye, Alston, and Pardey, appended below, for details) and the value shares using prices from the current and past period that are required to reconstruct all these indexes for all the spatial units reported in the paper. Documentation of the primary data files constructed by Craig, Pardey, and Acquaye is also available in the file named <b>Index</b> <b>Number</b> Construction The Laspeyres and Paasche indexes are not chain-linked indexes—they use base-period and current prices and quantities, respectively in the calculation. The Laspeyres input (output) quantity index uses base period input (output) prices to weight both current and base-period input (output) quantities, and was calculated as where Pi 0 is the price of input (output) i in the base-period, and Qi 0 is the quantity of input (output) i in the base-period.

40|$|At {{the end of}} 1995 the Bureau of Economic Analysis {{introduced}} chain weighted Fisher <b>ideal</b> <b>indexes</b> as {{the primary}} measures both for real GDP and its components and for the price data associated with the output measures. In response to these changes macroeconomic modelers were forced to rework the affected sections of their models. This paper describes the accommodation of the Indiana University Econometric Model of the U. S. (Indiana EMUS) to these changes. We briefly describe the overall structure of the Indiana EMUS and outline our overall strategy {{for dealing with the}} chain-weighted data. We chose to focus the model on output data stated in terms of chained 1992 dollars, rather than the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> themselves.

40|$|This article reviews an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> {{framework}} that links changes in aggregate performance measures (such as profit, revenue, cost and total factor productivity) {{to changes in}} both the prices and quantities of key outputs and inputs. The framework provides a way of linking the aggregate performance measures to outcomes for individual customer groups, employees and owners of businesses. This information is useful to policy makers in evaluating the outcomes of economic reform, including the distributional consequences. It is also useful to regulators who need to understand and monitor both {{the consequences of their}} regulation and the response to their decisions by those being regulated. The article demonstrates that the logarithmic version of Fisher's <b>Ideal</b> <b>index</b> offers a useful way of integrating changes in profit, productivity and prices into a single analysis.

50|$|In economics, <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> {{generally}} are time series summarising movements {{in a group}} of related variables. In some cases, however, <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> may compare geographic areas at a point in time. An example is a country's purchasing power parity. The best-known <b>index</b> <b>number</b> is the consumer price index, which measures changes in retail prices paid by consumers. In addition, a cost-of-living index (COLI) is a price <b>index</b> <b>number</b> that measures relative cost of living over time. In contrast to a COLI based on the true but unknown utility function, a superlative <b>index</b> <b>number</b> is an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> that can be calculated.

40|$|This paper defines and {{discusses}} {{the choices that}} are implicit in alternative approaches to constructing <b>index</b> <b>numbers.</b> The central theoretical result is the exogeneity theorem, which states that an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system possesses certain generally desirable properties, associated with meaningfulness, relevance and consistency {{if and only if}} it admits of a welfare interpretation that is invariant to the data to which it is applied. An <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system that does not permit a fixed welfare interpretation of this kind will fail to possess these properties. Moreover, it will not be possible to undertake meaningful multilateral comparisons between all possible units of comparison to which the <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system may be applied without adopting a metaevaluative criterion that expresses welfare judgments concerning the relation between distinct evaluative standards. Therefore, explicit or implicit normative judgments are inescapable in the construction and use of <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> intended to permit meaningful comparisons over an unrestricted domain. We identify a set of bounds on the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> that an <b>index</b> <b>number</b> system produces (the "generalized within bounds" requirement) which define necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be rationalizable (i. e. to possess a welfare interpretation). However, multilateral <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems that are widely in use violate this and other requirements of the exogeneity theorem. As a result, the <b>index</b> <b>numbers</b> they produce do not admit of a welfare interpretation which is invariant to the data to which they are applied, and indeed may not admit of any welfare interpretation at all. The exogeneity theorem establishes that the rationale for "exact" <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems is much less compelling than widely believed. A fixed welfare interpretation is also a necessary and sufficient condition for the path independence of the Divisia index. The theorem therefore establishes a three-way equivalence between desirable properties of continuous <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems, desirable properties of discrete <b>index</b> <b>number</b> systems and the existence of a fixed welfare interpretation...|$|R
