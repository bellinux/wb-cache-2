40|$|Hotelling's {{conceptual}} framework is expanded {{to incorporate the}} effects of a backstop technology on the planning horizon of the suppliers of an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> and its price and quantity trajectories. It is shown that in the non-trivial case, the presence of a backstop technology shortens the planning horizon of the suppliers of the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> in accordance with the resource suppliers' rate of time preference, backstop technology's rate of irnprovement and ratio of the initial resource spot price to the initial average production cost of the backstop substitute. As expected the presence of a backstop technology also lowers the spot prices of the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> and accelerates its extraction and depletion. However, a decline of the initial average cost of producing the backstop substitute by a dollar leads to a decline of the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource's</b> initial spot price by less than a dollar.

A carbon-emitting <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> competes with a dirtier abundant resource and a clean backstop. A time-dependent carbon tax {{is set to}} optimally use these resources under a cap constraint over atmospheric concentration. As the cap is tightened, the dirtier resource becomes less competitive compared to the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> (the “competition effect”), but the timing and duration of extraction of the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> is modified (the “timing effect”). We provide analytical expressions of these effects, and determine conditions over CO 2 size of reserves, pollution contents, extraction costs and demand elasticity such that the exhaustible-resource owners’ profits increase as the ceiling is tightened.

5000|$|The {{implementation}} of weak sustainability in governance {{can be viewed}} theoretically and practically through Hartwick’s rule. In resource economics, Hartwick’s rule defines the amount of investment in human capital {{that is needed to}} offset declining stocks of non-renewable resources. Solow [...] showed that, given a degree of substitutability between human capital and natural capital, one way to design a sustainable consumption program for an economy is to accumulate man-made capital. When this accumulation is sufficiently rapid the effect from the shrinking exhaustible resource stock is countered by the services from the increased human capital stock. Hartwick's rule, {{is often referred to as}} [...] "invest resource rents", where ‘rent’ is payment to a factor of production (in this case capital) in excess of that needed to keep it in its present use. This requires that a nation invest all rent earned from <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> currently extracted.|$|E
5000|$|In {{resource}} economics, Hartwick's rule {{defines the}} amount of investment in produced capital (buildings, roads, knowledge stocks, etc.) {{that is needed to}} exactly offset declining stocks of non-renewable resources. This investment is undertaken so that the standard of living does not fall as society moves into the indefinite future. Solow (1974) shows that, given a degree of substitutability between produced capital and natural resources, one way to design a sustainable consumption program for an economy is to accumulate produced capital sufficiently rapidly so that the pinch from the shrinking exhaustible resource stock is precisely countered by the services from the enlarged produced capital stock. Hartwick's rule - often abbreviated as [...] "invest resource rents" [...] - requires that a nation invest all rent earned from <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> currently extracted, where [...] "rent" [...] is defined along paths that maximize returns to owners of the resource stock. The rule extends to the case of many types of capital goods, including a vector of stocks of natural capital.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we obtain the time-consistent {{solution}} to a stochastic dynamic version of the strategic export subsidy problem. The dynamic structure of the problem emanates either from an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> or from a learning-by-doing technology. In any given period, nature ‘chooses’ the stochastic demand and cost parameters first. Then, governments choose subsidies. Lastly, firms choose output levels. We establish existence, uniqueness, and representation results for the time-consistent equilibrium of the game. Various interesting features of the solution are illustrated by simulation analysis. In particular, subsidies jump immediately to positive levels and, perhaps paradoxically, are reduced gradually to zero in the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> case, while they keep rising in the learning-by-doing case. Subsidies are higher in the learning-by-doing case than when the good in question is an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource.</b> Also, they are higher in the case when only one government is active, and lower in the corresponding time-inconsistent equilibrium case.

5000|$|In economics, a non-renewable {{resource}} {{is defined as}} goods, where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow. David Ricardo in his early works analysed the pricing of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources,</b> where {{he argued that the}} price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by Hotelling's rule, which is a 1931 economic model of {{non-renewable resource}} management by Harold Hotelling. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a depletion of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or [...] "Hotelling rent" [...] for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the rate of interest, reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.The Hartwick's rule provides an important result about the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.|$|E
30|$|This study {{investigates the}} problem of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> using a dynamic input–output model with {{classical}} features. Although discussions on whether <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> set a limit to economic growth continue in debate to this day, one must acknowledge that <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> are and will remain of great importance to most economies. Solow’s opinion that the topic of exhaustible (or non-renewable) resources is “important, contemporary, and perennial” (Solow 1974, p. 1) in economics is indeed still very relevant.|$|E
40|$|<b>Exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> are {{considered}} to be imperative input goods to sustain our livelihood including economic activities. However, there is concern over depletion of the resources since the usage of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> has been increasing in accordance with the growth in population. Therefore, various environmental policies have been set and executed to address this concern. In light of these situations, this article examines the time path of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> by applying the optimal growth theory. As a result, it indicates that the extraction of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> decline overtime. Moreover, when comparing the results of when the increase in population and the enforcement of environmental policies are each taken into consideration with when they are not, it identifies that the optimal path of extraction for <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> each support both a more rapid and gentle path when population increase and environmental policy enforcement are taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we tie {{together}} the two literatures of durable goods monopoly and <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> pricing. We {{show that the}} intertemporal no-arbitrage condition that arises if the durable good monopolist seller can commit to a price path mirrors the intertemporal no-arbitrage condition if the monopsonist buyer of an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> can commit to a price path. The intuition is that the durable good monopolist initially announces high future prices to get highvaluation buyers to buy early and subsequently lowers the price to attract additional buyers. On the other hand, the monopsonist buyer of the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> initially announces low future prices to encourage sellers to supply their units early and subsequently, as the stock of the resource declines, raises the price to call forth additional supply. As the period of commitment shrinks to zero, the durable good’s price drops to its marginal cost and the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource’s</b> price jumps to its choke level, all in a twinkling of the eye, as Coase hypothesized. The observation that two theories share the same formal structure, that is, differ only in the interpretation placed on symbols, can almost always be used to simplify a body of knowledge. [Sonnenschein 1968, p. 316] Coase and Hotelling share the distinction of having authored three papers {{each of which has}} become a pillar of modern economic theory.

30|$|The modern {{theory of}} <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> {{generally}} {{stems from the}} well-known Hotelling rule (Hotelling 1931). According to the Hotelling rule, the prices of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> in situ must increase at a rate {{equal to that of}} the profit, provided that free competition prevails, {{due to the fact that}} the storage of <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> requires a normal rate of profit as do other production processes. Since resources are generally used in the production of many, if not all commodities, it is appropriate to conduct research on <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resources</b> within a multi-sectoral framework. In addition, since the Hotelling rule seems to imply that the prices of many, if not all, commodities are subject to change, a dynamic analysis is appropriate. Based on these two considerations, the dynamic input–output model is the best option for carrying out this study’s research.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies how {{owners of}} carbon-emitting {{resources}} {{can benefit from}} carbon taxation. We build a Hotelling-like model with three energy resources: a polluting <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource,</b> a dirtier abundant resource and a clean backstop.

We consider the cases where both polluting resources are used and the exhaustible one gets exhausted. When this resource is cheaper to extract than the dirtier resource, tightening carbon regulation increases the profits of the <b>exhaustible</b> <b>resource</b> owners: (i) if its demand elasticity is low enough or (ii) if its extraction cost is close enough {{to that of the}} dirty backstop, or (iii) if its pollution content is low enough (compared to that of the dirty backstop), or (iv) if its initial stock is low enough.

Nonconvexity is shown to imply that (1) (efficient) extraction ceases {{to the left of}} the minimum efficient scale, i. e., where average costs exceed marginal costs; and (2) a competitive equilibrium does not exist. Introduction of a backstop technology (which induces a flat portion of the industry demand curve) restores both existence and efficiency, provided that the backstop price is sufficiently low. If firms face even a small amount of uncertainty regarding their rivals' stocks, a backstop technology is sufficient to restore existence of competitive equilibrium, even if the backstop price is very high.
