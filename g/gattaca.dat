25|$|Sturgess' {{influence}} in skepticism began during The Amazing Meeting 3 where she helped as a volunteer. At {{the beginning of}} 2006, after an influential lecture on 'Teaching Critical Thinking in the Physical Sciences' by Liam McDaid of Sacramento City College, the West Australian Skeptic Association ran an Award for challenging pseudo-scientific and paranormal claims. Sturgess used this opportunity as a 'theme' for her Term 2 upper-ability English class (along with studies of Macbeth, <b>GATTACA</b> and The Chrysalids) who subsequently submitted six group reports. The class was commended with two awards and one honourable mention; later repeated in 2007 with two Awards and three honourable mentions.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Gattaca,</b> {{named after}} the 1997 science fiction movie, was a minor group of {{approximately}} ten members that appeared briefly in the first series. The small group first appeared in episode seven when the Whiskers accidentally crossed over into their territory. The meeting ended without incident as the Whiskers willingly returned to their own land. Risca, a former dominant female of the Whiskers, led the <b>Gattaca.</b> [...] Acting as minor rivals of the Whiskers, the <b>Gattaca</b> received little story attention until they quietly disappeared from the show {{before the end of}} the series. In reality, the group died out from disease and predation.|$|E
500|$|In Andrew Niccol's {{science fiction}} film <b>Gattaca</b> (1997), [...] "one {{of the more}} {{interesting}} scripts" [...] Hawke said he had read in [...] "a number of years", he played the role of a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man's identity. Although <b>Gattaca</b> was not a success at the box office it drew generally favorable reviews from critics; The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reviewer wrote that [...] "Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has served him well since his kid-actor days, is most impressive".|$|E
500|$|Hawke next {{worked with}} the Spierig {{brothers}} again on the science fiction thriller Predestination, in which Hawke plays a time-traveling agent on his final assignment. Following its premiere at the 2014 SXSW Film Festival, the film was released in Australia in August 2014 and in the US in January 2015. The film received largely positive reviews and was nominated for the AACTA Award for Best Film. He then reunited with his <b>Gattaca</b> director Andrew Niccol for Good Kill. In this modern war film, Hawke played a drone pilot with a troubled conscience, which led to The Hollywood Reporter calling it his [...] "best screen role in years." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} {{inspired}} by several Western films, most notably L.A. Confidential. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences, including Minority Report, <b>Gattaca,</b> Brazil and Blade Runner; the latter of which he compared very closely to Psycho-Pass. Before {{the making of the}} series, Urobuchi insisted on using a Philip K. Dick-inspired, dystopian narrative. The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched Lupin III during his childhood because he thought about adding [...] "today's youth trauma" [...] to the series. The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked. Other voice actors have been credited in the making of the series because of the ways they added traits to the characters.|$|E
500|$|David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), an {{adaptation}} of the speculative novel by J. G. Ballard, {{has been described as}} a [...] "film noir in bruise tones". The hero is the target of investigation in <b>Gattaca</b> (1997), which fuses film noir motifs with a scenario indebted to Brave New World. The Thirteenth Floor (1999), like Blade Runner, is an explicit homage to classic noir, in this case involving speculations about virtual reality. The Animatrix (2003), based on The Matrix trilogy, contains an anime short film in classic noir style titled [...] "A Detective Story" [...] which takes place within the story of the trilogy. Anime television series with science fiction noir themes include Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop (1998), The Big O (1999), and Noir (2001).|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Journal of Popular Film & Television, Susan George {{authored}} a {{paper that}} dealt with the portrayal of procreation in Species, <b>Gattaca</b> and Mimic. George compares the character of Fitch to [...] "an updated Dr. Frankenstein," [...] and explores the development of Sil's maternal aspirations, which convert the character into an [...] "archaic mother" [...] figure similar to the xenomorph creature in the Alien series, both of which are, she claims, portrayed negatively. George further states that a recurring theme in science fiction films {{is a response to}} [...] "this kind of powerful female sexuality and 'alien-ness in that [...] "the feminine monster must die as Sil does at the end of Species." [...] Feldman himself considered that an underlying theme regarded [...] "a female arriving and seeking to find a superior mate." ...|$|E
500|$|The team's {{goal was}} to make the game {{different}} from contemporaneous first-person shooters. The team ensured the game had its own style that would differentiate itself from other games. This was achieved by using a [...] "split-world aspect", which divided the game's into two areas, each with a different artstyle. The team added details and aesthetics to the game's three syndicates in the upper zone so they would easily be recognized and be different from each another. [...] "The Downzone", where non-implanted poor people live, has a different design from the three syndicates. The team took ideas for this area from Mirror's Edge. Both sides were inspired by futuristic films such as Blade Runner, Minority Report and <b>Gattaca.</b> In addition, the split-world concept applies to the gameplay. The Downzone enemies tend to be more aggressive and anti-agents, and some gameplay segments such as the breaching system are inapplicable in such areas.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} three series of the four-series programme, five major groups of meerkats were {{regularly}} shown, however its primary focus was on {{a group called the}} Whiskers, {{one of the largest and}} oldest of the research groups. [...] Other groups featured were neighbouring rival groups of the Whiskers and groups formed by former Whiskers members. During the first series, a group called the Lazuli were depicted as the Whiskers’ main rivals, with occasional appearances by the smaller <b>Gattaca</b> group. [...] In the second series, the Commandoes were introduced as one of the toughest rivals the Whiskers had ever faced, and by the third, the Commandoes had forced the Whiskers to move. The Whiskers then acquired two new neighbouring groups, the Zappa, with whom they had frequent confrontations, and the short-lived Starsky group formed by a trio of evicted Whiskers females. In the fourth and final series, one of the Whiskers' females formed a new group, the Aztecs.|$|E
500|$|In October 2013, Paul was {{the subject}} of some {{controversy}} when it was discovered that he had plagiarized from Wikipedia part of a speech in support of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Referencing the movie <b>Gattaca,</b> Paul quoted almost verbatim from the Wikipedia article about the film without citing the source. Evidence soon surfaced that Paul had copied sentences in a number of his other speeches nearly verbatim from other authors without giving credit to the original sources, including in the speech he had given as the Tea Party rebuttal to the president's 2013 State of the Union address. In addition, a three-page-long passage of Paul's book Government Bullies was taken directly from an article by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. When it became apparent that Paul's op-ed in The Washington Times on mandatory minimums and related testimony he had given before the Senate Judiciary Committee both contained material that was virtually identical to an article that had been published by another author in The Week a few days earlier, the Washington Times said that the newspaper would no longer publish the weekly column Paul had been contributing to the paper. After a week of almost daily news reports of new allegations of plagiarism, Paul said that he was being held to an [...] "unfair standard", but would restructure his office in order to prevent mistakes in the future, if that would be what it would take [...] "to make people leave me the hell alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics of}} libertarian {{transhumanism}} {{have focused on}} the likely socioeconomic consequences in societies in which divisions between rich and poor are on the rise. Bill McKibben, for example, suggests that emerging human enhancement technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the {{gap between rich and poor}} and creating a [...] "genetic divide". Even Lee M. Silver, the biologist and science writer who coined the term [...] "reprogenetics" [...] and supports its applications, has expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically engineered [...] "haves" [...] and [...] "have nots" [...] if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of enhancement technologies.
