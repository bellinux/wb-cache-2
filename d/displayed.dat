50|$|Lacking a {{measurement}} device, measurement {{can be performed}} using a test <b>display</b> (the <b>display</b> being measured), a control <b>display</b> (usually a CRT) that would ideally have negligible <b>display</b> lag, a computer capable of mirroring an output to the two <b>displays,</b> stopwatch software, and a high-speed camera pointed at the two <b>displays</b> running the stopwatch program. The lag time is measured by taking {{a photograph of the}} <b>displays</b> running the stopwatch software, then subtracting the two times on the <b>displays</b> in the photograph. This method only measures the difference in <b>display</b> lag between two <b>displays</b> and cannot determine the absolute <b>display</b> lag of a single <b>display.</b> CRTs are preferable to use as a control <b>display</b> because their <b>display</b> lag is typically negligible.

40|$|Objective: Effects of <b>display</b> {{size and}} dual <b>display</b> setting on {{preferred}} <b>display</b> and keyboard positions were evaluated. Background: User-preferred <b>display</b> position may vary as its size changes or when multiple <b>displays</b> are used. It {{is also not}} known whether the use of larger <b>displays</b> or multiple <b>displays</b> would influence positioning of the keyboard. Method: Participants (N = 19) who had normal visual acuity (20 / 30 or better) determined preferred positions of the <b>display</b> and the keyboard during a data entry task in four <b>display</b> setups (19, 24, 27. 5, and dual 19 in.). The size of capital characters (3. 2 mm high) was kept consistent between setups. Results: Preferred viewing distance ranged from 0. 68 m (19 -in. <b>display)</b> to 0. 76 m (27. 5 -in. <b>display).</b> No significant differences in viewing distance and <b>display</b> height {{were found between the}} single 19 -in. <b>display</b> and dual 19 -in. <b>displays</b> setups. The preferred position of the keyboard was consistent between <b>display</b> setups. Conclusion: Participants placed larger <b>displays</b> farther and lower while maintaining the <b>display</b> top at or near eye height. Preferred position of the dual <b>displays</b> in landscape setting did not differ from that of a single <b>display.</b> It appears that the preferred <b>display</b> position varies with the vertical dimension of the overall viewable area of the <b>display.</b> Application: The results of this study can be used to determine the dimensions or adjustability of computer workstations for larger <b>displays</b> or multiple <b>displays</b> settings. close 6...|$|R
