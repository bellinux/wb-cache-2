So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too.

500|$|Jane {{was long}} {{thought to be}} the only 16th-century English monarch without a {{surviving}} contemporary portrait; one was documented in a 1590 inventory, but is now considered lost. Some identified as her were later deemed to be of other sitters, such as one of Catherine Parr, the last of the six wives of King Henry VIII, which was identified as Lady Jane Grey until 1996. Other works, such as The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833) by Paul Delaroche, were painted years or centuries after her death. As a result, Cynthia Zarin of The New Yorker writes, [...] "the blank where [...] face should be has made <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> easier for succeeding generations to imprint their political and personal fantasies on her".|$|E
500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>much.</b> It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E

500|$|Sales of the North American {{version of}} Dragon Warrior VII reached about 200,000 copies {{according}} to The Magic Box, {{which was not}} nearly as stellar as its Japanese counterpart. Enix of America still expressed their satisfaction with the sales figures. Dragon Warrior VII met with mostly positive reviews from North American critics. IGN noted that all [...] "100+ hours" [...] of the game are enjoyable despite the dated visuals and clunky presentation. GameZone.com praised the game's concept and nostalgia factor and cited it as [...] "what role-playing games were meant to be."

500|$|The {{fire and}} Peggy's exit episodes {{garnered}} a mixed reception by critics. Liam Tucker, founder of website Watch With Mothers, compared the fire episode {{to the film}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and admired the special effects and performances of the episode, but said that it seemed unlikely that everyone would have escaped safely, especially Stacey and her baby. Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury wondered if the fire episode was inaccurate {{due to the lack}} of fire alarms, sprinklers and emergency lighting in the pub, but noted that the episode's use of the song [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor", featuring the line [...] "Gonna burn this god damn house right down", was [...] "clever". A writer for Heat said [...] "We knew the Vic fire was coming, but actually seeing it was quite another thing, and knowing that it also marked the end of an era with the departure of [...] Windsor made <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more emotional." [...] A reporter for the Nottingham Evening Post wrote [...] "Never in the history of soap fires, of which there have of course been legion, have so many hilariously overindulgent explosions been captured on camera." [...] The Mail on Sunday picked the fire episode as the [...] "Soap of the Day", while The People deemed the lack of deaths [...] "a wasted opportunity." [...] Ally Ross wrote in his column in The Sun that the fire episode was [...] "twenty minutes of shouting", questioned why one character was seen flouting the smoking ban and Phil was boarded up behind an inward-opening door, and opined that he was glad to see Peggy leave as she had become [...] "increasingly psychotic" [...] and [...] "vile".|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "well put together", noting {{that it had}} [...] "ood set ups and good execution" [...] and that it [...] "gave us good comedy" [...] as it had [...] "plenty to work with." [...] In regards to the Liz and Dennis story, he admitted that while it was funny, it was [...] "fairly stereotypical." [...] Canning commented that Jack's relationship with Condoleezza Rice in the episode was a [...] "great concept" [...] and [...] "offered up {{a good number of}} chuckles", although [...] "it never became as clever as it appeared it was going to be." [...] Canning gave the episode a 6.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich was complimentary towards the episode, reporting, [...] "Now this is what I'm talking about. Second-tier cast integration, multiple stories going on, intimations that Condoleezza Rice likes phone sex... Another winning week for NBC's 30 Rock." [...] Mitovich enjoyed the fact that Jack was in a relationship with Rice, writing that another show [...] "would build [...] whole episode around them" [...] but that 30 Rock [...] "made <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> funnier by playing it in the background and thus getting to be more outrageous with it." [...] Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that Alec Baldwin [...] "always knocks the ball out of the park on the acting front" [...] but noted that [...] "the best material" [...] in this episode belonged to the Tracy and Toofer story. [...] "The show does have a tendency to telegraph its punchlines, but it was nice to have the two men's differences resolved by finding the funny in a Star Jones/excessive vomiting sketch." [...] Ward was complimentary towards Jane Krakowski, observing that her [...] "comic timing" [...] in [...] "The Break-Up" [...] was [...] "impeccable as usual, but {{it would be nice to}} see her character get a tad more three-dimensional." [...] Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on the show, citing that he does a [...] "hilarious turn" [...] as Dennis, while the Houston Chronicles Mike McDaniel opined that Winters had a [...] "cene-stealing and hilarious role" [...] on the show.|$|E

Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician's misdeeds, both known and speculative. Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment on November 1993. They conceived of a concept referred to as [...] "the Beast", which Wilkinson describes as [...] "a headless monster that lurches through postwar history," [...] a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War, and helped Nixon's rise to power and his fall from it as well.
