40|$|This paper revisits Japanese <b>focus</b> prosody by {{comparing}} the realization of contrastive <b>focus</b> vs. neutral <b>focus</b> across 4 <b>focus</b> positions and 2 accenthoods. Post-focus F 0 Range compression (PFC) is found only in accented stimuli, while <b>focus</b> in unaccented stimuli is marked by Min F 0 lowering. Penultimate <b>focus</b> differs from other <b>focus</b> positions, {{in terms of its}} post-focus behavior. Intensity and Duration manifest patterns of <b>focus</b> marker distribution comparable to those of F 0. These results combined confirm that <b>focus</b> realization interacts closely with accenthood and <b>focus</b> position, and have implications that may enhance our understanding of Japanese pitch accent in general.

40|$|Hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> of {{particles}} is numerically studied by the immersed boundary – lattice Boltzmann method. Particle <b>focusing</b> entropy is proposed to quantitatively characterize processing performance and final results of hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Simulations of hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> in several straight microchannels {{are carried out}} to evaluate versatility of the <b>focusing</b> entropy. Time evolutions of <b>focusing</b> entropies and particle trajectories are analyzed contrastively. The results demonstrate that the <b>focusing</b> entropy is an effective scale to measure particles ordering degree and hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> performance. Higher ordering degree determines lower <b>focusing</b> entropy, which indicates better <b>focusing</b> performance. Channel cross section, particle rigidness and channel Reynolds number are three major factors influencing <b>focusing</b> dynamics and final results. Rectangular microchannel is more advantageous than circular and square ones in hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Particles of different rigidness in rectangular microchannel can be separated significantly with the flow mediation. Increasing channel Reynolds numbers can lead to higher efficiency and better <b>focusing</b> performance...|$|R
