25|$|Several {{different}} kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first <b>half-tone</b> photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-Édouard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr. On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the Canadian Illustrated News which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page <b>half-tone</b> image of His Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman. Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the New York Daily Graphic in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.|$|E

Thanks to these passing chords, the harmonic structure of the morna was not restrained to the cycle of fifths, but incorporated other chords that made the smooth transition to the main ones.|$|E
40|$|Gray-scale {{images can}} be {{displayed}} on binary display devices using {{a process known as}} <b>half-toning</b> where gray intensities are approximated by different distributions of black and white pixels. There is a significant number of methods with which these binary or half-toned approximations can be generated. Most of the available methods can be categorized as either a threshold-matrix <b>half-toning</b> method or as an error-diffusion <b>half-toning</b> method. The threshold-matrix <b>half-toning</b> methods are fast and simple to implement and they can be used with or without an increase in resolution. The binary approximation of each gray-scale value is computed independently. Images half-toned with threshold matrices often exhibit quantization bands in areas of the image where a smooth intensity change occurs. Error-diffusion <b>half-toning</b> methods approximate the image one segment at a time. Any error resulting from a segment's approximation is propagated to unprocessed segments. In this paper we present some results from our current research focused on producing <b>half-toning</b> methods that are hybrids of threshold-matrix and error-diffusion <b>half-toning.</b> In particular, we introduce three hybrid methods: Threshold-matrix with error-diffusion, Variable shape threshold-matrix, and Variable threshold with error-diffusion. Each of these techniques brings together aspects from both threshold-matrix and error-diffusion <b>half-toning</b> methods. The common feature of these three methods is that they remove the quantization bands introduced by the use of small threshold matrices. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Half-toning</b> is {{the process}} by which gray-scale images are {{approximated}} with sets of black and white pixels. The process works because our eyes perceive a local average, thus <b>half-toning</b> seeks to approximate the local average. Ideally this approximation should be accomplished without introducing `undesirable' artifacts. In many situations the stylized display of images is desired. Often this stylized display is accomplished by the addition of semi-structured artifacts. In current applications the designer processes the image using tools provided by some image processing package. The resulting image is then half-toned and printed. <b>Half-toning</b> these processed images can reduce the visual impact of the special effects that have been introduced in the image. In this paper we show that the processes of controlled artifact introduction and <b>half-toning</b> can successfully be combined. By combining these two processes we ensure that the printed image is what the designer intended. We present a bri [...] ...|$|R

500|$|Prototypical tone {{clusters}} are chords {{of three}} or more adjacent notes on a chromatic scale, that is, three or more adjacent pitches each separated by only a semitone. Three-note stacks based on diatonic and pentatonic scales are also, strictly speaking, tone clusters. However, these stacks involve intervals between notes greater than the <b>half-tone</b> gaps of the chromatic kind. This can readily be seen on a keyboard, where the pitch of each key is separated from the next by one semitone (visualizing the black keys as extending {{to the edge of}} the keyboard): Diatonic scales—conventionally played on the white keys—contain only two semitone intervals; the rest are full tones. In Western musical traditions, pentatonic scales—conventionally played on the black keys—are built entirely from intervals larger than a semitone. Commentators thus tend to identify diatonic and pentatonic stacks as [...] "tone clusters" [...] only when they consist of four or more successive notes in the scale. In standard Western classical music practice, all tone clusters are classifiable as secundal chords—that is, they are constructed from minor seconds (intervals of one semitone), major seconds (intervals of two semitones), or, in the case of certain pentatonic clusters, augmented seconds (intervals of three semitones). Stacks of adjacent microtonal pitches also constitute tone clusters.|$|E

40|$|Recent results {{describe}} how a space-filling curve {{can be used}} as an error-diffusion path for <b>half-toning</b> of grey-scale images. The space-filling <b>half-toning</b> method produces clustered approximations to images with less regular artifacts than other available clustering methods. In this paper we present two methods for <b>half-toning</b> colour images using the space-filling technique. The first method processes the red, green, and blue (RGB) (or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK)) channels independently, while the second method implements an interpolation between colours that lie on the corners of the RGB colour cube. The first method produces overlapping clusters of red, green, and blue pixels. This technique is useful when the display device allows the three colours to be set independently. For a variety of reasons it is often desirable {{to reduce the amount of}} ink used in the display of an image.

We also show how the propagation of error reduces the intensity bands that are associated with threshold-matrix methods...|$|R
