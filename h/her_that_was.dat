Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed <b>her.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> not being done in 1961." ...|$|E

[...] In this way, one of the ideas they connected was the universality of long-distance relationships, the pain and heartache of which they were able to incorporate in [...] "Miles Away".

Her {{intention}} was to remain in theater, but in her second semester took a class taught by Tracy Fullerton {{on the history of}} game design, which inspired her to focus her studies on video game design instead. The class caused her to realize [...] "how much hadn't been done" [...] in the realm of communication and expression in video games and the lack of established structure and rules as to how it was best to make games, which appealed to the part of <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> interested in experimental theater. While at school she produced the award-winning game Cloud, developed by Jenova Chen and a student team, and also worked on other video games such as Darfur is Dying.|$|E
500|$|Hathaway {{prepared}} for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was [...] "put through the wringer" [...] according to Weisberger, who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour. Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the last nice thing she would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|E
500|$|The female protagonist [...] "went through {{numerous}} concept sketches, costume designs, hairstyles, names, {{and even}} nationalities."

[...] In the end, the in-game model of Cate Archer was styled after model and actress Mitzi Martin. This was a marketing decision made by the publisher, Fox Interactive, which used its feature film casting department to look for an appropriate model internationally. Archer's voice was provided by American voice actress Kit Harris, who also did the voice of the Inge Wagner character. Originally, Harris recorded the Scottish protagonist's voice in a stronger Scottish accent. This was changed after a Scottish producer of the game felt that the particular accent used was too lower class, and an inappropriate choice; Harris re-recorded her lines with a [...] "British bent" [...] instead. Both the face and the voice of the character were changed in the game's sequel, [...]|$|E

Many of these visions involved bright lights, {{and in one}} she described being [...] "so filled with light within that she could gaze at herself." [...] As with the foreskin occasion, many of her visions involved touch, such as being kissed on the cheeks by the Lamb of God. While eating the Eucharist, Blannbekin claimed to taste Christ; on one occasion, a sexually immoral priest could not find his Eucharist, which Blannbekin claimed to have felt in her own mouth. Similarly, she described drinking a [...] "refreshing spiritual drink" [...] from the spear wound of Jesus.

2500|$|Her 1977 {{appearance}} {{on the cover of}} Time magazine under the banner [...] "Torchy Rock" [...] was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock. At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear, Ronstadt hated the image of <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> projected to the world on that cover, and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image {{she did not want to}} project. In 2004, she was interviewed for CBS This Morning and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, [...] "Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her Svengali. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism's about." [...] Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a [...] "negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold". Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the Time cover did not appear to help the situation.|$|E

The motorist saw the parked car on a lovers' lane named Rich Road (now South Robison) near a railroad spur 100yards south of US Highway 67 West close to a nightspot called Club Dallas.
