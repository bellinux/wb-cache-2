40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{quantify}} small hive beetle (Aethina tumida Murray) and Cape honeybee (A. m. capensis Esch., an African subspecies) behaviours {{that are associated with}} beetle confinement in an effort to understand why Cape bees can withstand large beetle infestations. Four observation hives were each inoculated with 25 beetles and were observed for 11 - 17 days. Data collected included <b>guard</b> <b>bee</b> (worker bees who guard beetle confinement sites) and confined beetle behaviour. There was considerable colony variation for many bee and beetle behaviours. Overall, there were more beetle guards during evening, which was likely an effort to keep increasingly active beetles contained. About one-fifth of the beetles were found at the comb periphery although the colonies suffered no ill effects. Although beetles reached the combs, the bees were able to prevent beetle reproduction. Our data suggest that confinement is more likely an initial defence against invading beetles and not the sole reason African subspecies of honeybees are usually immune to beetle infestations while European bees are not...|$|E
40|$|When vespine wasps, Vespa velutina Lepeletier (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), hawk (capture) bees {{at their}} nest entrances alerted and poised guards of Apis cerana cerana F. and Apis mellifera ligustica Spinola (Hymenoptera: Apidae) have average {{thoracic}} temperatures slightly above 24 ° C. Many additional worker bees of A. cerana, but not A. mellifera, are recruited {{to augment the}} <b>guard</b> <b>bee</b> cohort and begin wing-shimmering and body-rocking, and the average thoracic temperature rises to 29. 8 ± 1. 6 ° C. If the wasps persist hawking, about 30 guard bees of A. cerana that have raised their thoracic temperatures to 31. 4 ± 0. 9 ° C strike out at a wasp and form a ball around it. Within about three minutes the core temperature of the heat-balling A. cerana guard bees reaches about 46 ° C, which is above the lethal limit of the wasps, which are therefore killed. Although guard bees of A. mellifera do not exhibit the serial behavioural and physiological changes of A. cerana, they may also heat-ball hawking wasps. Here, {{the differences in the}} sequence of changes in the behaviour and temperature during “resting” and “heat-balling” by A. cerana and A. mellifera are reported...|$|E
40|$|The hypopharyngeal gland (HPG) is the {{principal}} organ of protein synthesis in honey bees. It is involved in larval rearing. We examined the fresh head weight, HPG acini diameter, and HPG protein content in worker bees engaged in different tasks and under brood and broodless conditions. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the HPG acini diameter of worker bees was related to their task. The highest HPG volume was found in nurse bees, and the volume regressed when the task changed from guarding to foraging. The fresh head weight {{was positively correlated with}} HPG acini diameter. Although, there was no positive correlation between HPG acini diameter and protein concentration, the glandular protein concentration increased progressively in nurse bees and declined in guard and forager bees. Histochemistry revealed similar results. Despite displaying significantly larger glands, <b>guard</b> <b>bee</b> protein secretion was {{similar to that of the}} foragers. Brooding had a significant effect on HPG activity. Only worker bees from the colony with an intact brood showed elevated rates of protein synthesis; thus, it is possible that a signal was emitted by the brood, which stimulated protein synthesis in the HPG. However, the size of the HPG was similar in both brood and broodless conditions...|$|E

40|$|A. dorsata builds {{its large}} exposed comb high in trees or under ledges of high rocks. The "open" nest of A. dorsata, {{shielded}} (only!) by {{multiple layers of}} bees, is highly vulnerable {{to any kind of}} direct contact or close range attacks from predators. Therefore, <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> of the outer layer of A. dorsata's nest monitor the vicinity for possible hazards and an effective risk assessment is required. <b>Guard</b> <b>bees,</b> however, are frequently exposed to different objects like leaves, twigs and other tree litter passing the nest from above and falling to the ground. Thus, downward movement of objects past the nest might be used by A. dorsata to classify these visual stimuli near the nest as "harmless". To test the effect of movement direction on defensive responses, we used circular black discs that were moved down or up in front of colonies and recorded the number of <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> flying towards the disc. The size of the disc (diameter from 8 cm to 50 cm) had an effect on the number of <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> responding, the bigger the plate the more bees started from the nest. The direction of a disc's movement had a dramatic effect on the attraction. We found a significantly higher number of attacks, when discs were moved upwards compared to downward movements (GLMM (estimate ± s. e.) 1. 872 ± 0. 149, P < 0. 001). Our results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the vertical direction of movement of an object can be important for releasing defensive behaviour. Upward movement of dark objects near the colony might be an innate releaser of attack flights. At the same time, downward movement is perceived as a "harmless" stimulus...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{honeybee}} mandibular gland compounds {{is poorly}} understood, {{although they may}} act as alarm pheromones. We measured forager and <b>guard</b> <b>bee</b> antennal responses evoked by two major components of mandibular gland secretions of the Asiatic honeybee, Apis cerana. Membrane potentials of antennal sensilla were measured after exposure to three concentrations of the synthetic alarm pheromones 2 -heptanone and (Z) - 11 -eicosen- 1 -ol using a potentiostat (EA 161) connected to an e-corder (ED 401) with microelectrodes. The resting membrane potential of A. cerana foragers and guards was - 55. 23 Â± 1. 44 and - 56. 41 Â± 1. 21. mV, respectively. The membrane potential of foragers after exposure to 1. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 2 -heptanone was - 5. 32 Â± 0. 46, - 8. 41 Â± 1. 33 and - 11. 53 Â± 2. 16. mV, respectively. The membrane potential of guards was - 5. 49 Â± 1. 66, - 8. 46 Â± 1. 32 and - 7. 31 Â± 3. 46. mV, respectively. Exposure of foragers to 1. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 (Z) - 11 -eicosen- 1 -ol induced membrane potentials of - 24. 00 Â± 6. 56, - 36. 36 Â± 5. 18 and - 14. 60 Â± 8. 20. mV, respectively; for guards they were - 47. 62 Â± 1. 46, - 46. 08 Â± 0. 87 and - 9. 35 Â± 1. 96. mV, respectively. The highest membrane potential was found in foragers exposed to 1. 0 2 -heptanone. The membrane potentials of foragers were {{higher than that of}} guards except at the highest concentration (10. 0) of both pheromones. These findings suggest that antennal sensory receptors of foragers may have higher specific thresholds than those of guards.

In the first scenario, we assessed more than 700 bees in the mass release, comprising 2 - 3 per cent of colony members. We found the first evidence for intercolonial group defence in Apis dorsata, which means that colonies or parts of them, which were not directly threatened, joined the defence action of the threatened colony.

We aimed to determine whether honey <b>bee</b> <b>guards</b> can recognise predatory common wasps Vespula vulgaris and nestmates by olfactory cues. Odours were transferred between both honey bees and wasps and the responses of guards to controlled introductions monitored. When controlling for the species of introduced insect, the transferred odour was a predictor of aggressive attacks on both bees and wasps. Carriers of incongruous, allospecific odours were antennated by more guards than carriers of conspecific odours. Olfactory cues were, therefore, transferred and guards responded not only to odour per se but also odour incongruity. Olfactory cues may therefore be important in predator recognition by honey <b>bee</b> <b>guards...</b>|$|R
50|$|Within the nest, {{there is}} usually large {{entrance}} tube that can extend up to 35 cm. This entrance tube contains stalactite-like protuberances {{on the underside of}} the nest. Researcher observed the constant smoothness and roundness of the interior of the flight tube. This main entrance is sealed using a waxy resin substance to prevent intruders from entering at night. Depending on the weather, <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> will situate themselves in the inner margins of the nest entrance, or directly outside of it. The presence of an entrance tube is common in stingless bee nests and can be found in many species, such as tetragonisca angustula, to help protect the nest.|$|R

50|$|As the Vespine wasps {{approach}} {{the entrance to}} the honeybee nest, more <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> are alerted, which in turn increases their probability of being killed by heat-balling bees.

Alternatively, however, {{in the presence of a}} wasp, the bees may also just withdraw into their nests and await the heat-balling circumstances to develop naturally. Furthermore, other bees may just decide to fly away as an evasive measure in times of conflict, often altering their specific flight styles in order to avoid predation.|$|R

40|$|The {{pheromone}} {{ethyl oleate}} was recently discovered in honeybees and has offered researchers {{the opportunity to}} further understand how division of labor is managed in honeybee (Apis mellifera) societies. Biologists recognize two types of pheromones: Releaser pheromones, which elicit immediate responses from receiving animals, and primer pheromones, which cause long-term changes in behavior without immediate behavioral change. The pheromone ethyl oleate {{used in this study}} acts as a primer pheromone in honeybees. The behavior of <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> was examined after direct exposure to ethyl oleate, by recording the number of treated bees present in the hive. The number of bees present inside and outside the hive was recorded once daily for three days after exposure of <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> to ethyl oleate.

No significant difference was seen in the number of control and treatment bees present, indicating no behavioral change after exposure to ethyl oleate. However, a significant {{decline in the number of}} bees occurred over time, with the lowest number of bees recorded on the third day. More control bees were found inside and outside the hive during early summer, while more treatment bees were observed in late summer. In the future, tagging more bees, conducting the entire study early in the summer and spending more time observing and tracking bees in the hive would improve such studies. Improved delivery methods of ethyl oleate to the bees and a means to measure the concentrations of ethyl oleate in bees would also be helpful...|$|R
50|$|A. florea show highly {{specific}} social defense mechanisms when they sense predators nearby. For instance, they typically display hissing and shimmering behavior, {{in addition to}} nesting amidst dense foliage to camouflage themselves from potential predators. A more poignant example is the specific behavioral response they exhibit against their predominant predator, the O. smaragdina weaver ant. When these ants are in close proximity, the bees produce and deposit sticky barriers to obstruct their path. The <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> take cover at this sticky zone and start to alert other bees using specific hissing sounds {{with the goal of}} preventing full blown raids by the ants.

50|$|Aggression is {{commonly}} seen between conspecifics of all halictid bees; especially between usurper females, drawn out fights can occur that last {{for nearly a}} half-hour and result in damage to or loss of limbs and body parts. <b>Guard</b> <b>bees</b> of the L. malachurum species, which are workers that defend the nest, also demonstrate antagonistic behavior toward non-nestmate conspecifics, by orienting their stingers toward the intruders or blocking {{the entrance to the}} nest with their abdomens. They are able to discriminate between non-nestmates and nestmates, which they allow to pass with ease. Foragers, though, are either unable to discriminate between nestmate and non-nestmate conspecifics or are uninterested in pursuing aggression against non-nestmate conspecifics, so exhibit high levels of tolerance toward all conspecifics.|$|R

Ants can and do construct main nests with satellite nests, whereas bees construct only a main nest with no satellite nests.

Bees, on the other hand, cannot leave odor trails in the air, and hence are unable to identify bees from another nest; bees from another nest with different pheromone smells are stung to death by <b>guard</b> <b>bees</b> in the main nest.

However, where the European honey bee has been imported, Vespa velutina finds them easier prey than Apis cerana because Apis mellifera have not been subjected to selection for countering concentrated hawking by hornets.

50|$|Females {{in search}} of nesting sites are {{attracted}} to existing holes in wood materials where nests are usually formed. Upon arrival at a desirable site {{where there are no}} current inhabitants, the female will inspect the existing tunnel system extensively. If the hole is an occupied and guarded nest, the <b>guarding</b> <b>bee</b> will block the entrance. If not guarded, a resident of the nest will come to block the entrance if in the area by protruding their head from the hole. The stranger will hover around the hole for a brief period of time, and often the resident will attempt to chase the stranger away. If the intruder is able to bypass the resident bee at the entrance, a struggle will ensue accompanied by loud buzzing noises. These struggles can last up to a couple hours. Either the intruder is then thrown out, or will throw out the resident, at which point the process for a takeover occurs, beginning with the eviction of any existing brood. The benefits of guarding behavior can clearly be seen here as strangers hardly ever intrude on social nests containing more than one adult.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera) {{is one of}} {{the world}} most studied insects, the chemical compounds used in nestmate recognition, remains an open question. By exploiting the error prone recognition system of the honeybee, coupled with genotyping, we studied the correlation between cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile of returning foragers and acceptance or rejection behavior by guards. We revealed an average recognition error rate of 14 % across 3 study colonies, that is, allowing a non-nestmate colony entry, or preventing a nestmate from entry, which is lower than reported in previous studies.
