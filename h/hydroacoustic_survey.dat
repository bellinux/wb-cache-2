40|$|MaxDepth Aquatics, Inc. was {{contracted}} {{to conduct a}} <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> of macrophyte distribution in Diamond Lake in 2009. The survey essentially repeated surveys conducted in 2002 and 2007, allowing for a detailed assessment of conditions in 2009 and comparisons among previous years. In addition, Portland State University was {{contracted to}} conduct a depth stratified random point sample survey of macrophyte species presence and absence. The point sample survey was similar to surveys conducted in 2005 and 2007. The results of the 2009 <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> showed that macrophytes were widely distributed throughout the lake at depths less than 8 meters, although some shorter aggregations of macrophytes were found at depths down to 14 meters. Average canopy height corresponded closely to macrophyte density in 2009. The recent survey showed that macrophytes had extended deeper throughout the lake compared to 2002 and 2007 and that canopy height had increased substantially in some locations. The 2009 distribution showed that recolonization of the near shore areas was proceeding, albeit at a relatively slow pace since the lake drawdown completed in 2006. The maximum density of macrophytes in 2009 was found between 4 to 6 meters. Five macrophyte species, one macroalgal species, and filamentous algae {{were present in the}} 2009 random point survey. The occurrence rates of the macrophytes Elodea canadensis, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Potamogeton praelongus in 2009 were similar to 2005 and 2007 while Potamogeton pusillus occurrence increased and Myriophyllum verticillatum decreased. Macrophytes were present in a few samples greater than 9 meters; however, biomass, as measured by the fullness of a sampling rake, was highest between 2 and 6 meters. The comparison of the grab sampling conducted in August with the <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> in early September showed poor correspondence in macrophyte density obtained by the two methods. This is likely due to differences in spatial scales of collected samples (10 m 2 grid for hydroacoustics compared to 3 ̆c 1 m 2 grab samples), comparison of a continuous analytic tool (hydroacoustic) versus an ordinal ranking of density (rake), and possibly some changes in the macrophytes community between the two sampling dates...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydroacoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> are an {{important}} tool for assessing the abundance of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in lakes, the requirement for which is increasing because of new environmental legislation. Consequently, survey demand is now such that assessments must be undertaken with the minimum of effort compatible with scientific validity. One major complication is seasonal variability in abundance, with which surveyors have attempted to deal by defining somewhat arbitrary seasonal sampling windows. The definition of more objective windows was pursued by analysing variations in the seasonal abundance of Arctic charr in Windermere, UK, recorded using day and night <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> at monthly intervals from 1991 to 2001. Two alternative sampling windows for night surveys free of significant internal seasonal effects were revealed, i. e., December to September and September to December.

Here, we present an advanced methodology using data from splitbeam echosounder systems for analyzing gas release water depth (> 100 m).

We estimated the area of suitable quality spawning gravel at the current winter elevation (625. 1 m) and at the proposed winter elevation (626. 7 m). Gravels beneath the current winter elevation were generally characterized by a high percentage of fine sediments and a high degree of embeddedness. Of the total gravel available below the proposed elevation of 626. 7 m, only 15 % was available at current winter elevations.

40|$|During August 2002 we {{conducted}} a <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> to enumerate pelagic fish > 406 mm in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho. The purpose of this survey was to determine a collective lakewide biomass estimate of pelagic bull trout Salvelinus confluentus, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and lake trout S. namaycush and compare it to pelagic prey (kokanee salmon O. nerka) biomass. By developing hydroacoustic techniques to determine the pelagic predator to prey ratio, we can annually monitor their balance. Hydroacoustic surveys were also performed during December 2002 and February 2003 to investigate the effectiveness of autumn and winter surveys for pelagic predators. The inherent problem associated with hydroacoustic sampling is the inability to directly identify fish species. Therefore, we utilized sonic tracking techniques to describe rainbow trout and lake trout habitat use during our winter <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> to help identify fish targets from the hydroacoustic echograms. During August 2002 we estimated there were 39, 044 pelagic fish > 406 mm in Lake Pend Oreille (1. 84 f/ha). Based on temperature and depth utilization, two distinct groups of pelagic fish > 406 mm were located during August; one group was located between 10 and 35 m and the other between 40 and 70 m. The biomass for pelagic fish > 406 mm during August 2002 was 73 t (metric ton). This would account for a ratio of 1 kg of pelagic predator for every 2. 63 kg of kokanee prey, assuming all pelagic fish > 406 mm are predators. During our late fall and winter hydroacoustic surveys, pelagic fish > 406 mm were observed at lake depths between 20 and 90 m. During late fall and winter, we tracked three rainbow trout (168 habitat observations) and found that they mostly occupied pelagic areas and predominantly stayed within the top 10 m of the water column. During late fall (one lake trout) and winter (four lake trout), we found that lake trout (184 habitat observations) utilized benthic-nearshore areas 65 % {{of the time and}} were found in the pelagic area only 35 % of the time. Lake trout were found at depths between 10 and 90 m (average was approximately 30 m). Based on hydroacoustic surveys of pelagic fish > 406 mm and habitat use of sonic tagged rainbow trout and lake trout during late fall and winter, we conclude that hydroacoustic sampling during those times would be ineffective at acquiring an accurate pelagic predator population estimate and recommend conducting abundance estimates for pelagic predators when Lake Pend Oreille is thermally stratified (i. e.

40|$|When {{surveying}} {{demersal fish}} {{with a wide}} and variable vertical distribution, it is desirable to combine information from a bottom trawl survey with the information from a <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> into an absolute abundance estimate. To do this requires an estimate of either the amount of fish lost in the bottom acoustic deadzone or the amount of fish unavailable to the bottom trawl. In the latter case, this. quantity is not easily estimated using an hull-mounted transducer due to vertical movement between the moment a fish passes the acoustic beam and the moment it reaches the trawl. For such situations, we have examined an alternative procedure based on' an upward-looking, trawl-mounted acoustics system designed to directly measure the amount of fish passing above a 5;awl. This paper describes a pilot experiment for such measurements. To avoid disturbances of both fish behaviour and trawl geometry dueto a cable connection between the vessel and the trawl, the echo sounder, the data logging system (a portable PC) and the power supply were put in an underwater housing and mounted on the trawl together with the transducer.

40|$|Echo {{integration}} is an established method for stock estimation. However, {{this method is}} not free of errors like every other measuring method. Especially the variation between day and night behaviour of fish may lead to large measuring errors. A new method is represented detecting such systematic errors, exemplified by investigations during the international <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>survey</b> on the spring spawning herring in the Norwegian Sea. For this method all measured sA-values are sorted by starting time of the measuring unit distance. In order to reduce random influences a moving average over five time intervals is computed. When displaying these values in a diagram makes {{it is very easy}} to detect systematic errors based on the differences in day-night behaviour. For both species, herring and blue whiting, stock estimations are calculated based on the measured sA-values and the results of the analysed trawl catches. The influence of the differnt day and night behaviour of herring on the results of its biomass estimation is rather low. For blue whiting the measured values were about three time higher during day time than during night time. The result of this investigation should initiate a change of the evaluation procedure for stock estimation based on hydroacoustic measurements...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{gas bubble}} emissions at the Don-Kuban paleo-fan {{in the northeastern}} Black Sea regarding their geological setting, quantities as well as spatial and temporal variabilities during three ship expeditions between 2007 and 2011. About 600 bubble-induced hydroacoustic anomalies {{in the water column}} (flares) originating from the seafloor above the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) at ~ 700 m water depth were found. At about 890 m water depth a hydrocarbon seep area named "Kerch seep area" was newly discovered within the GHSZ. We propose locally domed sediments ('mounds') discovered during ultra-high resolution bathymetric mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to result from gas hydrate accumulation at shallow depths. In situ measurements indicated spatially limited temperature elevations in the shallow sediment likely induced by upward fluid flow which may confine the local GHSZ to a few meters below the seafloor. As a result, gas bubbles are suspected to migrate into near-surface sediments and to escape the seafloor through small-scale faults. <b>Hydroacoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> revealed that several flares originated from a seafloor area of about 1 km** 2 in size. The highest flare disappeared in about 350 m water depth, suggesting that the released methane remains in the water column. A methane flux estimate, combining data from visual quantifications during dives with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with results from ship-based <b>hydroacoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> and gas analysis revealed that between 2 and 87 x 10 ** 6 mol CH 4 yr- 1 escaped into the water column above the Kerch seep area. Our results show that the finding of the Kerch seep area represents a so far underestimated type of hydrocarbon seep, which has to be considered in methane budget calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of CEN standard pelagic nets to {{the assessment of}} fish communities is tested by comparing three metrics (species composition, species abundance, and size structures) measured {{in accordance with the}} standard (i. e. using benthic nets only) to those calculated from the total effort (i. e. including pelagic nets). <b>Hydroacoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> were used simultaneously to assess fish densities in the pelagic habitat. The results show that in most cases the pelagic nets did not provide any extra information about these three metrics. However, their inclusion in the calculation of CPUE and size structures may affect the picture of the fish communities, especially in lakes containing salmonid populations. This study highlights the need to sample pelagic fish when assessing fish communities in order to determine lake quality...|$|R

Trawl together with the lake-wide <b>Hydroacoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> give a reflection on the status of fish stocks in the lake to guide management decisions The National working group for bottom trawl surveys in Uganda undertakes these surveys within the Uganda sector of Lake Victoria. For the purpose of this survey, the Uganda sector of Lake Victoria is divided into three zones. A cruise lasting twenty days is conducted in two phases (two legs) 13 days covering Zones I and II and 7 days in Zone III...|$|R
