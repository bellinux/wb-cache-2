40|$|AbstractMembrane lectins were {{isolated}} from sheep, <b>goat,</b> <b>and</b> buffalo liver by chromatography on an asialofetuin (ASF) -Sepharose 4 B column. The lectins moved {{as a single}} protein band in SDS-PAGE with molecular masses of 42, 54 and 50 kDa, respectively, for sheep, <b>goat</b> <b>and</b> buffalo lectins. The molecular masses remained unchanged in 0. 2 M 2 -mercaptoethanol. As judged from the inhibition of binding of the lectin to ASF gel, the three lectins were β-galactoside-specific. Sheep, <b>goat</b> <b>and</b> buffalo lectins {{were found to be}} sialoglycoproteins containing 18. 6, 27 and 38. 8 mol/mol lectin of neutral hexose, respectively; the corresponding values for the sialic acid content being 5. 3, 8. 7 and 11. 8 mol/mol lectin. Thus <b>goat</b> <b>and</b> buffalo lectins are physico-chemically different from many mammalian hepatic lectins described so far...|$|R

5|$|Food {{production}} at Gedi likely involved a mixed economy based on livestock, {{as well as}} agricultural and horticultural production. Some foods were introduced through trade. Available crops included millet, African rice, cocoyam, coconuts, bananas, citrus fruits, pomegranates, figs, sugar cane, cotton, and various vegetables, while the principal livestock was likely cattle. Sheep, <b>goats,</b> <b>and</b> chickens {{played an important role}} as well.|$|E

Besides this, there were 24,890 pigs, 10,475 <b>goats</b> <b>and</b> 50,381 horses. The poultry flock totalled 8,736,547 birds, including 6,079,114 table birds (broilers).|$|E
5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, <b>goats,</b> <b>and</b> pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga, and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain <b>goats</b> <b>and</b> takin live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of <b>goats</b> <b>and</b> sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetically Capricornis {{is closer}} to <b>goats</b> <b>and</b> sheep than cattle. The {{nomenclature}} and status of Capricornis taxa are not completely resolved. Some researchers have considered Capricornis a junior synonym of Naemorhedus, a classification that includes gorals; molecular analysis has not supported this classification. Capricornis has a lower canine, which Naemorhedus species usually do not.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced <b>goats</b> <b>and</b> pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, the palace {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention.

It {{is estimated that}} around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed {{in the hands of}} villages, which paid an annual share to the palace. Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and <b>goats,</b> <b>and</b> 9,000 cattle.|$|E
