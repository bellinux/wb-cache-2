5|$|The opisthosoma {{consists}} of twelve or fewer segments that originally formed two groups, a mesosoma of seven segments and a metasoma of five, terminating with a telson or spike. The abdominal appendages of modern chelicerates are missing or heavily modified – {{for example in}} spiders the remaining appendages form spinnerets that <b>extrude</b> silk, while those of horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) form gills.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{primitive}} order and members do not <b>extrude</b> their stomach when feeding, lack an anus {{and have no}} suckers on their tube feet. Papulae are plentiful on their aboral surface and they possess marginal plates and paxillae. They mostly inhabit soft-bottomed areas of sand or mud.

5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to <b>extrude.</b> It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
40|$|One hundred-seventeen {{primiparous}} sows {{were used}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>extruded</b> sorghum grain and soybeans in lactation diets on sow and litter performance. The sows were fed a sorghum-soybean-based diet with the sorghum and soybeans <b>extruded</b> either singly or together. Treatments were: 1) ground sorghum-soybean meal (SBM) -soy oil-based control; 2) <b>extruded</b> sorghum-SBM-soy oil; 3) ground sorghum-extruded soybeans; and 4) sorghum and <b>extruded</b> soybeans blended then <b>extruded</b> together (<b>extruded</b> blend). All diets were formulated to. 80 % lysine,. 90 % Ca,. 80 % P, and 1. 47 Mcal ME/lb. Sows fed diets with <b>extruded</b> ingredients tended to wean more pigs with greater survivability and greater litter weight gains compared to sows fed the ground sorghum-SBM-based control diet. No differences occurred in sow weight or sow backfat loss. Sows fed <b>extruded</b> soybeans had decreased sow weight loss (14. 6 vs 29. 7 lb) compared with those fed <b>extruded</b> sorghum. Overall, improvements in litter weight gain were 6, 7, and 10 % for <b>extruded</b> sorghum, <b>extruded</b> soybeans, and the <b>extruded</b> blend, respectively, when compared to the ground sorghum- SBM-soy oil-based control. In conclusion, our data indicate that extrusion of ingredients for lactation diets improves sow and litter performance, and the greatest improvements were obtained by extrusion of blended soybeans and sorghum grain...|$|R

5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace. All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that <b>extrude</b> silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to <b>extrude</b> the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to <b>extrude</b> silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E

Extrusion was in an Insta-Pro extruder. All diets were formulated to be equal in concentrations of metabolizable energy (ME) and lysine. Pigs fed diets with <b>extruded</b> ingredients had improved F/G. Extrusion of sorghum and <b>extruded</b> soybeans together was of greater benefit than <b>extruding</b> those ingredients separately. Diets with <b>extruded</b> ingredients had greater digestibilities of DM and N, but fat thickness at the last rib was not affected by treatment.

5|$|Embedded in the {{calcareous}} skeleton are numerous microscopic polyps. They are connected internally {{by a system}} of canals and are concealed behind pores in the skeleton, the surface of which is smooth and lacks the corallites of true stony corals. The polyps have specialist functions, the gastrozooids processing and digesting the food caught by the dactylzooids which are grouped around them. The gastrozooids are small and plump and extend four to six tentacle stubs through their pores but are otherwise invisible. The dactylzooids have hairlike tentacles covered in cnidoblasts. Stings from the cnidocysts immobilize an item of prey and the tentacles thrust it through the mouth of an adjacent gastrozooid, from where it passes into the stomach for digestion. The polyps also <b>extrude</b> the coenosteum, the calcareous material of which the skeleton is composed. The coenosteum contains certain symbiotic microalgae called zooxanthellae. These are photosynthetic organisms which provide their hosts with energy and in return benefit from a protective environment in a well lit position. About 75% of the fire coral's energy requirements are provided by the zooxanthellae.|$|E
5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The seabed provides {{a range of}} habitats on or {{under the surface of}} the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they <b>extrude</b> build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live demersal fish that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E

Also, pigs fed sodium sulfite showed a trend for greater average daily gain (ADG) and F/G compared to pigs fed diets without sodium sulfite. The positive response to sodium sulfite continued into Phase II (d 14 to 28), where pigs fed sodium sulfite had greater ADG and ADFI compared to those not fed sodium sulfite. Pigs fed <b>extruded</b> soybeans in Phase II had greater ADG than pigs fed <b>extruded</b> SBM.

25|$|ABC {{transporters}} {{utilize the}} energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to transport various substrates across cellular membranes. They are divided into three main functional categories. In prokaryotes, importers mediate the uptake of nutrients into the cell. The substrates that can be transported include ions, amino acids, peptides, sugars, and other molecules that are mostly hydrophilic. The membrane-spanning region of the ABC transporter protects hydrophilic substrates from the lipids of the membrane bilayer thus providing a pathway across the cell membrane. Eukaryotes do not possess any importers. Exporters or effluxers, which are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, function as pumps that <b>extrude</b> toxins and drugs out of the cell. In gram-negative bacteria, exporters transport lipids and some polysaccharides from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The third subgroup of ABC proteins do not function as transporters, but are rather involved in translation and DNA repair processes.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{extrusion}}, {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to <b>extrude</b> the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.|$|E
