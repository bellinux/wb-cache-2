Doubling, a form of mechanical dot gain, contributes greatly to color variations while printing. Slur, another form of mechanical dot gain, is often confused with doubling.

40|$|Abstract—Differential {{microphone}} arrays (DMAs), due {{to their}} small size and enhanced directivity, are quite promising in speech enhancement applications. However, {{it is well known}} that differ-ential beamformers have the drawback of white noise amplifica-tion, which is a major issue in the processing of wideband signals such as speech. In this paper, we focus on the design of robust DMAs. Based on the Maclaurin’s series approximation and fre-quency-independent beampatterns, the robust first-, second-, and third-order DMAs are proposed by using more microphones than the order plus one, and the corresponding minimum-norm filters are derived. Compared to the traditional DMAs, the proposed de-signs are more robust with respect to white noise amplification while they are capable of achieving similar <b>directional</b> <b>gains.</b> Index Terms—Beamforming, beampattern, differential micro-phone arrays (DMAs), directivity factor, first-order DMA, robust DMAs, second-order DMA, third-order DMA, white noise gain.

In doing so, the array system offers more DOFs which means more sources can be resolved.

40|$|Microphone arrays have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest over the last few decades since they have the potential to solve many important problems such as noise reduction/speech enhancement, source separation, dereverberation, spatial sound recording, and source localization/tracking, to name a few. However, the design and implementation of microphone arrays with beamforming algorithms is not a trivial task when it comes to processing broadband signals such as speech. Indeed, in most sensor arrangements, the beamformer tends to have a frequency-dependent response. One exception, perhaps, is the family of differential microphone arrays (DMAs) that have the promise to form frequency-independent responses. Moreover, they have the potential to attain high <b>directional</b> <b>gains</b> with small and compact apertures. As a result, this type of microphone arrays has drawn much research and development attention recently.

40|$|Dot gain is a {{printing}} characteristic {{which has an}} effect on printing quality, if it is not controlled. It refers to the physical increase in size for a printed dot during the transfer process between the film and the printed sheet. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether varying squeeze pressure and blanket tension settings significantly affected <b>directional</b> dot <b>gain</b> (slur and doubling), therefore printing quality, using conventional and compressible types of offset lithographic blankets. The experiment was performed on the second unit of a two-color Heidelberg MOZP sheetfed offset lithographic press, bypassing the first unit. <b>Directional</b> dot <b>gain</b> was evaluated by density readings taken from four RIT Experimental Doubling Targets. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether statistically significant differences in dot gain values occurred.

The Fisher test determined that each of the squeeze pressure settings (. 006 in. and. 008 in. for conventional blankets,. 006 in. and. 012 in. for compressible blankets) contributed the most towards the difference in dot gain values, while the type of blanket and the different settings of squeeze pressure also contributed to dot gain. Visual examination of the press sheets revealed that <b>directional</b> dot <b>gain</b> occurred at the higher squeeze pressure settings for both conventional and compressible blankets. When both squeeze pressure and blanket tension settings increased, larger dot gain values were detected on conventional blankets. As blanket tension settings increased, dot gain decreased in compressible blankets, since the increased tension decreased the squeeze pressure, by thinning out the blanket. This trend was also noticed on the conventional blankets at the low squeeze pressure setting...|$|R

40|$|The paper proposes the {{development}} of an energy efficient multipath routing protocol with directional antenna for MANET as an optimization task as well as a multidisciplinary entity. A comprehensive analysis to link all the multi-disciplinary viewpoints involved in {{the development}} of desired multipath routing protocol with requisite technical details is presented in this paper. A simple and elegant mathematical formulation for the analysis of relative improvement of the performance metrics of ad-hocnetworks with omnidirectional and directional antenna is presented. Through extensive numerical simulations, the multi-dimensional desirable performance attributes of wireless link such as improvedrange, improved RSS, reduced RF transmit power and consequent reduced consumption of battery power have been analyzed keeping the <b>directional</b> <b>gain</b> of the antenna as a variable parameter. Development or modification of a protocol with concurrent focus on multipath routing with optimization of the batteryenergy is a significant step to increase the life time of MANET without recharging. Selection of the energy efficient path amongst several alternative ones is of paramount significance in the evaluation of overall performance of MANET system. A formulation to compute the required Battery Energy taking into account the data pertaining to the power efficiency of the associated transceiver design as well as the specified link performance parameters is also discussed. Through a case study involving the specifications of a typical transceiver operating in the 2. 4 GHz band, the desirable impact of higher gain of a directional antenna in the reduction of RF transmitter power is illustrated. The consequential reduced battery power consumption while still retaining the specified performance parameters of the adhoc network like range and Received Signal Strength (RSS) is also demonstrated. This paper also addresses the importance of alignment of beam peaks of directional antennas of a link and the quantification of additional RF power in lieu of Beam Pointing Angle (BPA) error in ad-hoc network. The profile of improved range with <b>directional</b> <b>gain</b> as an independent variable exhibits much sharper feature than an exponential function.

40|$|Delivering Gbps high user rate {{over long}} {{distances}} (around 1 km) is challenging, and the abundant spectrum available in millimeter wave band cannot solve the challenge {{by its own}} due to the severe path loss and other limitations. Since it is economically challenging to deploy wired backhaul every few hundred meters, relays (e. g., wireless access points) have been proposed to extend the coverage of a base station which has wired connection to the core network. These relays, deployed every few hundred meters, serve the users in their vicinity and are backhauled to the base station through wireless connections. In this work, the wireless relayed backhaul design has been formulated as a topology-bandwidth-power joint optimization problem, {{and the influence of}} path loss, angular spread, array size, and RF power limitation on the user rate has been evaluated. It has been shown that for a linear network deployed along the street at 28 GHz, when high joint <b>directional</b> <b>gain</b> (50 dBi) is available, 1 Gbps user rate within cell range of 1 km can be delivered using 1. 5 GHz of bandwidth (using single polarization antennas). The user rates drop precipitously when joint <b>directional</b> <b>gain</b> is reduced, or when the path loss is much more severe. When the number of RF chains is limited, the benefit of larger arrays will eventually be surpassed by the increased channel estimation penalty as the effective beamforming gain saturates owing to the channel angular spread.
