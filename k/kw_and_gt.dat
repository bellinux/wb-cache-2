40|$|The 2009 Annual Economic Report (AER) of the EU {{fishing fleet}} {{is the most}} recent {{compilation}} of statistics on the economic performance of EU member states (MS) fishing fleets. The economic data used in this publication is collected {{within the framework of}} the Data Collection Regulation (DCR); cf. Council Regulation (EC) No 1543 / 2000 of 29 June 2000. This report presents a detailed economic and structural overview of each MS fishing fleet. Economic performance projections for a number of EU fleet segments of key importance are included, as is the latest information on EU fish prices and price trends. Results suggest that the total income generated by the EU fishing fleet was around 7, 650 million euros in 2007, a marginal increase compared with previous years. While the number of vessels decreased in most MS between 2002 and 2007, fleet capacity, measured in <b>kW</b> <b>and</b> <b>GT,</b> decreased at a much slower pace. Employment in EU fisheries has also decreased significantly - in 2007 there was around 140, 000 fishers employed in the EU fish catching sector. Fishing effort also decreased in most MS fleets. Most fish prices improved between 2002 and 2007, which helped keep landings values steady in the face of declining landings volumes. Overall, the EU fishing fleet was profitable in 2007. Profitability, cash-flow and value added improved between 2002 and 2006. The data suggests that there was a slight downturn in economic performance in 2007 compared with previous years, particularly in the old MS. The outlook for 2008 and 2009 suggests deterioration in economic performance. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|E

40|$|Two new {{serological}} specificities {{were identified}} {{on the surface}} of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) -infected cells by direct and absorption immunofluorescence tests. Both antigens were detected with antisera prepared in rats that were growing transplants of syngenic MuLV-induced leukemias. Antigen GL was defined with the AKR leukemia K 36 as the test cell; antigen GT was defined with the W/Fu leukemia C 58 (NT) D as the test cell. GL <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> antigens were serologically and genetically independent of the MuLV-induced Gross and GIX cell-surface antigens. GL <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> antigens were found in normal lymphoid cells of mice from high-leukemic strains, but not in lymphoid tissues of mice from most low-leukemic strains. Tumors and leukemias of mice of low-leukemic strains often were GL <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> positive. Similarly, infection of normal cells with MuLV resulted in expression of GL <b>and</b> <b>GT.</b> With ferritin-labeled antibody the GL <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> antigens were observed on virus-free segments of the cell surface. Genetically, GL <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> antigens were each controlled by two dominant unlinked genes in AKR mice; these same antigens were each controlled by three or more dominant unlinked genes in C 58 mice. Penetrance of GL <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> regulatory genes was dependent upon the Fv- 1 genotype of the host. Expression of GL antigen was closely associated with virus production, whereas expression of GT antigen was less closely associated...|$|R

40|$|A set of 52 (CT) n <b>and</b> 23 (<b>GT)</b> n {{microsatellites}} in honeybee, 24 (CT) n <b>and</b> 2 (<b>GT)</b> n microsatellites in bumble-bee (n > 6) {{have been}} isolated from partial genomic libraries and sequenced. On average, (CT) n <b>and</b> (<b>GT)</b> n microsatellites occur every 15 kb and 34 kb in honeybee and every 40 kb and 500 kb in bumble-bee, respectively. The prevailing categories are imperfect repeats for (CT) n microsatellites in bumble-bee, and perfect repeats for both (CT) n <b>and</b> (<b>GT)</b> n microsatellites in honey-bee. Comparisons with data available in vertebrates indicate a lower proportion of perfect repeats in bees but length distributions {{are very similar}} regardless the phylum. This result extends to insects {{the concept of an}} evolutionary conservation for quantitative and qualitative characteristics of (CT) n <b>and</b> (<b>GT)</b> n microsatellites. Many (CT) n <b>and</b> (<b>GT)</b> n repeats are surrounded with various types of microsatellites, revealing an associative distribution of short repeat sequences. As expected, a high level of intrapopulational polymorphism has been found with one tested honeybee microsatellite. Also, flanking regions of this microsatellite are similar enough to allow PCR amplification in several other species of Apis and Bombus...|$|R
