In recent years, some irrigation water agencies (i. e., irrigation districts) have replaced deteriorating round gates with lower-cost rectangular gates that cover round holes. Similar to the situation described in a companion paper, where round gates were examined, {{there have been no}} investigations into flow measurement uncertainty using the existing rating tables for these gates. In this study, two commonly used rectangular gate sizes, 0. 46 m (18 -in.) and 0. 61 m (24 -in.), were tested under scenarios of various gate openings, upstream heads, and head differences.

40|$|Concentrations of {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) in runoff from catchments are often subject to substantial short term variations. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the spatial sources of DOC and the causes for short term variations in runoff from a forested catchment. Furthermore, we investigated the implication of short term variations for the calculation of annual runoff fluxes. High frequency measurements (30 min intervals) of DOC in runoff, of <b>discharge</b> and groundwater <b>table</b> were conducted for one year in the 4. 2 km 2 forested Lehstenbach catchment, Germany. Riparian wetland soils represent about 30 % of the catchment area. The quality of DOC was investigated by three dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrices in samples taken from runoff, deep groundwater and shallow groundwater from the riparian wetland soils. The concentrations of DOC in runoff were highly variable at an hourly to daily time scale, ranging from 2. 6 mg l− 1 to 34 mg l− 1 with an annual average of 9. 2 mg l− 1 . The concentrations were positively related to discharge, with a pronounced, counter clockwise hysteresis. Relations of DOC to discharge were steeper in the summer/fall than in the winter/spring season. Dynamics of groundwater <b>table,</b> <b>discharge,</b> DOC concentrations and DOC quality parameters indicated that DOC in runoff originated mainly from the riparian wetland soils, both under low and high flow conditions. The annual export of DOC from the catchment was 84 kg C ha− 1 yr− 1 when calculated from the high frequency measurements. If the annual export was calculated by simulated random fortnightly samplings, the range was 47 to 124 kg C ha− 1 yr− 1 . Calculations of DOC export fluxes might result in significant errors when based on infrequent (e. g. fortnightly) sampling intervals.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the fitting of hydrologic models to data. Most of this work has focused on simple, CPU-efficient, lumped hydrologic models using <b>discharge,</b> water <b>table</b> depth, soil moisture, or tracer data from relatively small river basins. In this paper, we focus on large-scale hydrologic modeling and analyze the effect of parameter and rainfall data uncertainty on simulated discharge dynamics with the global hydrologic model PCR-GLOBWB. We use three rainfall data products; the CFSR reanalysis, the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and a combined ERA- 40 reanalysis and CRU dataset. Parameter uncertainty is derived from Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) using monthly discharge data from five of the largest river systems in the world. Our results demonstrate that the default parameterization of PCR-GLOBWB, derived from global datasets, can be improved by calibrating the model against monthly discharge observations. Yet, it is difficult to find a single parameterization of PCR-GLOBWB that works well for all of the five river basins considered herein and shows consistent performance during both the calibration and evaluation period. Still there may be possibilities for regionalization based on catchment similarities. Our simulations illustrate that parameter uncertainty constitutes only a minor part of predictive uncertainty. Thus, the apparent dichotomy between simulations of global-scale hydrologic behavior and actual data cannot be resolved by simply increasing the model complexity of PCR-GLOBWB and resolving sub-grid processes. Instead, it would be more productive to improve the characterization of global rainfall amounts at spatial resolutions of 0. 5 ° and smaller...|$|R
40|$|<b>Discharge,</b> water <b>table</b> depth, {{and soil}} {{moisture}} content have been observed at a high spatial and temporal resolution in a 44 ha catchment in Costa Rica {{over a period of}} 5 months. On the basis of the observations in the first 3 months (period A), two distinct soil moisture models are identified and calibrated: a linear stochastic time-varying state-space model, and a geo-statistical model. Both models are defined at various spatial and temporal resolutions. For the subsequent period of 2 months (period B), four different ways to predict the soil moisture dynamics in the catchment are compared: (1) the application of the dynamic models in open-loop form; (2) a re-calibration of the dynamic models with soil moisture data in period B, and subsequent prediction in open-loop form; (3) prediction with the geo-statistical models, using the soil moisture data in period B; (4) prediction by combining the outcomes of (1) and (3) via generalized cross-validation. The last method, which is a form of data assimilation, compares favourably with the three alternatives. Over a range of resolutions, the predictions by data assimilation have overall uncertainties that are approximately half that of the other prediction methods and have a favourable error structure (i. e. close to Gaussian) over space as well as time. In addition, data assimilation gives optimal predictions at finer resolutions compared with the other methods. Compared with prediction with the models in open-loop form, both re-calibration with soil moisture observations and data assimilation result in enhanced discharge predictions, whereas the prediction of ground water depths is not improve...|$|R
40|$|The Mw = 6. 3 L'Aquila {{earthquake}} on 6 April 2009 {{produced a}} mainshock that caused {{significant changes in}} the hydrogeology of the Gran Sasso carbonate fractured aquifer: (i) the sudden disappearance {{at the time of the}} mainshock of some springs located exactly along the surface trace of the Paganica normal fault (PF); (ii) an immediate increase in the discharge of the Gran Sasso highway tunnel drainages and of other springs and (iii) a progressive increase of the water table elevation at the boundary of the Gran Sasso aquifer during the following months. Using the data collected since the 1990 s that include aftershock monitoring as well as data regarding spring <b>discharge,</b> water <b>table</b> elevations, turbidity and rainfall events, a conceptual model of the earthquake's consequences on the Gran Sasso aquifer is proposed herein. In this model that excludes the contribution of seasonal recharge, the short-term hydrologic effects registered immediately after the mainshock are determined to have been caused by a pore pressure increase related to aquifer deformation. Mid-term effects observed in the months following the mainshock suggest that there was a change in groundwater hydrodynamics. Supplementary groundwater that flows towards aquifer boundaries and springs in discharge areas reflects a possible increase in hydraulic conductivity in the recharge area, nearby the earthquake fault zone. This increase can be attributed to fracture clearing and/or dilatancy. Simulations by numerical modelling, related to pore pressure and permeability changes with time, show results in accordance with observed field data, supporting the conceptual model and confirming the processes that influenced the answer of the Gran Sasso aquifer to the L'Aquila earthquake.

However, raised bogs are often characterized by a pronounced surface topography, causing large changes in connectivity of contributing areas on the bog. In this study, daily regression of measured discharges versus catchment areas is used to quantify the impact of surface topography on catchment connectivity within a raised bog. The resulting coefficient of determination shows {{the strength of the}} relationship between the discharge and catchment area over time under different hydrological conditions. Monitoring of <b>discharge,</b> water <b>table,</b> transmissivity, and basic weather data on a raised bog (1. 9 km 2) in eastern central Estonia took place from May 2008 to June 2010. Contributing areas, calculated based on the outlet's discharge volume (V Q) divided by the net precipitation volume (VPnet), of the outlet containing the central pool-ridge system varied between 1 × 10 - 3 and 0. 7 km 2, suggesting significant differences in connectivity between hydrological events. Correlation between discharge and theoretical catchment size was high (R 2 > 0. 75) when the water table was close to the surface (less than 5 cm below peat surface), and consequently, transmissivities were also high (up to 1, 030 m 2 d - 1), which led to connectivity of local storage elements, such as pools and hollows. However, a water table below this threshold resulted in large parts of the catchment being disconnected. The importance of water table depths on catchment connectivity suggests the need to reconsider the hydrological concept of raised bogs; to incorporate these shallow flow components and better understand residence time and consequently transport of solutes, such as DOC, from patterned peatlands. </p...|$|R

Two analytical solutions exist for early- and late-time drainage from a saturated, homogeneous, and horizontal aquifer following instantaneous drawdown. The solutions for discharge Q can be expressed as dQ/dt = −aQ [superscript b], where a is constant and b takes on the value 3 and 3 / 2 for early and late time, respectively. Though many factors can contribute to departures from the two predictions, we explore the effect of having permeability decrease with depth, as it is known that many natural soils exhibit this characteristic. We derive a new set of analytical solutions to the Boussinesq equation for k ∝ z [superscript n], where k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity, z is the height above an impermeable base, and n is a constant.

Soil hydrology is a dominant ecosystem {{control in the}} PCTR, affecting soil formation, vegetation distribution, biogeochemical cycling, and carbon storage. Despite the importance of soil hydrology to the ecosystem, {{there have been few}} studies investigating water table dynamics and runoff generation in the PCTR. In this study, we applied two methods to investigate this interaction across a replicated set of three common sub-catchment types spanning a range of landscape units. Over the summer and fall of 2013 we monitored sub-catchment <b>discharge,</b> water <b>table</b> position, and precipitation in order to measure catchment moisture balance and the interaction between water table and runoff. There was a strong non-linear response in the wet soil catchments (fen and forested wetland), with > 80 % of runoff occurring above a threshold water table position. The hydrology of the upland sites appears to be controlled by shallow rock horizons. Despite cool summertime temperatures and frequent precipitation, catchments experience a moisture deficit during the summer months that is reflected in the water table positions and catchment runoff ratios. Because of the strong dependence of runoff on water table position, changes in seasonal moisture balance that affect the water table have the potential to cause large, non-linear changes in runoff generation and biogeochemical cycling. We also made use of an existing five year dataset from the same catchments to model catchment storage / discharge relationships as ordinary, non-linear, first-order differential equations. Performance of the models varied across sub-catchments, simulating discharge reasonably well in some (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency 0. 20 - 0. 45) and poorly in others (Nash-Sutcliffe < 0).

This work analyzes how the tidal flow determines the hydrodynamics and salinity of surface water and groundwater at different depths in the intertidal wetland located in the marsh of the Ajó River. Water level and salinity measurements {{were obtained from the}} Ajó River, the channels discharging into the river and the phreatic aquifer. The results in the natural marsh indicate the presence of saline stratification and that the surface water–groundwater relationship varies with the tide. At low tide, the water <b>table</b> <b>discharges</b> into the surface watercourses, and when the high tide rises above the regional groundwater discharge level, the tidal flow contributes to the water table, which causes an increase in salinity in surface water and groundwater.

In the marsh areas excluded from the tidal cycle due to the presence of floodgates, the water <b>table</b> always <b>discharges</b> into the canals, and in the surface water and groundwater there is no presence of saline stratification.

Short- and mid-term effects have been observed in the groundwater flow at recharge and discharge areas. The following short-term effects have been observed: i) the sudden disappearance of some springs located along the surface trace of the Paganica Fault; ii) an immediate discharge increase of the Gran Sasso highway tunnel drainages (+ 20 %) and of other springs (+ 10 %); iii) a progressive increase of the water table elevation (+ 1 m) at the boundary of the Gran Sasso aquifer during the following month; iv) a sudden lowering of the water table in the recharge area. Similar post-seismic effects have been recorded in the following 20 months, when spring <b>discharge</b> and water <b>table</b> remain higher than the pre-seismic ones in discharge zones. A conceptual model of the earthquake consequences on the Gran Sasso aquifer is proposed herein. The short-term hydrologic effects registered immediately after the mainshock have been caused by a pore pressure increase related to elasto-static aquifer deformation. Apart from the contribution of seasonal recharge observed in 2009 - 10, mid-term effects observed in the 20 months following the mainshock suggest that there was a change in groundwater hydrodynamics. Supplementary groundwater that flows toward aquifer boundaries and springs in discharge areas reflects a possible increase in hydraulic conductivity in the recharge area. This increase is probably related to fracture cleaning and/or dilatancy. Additional monitoring including hydrochemical data allows a refinement of the proposed model. The outcomes of the hydrochemical spot sampling of the pre-seismic (2001 - 2007), post-seismic (April 2009) and after-seismic (July and September 2009, may 2010) periods, give the following insights: i) post-seismic groundwater of Tempera spring group was more mineralised and richer in Rn- 222 than the pre-seismic one; ii) transient changes in pH and calcite saturation index involve the whole aquifer, moving from Tempera springs and spreading from the recharge to discharge areas, causing changes in groundwater hydrochemistry; iii) post-seismic gradual return to previous hydrochemical equilibrium. Both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical observation converge towards a non-permanent increase of the bulk hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer portion close to the Paganica Fault (recharge area and local discharge zone). This fact has caused a lowering of the water table and of the calcite saturation index in recharge areas and simultaneously an increase of water table and flow rate in discharge zones. Complete interpretation of both quantitative and hydrochemical data allows to determine the long-term consequences of this earthquake on the groundwater flow of the Gran Sasso carbonate massif...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin and}} {{movement}} of groundwater are the fundamental questions that address both the {{temporal and spatial}} aspects of ground water run and water supply related issues in hydrological systems. As groundwater flows through an aquifer, its composition and temperature may variation dependent on the aquifer condition through which it flows. Thus, hydrologic investigations can also provide useful information about the subsurface geology of a region. But because such studies investigate processes that follow under the Earth's shallow, obtaining the information necessary {{to answer these questions}} is not continuously easy. Springs, which <b>discharge</b> groundwater <b>table</b> directly, afford to study subsurface hydrogeological processes. The present study of estimation of aquifer factors such as transmissivity (T) and storativity (S) are vital for the evaluation of groundwater resources. There are several methods to estimate the accurate aquifer parameters (i. e. hydrograph analysis, pumping test, etc.). In initial days, these parameters are projected either by means of in-situ test or execution test on aquifer well samples carried in the laboratory. The simultaneous information on the hydraulic behavior of the well (borehole) that provides on this method, the reservoir and the reservoir boundaries, are important for efficient aquifer and well data management and analysis. The most common in-situ test is pumping test performed on wells, which involves the measurement of the fall and increase of groundwater level with respect to time. The alteration in groundwater level (drawdown/recovery) is caused due to pumping of water from the well. Theis (1935) was first to propose method to evaluate aquifer parameters from the pumping test on a bore well in a confined aquifer. It is essential to know the transmissivity (T = Kb, where b is the aquifer thickness; pumping flow rate, Q = TW (dh/dl) flow through an aquifer) and storativity (confined aquifer: S = bSs, unconfined: S = Sy), for the characterization of the aquifer parameters in an unknown area so as to predict the rate of drawdown of the groundwater table/potentiometric surface throughout the pumping test of an aquifer. The determination of aquifer's parameters is an important basis for groundwater resources evaluation, numerical simulation, development and protection as well as scientific management. For determining aquifer's parameters, pumping test is a main method. A case study shows that these techniques have been fast speed and high correctness. The results of parameter's determination are optimized so that it has important applied value for scientific research and geology engineering preparation...|$|R
40|$|Modeling is {{a common}} {{practice}} to evaluate factors affecting water quality in environmental systems impaired by point and nonpoint losses of N and P. Nevertheless, in situations with inadequate information, such as ungauged basins, a balance between model complexity and data availability is necessary. In this paper, we applied a simplified analytical model to an artificially drained floodplain in central-western Italy to evaluate the importance of different nutrient sources and in-stream retention processes and to identify critical source areas. We first considered only a set of chemical concentrations in water measured from February through May 2008 and from November 2008 through February 2009. We then broadened available data to include water discharge and hydraulic-head measurements to construct a hydrogeological model using MODFLOW- 2000 and to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} simplified method. The simplified model provided acceptable estimates of discharge (ranging from 0. 03 – 0. 75 m 3 s- 1) and diffuse nutrient inputs from water <b>table</b> <b>discharge</b> and in-stream retention phenomena. Estimates of PO 4 –P and total P retention (ranging from 1. 0 to 0. 6 mg m- 2 s- 1 and from 1. 18 to 0. 95 mg m- 2 s- 1 for PO 4 –P and total P, respectively) were consistent with the range of variability in literature data. In contrast, the higher temporal variability of nitrate concentrations decreased model accuracy, suggesting the need for more intensive monitoring. The model also separated the dynamics of different reaches of the drainage network and identified zones considered critical source areas and buffer zones where pollutant transport is reduced...|$|R
