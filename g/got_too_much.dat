Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, consequently resulting in them hanging off of {{the sides of the}} boats and being fractured during collisions.|$|E
25|$|When Livingstone {{returned}} in 1853 to the Makololo's capital, Linyati, {{he found out}} that only shortly after her father's death she had stepped down in favour of her brother Sekeletu, who became a new king. In Livingstone's account the reason was her desire to have a stable husband and a family that was firmly hers, while as a ruler she was forced to alternate many husbands so that none <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, Westwood contested {{a playoff}} at the BMW PGA Championship with fellow Englishman {{and at the}} time world number two Luke Donald. On the par five 18th, Donald hit his {{approach}} shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> backspin on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E

500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of news to me. Here's what I would say to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".|$|E
500|$|Several years later, Dibnah and {{his family}} went on holiday, to Blackpool. The trip was filmed for {{television}} and showed Dibnah's preference for working rather than holidaying. He did however manage to undertake the removal of a small chimney stack from a business in the town, under a distinctly grey sky and aided by his wife, Alison. His payment for the job was a new front plate for the boiler of his traction engine. Dibnah, however, refused to take any more holidays and, after 18years of marriage, Alison booked and paid for a holiday to Greece, taking their three children (Jayne, Lorna and Caroline) with her. Dibnah remained at home and was surprised when, upon her return, she asked for a divorce. One day in October 1985, Dibnah attended a solid fuel exhibition in nearby Bury. Upon his return he discovered that Alison had left the house, taking with her their three children, the dog and some items of furniture. Short of money, {{he was forced to}} sell his antique AJS motorcycle. He found life without his family difficult but defended his wife: [...] "There is no doubt whatsoever, she were a good help to me and I'm going to miss her. It was just that all the pressure <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for her." ...|$|E

500|$|Nurmi {{felt that}} he <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman, but his {{interest}} in running never died. He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in {{a benefit for the}} victims of the Greek Civil War. Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club. In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: [...] "The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'" [...] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something. Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala. He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.|$|E
500|$|The telepathic mutant {{leader and}} founder of the X-Men. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in {{humanity}} create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got an ego and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E

5000|$|Squire later {{commented on}} {{his reasons for}} ending the band that [...] "I thought 'This sounds shit, we don't deserve {{to be in this}} place.' The band sounded complacent.

Colin Milburn scored a thrilling 94 on debut then 126 at Lords but his career was tragically curtailed by a car {{accident}} in which he lost an eye. [...] Ken Barrington was given a thorough working over by Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith and was left out after two matches when the strain <b>got</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> [...] Derek Underwood was hit in the teeth by Charlie Griffith when the West Indies needed just one wicket to win. [...] Basil Butcher scored 209 at Trent Bridge. [...] Cowdrey was replaced by the battling Brian Close as captain at the Oval and the indefategable Yorkshireman led his team from the front to an innings victory.
