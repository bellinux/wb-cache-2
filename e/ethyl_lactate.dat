50|$|Shampoo {{intended}} for animals may contain insecticides or other medications {{for treatment of}} skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special {{care must be taken}} not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended {{to do more than just}} clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas.The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, povidone iodine, triclosan, <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate,</b> or sulfur.Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos.Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.|$|E

However, COSMO-RS analysis showed a higher solubility of alpha-mangostin in <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate,</b> DMC, MeTHF, ethyl acetate and ethanol. Moreover, the experimental studies using a classical reflux extraction followed by a quantitative HPLC analysis of alpha-mangostin showed similar results to the predictive values from the COSMO-RS model. The alpha-mangostin levels extracted by <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate,</b> DMC, MeTHF, ethyl acetate and ethanol were higher than those using dichloromethane and D-limonene. The results support the potential use of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate,</b> DMC, MeTHF, and ethanol as alternative green solvents for the preparation of alpha-mangostin extracts...|$|E

Furthermore, its potential use as a solvent in chemical reactions which could be performed in supercritical media and as an effective cosolvent in supercritical extraction processes and/or in antisolvent precipitation processes has also been studied. In view of this, knowledge of the phase behavior of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> + CO 2 binary is vital for the modeling and design of such processes. In this work, data on the solubility of CO 2 in the <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> rich liquid phase at T = (311, 318, and 323) K and pressures ranging from (1 to 8. 1) MPa is reported for the first time. The compositions of the liquid phase were measured using a variable volume view equilibrium cell. The new data measured together with previously reported data on the solubility of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> in CO 2 were employed to explore the capabilities of two different thermodynamic models, namely, the cubic Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state (SRK-EoS) and the group contribution EoS (GC-EoS), to represent the phase equilibria of the binary <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> + CO 2 mixture. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the effect of}} combined membrane separation and heterogeneous catalysts {{for the production of}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> solvent. The enhanced process is a flat sheet cellulose acetate membrane and cation-exchange resin catalysts. A methodology based on catalyst and acetate membrane impregnation {{in the presence of a}} sweep gas at low pressure with the aim of obtaining a higher yield of the ester product have been developed. The esterification reaction was carried out at the temperature of 60 °C. The ester product gave a percentage yield of up to 75 %. The ion chromatogram of the ester product obtained in the catalyst and membrane impregnation was compared with the esterification product of the batch esterification reaction. The gas chromatograph NIST library spectra of the ester product indicated the structure of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> (45) on the mass spectra which was in accordance with the commercial <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate.</b> Products obtained on dowex 50 W 8 x and amberlyst 36 resin catalysts were found to elute faster at 1. 503 and 1. 527 min respectively in contrast to those using amberlyst 15 and amberlyst 16. In all, the percentage yield of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> can be improved using cellulose acetate membrane. Amberlyst 36 and dowex 50 W 8 x cation-exchange resins were revealed as the most effective catalysts for the esterification process involving lactic and ethanol to produce <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> in contrast to other cation-exchange resins that were used in the study. The results further confirms effectiveness of cellulose acetate membrane in the selective removal of the water from the esterification product. PTDF (PTDF/ED/OSS/POF/ 819 / 16...|$|E

A kind {{of solid}} acid (sulfated zirconia) was {{proposed}} {{to be used}} as the catalyst for the hydrolysis of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> because esterification-hydrolysis was usually applied to produce lactic acid of high purity. The sulfated zirconia was prepared via a simple chemical precipitation and impregnation approach. The prepared catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, TG-DSC, FT-IR, and NH 3 -TPD. Catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was evaluated by the hydrolysis reaction of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate.</b> The characterization results showed that the prepared sulfated zirconia was of tetragonal phase at the optimum calcination temperature of 650 °C and had strong acidity. The conversion of hydrolysis of <b>ethyl</b> <b>lactate</b> using the prepared catalyst was 82. 62 %. Although the conversion was lower than that of liquid acid (p-toluenesulfonicacid), the solid acid catalyst was easier to be separated from the products. It resolved the problems of pollution and catalyst reuse. This work might provide a new green process for producing lactic acid of high purity...|$|E
