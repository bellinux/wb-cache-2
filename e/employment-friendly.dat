40|$|The {{transition}} to post-industrialism has generated {{a range of}} new tensions between welfare arrangements and labour market performance, which con-front today’s welfare states with new challenges for <b>employment-friendly</b> reca-libration, such as flexicurity, activation and work-care conciliation. Hence, the question of whether, how {{and to what extent}} current welfare states are able to adapt to the conditions and needs of post-industrial labour markets has become a major issue in recent welfare state research. This article identifies and discusses key debates in this literature on the politics of <b>employment-friendly</b> reforms. It first focuses on the general capacity for reform in mature welfare states and then discusses regime-specific reform politics, since post-industrialism confronts different welfare regimes with very different challenges. For each regime, the article proposes a range of research frontiers and open debates which we consider particularly relevant and fruitful avenues for future theorizing and research...|$|E
40|$|We use {{input-output}} {{techniques to}} assess the contribution of patterns of final demand and consumption to the differing employment rates observed across six industrialized economies. The key concept utilised is the employment generated economy-wide in supplying each product or service to final demand, including all stages in the supply chain - {{the concept of the}} ëvertically integrated sectorí (VIS). The main conclusions are: (1) On a VIS basis the relative employment-friendliness of demand in individual sectors remains fairly constant over time within countries and fairly similar across countries. The European economies are rather more similar to each other than to the US. (2) The employment-intensities of services and manufacturing are broadly equal, when measured on a VIS basis. (3) Final demands originating in both manufacturing and services are increasingly generating jobs located in services. (4) The changing patterns of final demand have been significantly <b>employment-friendly</b> in the European economies, but employment-neutral in the US. The final demand mixes of the European economies are more <b>employment-friendly</b> than the US pattern. The demand mixes of all the European countries would raise US employment, while the US mix would result in lower employment in the European economies. (5) The changing mix of consumption has been significantly less <b>employment-friendly</b> than final demand, and only a minor source of employment growth within each economy. The European consumption patterns tend to be less <b>employment-friendly</b> than that of the US. The consumption patterns of France and Germany would reduce US employment by 3 - 5 % respectively, while those of the UK and Spain would have little effect. Conversely, if the US consumption mix were adopted in the European economies employment there would be 2 - 4 % higher. (6) Demand growth has been the major source of employment growth, offset by job losses through labour productivity gains. Structural change along the supply chain, including outsourcing, both creates and destroys jobs, with only a small net effect. In the US stronger demand growth has brought more job creation, while weaker productivity gains have been less job-destroying than in the European economies. These are the major factors, which have opened up the employment gap. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} {{common to}} the various chapters of this book is whether and how the European Union (EU) has contributed to <b>employment-friendly</b> welfare reforms. In order to investigate the mechanisms which cause the various EU initiatives to matter at the national level, we have chosen {{to concentrate on the}} national ‘usages of Europe’ (see Graziano, Jacquot and Palier, introduction to this volume; and for a general presentation of this analytical approach see Woll and Jacquot, 2010).

30|$|These general <b>employment-friendly</b> {{policies}} {{can have}} particularly beneficial effects on demographic groups seeking {{access to the}} labour market {{at a young age}} or when re-entering the labour market after a phase of unemployment or inactivity. Therefore, it can be stated that universal policies can have a particular impact on certain groups. Regarding active labour market policies, one can argue in a more generalised fashion that many active labour market policy schemes can be targeted flexibly to address the employment obstacles of target groups identifiable in the national context, with age representing just one parameter among others here. In particular, ALMPs can help to make jobseekers more attractive to potential employers by reducing labour costs in the initial phase of employment or by raising productivity via skills upgrading.|$|E
30|$|With {{conventional}} caution, {{some potential}} economic policy implications {{can be drawn}} from these results. Firstly, policy makers should take into account that even if higher social security contributions have a limited effect on employment in the long run, these are not entirely negligible, especially in the short run. This fact poses limits to strengthening social protection systems via higher revenues. Secondly, intermediate results pointed to significant employment gains from a revenue-neutral tax reform, increasing consumption taxes and lowering labour taxes. Obviously, this tax shift might also involve some problematic aspects, namely a short-term inflationary effect and a change in income distribution, which should be evaluated. Finally, our estimates support that taxation in Nordic economies, characterized by a high coordination of wage bargaining and effective public sectors, is more <b>employment-friendly.</b>|$|E
30|$|A final {{observation}} is that, in Tunisia, the SIVP {{is not used}} as a countercyclical tool, but rather as an instrument to try and tackle (or at least alleviate) a persistent and structural unemployment problem. It has been in place, {{in one form or}} another, continuously since 1987, and benefits a very large portion of graduates (nearly half). This raises yet another question about its effectiveness: while the literature has shown that temporary wage subsidies to tackle cyclical unemployment can be highly effective, and while {{it is likely that the}} SIVP alleviates at least some of the problem, it is not (and cannot be seen) as a long-term and durable solution to the unemployment problem in Tunisia. For that, <b>employment-friendly</b> growth will be required, as well as more structural reforms of the labour market.|$|E

It argues that distortions and rigidities in the labor market can aggravate macroeconomic imbalance and create impediments in the way of their adjustment. It also argues that the initial system of economic incentives and institutions and the composition of adjustment policies determine what kind of impact adjustment has on employment. A comparison of the experience of a group of South Asian countries with that of a group of East and Southeast Asian countries provides useful insights into the kind of labor market policies and institutions that are most conducive to the avoidance of macroeconomic imbalance and to the rapid adjustment of the imbalances that occur. This comparison also helps identify guidelines for the design of <b>employment-friendly</b> adjustment...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the 1990 s, {{international}} organisations, {{such as the}} International Monetary Fund mainly {{based their}} policy proposals for transition economies and the high unemployment, low growth countries in Western Europe, on economic “orthodoxy”. This approach predominantly followed neoclassical economics in which market liberal solutions predominate. These suggestions were controversial; the early results of these policies appeared to be disappointing. Policymakers sought alternative reform proposals {{and the idea of}} “flexicurity ” has gradually emerged to the political buzzword. Flexicurity combines flexibility with security and suggests that rather generous unemployment benefits and spending on active labour market policies can be aligned with a flexible, <b>employment-friendly</b> labour market. Originating in Denmark, the European Commission and the International Labour Organisation have promoted flexicurity more or less independent of specific single country cases, and based their approach on more abstract, generalised relationships between flexibility and security.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, EU {{institutions}} have been increasingly concerned with the issues of unemployment reduction and job creation. The EU has recommended that member states develop welfare systems that moderate {{the negative effects of}} market relationships on the one hand, and enhance the efficiency of market performance on the other. This paper provides an overview of labour market policies to protect individuals from unemployment. It shows that in the context of EMU and EU enlargement, policies such as unemployment insurance could improve welfare, {{to the extent that it}} encourages labour mobility, but has negative effects on individuals’ job search efforts. To counter welfare and inactivity traps, member state governments are asked to reform benefit and tax systems towards more <b>employment-friendly</b> policies. Further, the effect of population ageing on the labour force is considered, along with options to sustain labour force supply and state pension provision. The paper concludes that measures to expand the range and quality of employment opportunities available to older workers will become increasingly important and that governments will have an important educational and coordinating role to play in facilitating these adjustments. ...|$|E
40|$|Our paper charts the {{evolution}} of labour market and welfare policy in the UK since the mid- 1990 s, {{with the aim of}} gauging the impact and influence of European level policy initiatives on the policymaking process. Our main focus is on the ‘welfare to work ’ agenda developed by the Labour government after 1997, a programme of changes to labour market regulation, social benefits, and labour activation institutions which in many interesting ways parallels the agenda of the European Employment Strategy. By analyzing the political context and discursive presentation of UK policy changes, we are able to make two paradoxical findings. On the one hand, recent policy in the UK has been remarkably in line with European initiatives to make the welfare state more <b>employment-friendly,</b> whilst at the same time strengthening egalitarian distributive policies. On the other, these policy changes have avoided evoking European initiatives at all costs, and indeed have drawn on other European experiences as a ‘counter-model ’ against which UK policy has been framed. The contradictory result of these developments is that Britain has converged substantially with other European countries ’ welfare arrangements whilst rejecting Europe as a source of ‘political cover ’ for welfare reform...|$|E
40|$|In Esping-Andersen’s {{influential}} work {{on three}} worlds of welfare capitalism, decommodification appears {{as the central}} characteristic of the welfare state, and efforts to de-commodify labor are posited {{to be the main}} goal of social democracy. Since decommodification is defined as exit from the labor market with little or no loss of income, social democrats ’ emphasis on decommodification clashes with another purported goal of social democracy, high labor force participation. Drawing on research demonstrating the divergent employment effects of various decommodifying social policies, we resolve the existing paradox by showing that social democratic parties are supportive of decommodifying social policies insofar as these policies do not reduce aggregate levels of employment. Pooled time series analysis of employment-impeding policies (long-term unemployment replacement rate, social security and payroll taxes, and employment protection) suggests that they are associated with Christian democracy rather than social democracy. Instead, we find that social democracy is a key determinant of <b>employment-friendly</b> policies, such as active labor market spending and short-term unemployment replacement rate. Given the radically divergent employment effects of different types of decommodifying social policies and the importance of employmentfriendly policies for the viability of generous welfare states, our analysis serves to further underline the future viability of the social democratic mode...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Finnish experiences of Active Labour Market Policy (ALMP) across the economic cycle, especially in economic downturn. Cuts in unemployment spell duration {{have been the}} main factors to contribute in decreasing the unemployment in the recent years. Subsidised employment programmes have clearly a stronger countercyclical character than Labour Market Training programmes. Evidence on effectiveness of LMP states that employment services are of high quality and have positive effectiveness, the main LMP programmes have usually positive, but relatively small effectiveness {{with the exception of}} public sector employment programmes which have poor effectiveness. The employment obligations of the late 1980 s and too high a volume of LMP programmes in the recession of the 1990 s are examples of bad lessons. On the other hand, a more coherent LMP strategy with emphasis on the dynamics and prevention-oriented policy is a good lesson as is also the strategy to prepare for the ageing and scarcity of the labour force. LMP is not originally developed for economic downturn, but it can help to create a more <b>employment-friendly</b> economic policy by taking care of the functioning of the labour market and the availability of the labour when demand for it recovers. In downturn, the volume of LMP can be increased to create more dynamics to unemployment, but the selectivity should not be destroyed. Labour Market Policy, economic downturn...|$|E
40|$|What {{explains}} {{the shift from}} the moderate to high inflation rates of the Golden Age of post-war capitalism to the low inflation regime of monetarism in the 1970 s and 1980 s? Conventional views emphasise the rise of monetarism as a new economic paradigm that convinced policy makers to delegate monetary policy to conservative and independent central banks – a view that comes in many variants, from constructivist to orthodox economics. In contrast to these arguments, we introduce electoral and party politics into the debate. This paper models and examines the shifts in the inflationary preferences of the median voter and their translation into party politics and economic policies. As the median voter accumulates nominal assets {{against a background of}} de facto and de jure increasing job security and rising wages, her preferences on macro-economic policies shift from concerns about <b>employment-friendly</b> to inflation-averse policies. Social democratic parties, who are pivotal players in this regard because of their ‘natural’ preference for high employment over low inflation, are thus forced to adopt antiinflation policies as well to remain electorally viable. We show that the employment situation of the average worker improved in every respect during the 1960 s and 1970 s, that most of the population became inflation averse during the 1970 s and 1980 s, and that social democratic parties were forced to adopt more economically orthodox party manifestos. We then analyse the shift to a low inflation regime in a series of country case studies...|$|E
40|$|Development strategies, in {{the name}} of gender-neutral, are gender-blind. The gender {{blindness}} of development strategies are derived from the gender-insensitiveness of dominant development paradigms, which, {{in the name}} of work, do not make any distinction between productive and reproductive work and does not differentiate, {{in the name of}} household, the asymmetries faced by its different members on the basis of sex. Given the nature of gender blindness of development strategies, it is clear that issues related to work and employment are at the core of it. For example, if work done by women within households and for the care economy continues to be not properly valued and compensated for, development strategies would be biased against women. If labour supply functions continue to exclude the trade-off between productive and reproductive functions of women, employment strategies would be partial. The failure to recognize the differentiated position of women within households in terms of opportunities also has adverse implications on work, employment and incomes of women. Female employment is crucial for equitable growth and poverty reduction. Enhanced female employment and income also contribute to better priority setting and resource allocation within families, as women are more prudent. Women, however, {{have been found to be}} concentrated in lowpaying, low productive jobs, they account for major part of temporary, part-time and precarious employment. An <b>employment-friendly</b> strategy is not necessarily gendersensitive. Engendering employment strategy would require reorienting the macro policies, the incentive mechanisms and catering to specific needs of women as they juggle between their productive and reproductive roles, and protecting their rights and safety as workers.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} French dilemma {{associated}} with court administered resolution of corporate financial distress. In such a legal system, the courts seek a double objective: maintaining job positions through continuation, and determining the best outcome for the claimants. We discuss this dilemma empirically, using a unique sample of bankruptcy files on French SMEs. We address successively three critical questions. First, we highlight {{the determinants of}} the final bankruptcy outcome (continuation through reorganization or sale, or piecemeal liquidation) : does continuation (the most <b>employment-friendly</b> outcome) depend on the firm's characteristics, and/or {{on the way the}} procedure is managed? Second, we study the determinants of the creditors' recovery rates: do the courts play an active role in increasing recoveries? Third, we address the dilemma directly by focusing on sales as a going concern. We model the court administered selection process between rival buyout offers: do the courts balance the social content against the financial content of each offer? Is there an explicit arbitrage between employment preservation and creditor recoveries? Our main results are: (1) the French courts actively work to facilitate continuation against liquidation, and thus play a role in employment preservation. Besides, we find continuation is more likely to prevail when default is an outcome of specific difficulties (outlets, finance, and production). (2) We confirm the Radulovic (2008) findings: the global recovery rate mainly depends on the firm's ex ante characteristics at the time of triggering, while the way the procedure is managed by the court has little impact. Similarly to LoPucki and Doherty (2007), continuation via reorganization does not generate lower recovery rates on average than the other outcomes. (3) Last, the courts' choice between rival buyout offers confirms that social considerations prevail in the arbitration. Yet, the courts still consider financial issues as well (a higher sale price increases the chances that an offer is selected), but without clear connection with the amount of due claims (one direct consequence is a moderate recovery rate on sales).

40|$|Indonesia {{has so far}} {{suffered}} a relatively mild impact from the global financial crisis. Its economy grew at 4 % in the year to June 2009, displaying a more resilient response than some of its neighbours. Fiscal stimulus measures, deft monetary policy and cash transfers to the poor served to soften {{the impact of the}} crisis. Parliamentary elections in April and presidential elections in July provided further economic stimulus. Election-related spending and the stimulus measures helped maintain formal sector employment levels and the proportion of casual employees in the workforce. Like the cash transfers, payments by parliamentary candidates to voters contributed to household incomes, particularly among the poor. This is reflected in widespread declines in poverty observed in 2009. The crisis, the stimulus package, the direct cash transfers and the election campaign spending combined to create a mechanism of income redistribution in favour of the poor. On 20 October Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Boediono were inaugurated as president and vice president for 2009 - 14. They announced key economic targets for 2014, including 7 % economic growth, 5 - 6 % unemployment and an 8 - 10 % poverty level. It is crucial that the two leaders tackle important reforms - even politically sensitive ones - that will remove obstacles to faster and more <b>employment-friendly</b> growth. However, the plan for their first 100 days focuses on a series of small, politically non-sensitive reforms designed to demonstrate their commitment to, and create momentum for, wider reform. This strategy is unlikely to create an impression that the government is serious about more substantial and essential reforms. Nor is it likely to generate the economic impact necessary to bring the economy closer to the government's key economic targets. The slow expansion of infrastructure since the 1997 - 98 crisis is a major obstacle to future high and sustained economic growth. Despite some signs of improvement in recent years, Indonesia's rate of infrastructure investment remains far below pre-crisis levels. Tackling this problem should be a high priority for the government. While pursuing ways to grow faster, Indonesia - one of the world's largest CO 2 emitters-needs to respond more vigorously to climate change. The leaders have pledged to place climate change mitigation high on their policy agenda. Yet little has been said about how, as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Indonesia should support her people's adaptation to its effects. The government needs to give high priority to adaptation and promote it at the international level. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUntil very recently, Germany {{belonged to}} the ‘familialist’ group of welfare states, which offered cash rather than {{services}} to married couples and families. Sweden, in contrast, {{belonged to the}} ‘non-familialist’ counterpart, fostering gender equality in employment and family care via public services and extended reconciliation measures for decades. During the 2000 s, however, Germany eventually enacted <b>employment-friendly</b> family policies, like Swedish-style parental leave and the steady expansion of full-time public childcare. Germany also inserted an impressive series of new rules and procedures into Family and Social Law to better protect children and secure their healthy upbringing and early education. While much remained {{the same in the}} Swedish case, a new layer of policy measures was added to the existing family policy plethora. In the wake of the economic crisis in the 1990 s, increasing ill-health among the youth led to new public health goals in turn emphasizing the need of more effective parenting support services. Interestingly, these new forms of social welfare services – or ‘new social risks policies’ – partly developed in parallel with the ‘deinstitutionalization’ of family life, exemplified in individualization, delayed parenthood, increasing rates of cohabitation, divorce and single parent households. In this paper we assume that the evolution of new social welfare services, such as parenting support, {{can be viewed as a}} reaction to the deinstitutionalization of family life, i. e. they constitute forms of new risk management. In the analysis new forms of welfare services are interpreted as public strategies aiming at re-institutionalizing parenthood and parenting via all sorts of services (less so cash benefits), and compensating for the erosion and the assumed weakness of traditional norms around couple and family formation and child upbringing. Thus the purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of the deinstitutionalization process of the family in ‘new social risk’ policies in Germany and Sweden. The paper begins by briefly discussing major trends in family arrangements, pinpointing differences in context, assumptions, and the important issue of timing, which together help to understand why the ‘new risk policies’ have taken different shape in the two countries. Second, we provide an overview of the current characteristics of these policies (cash benefits, care services and activation measures) for children and parents. Here, we derive empirical evidence for our two case studies from policy documents and expert reports. Evidence is also based on interviews with decision makers, service providers and experts in the field of new parenting support services in both countries. In the final section we highlight recent diverging family policy trends in the two countries compared: the devolution of care responsibilities from state to families in Sweden, versus the progressive takeover of such responsibilities by the state in Germany. The findings of our two small case studies provide important insights into public policies (services more than benefits) to moderate or compensate assumed social risks, which accompany new forms of family formation and parenting...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that lifting unfair dismissal laws will create very few jobs, says Ben Freyens THE GOVERNMENT claims repealing unfair dismissal laws for small and medium business will boost employment figures. According to Workplace Relations Minister Kevin Andrews, unfair dismissal laws had ‘acted as a brake on job creation’ and ‘fostered a culture of complaints and litigation where firms would go to any length to avoid hiring extra staff’ (Australian, 3 November). Any policy that removes these costs should therefore be considered <b>employment-friendly.</b> The government rests its case - and its notorious claim that 53, 000 jobs (later, 77, 000 jobs) will be created by lifting unfair dismissal laws - {{on the results of}} various opinion surveys in which business owners are asked whether they would hire staff if the laws were rescinded. Given that employers have an interest in the question asked, {{it is hardly surprising that}} many answered they would. Economists prefer to judge according to what economic agents actually do (the ‘revealed preference’ approach) rather than what they pretend they will do (and may never do). Surveying the ‘revealed preference’ literature on this issue yields no compelling evidence that the existing laws have had a negative impact on employment. In theory, firing costs (such as those generated by unfair dismissal protection) have two effects on employment: they deter hiring (the government’s claim) but they also deter firing (especially when the case against the employee is weak). Removing employment protection thus leads to offsetting effects. Which of the two effects prevails is unclear as no robust research has been conducted in this field in Australia. The wider empirical and international literature is also inconclusive. The two most recent literature surveys on this issue make contradicting claims on the relevance of employment protection in the employment debate. If there is any consensus it is that the net impact on employment must depend on time and country-specific parameters such as the number of voluntary separations, economic uncertainty, discounting, the probability of facing these costs, and the relative magnitudes of hiring and firing costs. It should also be stressed that international organisations and academic research consistently rank Australia as a country with low firing costs. Unfair dismissal laws do not apply to temporary and casual workers - or, in most states, to staff earning more than in the range $ 75, 000 to $ 90, 000. Unfair dismissal compensation is capped at six months’ wages, a third of the cap in many ‘eurosclerotic’ countries. State and federal IR court decisions are not on average friendlier towards employees than to employers (as opposed to those in many continental European countries). Intuitively, removing firing costs in a country in which those costs are already low appears unlikely to yield considerable results. In a recent study funded by the Australian Research Council (PDF file) the magnitude of the costs of firing in Australia was estimated with direct quantitative methods and used to calibrate the ‘hiring deterrent’ effect of unfair dismissal laws. Other observed parameters such as the probability of incurring these costs, the average tenure at time of dismissal and long-term labor demand elasticity were obtained from the Industrial Relations Commission, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Treasury respectively. The employment impact was found to be relatively mild: at best 6000 jobs would be created by removing the laws. But this ignores the ‘labor retention’ effect, which would also be removed by the policy, adversely affecting employment. Hence, removing unfair dismissal protection may have no impact whatsoever on employment or could even have a negative impact if it triggers a wave of long withheld fires. There are other much more convincing arguments for removing unfair dismissal laws than their uncertain and probably weak effect on job creation. One is that these laws currently discriminate between employees that are protected by these laws (permanent employees) and those that aren’t. A policy aiming at removing the laws for everyone (or alternatively extending the laws to cover every employee) can only be fairer than the status quo. From an economic perspective, another argument is that dismissals for reason specific to the worker are either fair or unlawful but never unfair. One way or the other, drinking at work, absenteeism, refusing to work, rebellious behavior and poor performance always come down to a problem of mismatch between wage and productivity. Perhaps such behaviour also decreases the productivity of other staff or imposes an external cost on the employer. The economic case is clear: dismissal for such reasons is always fair because it is efficient. The possible harshness of the decision and the social reasons behind the employee’s behaviour constitute a grey zone that does not fit anywhere in economic reasoning. On the other hand it should be clear that employers dismissing fully productive staff for individual reasons (resisting employer bullying on out-of-contract or illegal work, pregnancy, personal dislike, age or race, etc) have a poor case for fair dismissal. Unlawful termination laws that protect staff against such contingencies are not targeted by the government’s IR reforms. A dismissed but productive employee can then contest the dismissal on these grounds even if the employer claims to have acted fairly and lawfully. If the economic case for removing unfair dismissal laws is so straightforward, then why is the current debate focused on so weak, inconclusive and poorly documented an argument as to whether the costs reduce employment? Perhaps job creation rhetoric derives from political economy considerations and in particular the popularity of the measures, but this skirts the important question: what is the rationale for having (or not having) unfair dismissal protection? A proper debate on this question matters more than obscure and blunt job creation arguments. Ben Freyens is a research fellow at UNSW@ADFA.
