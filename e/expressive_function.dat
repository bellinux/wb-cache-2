The data suggests that meaning predictability in blends as (nick-) names, (most often names with identificatory, descriptive and <b>expressive</b> <b>functions)</b> varies with their processing complexity. Comparing blends as nicknames provides evidence for considering the process of meaning (re-) creation as a trade-off between factors affecting morphotactic non-compositionality (e. g. recategorization, underlying exocentric compound) and semantic non-constituency (e. g. the presence of eponymous adjectives, meaning selection/restriction or expansion/emergence via reduplication of identical qualities, selection/matching of non-prototypical or idiosyncratic features, value judgements against the background of culturally-significant values and stereotypes) ...|$|R

This suggestion has proven to be valid in a multitude of studies that take self-monitoring into account as a predictable personality type in relation to attitude functions (Snyder & DeBono, 1985; Shavitt, 1990; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002).|$|E
5000|$|For bilingual {{children}} {{who grow up}} in a bilingual environment, how their language developed through childhood influences the lexical size of both languages. Researchers showed that the basic process is same as with monolinguals, and bilingual children tend to learn the languages as two monolinguals. The growth of both languages' lexicon is the same with the growth of the lexicon for monolingual. [...] Older children do transfer more than younger children. Also in this step of learning words, the vocabulary size positively related to the exposure time in that language.

[...] Semantic tasks for preschool children with predominantly Spanish-speaking, predominantly English-speaking and bilingual showed that these three groups are different from each other. Bilinguals perform best on <b>expressive</b> <b>function</b> for both Spanish and English as predominantly-speaking children but performed differently in each language, which means they do not mirror performance in Spanish and English.

40|$|The {{debate over}} the lack of {{correlation}} between CEO compensation and performance has caused a divide amongst corporate law scholars. Proponents of intervention have predictably welcomed the legislative activity and have called for more. This article argues that the legislative and regulatory interventions by the state are in furtherance of the expressive functions of the law, and {{that even in the}} absence of sanctions such expressive laws can have an affect on behavior. It argues that while legislative and regulatory actions can express certain norms, they are ultimately unlikely to be of much help in behavior modification unless accompanied by norm internalization. Decentralized deployment of non-legal sanctions can offer a pathway to norm internalization in the CEO compensation area. Under this thesis, legislation only aids the deployment of social sanctions by virtue of its <b>expressive</b> <b>function.</b> This paper will briefly describe the <b>expressive</b> <b>function</b> of the law, and provides an overview of legislative attempts at serving this <b>expressive</b> <b>function.</b> It posits that expressive law cannot succeed in the absence of norm internalization by CEOs and directors.

40|$|What is the {{ultimate}} objective of the patent eligibility inquiry? The recent eligibility case law — a frenzied outpouring of opinions from many esteemed judges — has revealed little while mystifying much. Scholars haven’t fared much better, although it isn’t for lack of trying. Our scholarly colleagues have offered a multitude of intriguing new perspectives on the analysis — drawing on history, the philosophy of science, semiotics, institutional choice, and so on. But we continue to wonder exactly what the eligibility inquiry is for. In addressing that question here, we’re following a familiar methodological tradition: we propose to reimagine eligibility from a new perspective, that of expressive theories of law. Our central claim is that eligibility rules {{can be understood as}} performing <b>expressive</b> <b>functions</b> that are at least as weighty, if not more so, than the traditional gatekeeping function. We argue that it’s helpful to identify those <b>expressive</b> <b>functions</b> for three reasons: (1) doing so helps explain some aspects of eligibility doctrine that otherwise appear incoherent; (2) doing so brings to the fore some new ideas about the objectives of the eligibility inquiry that link to eligibility’s expressive functions; and (3) doing so may enable courts to design eligibility rules that facilitate the development of new behavioral norms in the patent community...|$|R

40|$|Five {{views of}} the {{function}} of interjections, developed {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century by the psychologist-linguist Bühler, the linguists Gardiner, and Jakobson, and the psychologists Révész and Duijker, are discussed. All five scholars reject the earlier psychologism that reinforced the traditional emotion-expressive view of interjections; all of them argue for a listener-directed, communicative view of language in general, and all include a specific appeal-to-the-listener-function in their model of language functions. My original hypothesis was therefore that these scholars would reject the one-sided traditional view that interjections mainly express the speaker’s emotions, acknowledging instead that the central function of most interjections is to make some appeal to the listener (a view supported by recent investigation of a corpus of spoken Dutch, which shows that only 7 % fulfils a purely <b>expressive</b> <b>function).</b> As it turns out, however, all five scholars support the traditional view and attributed an <b>expressive</b> <b>function</b> to interjections.

Whatever {{the kind of}} text a translator deals with, it will bring out something new, something different for the world of translation. Having a poetry translation to be analyzed is also an interesting thing to do, especially if the original version was written by a writer of all ages like Kahlil Gibran. It {{is one of the}} reasons why the writer is interested in analyzing "Sang Nabi", the Indonesian version of Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet". The other reason is that she is very keen to know whether a literature translation text also pay attention on retaining the form along with the message. And it becomes a foundation that brings the writer to use a theory of translating expressive text namely an <b>expressive</b> <b>function</b> theory. Through this research, she wants to know whether "Sang Nabi" is translated properly based on the <b>expressive</b> <b>function</b> theory and what is maintained in Indonesian version based on that theory. The writer wishes that from the study, the readers, or anybody who is interested in the translation, realize that translating an expressive text is not the same as translating general type of text. It has its own strategy and mechanism. This study is a qualitative one and she collects the data from the original book, "The Prophet" and the Indonesian translation, "Sang Nabi". The writer chooses eight poems with the same titles from each book to be analyzed. She analyses the data by examining thoroughly whether the components of <b>expressive</b> <b>function</b> which consist of Unconventional Syntax, Original Metaphor, Infrequent Collocation, Archaism, Unit of Translation and the meaning of the poems are retained. Finally, she finds out that "Sang Nabi" is not translated properly on the point of view of <b>expressive</b> <b>function.</b> The forms that are maintained mostly are Unconventional syntax and Original Metaphor, only two out of six components. Meanwhile, the rest are not well-transferred and the poems also endure much loss of meaning because of many wrong translations. The writer infers that to retain the form along with the message in an expressive text is not an easy job to do and entail a great effort. Yet, she still thinks that it is not an impossible thing to do because by retaining the form as well as the message, we will not enjoy the poem but also to know further about the personal expression of the author...|$|E
