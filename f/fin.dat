5|$|The adipose <b>fin,</b> {{which is}} present in over 6,000 teleost species, is often thought to have evolved once in the lineage and to have been lost {{multiple}} times due to its limited function.

40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} of heat transfer enhancement and deterioration in supercritical water reactor core {{is essential to}} the reactor efficiency and security. At present, there exists deficiency in the study of core enhanced channels. Two different <b>fins</b> arrangements of the enhanced channels are designed in present paper, which are long-strip <b>fins</b> and equal-distance short <b>fins.</b> At the conditions of the supercritical pressure of 25 MPa, the inlet temperature of 350 ℃ and different inlet velocities, the heat transfer enhancement and deterioration {{characteristics of}} water flowing in the two different <b>fins</b> arrangements of the enhanced channels were studied and comparatively analyzed. The results show that the heat transfer is enhanced in the channels with <b>fins.</b> The heat transfer enhancement is better in the channel with equal-distance short <b>fins</b> when lower input velocity, better in the channel with long-strip <b>fins</b> when high input velocity. The surface heat transfer coefficients increase with the velocity increases; the surface heat transfer coefficients in equal-distance short <b>fins</b> is two to three times than that in the channel without <b>fins.</b> There exists heat transfer deterioration when the input velocity is lower in the channel without <b>fins</b> and with long-strip <b>fins,</b> no deterioration occurs in the channel with equal-distance short <b>fins.</b> The channel with equal-distance short <b>fins</b> is a relatively reasonable of the three channels...|$|R

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail <b>fin</b> {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal <b>fin</b> and second dorsal <b>fin</b> would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail <b>fin</b> (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first dorsal <b>fin</b> has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal <b>fin</b> is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic <b>fin</b> bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second dorsal <b>fin,</b> with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal <b>fin</b> comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base.

5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark <b>fin</b> soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, <b>fin</b> them, and dump the finless animal {{back into the}} water.
