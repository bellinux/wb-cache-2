40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) with a {{centrifugal pump}} requires a certain flow rate; therefore, its application for low body weight infants is frequently accompanied by oxygenator membrane malfunction and/or inadequate perfusion. To prevent low-flow associated complications, we report {{a case in}} which a novel system of dual roller pumps was used. A baby girl with a body mass index 0. 25 m 2, who experienced difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after a Norwood-like operation, required an ECMO. Concerns for the tube lifespan reduction due to roller pump friction led to the use of a <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump circulation. The termination of ECMO during tube exchange is not needed, because circulation is maintained by another roller pump. The novel strategy of ECMO with <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pumps will allow low perfusion rate to provide adequate circulatory support for low body weight patients...|$|R

50|$|Horizontal {{windlasses}} offer several advantages. The unit {{tends to}} be more self-contained, protecting the machinery from the corrosive environment found on boats. The dual wheels also allow two anchors on <b>double</b> <b>rollers</b> to be serviced. Vertical capstans, for their part, allow the machinery to be placed below decks, thus lowering the center of gravity (important on boats), and also allow a flexible angle of pull (which means rope or chain can be run out to different fair leads).|$|R

50|$|The M&KR used stone block {{sleepers}} with Birkinshaw's patent {{malleable iron}} rails. At this early date {{the technology of}} rail configuration had not matured, but John Birkinshaw had secured a patent in 1820 for a T-section fish-bellied edge rail of malleable iron. His patent specified {{that they should be}} formed by passing through rollers—as they were fish-bellied, presumably only the head was shaped in the <b>rollers.</b> <b>Cast</b> iron, as used until then, is brittle and ill-suited to heavy railway use; malleable iron is heat treated after casting and is able to withstand shocks. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was the first public railway to adopt Birkinshaw's rail; the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway was either the second or the third public railway.|$|R
40|$|During arthroscopies, {{bleeding}} episodes {{occur as a}} result of tissue damage. Irrigation systems assist in minimizing these disturbances. The performance of three arthroscopic irrigation systems in clearing {{bleeding episodes}} was evaluated objectively. One surgeon performed 99 shoulder arthroscopies using three irrigation systems: gravity infusion, single <b>roller,</b> and <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump. The three irrigation systems groups were matched postoperatively for type of surgery-acromioplasty, SLAP, release, rotator cuff repair and capsule repair, and operation duration. The recorded arthroscopies were analyzed for the presence of bleeding episodes with a special computer program that automatically detects the tinctures of red-colored blood. A least 20 % of an arthroscopic image had to be covered with blood to qualify as bleeding episode. The median (min-max) presence of bleeding episodes {{as a percentage of the}} operation time was 6. 6 % (0. 0 - 43. 6 %) for gravity infusion, 3. 7 % (0. 2 - 46. 4 %) for the single roller, and 3. 3 % (0. 0 - 19. 3 %) for the <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump, respectively. The large variation could be attributed to the occurrence of arterial bleeding episodes during some procedures. No significant differences were found between the irrigation systems. For a subgroup including acromioplasties and releases, significant differences were found in favor of both roller pumps (P < 0. 05). Overall, the roller pumps did not outperform gravity infusion. However, from the results, high-risk procedures for bleeding episodes were identified (acromioplasty and release of a frozen shoulder) that can benefit from the use of roller pumps. A clear view is essential to perform an arthroscopic procedure safely and efficientl...|$|R

Automatic chassis lubrication continued to be fitted, operating [...] "thermostatically every time the engine warm(ed) up", and the propeller-shaft centre bearing was [...] "prepacked with grease" [...] so did not require lubrication.

5000|$|The {{park was}} inaugurated as Parque Interama on September 21, 1982. Its sixty attractions {{included}} the Aconcagua roller coaster, the Scorpion double giant wheel, Vertigorama <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, Aerogondolas (the longest Sky Ride in Latin America), the musical fountain, and a miniature railway circulating {{around the perimeter}} of the park. The observation tower reached 208 m (682 ft) upon topping out in 1981, and remained the tallest free-standing structure in Argentina until 2015. The park struggled with setbacks from before its opening, The 1980 bankruptcy of the chief stockholder in Interama, Banco Sidesa, delayed the inaugural. Interama's estimated US$ 100 million in bad debts prompted the administration of Mayor Julio César Saguier to revoke the lease, and sue Interama, upon the 1983 return of democracy. The park was then renamed as the Parque de la Ciudad (City Park) in December of that year.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{in terms}} of {{efficiency}} and traction capabilities a recently patented toroidal traction drive variator: the so-called <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> full-toroidal variator (DFTV). By employing a relatively simple model of the elastohydrodynamic contact behavior between the disks and rollers, we compare {{the performance of the}} DFTV with classical solutions as the single-roller full-toroidal variator (SFTV) and the single-roller half-toroidal variator (SHTV). Interestingly, the DFTV shows an improvement of the mechanical efficiency over a wide range of transmission ratios, and in particular at the unit speed ratio, as in such conditions the DFTV allows for zero-spin thus strongly enhancing its traction capabilities. The relation between the torque transmission and the operational volume is also investigated for the three toroid geometries. In this case, the better performance is achieved by the SHTV, whereas the other two geometries show a similar behavior. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
