5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
25|$|Information {{management}} (IM) is {{the collection}} and management of information from one or more sources {{and the distribution of}} that information to one or more audiences. This sometimes involves those who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the structure, processing and delivery of information. Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files, file maintenance, and the life cycle management of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light and also began to include the field of data maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} set to reach a final {{decision}} {{on the future of}} I-81 with input from many local groups, or stakeholders. In early May 2011, this official process was started by two entities: NYSDOT and the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC), the region’s metropolitan planning organization. NYSDOT is responsible for overseeing the process and, eventually, its construction. SMTC consists of member agencies that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in transportation decisions in Central New York. Both parties have yet to reach a decision, but they hope to eventually reach one that {{is in the best interest}} for everyone in the greater Syracuse area. In late March 2011, SMTC and NYSDOT announced the formation of the I-81 Community Liaison Committee (CLC). The CLC is made up of representatives from 37organizations and will give ideas and point out concerns about the future of I-81 in Syracuse.|$|E

500|$|Donnell's {{goal was}} that the Monadnock would [...] "not only look as it {{originally}} did, it [...] also live as it used to", and he sought tenants for the street-level shops that were similar to their 19th-century occupants. Shop windows were cleared of all signs and obstructions to preserve intended view from the corridor through to the street. Fluorescent lighting was prohibited and only gold leaf lettering on the glass was permitted for signage. Shops, all individually owned, were selected to fit the architectural character of the building. A florist, for example, was chosen that evoked a turn-of-the-century atmosphere, {{as well as a}} barbershop with vintage fixtures and decor. A tobacconist with oak furnishings, a pen shop with glass cases, a shoe-shine stand, and other service establishments represented, in Donnell's words, [...] "the kind of small-scale entrepreneurs who occupied those spaces {{at the turn of the}} century, the kind of people who bring vitality and life to a building because they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching, was mixed towards [...] "Of Vice and Men", writing that the episode's {{focus on the}} mystery of the week did not work thematically, as Veronica did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in its solving. [...] "The better we get to know the {{supporting}} characters and the closer each arc gets to its conclusion, the harder it gets to care about stories that don't have a really personal connection for Veronica." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was very critical of the episode, naming five ways in which he thought Veronica was unlikable in the episode. [...] "Simply put, Veronica spends most of [...] "Of Vice and Men" [...] acting like she's better and smarter than everyone else. Of course, she is smarter than everyone, so that's okay. But better? Sometimes that's justified, sometimes it's not," [...] elaborating that Veronica became increasingly unlikeable in the episode. He was also negative towards the final sequence, writing [...] "it feels slightly manipulative," [...] commenting that the show was not ready to tackle scenes of attempted rape.|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{was assassinated}} in September 1901, and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt. [...] Taft and Roosevelt had first become friends around 1890 while Taft was Solicitor General and Roosevelt {{a member of the}} Civil Service Commission. Taft had, after McKinley's election, urged the {{appointment}} of Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and watched as Roosevelt became a war hero, Governor of New York, and Vice President of the United States. They met again when Taft went to Washington in January 1902 to recuperate after two operations caused by an infection. There, Taft testified before the Senate Committee on the Philippines. Taft wanted Filipino farmers to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in the new government through land ownership, but much of the arable land was held by Catholic religious orders of mostly Spanish priests, which were often resented by the Filipinos. Roosevelt had Taft go to Rome to negotiate with Pope Leo XIII, to purchase the lands and to arrange the withdrawal of the Spanish priests, with Americans replacing them and training locals as clergy. Taft did not succeed in resolving these issues on his visit to Rome, but an agreement on both points was made in 1903.|$|E

500|$|The topic {{came up in}} a 2013 {{interview}} of President Barack Obama, who stated {{that if he were}} the owner of the Redskins, he would consider changing the name because it offends many Native Americans, but that he did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in the issue as he is not an owner of a professional sports team. In November 2015 Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated [...] "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" [...] and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. On May 22, 2014, fifty U.S. Senators, forty-eight Democrats and two Independents, sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Goodell asking the league, referencing the Donald Sterling case, to [...] "send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports." [...] Five Democratic Senators declined to sign the letter, and Republicans were not invited to do so. [...] No Senators have publicly supported the name, but rather have either declined to give an opinion or stated their opposition to Senate involvement in the issue. During his campaign, President Donald Trump defended the name.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the reforms}} of Isabella I which reduced noble power were {{reversed}} as a price for luring the nobility to the royalist side. [...] However, Charles understood that noble encroachment of power had helped cause the revolt, and embarked upon a new reform program. [...] Unpopular, corrupt, and ineffective officials were replaced; judicial functions of the Royal Council were limited; and local courts were revitalized. [...] Charles also adjusted {{the membership of the}} Royal Council; its hated president was replaced, the aristocracy's role reduced, and more gentry were added to it. [...] Realizing that the urban elite needed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in the royal government once more, Charles gave many of them positions, privileges, and government salaries. [...] The Cortes, while not as important as the comuneros had hoped, nevertheless maintained its power; it was still required to approve new taxes and could advise the king. [...] Charles also discouraged his officials from using overly coercive methods, after seeing his heavy-handed treatment of the Cortes of Corunna backfire. [...] If anything, the co-option of the middle class worked too well; when Charles' successor King Phillip II demanded a ruinously large tax increase in the 1580s, the Cortes was too dependent on the Crown for money to effectively resist policies that would wreck the economy.|$|E

2500|$|The term patriarchy {{is often}} misused loosely {{to stand for}} [...] "male domination", while the more {{rigorous}} definition lies with the literal interpretation: [...] "the rule of the father". So some people believe patriarchy does not refer to a simple binary pattern of male power over women, but power exerted more complexly by age as well as gender, and by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.|$|E

In August 2016, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) gained a 10% share in the Empire State Building through a $622 million investment to the Empire State Realty Trust. The trust’s president John Kessler called it an “endorsement of the company’s irreplaceable assets”.

Noam Chomsky, political activist and professor of linguistics at MIT, writes that [...] "there are far more powerful interests that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in what happens in the Persian Gulf region than does AIPAC , such as the oil companies, the arms industry and other special interests whose lobbying influence and campaign contributions far surpass that of the much-vaunted Zionist lobby and its allied donors to congressional races." ...|$|E

That's what we did for Bleed American too.

2500|$|At {{some time}} in the late 1950s, Kahane took on the persona of a Gentile individual, along with the {{pseudonym}} Michael King. At this point, Kahane began openly expressing anti-Communist positions. He and Joseph Churba created the July Fourth Movement, which was formed to counteract widespread opposition towards U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Subsequently, they co-authored the text, The Jewish Stake in Vietnam together, which was an attempt to convince American Jews of the [...] "evil of Communism". The book's introduction states that, [...] "all Americans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>stake</b> in this grim war against Communism.... it is vital that Jews realize the threat to their very survival [...]" [...] Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of para-militarism, and they permanently parted ways. Churba went on to pursue his own career, joining the US Air Force, writing many books on the Middle East, and later becoming one of Ronald Reagan's consultants. Kahane chose to fight for Jewish rights, and was willing to use extreme measures. He even attempted to acquire and grow biological weapons to use on a Soviet military installation, but failed. He began using the phrase [...] "Never Again", and conceived the Jewish Star and fist insignia, a symbol resembling that of the Black Panther Party, though Kahane himself opposed the Black Panther party due to anti-Jewish riots they had supported in Massachusetts and their leftist leanings, as he saw it.|$|E
