50|$|As MWOM {{passed its}} {{hundredth}} issue (August 31, 1974) a galaxy of different characters {{began to be}} featured in the publication (with the Hulk still holding the top spot), many of these coming via the merger of other titles into MWOM. The Avengers returned to MWOM, bringing Conan the Barbarian with them in issue #199 (July 21, 1976) following the cancellation of their own magazine. The Avengers had <b>joint</b> <b>cover</b> billing with the Hulk, and over time the green giant would share it with other characters. From issue #233 (March 1977), the Hulk co-starred with Planet of the Apes (after their own 1974-1977 weekly folded) and subsequently with Dracula and Nick Fury. (The former was {{left over from the}} last merger, when the title then called Planet of the Apes and Dracula Lives merged into MWOM; while the latter was from Fury weekly, an unsuccessful March-August 1977 attempt to follow the popularity of boys' war comics in the UK.)

50|$|After {{following}} Amok's trail {{they arrive}} at the Pits of Zinja - a long since exhausted mine, and coincidentally Jool's last home. During a three-way fight between the Mekaka, the Wheeldebeasts and the Zinja, Jool believes that The God Beast has not brought the herd to Zinja for more metal, but to kill them, as he buries them in the empty pits. To prevent this, Armageddon attacks The God Beast directly, and inadvertently hacks into his brain - releasing The Master Program into Armageddon. Breaking the fourth wall, The Master Program explains to the reader how Earth came to be, (mentioning the only date in the series - that the Earth's magnetic field cut out in the 24th Century,) and also reveals to Armageddon that The God Beast is not destroying his herd, but protecting them from an imminent asteroid shower - the Moonsoon. As the asteroids start to fall, fighting is broken off and all the combatants take <b>joint</b> <b>cover</b> in the pits. As Armageddon now has ownership of The Master Program he becomes the new God Beast, Amok dies, and passes control of the herd onto Armageddon. Armageddon states that the ore in the asteroids will help him rebuild his tribe - referring to the Wheeldebeasts.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program is to further evaluate the performance and constructability of reinforced concrete (RC) column-steel beam-slab systems (RCS) for use in low- to mid-rise space frame buildings located in regions of high wind loads and/or moderate seismicity. To better understand these systems, two full scale RCS cruciform specimens were tested under bidirectional quasi-static reversed cyclic loading. The experimental portion of this research program included the construction and testing of two full-scale cruciform specimens with identical overall dimensions but with different joint detailing. The two joint details evaluated were <b>joint</b> <b>cover</b> plates and face bearing plates with localized transverse ties. The construction process was recorded in detail and related to actual field construction practices. The specimens were tested experimentally in quasi-static reversed cyclic loading in both orthogonal loading directions while a constant axial force {{was applied to the}} column, to simulate the wind loads in a subassembly of a prototype building. To compliment the experimental work, nonlinear analyses were performed to evaluate the specimen strength and hysteretic degradation parameters for RCS systems. In addition, current recommendations in the literature on the design of RCS joints were used to estimate specimen joint strength and were compared with the experimental findings...|$|E

Active and passive, as well as against isometric resistance movements, are discussed. In particular, the passive mobilization is demonstrated effective in the restoration of joint mobility. The sterno- clavicular joint is not structured in order to complete great work loads and has the tendency to become hypermotile or unstable, if subordinate to overload works, becoming painful. In this case, the techniques of passive mobilization and of modulation of the pain turn out effective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} plastic (FRP) composites for strengthening of beams and columns in RC structures has attracted great attention in recent decades. However, less {{attention has been paid}} to strengthening RC connections with FRP laminates. In the current study, a finite element (FE) modeling has been proposed for the non-linear analysis of RC <b>joints</b> <b>covered</b> with FRP overlays. The model consists of the effects of anchorage slip and anchorage extension of the steel reinforcement in the connection zone. As for the credibility of the method, some available experimental works were modeled and non-linearly analyzed using ANSYS. The results showed that the model can predict the experimental works with good accuracy. At the end and as a case study, a base joint specimen was strengthened with FRP laminates in 7 different cases and the specimens were analyzed using the aforementioned modeling. The results showed that good ductility and strength enhancement could be achieved by employing correctly configured FRP laminates...|$|R

50|$|In 1901, Ardeshir {{turned to}} experimenting with safes. Ardeshir {{resolved}} {{to build a}} safe that was not only burglarproof, but fireproof as well, which as he determined, most safes were not. Ardeshir made dozens of designs on paper and held innumerable discussions with his engineers and craftsmen, until it was finally determined {{that the only way}} to ensure security and stability was to make the safe out of a single sheet of steel. The resultant design had altogether sixteen bends, each side of the cross-shaped sheet being folded forward and then being folded twice more (inwards) to form the front door frame. Joints were welded, not riveted, and the coffer was covered by a second sixteen-bend sheet offset to the first by 90 degrees. The door was double plated, with the lock and hinges attached to the inner plate and the <b>joints</b> <b>covered</b> by the outer plate. The total weight was 1¾ tons. Altogether three patents covered the Ardeshir design. The first safes entered the market in 1902.|$|R
40|$|Robots {{based on}} {{parallel}} kinematic structures feature low moved masses, allowing for better dy-namic performance compared to serial mechanisms, eventually resulting in shorter cycle-times in handling and assembly. A {{side effect of}} this high dynamics is {{a higher level of}} vibration which has to be addressed in order to reach the full potential for short cycle-times. Some active measures for vibration-suppression were already presented previously. Another problem of parallel robots is a small ratio between working-space to installation-space. In order to overcome the problem (e. g. by changing configurations) specific components (e. g. joints) are needed. In this paper the use of an adaptronic joint with quasi-statical clearance adjustment integrated in the five-bar parallel structure is presented, addressing both vibration-suppression and configuration changes. Dimensioning of the adaptronic <b>joint</b> <b>covers</b> two aspects. Firstly increasing of friction up to blocking the joint in order to change configuration of the five-bar-structure. Secondly friction variation is used to optimize vibration damping and thus indirectly shorten cycle-times. First experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
