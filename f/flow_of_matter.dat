25|$|In {{the case}} of a flowing system of only one {{chemical}} constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.|$|E
25|$|Planck's law {{describes}} the unique and characteristic spectral distribution for electromagnetic radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium, {{when there is}} no net <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> or energy. Its physics is most easily understood by considering the radiation in a cavity with rigid opaque walls. Motion of the walls can affect the radiation. If the walls are not opaque, then the thermodynamic equilibrium is not isolated. It is of interest to explain how the thermodynamic equilibrium is attained. There are two main cases: (a) when the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium is in the presence of matter, when the walls of the cavity are imperfectly reflective for every wavelength or when the walls are perfectly reflective while the cavity contains a small black body (this was the main case considered by Planck); or (b) when the approach to equilibrium is in the absence of matter, when the walls are perfectly reflective for all wavelengths and the cavity contains no matter. For matter not enclosed in such a cavity, thermal radiation can be approximately explained by appropriate use of Planck's law.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the revised}} and more {{rigorous}} {{definition of the}} internal energy of a closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work takes the system from one state to another, this leaves {{a problem for the}} definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is not in general possible. According to Max Born, the transfer of matter and energy across an open connection [...] "cannot be reduced to mechanics". In contrast to the case of closed systems, for open systems, in the presence of diffusion, there is no unconstrained and unconditional physical distinction between convective transfer of internal energy by bulk <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> the transfer of internal energy without transfer of matter (usually called heat conduction and work transfer), and change of various potential energies. The older traditional way and the conceptually revised (Carathéodory) way agree that there is no physically unique definition of heat and work transfer processes between open systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{outlines}} DROOL, a novel {{knowledge representation}} scheme for supporting {{early stages of}} the design of multi-technology systems. The key idea behind DROOL is that mechatronic systems should be considered as interlocking <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> energy and information. This provides a powerful framework for thinking about important aspects of conceptual design, and an equally powerful structure for organising a design representation scheme. The paper presents an object model for DROOL, and shows how the scheme describes design concepts at various levels of abstraction, in terms of component hierarchies and interlocking <b>flows.</b> The development <b>of</b> DROOL is part of the FACADE Project, whose aim is to develop intelligent computer tools to facilitate communication among designers with different specialties in concurrent engineering projects. The FACADE System comprises a suite of interfaces with different visual representations to support different conceptual design activities, with a single underlying product representation: DROOL. Development is concentrating on two interfaces with alternative visual representations in which designers can describe the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> energy and information in mechatronic systems: blob diagrams and concept arrays.

2500|$|The {{situation}} is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that {{his definition of}} [...] "heat transfer", for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat, but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a conceptual small cell {{in a situation of}} continuous-flow as a system defined in the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass. Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is considered to be open, the diffusive flows of the components being defined with respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between bulk flow of internal energy and diffusive flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal energy density {{does not have to be}} constant per unit mass of material, and allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of kinetic energy of bulk flow to internal energy by viscosity.|$|E

40|$|The {{relativistic}} thermodynamics of {{irreversible processes}} is developed for an isotropic mixture in which heat conduction, diffusion, viscous flow, chemical reactions and their cross-phenomena may occur. The four-vectors, representing the relative <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> are defined {{in such a}} way that, in the four-dimensional space-time continuum, they are perpendicular to the four-vector which represents the barycentric velocity. The entropy balance is derived from the fundamental relativistic macroscopic laws. If n is the number of chemical components, we find n + 4 relations among the 4 n + 4 phenomenological equations which we obtain for the relative <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and the heat flow. Owing to these relations we retain just that number (3 n) of independent equations which would be expected from physical considerations. It is shown that the Onsager relations are Lorentz invariant. A new cross-effect is found between diffusion and heat conduction, arising from a relativistic term in the force conjugate to the heat flow. It appears that due to this cross-effect the diffusion phenomena are influenced by the barycentric motion...|$|R

40|$|A {{new class}} of exact {{solutions}} of hydrodynamic equations for an incompressible fluid (gas) at {{the presence of a}} bulk sink and uprising vertical <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is considered. The acceleration of the rotation velocity of classical non-stationary vortices is conditioned by the joint action of the convective and Coriolis hydrodynamic forces (accelerations), which appear due to the converging radial <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> the <b>matter</b> in the region of a bulk sink. It is shown that there exist velocity profiles that nullify viscous terms in the Navier-Stokes equations and represent a vortex structure with a "rigid-body" rotation of its core and converging radial <b>flows.</b> The concept <b>of</b> non-stationary vortices in open systems is applied to description of origination of power atmospheric vortices (whirlwinds, tornados, and typhoons). In the classical hydrodynamics a favorable condition for the origination and existence of such vortices is the exact nullification of the terms, which describe kinematic viscosity of an incompressible fluid. Such flows have the minimal rate of energy dissipation that corresponds to the "minimum entropy production principle", and therefore may relatively easily appear in favorable natural conditions.

40|$|From a {{thermodynamic}} {{point of}} view, the attribution of the adjective sustainable {{to an open}} system like the city is, at least, very problematic. The biosphere is a closed system, kept far from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> energy coming from the sun. The biosphere maintains and increases its internal order dispersing entropy, generated by all the internal processes, as thermal infrared radiation. But then, the elegant picture of sustainability given by thermodynamics can not be applied to open systems, and notably to the city, without raising both theoretical and practical problems. The city is almost by definition a place of consumption and of degradation of potentials, kept in local equilibrium by external <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and energy, {{but at the same}} time plays a key role in shaping and maintaining the global <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> energy, and information, and this role must be taken into account when interpreting thermodynamic-based descriptions. The urban capital probably represents the greatest investment made by mankind. Materials have been harvested from the earth crust and from the natural systems, and have been concentrated and ordered in the city. But the "city" is not the infrastructure: it's concept of a different logical type. The city is a further level of organization that produces services of higher level. The urban infrastructure is necessary, but not sufficient to produce the city services. The city is the most important social and health "device". A proper accounting must consider the city-performance of the urban infrastructure, beyond the mere, local energy and carbon efficiency. In this context, local GHG accounting is proposed as a rather simple and useful basis to ground process-wise studies and projects, including the creation of effective local industrial ecologies, in a continuous city-making effort toward higher sustainability...|$|R
