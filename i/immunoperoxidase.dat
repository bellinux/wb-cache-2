25|$|Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy is often performed, {{especially}} for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H) and <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had {{a small number of}} positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.|$|E

While the first cases of IHC staining used fluorescent dyes (see immunofluorescence), other non-fluorescent methods using enzymes such as peroxidase (see <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining) and alkaline phosphatase are now used. These enzymes are capable of catalysing reactions that give a coloured product that is easily detectable by light microscopy.

50|$|Indirect <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay (IPA) is a {{laboratory}} technique {{used to detect}} and tirate viruses that do not cause measurable cytopathic effects and cannot be measured by classical plaque assays. These viruses include human coronavirus 229E and OC43.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in <b>immunoperoxidase</b> {{staining}} is the binding of the specific (primary) antibody to the cell or tissue sample. The detection of the primary antibody can be then accomplished directly (example 1) or indirectly (examples 2 & 3).|$|E
50|$|Visualising an antibody-antigen {{interaction}} can {{be accomplished}} {{in a number of}} ways. In the most common instance, an antibody is conjugated to an enzyme, such as peroxidase, that can catalyse a colour-producing reaction (see <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining). Alternatively, the antibody can also be tagged to a fluorophore, such as fluorescein or rhodamine (see immunofluorescence).|$|E
50|$|A {{presumptive}} diagnosis {{can be made}} based on the clinical signs and a low haematocrit reading (<27%). Virus isolation, increased antibody titres, <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining, ELISA, PCR or indirect immunofluorescence {{can be used to}} confirm the presence of the virus.

50|$|Immunohistochemistry and {{immunocytochemistry}} are {{methods used}} to determine in which cells or parts of cells a particular protein or other macromolecule are located. These stains use antibodies to bind to specific antigens, usually of protein or glycoprotein origin. Since antibodies are normally invisible, special strategies must be employed to detect these bound antibodies. In an <b>immunoperoxidase</b> procedure, an enzyme known as a peroxidase is used to catalyze a chemical reaction to produce a coloured product.|$|E
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} {{relies on}} viral isolation and characterization. For virus characterization, recent methodology using genomic amplification (PCR) and sequencing of products, will enable very precise description of strains, {{according to the}} oligonucleotide primers designed and target gene. Methods for IBV antigens detection may employ labelled antibodies, such as direct immunofluorescence or <b>immunoperoxidase.</b> Antibodies to IBV may be detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test, ELISA and Haemagglutination inhibition (haemagglutinating IBV produced after enzymatic treatment by phospholipase C).|$|E
50|$|At that time, {{electron}} microscopic {{demonstration of}} the virus particles within {{the nucleus of the}} cell was the only available way of confirming papillomavirus infection. In contradistinction to other viruses affecting the genital tract (e.g. herpes), confirmation by culture was not possible (and still is not possible) by conventional virological methods. Nor could the diagnosis be confirmed by <b>immunoperoxidase</b> testing or by HPV DNA and RNA hybridisation techniques (the latter subsequently widely used), which at that time had not yet been developed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{laboratory}} test is not straightforward, and all currently available tests have their limitations. The cheapest and most easily available serological test is the Weil-Felix test, {{but this is}} notoriously unreliable. [...] The gold standard is indirect immunofluorescence, but the main limitation of this method is the availability of fluorescent microscopes, which are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. Indirect <b>immunoperoxidase,</b> a modification of the standard IFA method, {{can be used with}} a light microscope, and the results of these tests are comparable to those from IFA. [...] Rapid bedside kits have been described that produce a result within one hour, but the availability of these tests is severely limited by their cost. [...] Serological methods are most reliable when a four-fold rise in antibody titre is found. If the patient is from a nonendemic area, then diagnosis can be made from a single acute serum sample. [...] In patients from endemic areas, this is not possible because antibodies may be found in up to 18% of healthy individuals.|$|E

40|$|Sixty five {{renal biopsy}} {{specimens}} {{were used to}} compare a direct immunofluorescence technique on frozen sections with <b>immunoperoxidase</b> techniques on paraffin wax sections. For the <b>immunoperoxidase</b> techniques, dewaxed sections were treated with protease at 37 degrees C. Sections were examined at intervals on a microscope and digestion was stopped when plasma was removed from glomerular capillary loops. This permitted intense staining of immunoproteins on <b>immunoperoxidase.</b> There was agreement between <b>immunoperoxidase</b> and immunofluorescence in the staining for IgG, IgA, and IgM in 50 biopsy specimens and discordant findings {{did not affect the}} diagnosis. <b>Immunoperoxidase</b> did not detect C 3 in 16 biopsy specimens. Findings with antiserum to another complement component, C 9, detected by <b>immunoperoxidase</b> correlated with C 3 findings detected by immunofluorescence in 17 biopsy specimens. It is concluded that microscopical observation of the progress of digestion permits optimal staining by <b>immunoperoxidase</b> methods, thus overcoming the problem of variability in proteolytic digestion of sections. Inconsistency in the demonstration of complement deposition can be avoided by staining for C 9 rather than C 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{indirect}} <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique with type-specific antisera {{was compared}} to kinetic neutralization for the typing of herpes simplex virus strains.

The <b>immunoperoxidase</b> method identified herpes simplex virus-infected cells in 91 % of vesicular lesions which were positive by standard virological culture. At later stages, the number of cases that could be diagnosed decreased appreciably. The <b>immunoperoxidase</b> method appears to be a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of early herpes simplex virus infection...|$|E
40|$|The <b>immunoperoxidase</b> method, using commercially {{available}} antisera, was compared with standard virological methods for {{the identification and}} typing of 77 isolates of human myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses.

With the <b>immunoperoxidase</b> method there was one false negative reaction, but no false positive reactions. Cross-reactivity between influenza A (soluble) and A 2 /HK antisera with influenza A isolates was noted, but did {{not interfere with the}} interpretation of results. It is concluded that the <b>immunoperoxidase</b> method is ideally suited for the rapid identification and typing of common human respiratory viruses on a routine basis.

40|$|The {{results of}} <b>immunoperoxidase</b> {{staining}} of 33 routinely processed renal biopsies {{correlated with the}} results of direct immunofluorescence in 79 % of tests performed. Most of the discrepant results were due to positive <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining, possibly reflecting greater sensitivity of the method. A comparison of two <b>immunoperoxidase</b> methods showed that the indirect method produced less intense staining than the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method when equivalent primary antibody titres were used. Lowering the primary antibody titres for the indirect technique resulted in equivalent staining by the two methods. Predigestion by protease VII effectively revealed the antigens under study without causing tissue damage or section loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{indirect}} <b>immunoperoxidase</b> {{technique was}} assessed for the serodiagnosis of tsutsugamushi fever (scrub typhus). The antigens were peritoneal smears prepared from mice infected intraperitoneally with the Karp, Kato, and Gilliam strains of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi. Treatment of the mice with cyclophosphamide apparently {{increased the number}} of the rickettsiae, and it minimized the exudate that interfered with the specific staining. The rickettsiae were seen as clusters in the juxtanuclear region of the mesothelial cells and also as free particles outside of the cells. By the indirect <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique, the sera from all of the patients (49 samples from 30 patients) were positive for the R. tsutsugamushi antibody. The antibody titers (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM) determined by the indirect <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique correlated with those determined by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Thus, the indirect <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique was useful for quantifying both IgG and IgM antibodies to the rickettsia...|$|E

40|$|Immunophenotyping by {{flow cytometry}} and frozen-section <b>immunoperoxidase</b> was {{compared}} on 21 consecutive {{lymph node biopsy}} specimens, of which a diagnosis of lymphoma was made for 11 specimens. Samples for flow cytometry were obtained by a fine-needle aspiration technique. Concordance between frozen-section <b>immunoperoxidase</b> and flow cytometry for all routine markers on all specimens ranged from 76 to 100 %. In general, B-cell markers showed poorer concordance than T-cell markers, with kappa and lambda light chains having the poorest concordance, at 76 % each. Flow cytometry was significantly more sensitive (90 versus 30 %; P < 0. 006) and had a significantly higher negative predictive value (100 versus 63 %; P < 0. 006) than frozen-section <b>immunoperoxidase</b> for demonstrating light-chain restriction. There {{was no significant difference}} in the specificities (100 versus 91 %) or positive predictive values (100 % each) between the two methods. Both methods demonstrated characteristic immunophenotypes for intermediate cell lymphomas, small lymphocytic lymphomas, and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas. Frozen-section <b>immunoperoxidase</b> and flow cytometry appear to be significantly concordant methods for immunophenotypic analysis of lymph node biopsies. Light-chain restriction is more readily demonstrated by flow cytometry than frozen-section <b>immunoperoxidase.</b> We believe that ex vivo fine-needle aspiration is a simple and reliable method of obtaining cell suspensions of lymph nodes for flow cytometry...|$|E
40|$|Sixty carcinoid tumours {{were tested}} in a {{retrospective}} study with an <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique using a monoclonal antibody against serotonin immunoreactive sites, with argyrophil staining using the Grimelius technique, and with argentaffin staining using the Masson-Fontana technique. A good correlation between all three techniques in the diagnosis of ileal carcinoid tumour was found, but the <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique showed greater sensitivity than the Masson-Fontana technique and greater specificity than the Grimelius technique in the diagnosis of foregut and hindgut carcinoid tumours. The <b>immunoperoxidase</b> technique with a monoclonal antibody against serotonin immunoreactive sites (YC 5 / 45) is recommended as a sensitive and specific test for carcinoid tumours.

40|$|The <b>immunoperoxidase</b> {{method was}} applied to the {{identification}} of Urea-plasma urealyticum serotypes. The assay used highly diluted antisera and could be run directly on primary plate isolates. It was ideal for detecting and identifying mixed serotypes because stained and unstained colonies could be visualized simultaneously by conventional light microscopy. Antisera run against eight serotypes revealed one-way cross-reactions between serotypes 3 and 5 and antiserum to 2, and between serotype 4 and antiserum to 8, at dilutions of less than 1 : 150. This cross-reactivity could be diluted out at the optimal antiserum dilution for the <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay, but not for the growth inhibition assay or immunofluorescence test. The <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay therefore proved ideal for serotyping U. urealyticum...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a simple and}} rapid dot <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay for the direct detection of parvovirus B 19 capsid antigens in human sera. The assay was performed with serum specimens dotted onto nylon membranes. VP 1 and VP 2 B 19 antigens, which represent 4 and 96 % of the capsid, respectively, were detected with a pool of monoclonal antibodies directed against the two proteins, and the complex was visualized by <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining. The assay could be performed in about 4 h, and positive results were revealed {{at the end of}} the reaction as dark blue spots on the nylon membrane at the site of positive specimens. A total of 541 serum samples from different subjects and with different laboratory evaluations with regard to B 19 infection were analyzed. The results obtained by the dot <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay were compared with the results obtained for the presence of B 19 DNA by dot blot hybridization and nested PCR. With optimized working conditions, the dot <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay was able to detect the presence of B 19 with a sensitivity comparable or slightly higher than that achieved by dot blot hybridization but less than that achieved by nested PCR. Since the level of sensitivity of the dot <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay proved to be appropriate for the detection of acute B 19 infection, and since the cost, time to a result, and versatility of the assay are important issues, from our evaluation, the dot <b>immunoperoxidase</b> assay described may be particularly suitable for large-scale screening of samples and a good alternative to DNA detection methods in the routine laboratory evaluation of B 19 infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>immunoperoxidase</b> {{staining}} and centrifugation on the sensitivity and rapidity of {{herpes simplex virus}} detection in mink lung cell cultures was determined with 730 clinical specimens. In standard tube cultures, the use of <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining resulted in detection of 31 (91 %) of 34 positive cultures after overnight incubation, compared with 25 (74 %) detected without the stain (P less than 0. 05). The effect of centrifugation of specimens onto the monolayer followed by overnight incubation and <b>immunoperoxidase</b> staining was studied with 431 specimens. Of 107 positive specimens, 103 (96 %) were detected by this method, compared with 91 (85 %) detected in standard cell cultures observed for 5 days (P less than 0. 02). Standard cell cultures that were examined after overnight incubation detected only 62 (58 %) of the 107 positive specimens (P less than 0. 001).
