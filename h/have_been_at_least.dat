5|$|The Scandinavian {{influence}} in Scotland was probably {{at its height}} in the mid eleventh century {{during the time of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man. The permanent Scandinavian holdings in Scotland at that time must therefore <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a quarter of the land area of modern Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{world premiere}} of Dialogues des Carmélites (in Italian, as Dialoghi delle Carmelitane) was {{recorded}} and has been released on CD.

5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, although there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania {{and other parts of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|After what {{is later}} {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three months, Daniel is {{finally able to}} reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but never got it to work properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn {{of the death of}} Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past {{with the help of the}} time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet another new loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the loops, and O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a long look at Carter.|$|E

5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal seemed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if {{the position of the}} blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} that there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing {{all the people that}} lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{is now a}} ruin, and {{all that}} remains above ground is a large grey {{sandstone}} wall, {{which has been the}} only remnant of any building on the site since at least the early 18th century. It includes two large tracery windows, decorated by red sandstone, which stand out against the grey. Red sandstone also appears {{at both ends of the}} walls, suggesting at least two more windows, and meaning that the wall would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> twice the length of the surviving fragment when built. Beneath the large windows are two smaller ones, suggestive of an undercroft, and a flue runs between the sets of windows. The wall fragment is thought to be 14th century, likely dating from the reconstruction in 1354.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} {{inspired}} two theme park rides: one at Universal Studios Florida, which closed in January 2012, {{and one at}} Universal Studios Japan. There is also an animatronic version of {{a scene from the}} film on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two musical adaptations: JAWS The Musical!, which premiered in 2004 at the Minnesota Fringe Festival, and , which premiered in 2006 at the Toronto Fringe Festival. Three video games based on the film were released: 1987's Jaws, developed by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System; 2006's Jaws Unleashed by Majesco Entertainment for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC; and 2011's Jaws: Ultimate Predator, also by Majesco, for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii. A mobile game was released in 2010 for the iPhone. Aristocrat made an officially licensed slot machine based on the movie.|$|E
5|$|The inner chamber {{measures}} 4.5 metres (13 feet) in length, and 1.7 metres (5 feet, 6 inches) in width, {{although it}} was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber's internal height would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 2 metres (6 feet, 6 inches). In its current state, the northern side of the chamber {{is made up of}} two slabs. One is 2.44 metres (8 feet) long, 2.29 metres (7 feet, 6 inches) deep, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) thick; the other is 1.52 centimetres (5 feet) long, 1.83 (6 feet) deep, and 61 centimetres (2 feet) thick. Conversely, the chamber's southern side consists of a single slab, measuring 3.45 metres (11 feet, 4 inches) in length, 2.21 metres (7 feet, 3 inches) in depth, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) in thickness at its eastern end.|$|E

50|$|Premier Jiang Yi-huah {{stated that}} there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five blasts around the city. The blasts cut gas {{supplies}} to 23,600 households, electricity to 12,000 households, {{and water to}} 8,000 households.|$|R
5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53m (174ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the bowsprit and beakhead were included. The width was 12.9m (42ft) and {{was defined as the}} widest point between the frames, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 66m (217ft).|$|E
5|$|The poem {{has been}} adapted to film twice, on both {{occasions}} by writer-director Stephen Weeks: first as Gawain and the Green Knight in 1973 {{and again in}} 1984 as , featuring Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain and Sean Connery as the Green Knight. Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected. French/Australian director Martin Beilby directed a short (30') film adaptation in 2014. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two television adaptations, Gawain and the Green Knight in 1991 and the animated Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what {{are believed to be}} the actual locations.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Frazier strike, the Twin Wells, just {{to the south of}} the Frazier Well, also struck oil. In May1865, A. P. Duncan and George C. Prather {{purchased}} the Holmden Farm, including the portions still leased to United States Petroleum, for $25,000 and a bonus of $75,000. The wooded bluff overlooking the Frazier and Twin Wells was cleared and a town was laid out. The town was divided into 500lots, which were put up for sale on May24. By July, the population was estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 2,000. The population of Pithole rose to 15,000people in September and 20,000 by Christmas. Pithole was incorporated as a borough on November 30, 1865.|$|E
50|$|Notably, {{the festival}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> headlined or co-headlined by Paul van Dyk in every year except 2005 and 2008. The festival <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{partially}} broadcast on BBC Radio 1 between 2006-2008.|$|R
