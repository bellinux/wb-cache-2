Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines,</b> were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The RAPD-typing showed that there are many different RAPD-types involved in the recontamination of pasteurised milk. Several of the milk contaminating RAPD-types were found in condensed water on <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> nozzles, in waste-water at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> and in air surrounding <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> Some contaminating RAPD-types were present inside <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> over long periods, especially at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>The</b> effect on post-pasteurisation contamination by reducing the usage of water around <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> was studied.

B. cereus were involved in, and sometimes solely responsible for, the spoilage of pasteurised milk. The B. cereus infection can originate from heat-resistant spores present in the raw milk, but B. cereus can also enter the milk at the dairy plant.
