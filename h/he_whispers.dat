25|$|Ashby {{returns with}} the {{captured}} Ramerrez gang member, Castro. Upon seeing his leader, Johnson, in the saloon, Castro agrees to lead Rance, Ashby and the miners {{in a search}} for Ramerrez, and the group then follows him on a false trail and in what {{turns out to be a}} wild goose chase. But before Castro leaves, <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> to Johnson that somebody will whistle and Johnson must reply to confirm that the place is clear. A whistle is heard, but Johnson fails to reply.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} hours after Fiona enacted her curse {{on the entire}} town that engulfed {{everyone}} after the wedding. However, Henry, who is spared, thanks to being the Author and having the Heart of the Truest Believer, wakes up with the Storybook in his hands, and starts searching for his family. After running into Archie, he tells Henry that Emma is at the hospital, where she has been committed to a psychiatric ward {{for the past two}} years. While visiting Emma, he learns that with Fiona's Curse, Regina's original curse was never broken, and Emma had stopped believing him. He asks her where Snow, Hook and David are, but the new Curse now has Emma believing that these events never happened, citing that she has made so much progress and can’t go back, then tells Henry to stop telling her about these stories. Suddenly Fiona (who is now the Mayor and Henry's mother) arrives and takes the book from Henry, but before he leaves <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> in Emma's ear to tell her to resist, as the Final Battle is coming.|$|E
500|$|Although Eko survives the implosion, he is dragged {{away by a}} polar bear. Locke and Charlie later rescue him {{and pull}} him to safety. In [...] "The Cost of Living", Eko awakens to find Yemi in his tent, telling him he needs to confess before finding [...] his tent is on fire. Searching for Yemi, he soon decides to follow Locke, Desmond, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro) to the Pearl station. While waiting outside, he sees Yemi again, and follows the {{apparition}} to give his confession. Upon learning it is merely a deception, Eko grows angry and chases Yemi into the jungle, where he confronts the [...] "Monster". After being thrown about by the Monster, Eko is finally thrown to the ground. Fatally wounded, <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> [...] "I saw the Devil" [...] to Locke before dying, although Locke, for whatever reason, decides to tell Sayid he said, [...] "We're next." [...] As he dies, we see an image of Eko and Yemi as happy children, walking into the distance. In one of the flashforwards in the final episode of the fourth season, Hurley is seen {{sitting at a table}} with a chessboard on it across from a seemingly empty seat. Before he leaves, Hurley says: [...] "Checkmate, Mr. Eko." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I smell lion near," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered,</b> searching {{among the}} reed stems with his eyes. [...] "I see lion," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> again, and pointed, but I {{could see nothing}} save the stems of the reeds.|$|R

60|$|Mr Bethany stooped quickly. 'What is it, what is it?' <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The final KLF Info sheet {{discussed}} the retirement in a typically offbeat fashion, and asked [...] "What happens to 'Footnotes in rock legend'? Do they gather dust with Ashton Gardner and Dyke, The Vapors, and the Utah Saints, or does their influence {{live on in}} unseen ways, permeating future cultures? A passing general of a private army has the answer. 'No', <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> 'but the dust they gather is of the rarest quality. Each speck a universe awaiting creation, Big Bang just a dawn away'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Harry bears a great {{resemblance}} to his father, {{it is often}} noted that he has Lily's eyes. Dumbledore has said that Harry's deepest nature is much more similar to his mother's. In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated; [...] "Harry has his father's and mother's good looks. But he has his mother's eyes, and that's very important in a future book". That future book was Deathly Hallows. In Snape's death scene in that novel, after having passed on his memories to Harry, <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> to Harry: [...] "Look... at... me..." [...] In one of Snape's memories, it is revealed that Dumbledore persuades Snape to protect Harry after Lily's death by mentioning {{the fact that he}} has [...] "precisely" [...] the same eyes as his mother. His last words to Harry were simply a desire to see Lily's eyes before he died.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "murderer" [...] that he {{was hunting}} had never {{actually}} killed anyone, but he had manipulated others to kill for him, subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts {{as nothing more than}} a momentary passion. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself, as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted, as he did not legally do anything wrong. It is revealed at the end of Curtain that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from arthritis, {{to give the impression that}} he is more infirm than he is. His last recorded words are [...] "Cher ami!", spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room. (The TV adaptation adds that as Poirot is dying alone, <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> out his final prayer to God in these words: [...] "Forgive me... forgive...") Poirot was buried at Styles, and his funeral was arranged by his best friend Hastings and Hastings' daughter Judith. Hastings reasoned, [...] "Here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country. He was to lie here at the last." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "'"Well - I'll be blowed" [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered,</b> [...] "such {{a little}} devil".|$|R

6000|$|Thornton {{knelt down}} by Buck's side. He took {{his head in}} his two hands and rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his wont, or murmur soft love curses; but <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> in his ear. [...] "As you love me, Buck. As you love me," [...] was what <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b> Buck whined with {{suppressed}} eagerness.|$|R
60|$|BLOOM: (Quickly) O, {{the very}} man! (<b>He</b> <b>whispers)</b> Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.|$|E
6000|$|... 'England!' <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> {{soft and}} harsh, [...] 'England!' {{repeated}} he, [...] 'And briar, and rose, and mavis, [...] A-singing in yon high tree.|$|E
60|$|WAITER. Yes, sir. (He glides swiftly {{round the}} table to Phil's left elbow. On his way <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> to the young waiter) Thick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your hand {{is asleep}} in my hand's arms," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b> The ball of his thumb pressed her thumb, and <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> once more: [...] "See. Now our hands are kissing each other--we--we must watch them better.... Your thumb {{is like a}} fairy." [...] Again his thumb, {{hardened}} with file and wrench and steering-wheel, touched hers. It was startlingly like a kiss of real lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "And once dead," [...] {{said the}} chiefs, [...] "wizards work no more spells," [...] and <b>he</b> bent and <b>whispered</b> in the induna's ear, {{looking at the}} assegai in his hand as <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{held her}} tremblingly; {{she bent over}} toward him; his mouth wet her ear; <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispers,</b> {{with his}} eyes screwed up, after tasting it, [...] "this ain't the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. This is eighteenpenny!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He seats {{himself by}} her side, and feasts {{his eyes on}} the lovely downcast face that dares not turn toward him. <b>He</b> <b>whispers</b> to her: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "England!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> {{soft and}} harsh, [...] "England!" [...] {{repeated}} he, [...] "And briar, and rose, and mavis, [...] A-singing in yon high tree.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>whispered</b> the words. No {{unfamiliar}} {{words could}} {{have had the same}} effect of comfort and conviction.|$|R
6000|$|He {{would not}} answer. [...] "Aspirations," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b> <b>He</b> {{fell into a}} broken monologue, {{regardless}} of me. [...] "Trailing clouds of glory," [...] he said, and [...] "first-rate poet, first-rate....George was always hard. Always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Harry, peeping {{over the}} blind; [...] "I see it;" [...] and then, {{with a sudden}} jump, <b>he</b> <b>whispered,</b> [...] "Tony! it's moving." [...] Tony did not answer for a moment, and then <b>he</b> hurriedly <b>whispered</b> back, [...] "That's so! It is moving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] he {{continued}} sadly, [...] "I {{do not understand}} him, <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> so softly that, though I hear, I cannot comprehend. I wonder why this is so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [LEMMY {{goes down}} to THE PRESS, who is reading over his last [...] note. Everyone watches and listens with the utmost discretion, [...] while <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> into the ear of THE PRESS; who shakes his head [...] violently.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a lovely}} altar-cloth," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> to me, with an enthusiasm that only makes one sorrow for him the more, so utterly {{impossible}} does it cause all hope of cure to seem. [...] "And they've got a coffin in the north crypt that is simply a poem. I never enjoyed a sarcophagus more in all my life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Opening quote: [...] "Now we've got eyes — eyes — a {{beautiful}} pair of children's eyes," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... 'Certainly--certainly!' the King muttered, and beckoned to Haigha. 'Open the bag!' <b>he</b> <b>whispered.</b> 'Quick! Not that one--that's full of hay!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} Uncle Silas {{is going to}} hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him up, I'd hang him." [...] And whilst the nigger stepped {{to the door to}} look at the dime and bite it {{to see if it was}} good, <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> to Jim and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. The man, this time, is the Captain. The {{woman is}} {{agitated}} by {{something that he}} is saying to her. He seems {{to be trying to}} persuade her to go away with him.

6000|$|Waggle's {{belief in}} his friend amounts to frantic adoration. 'What a genius he is, {{if he would}} but apply himself!' <b>he</b> <b>whispers</b> to me. 'He could be anything, sir, but for his passions. His poems are the most {{beautiful}} things you ever saw. He's written a continuation of [...] "Don Juan," [...] from his own adventures. Did you ever read his lines to Mary? They're superior to Byron, sir--superior to Byron.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Something broken,' <b>he</b> <b>whispered,</b> {{lifting his}} head a little, and turning his eyes towards me in his hopelessly crushed attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kiss me, then," [...] <b>he</b> <b>whispered,</b> hoarsely, blindly leaning down. [...] "It's hell--to leave you!... Wonderful girl--treasure--precious--Allie!... Kiss me--enough!... I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The hurrahs were repeated, {{drowning}} {{the faint}} organ notes. Jude's face changed more: <b>he</b> <b>whispered</b> slowly, his parched lips scarcely moving: ...|$|R
