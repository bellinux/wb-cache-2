5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when {{he was trying to do}} so.|$|E
5|$|The lavish {{illumination}} programme is {{far greater}} than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three pages with the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages for the first <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable {{that there were other}} pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there are a host of smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.|$|E

5|$|Royal marriages of the 19th {{century were}} {{arranged}} to secure alliances {{and to maintain}} blood ties among the European nations. As early as 1851, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her German-born husband, Prince Albert, were making plans to marry their eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, to Frederick. The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband. The monarchs desired to maintain their family's blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage {{would lead to the}} liberalization and modernization of Prussia. King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of the British monarch and consort, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured Baron Stockmar's idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia. Frederick's father, Prince William, had no interest in the arrangement, hoping instead for a Russian Grand Duchess as his daughter-in-law. However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain. In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the Great Exhibition but in truth she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert's daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> English, while Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison {{recalls that}} he was {{inspired}} to write [...] "The Inner Light" [...] by Juan Mascaró, a Sanskrit scholar at Cambridge University. Mascaró had taken part in a debate, televised on The Frost Programme on 4 October 1967, during which Harrison and John Lennon discussed the merits of Transcendental Meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders. In a subsequent letter to Harrison, dated 16 November, Mascaró expressed {{the hope that they}} might meet again before the Beatles departed for India, where the group were to study meditation with their guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Mascaró enclosed a copy of his book Lamps of Fire, an anthology of religious writings, including from Lao-Tzu's Tao Te Ching. Having stated his admiration for the spiritual message in Harrison's composition [...] "Within You Without You", Mascaró enquired: [...] "might it not be interesting to put into your music a <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Tao, for example no. 48, page 66 of Lamps?" ...|$|E

500|$|On August 18, {{after having}} {{traveled}} the last [...] without reliable grass or water, the Rose–Baley Party located a field and a spring that were sufficient {{to satisfy their}} stock. That night, despite posting round-the-clock guards, a mare and a mule went missing, and three searchers were sent to find them. They tracked the animals to a deep canyon, where Native Americans hiding in the rocks shot arrows at them. Savedra noticed the Natives watching the party from the nearby foothills the following day, {{and was able to}} draw them into camp using sign language. In Baley's opinion, the Natives were most likely Hualapai. They could speak a <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Spanish and English, and Savedra was able to communicate with them using their dialect and sign language. They admitted to having the group's missing animals, but insisted that the Mohave had stolen them. They repeatedly thumped their chest while uttering, [...] "Hanna, Hanna", meaning [...] "good" [...] Native, insisting that the Mohave were [...] "bad" [...] Natives.|$|E
500|$|At {{their home}} in Waterloo on Sunday, July 16, the M'Clintocks hosted a smaller {{planning}} session for the convention. Mary Ann M'Clintock and her eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr., discussed with Stanton {{the makeup of the}} resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval. Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed. Taken together, the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family, education, jobs, religion, and morals. One of the M'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 {{as a model for the}} declaration they wanted to make at their convention. The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted in the parlor on a round, three-legged, mahogany tea table. Stanton changed a <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women, replacing [...] "The history of the present King of Great Britain" [...] with [...] "The history of mankind" [...] as the basis for [...] "usurpations on the part of man toward woman." [...] The women added the phrase [...] "and women" [...] to make [...] "...all men and women are created equal..." [...] A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration.|$|E
500|$|Augustus Jones {{had learned}} of the band's {{troubles}} and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John {{to live with him}} at his farm in Saltfleet Township, with their stepmother and halfsiblings. [...] As he knew only a <b>few</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> English, Peter was enrolled in a one-room school in Stoney Creek. With the help of the local teacher, George Hughes, Peter learned English. The next year, the family moved to Brantford, where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming. [...] Sarah Tekarihogan's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford. [...] Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name [...] "Desagondensta", meaning [...] "he stands people on their feet". [...] Jones was baptised Anglican by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820, but internally he did not accept Christianity. [...] Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father, his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion, the conduct of the white Christian settlers [...] "drunk, quarreling, fighting and cheating the poor Indians, and acting as if there was no God" [...] convinced him there could be no truth in their religion. [...] He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada, with all the privileges it entailed. [...] Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised, Jones expected it to have no effect upon him. [...] Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822, when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother-in-law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling. [...] He attended school in Fairchild's Creek during the winter of 18223 studying arithmetic and writing, hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the fur trade. [...] In spring 1823, Jones left the school, returning to his father's farm that May.|$|E
