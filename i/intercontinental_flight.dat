5|$|Aviation {{service was}} pioneered {{in the early}} 20th century in colonial Dutch East Indies. On 1 October 1924, KLM started its first <b>intercontinental</b> <b>flight,</b> {{connecting}} Amsterdam to Batavia (now Jakarta) in a Fokker F-VII airplane. By September 1929 KLM had started regularly scheduled service between Amsterdam and Batavia. The route connected Amsterdam to Marseille, Rome, Brindisi, Athens, Merza Matruh, Cairo, Gaza, Baghdad, Bushire, Lingeh, Ojask, Gwadar, Karachi, Jodhpur, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok, Alor Star, Medan, Palembang, and Batavia, and extended to Bandung. Until {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, this was the world's longest-distance scheduled service.|$|E

The Savoia-Marchetti SM.95 four engined {{airliner}} was used on European routes up to 1949. On 31 October 1957, Alitalia merged with Linee Aeree Italiane and {{took on the}} name of Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane. Alitalia was owned by the Italian Ministry of the Treasury (49%), other shareholders, including employees (49%) and Air France-KLM (2%, now: 25%).|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} {{changes in}} the supply of non-stop <b>intercontinental</b> <b>flights</b> from European airports. We take advantage of OAG data for air services from a rich sample of European airports to intercontinental destinations in the period 2004 - 2008. Results of the empirical analysis indicate a tendency towards a more balanced distribution of <b>intercontinental</b> <b>flights</b> across European airports. We also find that the demographic size of a region, its sector specialization, the political role of its central city {{and the proportion of}} connecting traffic explain the amount of and changes in long-haul air services supplied from European airports. airports, air transportation, <b>intercontinental</b> <b>flights...</b>|$|R
