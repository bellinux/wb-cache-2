5|$|Males {{begin to}} {{increase}} in size {{at a faster rate}} with each successive moult after the seventh <b>instar.</b> Females, on the other hand, produce their first brood at the seventh <b>instar.</b> They may moult several times as adults, becoming sexually receptive each time until death. The average lifespan of C.mutica in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of C. graminis {{have four}} <b>instar</b> stages, though the first <b>instar</b> may not possess the {{characteristics}} of the later instars. Larvae are brown, and dorsally convex with spiracles evident on eight segments. They usually have small, indistinct tubercles with very short setae. The head of each larva is a darker brown than the body and has six ocelli on each side. The mandibles have five apical teeth.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final <b>instar.</b> Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first <b>instar</b> {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E
40|$|For {{determination}} {{of the number of}} larval <b>instars</b> of Stromatium longicorne Newman, head width and head length were measured. Judging from the frequency distributions of these measurements we concluded that this longicorn beetle has five larval <b>instars.</b> But except the first larval <b>instars,</b> the difference among those from the second larval <b>instars</b> to the fifth larval <b>instars</b> is not obvious. Comparing with the first larval <b>instars</b> and the fifth larval <b>instars,</b> they are extremely different in size-the head size of those of the fifth larval <b>instars</b> is 10 to 12 times larger than that of the first larval <b>instars.</b> Although the three experimental formulae on larval growth of Dyer, Gaines-Empbell and Tokunaga did not show good results, Tokunaga's formula was comparatively adaptable. The growth of young larval <b>instars</b> is quite slow. It takes 2 to 3 years to complete its life-cycles...|$|R
50|$|Most {{scales in}} this family have four female <b>instars</b> and five male <b>instars.</b> Members of the genus Gallacoccus have only three female <b>instars</b> however. The females form galls which are often quite ornate. In some species the first <b>instars</b> seem to act as {{soldiers}} and attempt to guard the gall. Adult males appear to develop inside the female galls.|$|R
50|$|There are {{examples}} of holometabolic species {{in which there are}} certain striking differences between the earliest <b>instars</b> and the later <b>instars,</b> though without their generally being regarded as hypermetamorphic. For example, early <b>instars</b> of many Papilionidae are of a colour, shape and texture that suggest bird droppings; later <b>instars</b> that are larger and would simply stand out in such camouflage, typically become leaf-green.|$|R
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each <b>instar,</b> the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval <b>instar.</b>|$|E
5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive <b>instar</b> as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first <b>instar</b> (the planidium) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The blister beetle Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go {{in search of the}} eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a carabid beetle. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a scarabaeid larva – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each <b>instar</b> becoming {{larger and}} more like an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{first and}} second female and male <b>instars</b> of the white mango scale, Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead (Coccoidea: Diaspididae), are {{described}} and illustrated. Morphological differences between the {{first and second}} <b>instars</b> of this species are compared and discussed. A key to differentiate between the first- and second-instars, key to sexual dimorphism in the first nymphal <b>instars</b> and key to sexual dimorphism in the second nymphal <b>instars,</b> were constructed...|$|R
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the beet {{leafhopper}} consists of three stages: eggs, nymphs and adults. The insects grow through 5 different molts during development which provides 5 <b>instars</b> before they reach adulthood. The growth patterns {{in the size of}} the <b>instars</b> follow a sigmoidal curve which means that there is greatest increase in size among younger <b>instars</b> and the rate of growth decreases as the <b>instars</b> reach adulthood.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have black}} heads and {{resemble}} the caterpillars of lepidopterans. Females have six <b>instars</b> and males have five. The first three <b>instars</b> are yellowish-green, and the later <b>instars</b> have black longitudinal stripes with patches {{of yellow and}} white on a bluish and black background.|$|R
5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third <b>instar.</b> Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that attract polistine wasps, which are predators of early <b>instar</b> caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract ants. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early the embryo, and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in the embryo, or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second <b>instar</b> the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last <b>instar,</b> or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
40|$|Over 400 {{tree species}} are primary or {{secondary}} hosts of gypsy moth. Interactions between host plant compounds and a viral pathogen such as {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (NPV) in vivo may explain gypsy moth host preference in later <b>instars.</b> Phenolic extracts from pines negatively affected growth of 2 nd and 3 rd but not 4 th <b>instars</b> when incorporated into artificial diet at low concentrations. The aglycone quercetin, and two of its glycosides found in pines, rutin and quercetin- 3 -O-glucoside, also reduced growth for 2 nd and 3 rd <b>instars.</b> When 3 rd <b>instars</b> were dosed with NPV (60, 000 PIBs/larva) and fed pine extract (0. 1 %) in diet, growth was reduced and mortality increased. Survivorship to adulthood was not significantly higher than control for 3 rd <b>instars</b> fed pine extracts over a range of viral doses, nor was it higher for 4 th <b>instars</b> dosed at 60, 000 PIBs/larvae. The three flavonoids also tended to have negative and synergistic effects on growth and survivorship of 3 rd and 4 th <b>instars</b> does with 60, 000 PIBs/larva. These results suggest that early <b>instars</b> of gypsy moth are quite sensitive to pine phenolics in diet, {{which may explain why}} they do not feed on pines in those <b>instars.</b> Gypsy moth is more tolerant of pine phenolics in later <b>instars</b> but these results do not support the hypothesis that gypsy moth later <b>instars</b> which feed on plant hosts such as pine, gain some protection from infectivity of NPV due to the phenolics present in those hosts...|$|R
40|$|The 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th, and 6 th <b>instars</b> of {{the cotton}} leaf worm Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval, 1833) were treated with lead acetate, 100 mg lead [Pb (C 2 H 3 O 2) 4]/kg, using the leaf-dip method, toevaluate the effect of Pb on {{nutritional}} indices. The consumption index was significantly increasedat the 3 rd and 6 th <b>instars.</b> The growth rate significantly increased in 4 th <b>instars.</b> The reverse wastrue in 6 th <b>instars.</b> The absorptive capacity, in terms of approximate digestibility, wasinsignificantly changed in the entire <b>instars.</b> The food utilization efficiencies, in terms of theconversion of ingested (ECI) and digested food (ECD) to biomass, were significantly increased in 4 th <b>instars.</b> However, the ECD was significantly decreased in the 5 th and 6 th <b>instars.</b> In conclusion,treatment with lead may adversely affect the population biomass of S. littoralis due to the grossreduction in the final weight gain of larvae approaching to pupation. This might lead to reducedlevel of population size...|$|R
40|$|Published: 10 March 2015 Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} reared parasitoid from larval light brown apple moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), feeding on grapevines in Australia. In order to evaluate the efficiency of searching behaviour of D. tasmanica, a laboratory study was undertaken to determine how this wasp responds to the susceptible stages of larval LBAM. Observations of searching behaviour were made in a wind tunnel, which allowed the wasp to express its full range of behaviour. The behaviour of D. tasmanica and susceptibility of LBAM to parasitism varies significantly among <b>instars.</b> The wasp most readily parasitises newly hatched larvae, but can parasitise the first three of the six <b>instars.</b> The first <b>instars</b> cause less damage and also produce less faeces and silk than later <b>instars,</b> so they are associated with less volatile cues that may be detected by the parasitoid. Flight initiation to an infested leaf was lower {{in the presence of}} first <b>instars</b> compared with second and third <b>instars.</b> The flight duration was shortest when females were exposed to plants infested by third <b>instars.</b> An analysis of the sequence and timing of searching behaviour indicated that females respond differently to each of the <b>instars</b> of LBAM.

5|$|While the {{development}} of wings in insects is clearly defined in those {{who are members of}} Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage, therefore they must have a different wing morphogenesis. Insects such as those that are hemimetabolic have wings that start out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last <b>instar</b> of the nymph.|$|E
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first <b>instar</b> larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second <b>instar.</b> They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} food {{availability}} {{and the presence}} of the parasite, Plagiorchis elegans, on the probability of Aedes aegypti preimagos to transform from one immature stage to the next over consecutive 24 - or 48 -hour periods of time were determined. Under conditions of low food availability, 24 - and 48 -hr transition probabilities of all larval <b>instars,</b> to the next were reduced. Increases in food availability reversed this process, causing significant decreases in same-stage transition probabilities. However, as transition to successive stages increased among first, second, third and fourth <b>instars,</b> there was concomitant significant increase in first and fourth preimago mortality. Addition of Plagiorchis elegans cercariae caused significant decreases in the 24 and 48 -hour same-state probabilities for all pre-imago stages. Successive stage transitions for first, second and third <b>instars</b> were significantly increased while those of fourth <b>instars</b> and pupae were significantly decreased following exposure to the parasites. The mortality of all preimago stages significantly increased with exposure to parasite, but was highest among fourth <b>instars</b> and pupae. There were strong food-by-parasite interaction effects among first, second and third <b>instars.</b> Differences in transition probabilities increased with increasing food levels between controlled and parasite-exposed groups. The opposite was true for fourth <b>instars</b> and pupae. While there was no significant interactive effect between food {{and the presence of}} the parasite on pupae regardless of food concentration, this was not true for mortality probabilities among fourth <b>instars.</b> Significantly more fourth <b>instars</b> died in response to parasite exposure and there were significant interactive effects of food and parasites on the probability of fourth <b>instars</b> transformation to pupae over 48 hrs...|$|R
50|$|The {{first and}} second <b>instars</b> are Batesian mimics of black ants, while bigger <b>instars</b> and adults, neither of which are ant mimics, are predators of those same ants.|$|R
50|$|Larvae are gregarious {{and yellow}} at first. Later <b>instars</b> are solitary, and whitish-green with white tubercules along the back, and small black dots. Five <b>instars,</b> maximum length 70-75 mm.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of tracheation of the wings begin before the wing histoblast form, {{as it is}} important to note that they develop near a large trachea. During the fourth <b>instar,</b> cells from the epithelium of this trachea become greatly enlarged extend into the cavity of the wing bud, with each cell having developed a closely coiled tracheole. Each trachcole is of unicellular origin, and is at first intracellular in position; while tracheae are of multicellular origin and the lumen of each is intercellular in position. The {{development of}} tracheoles, each coiled within a single cell of the epithelium of a trachea, and the subsequent opening of communication between the tracheoles and the lumen of the trachea, and the uncoiling and stretching out of the tracheoles, so that they reach all parts of the wing.|$|E
5|$|Dragonfly nymphs vary in {{form with}} species and are loosely classed into claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and burrowers. The first <b>instar</b> {{is known as}} a prolarva, a {{relatively}} inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form. The general body plan {{is similar to that of}} an adult, but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs. The lower jaw has a huge, extensible labium, armed with hooks and spines, which is used for catching prey. This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles. Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills, dragonfly nymphs have internal gills, located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments. Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip. The naiads of some clubtails (Gomphidae) that burrow into the sediment, have a snorkel-like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud. Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second <b>instar.</b> The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E
5000|$|Stictococcids {{have three}} female <b>instars</b> and five male <b>instars.</b> The first <b>instars</b> are sexually dimorphic, with the females having the anus {{in the center}} of the body and having {{well-developed}} mouthparts, whereas the males have the anus near the posterior end of the body and have no mouthparts. Most species are associated with ants who feed on the honeydew they produce.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{in western}} gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii) on trunks of Pinus banksiana. Early <b>instars</b> score the gall tissue below the bark, while later <b>instars</b> mine the gall tissue.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Quercus mongolica. Larvae {{of first}} two <b>instars</b> live gregariously. There are {{a total of}} five <b>instars.</b> The {{pupation}} takes place in a pupa hanging on the leaf petiole.|$|R
5|$|Thrips are hemimetabolous, metamorphosing {{gradually}} to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are like small wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, {{the third and}} fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth <b>instar,</b> are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body's organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; in the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus, for example, the winged form makes up 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form makes up 98% of the population late in the summer. Thrips can survive the winter as adults or through egg or pupal diapause.|$|E
25|$|The larvae live gregariously and {{are heavily}} parasitized (up to 90%). The first <b>instar</b> lasts about five days, second <b>instar</b> for four days, third <b>instar</b> five, fourth <b>instar</b> four, {{about three days}} for the fifth <b>instar</b> and another three days for the sixth <b>instar.</b> They begin to pupate after around 22 days of their larval duration.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{larval stage}} for S. nudiseta lasts for {{approximately}} 13–15 days. Through research and experimentation, {{it has been}} found that the developmental period for the first <b>instar</b> is about 24 hours, the period is greater for the second <b>instar,</b> approximately 48 hours and the third <b>instar</b> has the longest developmental period at 230 hours.|$|E
50|$|Nymphs {{are white}} in {{coloration}} and soft-bodied {{in the early}} <b>instars,</b> later hardening and darkening in color in the later <b>instars.</b> They vary in size; and with each molt they will grow larger.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. A {{possible}} adaptive bene®t of coprophagy {{was investigated}} in nymphs of the German cockroach Blattella germanica (L.). 2. Newly ecdysed ®rst <b>instars,</b> given no source of food other than conspeci®c faeces, survived signi®cantly longer than ®rst <b>instars</b> deprived of faeces. The faeces of adult males and females may be of different quality, however, because nymphs given female faeces {{were more likely to}} moult into the second stadium than nymphs given male faeces. 3. In contrast to ®rst <b>instars,</b> second <b>instars</b> provided adult faeces survived only slightly longer than starved counterparts. Faecal feeding is therefore stage-speci®c, as is the bene®t derived from it. 4. The relationship between the nutrient composition of faeces and the survival of nymphs was also examined. First <b>instars</b> fed the faeces of adults that had been maintained on a high (50 %) protein diet, died more slowly than ®rst <b>instars</b> fed the faeces of adults that had been maintained on medium (22. 5 %) and low (5 %) protein diets. Chemical analysis of faeces showed that the concentration of protein in adult faeces increased with the level of protein in the diet. Moreover, food choice assays showed that ®rst <b>instars,</b> unlike adults, ingested more of the high-protein diets. 5. These data support the idea that coprophagy is a stage-speci®c adaptive behaviour that permits ®rst <b>instars</b> to moult into the second stadium with minimal foraging. Key words.
