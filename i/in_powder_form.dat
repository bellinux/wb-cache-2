5|$|Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and {{malleable}} metal that is solid at room temperature, {{though it is}} hard and brittle at lesser purities. <b>In</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form,</b> zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction {{noted that}} {{although}} there were some reports of tablets being sold {{for as little as}} €1, most countries in Europe then reported typical retail prices in the range of €3 to €9 per tablet, typically containing 25–65mg of MDMA. By 2014 the EMCDDA reported that the range was more usually between €5 and €10 per tablet, typically containing 57–102mg of MDMA, although MDMA <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> was becoming more common.|$|E
25|$|Quillivant XR is an extended-release oral {{suspension}} (after reconstitution with water): 25mg per 5 mL (5mg per mL). It {{was designed and}} is patented and made by Pfizer.

Each bottle is shipped with the medication <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> containing roughly 20% instant-release and 80% extended-release methylphenidate, to which water must be added by the pharmacist in an amount corresponding with the total intended volume of the bottle. The bottle must be shaken vigorously for ten seconds prior to administration via included oral syringe to ensure proper ratio.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2015, Canada {{has seen}} a {{widespread}} number of fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspect that the drug is being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets. Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in multiple deaths from the homeless to young professionals, including multiple teens and young parents. Because of the rising deaths across the country, Health Canada is putting a rush on {{a review of the}} prescription-only status of naloxone in an effort to combat overdoses of the drug.|$|E

25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E
25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure fentanyl powder was seized by Border Patrol agents in California from a vehicle that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit fentanyl for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic fentanyl lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing fentanyl instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk fentanyl and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> from China.|$|E
500|$|The South station {{had five}} {{generating}} sets and the North station had four. Each generating set had a bunker for 1,250 tonnes of coal, fed by a conveyor from the coal store. This conveyor belt system {{was built by}} E.N. Mackley & Co, Gateshead. Each bunker fed coal into a pulveriser, manufactured by Raymond. From here it was fed into a boiler <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> and burned. All of the boilers were suspended from the boiler houses' steel frames, and were made by Clarke Chapman Group Ltd, Gateshead. The boilers were forged in Sheffield, {{the first of the}} nine arriving at Stella South in 1953. At 62tonnes, the boilers were at the time the largest ever made in the UK. The boilers were of the radiant-heat type, comprising a water-cooled combustion chamber, controlled-type superheater and an economiser. Each of the boilers had an evaporation rating of 550 kL/h, a steam pressure of 950 psi and a steam temperature of 925°F. Each boiler was equipped with two forced and two induced Howden fans, twenty-two electrically operated Clyde soot blowers, an automatic control system made by Bailey and Sturtevant electrostatic precipitators. [...] Each station was designed to burn 2,000 tonnes of bituminous coal a day.|$|E

2500|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. Approximately 4.6 million tons of pigmentary TiO2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as utilization continues to rise. When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like [...] "mystic fire topaz". TiO2 is also an effective opacifier <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form,</b> where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as [...] "the perfect white", [...] "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.|$|E
