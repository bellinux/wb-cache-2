50|$|The {{hardware}} design was radically changed moving to an architecture {{with a single}} processor per node {{as opposed to the}} traditional TRAME hardware. It had two alternative base modules of different capacity based on processors Intel i960CA and i960RM with a 1Gbit/s bus to communicate the different router PCBs. The number of physical interfaces was just 10 (8 serial + 2 Ethernet (10B2 or 10BT)) because the Ethernet allowed to connect several devices in a single LAN. It also had a frontal service serial channel. By losing redundancy (a single processor per router) the node lost some availability with respect to TRAME previous versions.

The <b>dual</b> <b>homing</b> mechanism is resilient to a single failure of a BS.

We first formulate the problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{employed in}} monitoring applications require {{data collected by}} the sensors to be deposited at specific nodes, referred to as drains. To improve robustness in data collection, we consider a <b>dual</b> <b>homing</b> network in which two drains are employed and every node is required to send data to the two drains over link- or node-disjoint paths. One approach {{to reduce the number}} of routing table entries at a node is to construct two trees, namely red and blue, each rooted at a particular drain such that the paths from any node to the two drains on the trees are link- or node-disjoint. In this paper, we develop the first distributed algorithm for constructing colored trees in a dual-homing network whose running time is linear in the number of links. In addition, we show that the average path length may be optimized by employing the generalized low-point concept rather than the traditional low-point concept. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{wireless}} access to any service in different contexts is nowadays taken for granted. However, the dependability requirements are different for various services and contexts.

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} purposes of sensing information is to immediately respond to any anomalies. In order to make an accurate and cognizant decision, there is a great need for a dependable wireless sensor network. Failure dependability relates to providing dependability against node and/or link failures. In multi-layered wireless sensor networks with data fusion, we observe that as the data propagates from the sensor node to the sink, the data packet represents an increasing number of sensor nodes (sub-tree) in the network. Hence, it is critical that this data packet reaches the sink, since the loss of a single packet eliminates the information sensed by a whole (possibly large) sub-tree of sensor nodes. We evaluate two dual-homed routing techniques for providing faulttolerance, namely 1 + 1 dual-homing and 1 : 1 <b>dual</b> <b>homing.</b> Based on extensive simulation results, we observe that 1 : 1 dual-homed routing minimizes packet loss, increases network throughput, and increases network lifetime compared to the 1 + 1 dual-homed routing and the traditional single-homed routing techniques.

40|$|A {{resilience}} {{strategy is}} introduced for networks implementing <b>dual</b> <b>homing</b> (dual parenting) of customers, specifically those employing Long-Reach PONs (LR-PONs). Assuming that some mechanism exists to detect network element failures, the discussion {{concentrates on the}} protocols which propagate information about the reachability of LR-PONs and those that re-route traffic {{in the event of}} a fault. A protocol called FROTH (Fast Recovery for OLTs via Transmission of Hellos) informs each edge router which LR-PONs are available over the whole network. This information is used by another protocol called LATTE (Label and Address Tunneling via Tables at the Edge), to re-route traffic in the event of failure. A target of 50 milliseconds is assumed for end-to-end recovery time, since this has been used for many years with voice services, and is adopted in the absence of other information. Here, FROTH transports signaling traffic over IP – due to the probabilistic nature of packet transmission, it is impossible to place a hard bound on recovery time, but rather the probability is calculated that it will be met. Modeling studies suggest that {{in the event of a}} cable failure or single equipment element failure, re-routed data will almost always leave the transmitting edge router in under 50 milliseconds. For more catastrophic failures (such as router failure or loss of an edge router), recovery might take between 100 – 200 milliseconds. Reachability information for each LR-PON is distributed over each area of the network by IP, and used to activate re-routing of traffic via tunnels or address substitution. However the underlying services need not use IP, and may be of any type (for example private line), making the scheme separate from the service, customer or provider...|$|E
40|$|The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) {{industry}} has {{through the last}} decades changed and still continues to affect the way people {{interact with each other}} and how they access and share information, services and applications in a global market characterized by constant change and evolution. For a networked and highly dynamic society, with consumers and market actors providing infrastructure, networks, services and applications, the mutual dependencies of failure free operations are getting more and more complex. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between the various actors and users may be used to describe the offerings along with price schemes and promises regarding the delivered quality. However, there is no guarantee for failure free operations whatever efforts and means deployed. A system fails for a number of reasons, but automatic fault handling mechanisms and operational procedures may be used to decrease the probability for service interruptions. The global number of mobile broadband Internet subscriptions surpassed the number of broadband subscriptions over fixed technologies in 2010. The User Equipment (UE) has become a powerful device supporting a number of wireless access technologies and the always best connected opportunities have become a reality. Some services, e. g. health care, smart power grid control, surveillance/monitoring etc. called critical services in this thesis, put high requirements on service dependability. A definition of dependability is the ability to deliver services that can justifiably be trusted. For critical services, the access networks become crucial factors for achieving high dependability. A major challenge in a multi operator, multi technology wireless environment is the mobility of the user that necessitates handovers according to the physical movement. In this thesis it is proposed an approach for how to optimize the dependability for critical services in multi operator, multi technology wireless environment. This approach allows predicting the service availability and continuity at real-time. Predictions of the optimal service availability and continuity are considered crucial for critical services. To increase the dependability for critical services <b>dual</b> <b>homing</b> is proposed where the use of combinations of access points, possibly owned by different operators and using different technologies, are optimized for the specific location and movement of the user. A central part of the thesis is how to ensure the disjointedness of physical and logical resources so important for utilizing the dependability increase potential with <b>dual</b> <b>homing.</b> To address the interdependency issues between physical and logical resources, a study of Operations, Administrations, and Maintenance (OA&M) processes related to the access network of a commercial Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) /Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) operator was performed. The insight obtained by the study provided valuable information of the inter woven dependencies between different actors in the delivery chain of services. Based on the insight gained from the study of OA&M processes a technological neutral information model of physical and logical resources in the access networks is proposed. The model is used for service availability and continuity prediction and to unveil interdependencies between resources for the infrastructure. The model is proposed {{as an extension of the}} Media Independent Handover (MIH) framework. A field trial in a commercial network was conducted to verify the feasibility in retrieving the model related information from the operators' Operational Support Systems (OSSs) and to emulate the extension and usage of the MIH framework. In the thesis it is proposed how measurement reports from UE and signalling in networks are used to define virtual cells as part of the proposed extension of the MIH framework. Virtual cells are limited geographical areas where the radio conditions are homogeneous. Virtual cells have radio coverage from a number of access points. A Markovian model is proposed for prediction of the service continuity of a dual homed critical service, where both the infrastructure and radio links are considered. A dependability gain is obtained by choosing a global optimal sequence of access points. Great emphasizes have been on developing computational e cient techniques and near-optimal solutions considered important for being able to predict service continuity at real-time for critical services. The proposed techniques to obtain the global optimal sequence of access points may be used by handover and multi homing mechanisms/protocols for timely handover decisions and access point selections. With the proposed extension of the MIH framework a global optimal sequence of access points providing the highest reliability may be predicted at real-time...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 180 - 184. With {{the vast}} {{development of the}} Internet, telecommunication networks are employed in numerous different outlets. In addition to voice transmission, which is a traditional utilization, telecommunication networks are now used for transmission {{of different types of}} data. As the amount of data transmitted through the network increases, issues such as the survivability and the capacity of the network become more imperative. In this dissertation, we deal with both design and routing problems in telecommunications networks. Our first problem is a two level survivable network design problem. The topmost layer of this network consists of a backbone component where the access equipments that enable the communication of the local access networks are interconnected. The second layer connects the users on the local access network to the access equipments, and consequently to the backbone network. To achieve a survivable network, one that stays operational even under minor breakdowns, the backbone network is assumed to be 2 -edge connected while local access networks are to have the star connectivity. Within the literature, such a network is referred to as a 2 -edge connected/star network. Since the survivability requirements of networks may change based on the purposes they are utilized for, a variation of this problem in which local access networks are also required to be survivable is also analyzed. The survivability of the local access networks is ensured by providing two connections for every component of the local access networks to the backbone network. This architecture is known as <b>dual</b> <b>homing</b> in the literature. In this dissertation, the polyhedral analysis of the two versions of the two level survivable network design problem is presented; separation problems are analyzed; and branch-and-cut algorithms are developed to find exact solutions. The increased traffic on the telecommunications networks requires the use of high capacity components. Optical networks, composed of fiber optical cables, offer solutions with their higher bandwidths and higher transmission speeds. This makes the optical networks a good alternative to handle the rapid increase in the data traffic. However, due to signal degradation which makes signal regeneration necessary introduces the regenerator placement problem as signal regeneration is a costly process in optical networks. In the regenerator placement problem, we study a location and routing problem together on the backbone component of a given telecommunications network. Survivability is also considered in this problem simultaneously. Exact solution methodologies are developed for this problem: mathematical models and some valid inequalities are proposed; separation problems for the valid inequalities are analyzed and a branch-and-cut algorithm is devised.
