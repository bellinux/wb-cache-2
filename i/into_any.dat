5|$|The {{difference}} in the game came from special teams and turnovers. Virginia Tech turned the ball over three times, while Kansas turned the ball over just once. Kansas converted its three takeaways into 17points, giving the Jayhawks an enormous advantage on the scoreboard.

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits <b>into</b> <b>any</b> category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily <b>into</b> <b>any</b> of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then launch <b>into</b> <b>any</b> of the game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} a book, as a topological space, was defined by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s. As part of this work, Atneosen already {{considered}} embeddings of graphs in books. The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs <b>into</b> <b>any</b> other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, edges are represented by curves, {{and the only way}} that two edges can intersect is for them to meet at a common endpoint.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars. The story follows four young bears.

5|$|The {{space between}} the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, a {{connective}} tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act {{as a type of}} skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform <b>into</b> <b>any</b> other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.|$|E
