5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5000|$|The {{price of}} filling air powered {{vehicles}} <b>is</b> significantly <b>cheaper</b> than petrol, diesel or biofuel. If electricity <b>is</b> <b>cheap,</b> then compressing air will also <b>be</b> relatively <b>cheap.</b>|$|R
50|$|HSS broach cutters <b>are</b> <b>cheaper</b> {{than the}} TCT broach cutters for smaller diameters up to 40 mm, while TCT broach cutters <b>are</b> <b>cheaper</b> than HSS for diameters above 41 mm.|$|R

5|$|Silicon carbide, {{dissolved}} in a {{basic oxygen furnace}} used for making steel, acts as a fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new smoke detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E

25|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings, that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. As compared to investment casting, it <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> {{because it is a}} simpler process and the foam <b>is</b> <b>cheaper</b> than the wax. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature of}} the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification.|$|E
