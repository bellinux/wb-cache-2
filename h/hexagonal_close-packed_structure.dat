Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> <b>structure</b> (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.

Inverse opals based on different oxide materials (TiO 2, SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3) were fabricated by templating polystyrene colloidal crystal films grown by the vertical deposition technique.

50|$|UHTCs all exhibit strong {{covalent}} bonding which gives them structural stability at high temperatures. Metal carbides are brittle {{due to the}} strong bonds that exist between carbon atoms. The largest class of carbides, including Hf, Zr, Ti and Ta carbides have high melting points due to covalent carbon networks although carbon vacancies often exist in these materials; indeed, HfC {{has one of the}} highest melting points of any material. Nitrides such as ZrN and HfN have similarly strong covalent bonds but their refractory nature makes them especially difficult to synthesize and process. The stoichiometric nitrogen content can be varied in these complexes based on the synthetic technique utilized; different nitrogen content will give different properties to the material, such as how if x exceeds 1.2 in ZrNx, a new optically transparent and electrically insulating phase appears to form. Ceramic borides such as HfB2 and ZrB2 benefit from very strong bonding between boron atoms as well as strong metal to boron bonds; the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close-packed</b> <b>structure</b> with alternating two-dimensional boron and metal sheets give these materials high but anisotropic strength as single crystals. Borides exhibit high thermal conductivity (on the order of 75 - 105 W/mK) and low coefficients of thermal expansion (5 - 7.8 x 10−6 K-1) and improved oxidation resistance in comparison to other classes of UHTCs.
