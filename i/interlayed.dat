Horizons of poikilitic olivine gabbros in the core represent magma chamber replenishment in which the replenishing magma ponded {{at the base of the}} chamber and fractionated. Variations in plagioclase trace element compositions (e. g. La/Nd and Ba/K) in part reflect compositional variation in their parental melts derived from the mantle. Calculated equilibrium melt compositions are highly LREE depleted (Lan/Ndn as low as 0. 25).;Brown-pyroxene gabbros are olivine - plagioclase - clinopyroxene cumulates which have more evolved mineral compositions than poikilitic olivine gabbros. A series of major and trace element characteristics of the rocks, and textural phenomena, indicate that post-cumulus processes were important in their formation. In particular, extreme variations in incompatible element abundances, and fractionation of Zr and Y (and REE's), from the core to rim of clinopyroxene crystals occurs. It is proposed that the fractionation of the interstitial melt was caused by reaction between migration interstitial melt and the crystal assemblage (magmatic metasomatism). This led to the interstitial melt becoming highly evolved in terms of incompatible elements whilst the major elements were efficiently buffered by the crystals. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe CBM {{experiment}} {{will investigate}} strongly interacting matter at extreme densities {{at the future}} accelerator facility FAIR in Darmstadt, in search for the first-order phase transition from confined to deconfined matter. Key observables of CBM are strange and charmed hadrons. We discuss {{the performance of the}} planned experimental setup with respect to the measurement of strange and multi-strange hadrons, open charm and charmonium, based on detailed detector simulations which include a realistic detector response. Prospects for strangeness and charm measurements with the CBM experiment 2 1. The CBM experiment The interest in the high-density part of the QCD phase diagram and its features, namely the possible first-order phase transition from confined to deconfined matter, the critical endpoint separating the first-order transition region from that of a cross-over at lower densities, and the properties of hadrons in a dense environment, reflect in several experimental activities in accelerator laboratories around the world: the RHIC energy scan programme, the NA 61 activities at CERN-SPS, the NICA project at JINR Dubna, and the CBM project at the future facility FAIR in Darmstadt [1]. Amongst them, the fixed-target experiment CBM provides the unique opportunity to study extremely rare probes like charmed hadrons, which are close to their production thresholds at FAIR beam energies (10 - 45 A GeV). This opportunity is due to the high beam intensities to be delivered by the SIS- 300 synchrotron of FAIR (up to 10 9 ions/s), giving rise to interaction rates of up to 10 MHz with a typical 1 % interaction target. CBM is being designed to measure hadronic, leptonic and photonic observables in a large acceptance, covering the full p t range and rapidities from centre-of-mass rapidity close to beam rapidity. The planned experimental setup is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The core tracker (STS), consisting of eight stations of Silicon microstrip detectors, is located between the yokes of a super-conducting dipole magnet. Close to the target, the Micro-Vertex Detector (MVD) provides excellent resolution of displaced vertices from open charm decays. Downstream of the STS, a RICH and several layers of Transition Radiation Detectors (TRD) provide electron identification in a large momentum range. The TRD also serves for global tracking, connecting the tracks reconstructed in the STS with the time-of-flight wall located approximately 10 m downstream of the target. An electromagentic calorimeter after the TOF detector enables the measurement of neutral particles. The setup is completed with a downstream calorimeter (PSD) for event characterisation in terms of centrality and reaction plane angle. For muon measurements, the RICH will be replaced by an absorber system <b>interlayed</b> with several tracking detector planes, allowing to follow the tracks reconstructed in the main tracker through the setup (right panel of Fig. 1). In the following, we present results of physics performance studies in this detector system. They are based on the simulation of signals embedded into typical background events generated by UrQMD [2]. If not mentioned otherwise, all results refer to the collision system Au+Au at 25 A GeV beam momentum. The results were obtained with full detector response simulation and event reconstruction...|$|E

For the biostratigraphical {{characterization}} of the metamorphic formations, beside the structure and tectonic particularities, the only biostratigraphical guide – marks are represented by the acritarchs and chitinozoans assemblages. For Upper Formation (Tg. 4) of Tulghes Group from Eastern Carpathians is an example difficult to study and biostratigraphical correlation due to its boundary position between Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician. Previous studies on chitinozoan and acritarch assemblages allowed some interesting palynological and biostratigraphical conclusions. The position of our country’s territory in Perigondwanaland, {{at the intersection of}} warm and cold microfloristic element, from Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician, as well as the total lack of trilobite and graptolite fossil rests, for zonation and analogy, tectonization and the powerful metamorphism of the analyzed samples induced great difficulties in the biostratigraphical {{characterization of}} these formations.

Only three or four songs were written as a group whilst the rest were written by Goddard and Taylor, though Doyle said [...] "we did have input {{in the way it}} was produced". Doyle described the writing process for the album as [...] "a bit like writing a poem" [...] because there was [...] "a certain structure" [...] that the band needed to work to whilst exercising [...] "as much freedom" [...] as they could. Goddard described the band's approach to song-writing as a [...] "mix of things with a lot of very careful thinking about rhythms, and <b>interlaying</b> a lot of different ideas and influences" [...] though, at certain points, there would be the sense that something needed to occur and these elements in songs were created spontaneously from the interaction between himself and Taylor: [...] "this melody will somehow suddenly explode in your mind. It's never planned, it just seems to happen; almost like it has to." [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] and [...] "Slush" [...] were written by Taylor whilst Goddard wrote [...] "Brothers". Doyle stated that [...] "One Life Stand" [...] and [...] "I Feel Better" [...] were put together [...] "in a slightly more piecemeal way".|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a problem of {{independent}} trade in Czech Republic which means small and medium sized retail and wholesale enterprises without capital linkage to big companies abroad. It is especially focused on Czech food sellers trying to compete against transnational companies entering and operating on Czech market. One of possibilities how to face geographically and financially strong subjects is vertical cooperation and creation trade alliances. It means joining individual small and medium sized wholesalers and retailers into one association representing all members. Main advantages of these cooperative structures are lower purchase costs due to common negotiation with suppliers and co-financing of some activities (for example promotion). It {{is very important to}} sustain the diversity of retail market because of ensuring and forming competitive environment and offering the miscellaneous forms of retail to final consumers. That is why the main goal {{of this paper is to}} find out last changes and contemporary position and structure of the food independent trade alliances with prediction of future development. It is necessary to mention the fact that data is quite difficult to gain for this purpose. There are yearbooks of Czech and Slovak trade where some important information are published namely sales of food trade alliances are used like main indicator to describe and predict their development. A suitable statistic method has to be selected to fulfil the stated goal. Time series and <b>interlay</b> with trend curve seem like the most suitable instrument. In case of individual trade alliances the linear or logarithmic function will be used according to course of sales...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{does not}} deny the World Bank’s effort in getting water {{management}} right in developing countries. It, however, raises some concerns with the Bank’s water policies that may have undesirable impact on poor people’s access to water and livelihoods on the ground. It unpacks the assumptions of the ideas, such as community participation, decentralisation, user-charging, good governance and strict rule enforcement. It suggests that poor people may have to bear disproportionately high costs if these policies do not work. Particularly, this paper challenges the Bank’s water model which assumes that water users are rational and opportunistic and inadequately considers the complexity of human motivations and structural forces in shaping effective water governance. The economic understanding of institutions and the over-emphasising of laws, regulations and formal groups, plays down the role of socially-embedded institutions in influencing water-user behaviour. It draws on examples and case studies of the water sector in developing countries and underlines the importance of building a more socially-informed model by incorporating human values into water governance and seeking {{a deeper understanding of}} social context and cultural diversity. This paper highlights the needs to achieve water sustainability, without compromising poor people’s social networks and livelihoods of the poor. This paper lays out five principles that matter to the success of water interventions: (1) history and culture of social relations; (2) existing relations of cooperation that shape water participation; (3) people’s livelihood priorities; (4) individuals’ preferred institutional environment; (5) the <b>interlay</b> between new and old institutions that channels that people can get access to resources and exercise agency...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{elements}} subtending {{this study are}} two: the crowd and the organization, extending on Villarroel (2008, 2013). In the last 20 years these two components of the business landscape were combined creating several different outcomes. In {{the early days of}} crowdsourcing, companies were exploiting the crowd’s knowledge by running contests in order to achieve a specific solution (e. g. InnoCentive in 2001). Then some companies started to create one of their own division <b>interlay</b> outsourced to the crowd. Today some organizations are completely crowd dependent in almost all their activities. In this study {{the focus is on the}} last combination, the most recent, where the firm and the crowd are bilaterally interdependent. More specifically, this study analyzed and classified what we call the Hybrid Crowdsourcing Organization (HCO). Using a case study methodology this new firm organization is studied. The analysis is based on the source of competitive advantage, its value chain and its inter-organizational relationship. A comparison is made with traditional organizations through a deep and broad case study approach (Eisenhardt 1989). The theories about the nature of the firm; value chain; and competitive advantage are reconsidered as they apply (or not) to HCO. This study shows how organizational competences can drive new sources of efficiencies by a firm’s design that is able to leverage resources in a more efficient way. The HCO organizational competences build new efficiencies impacting on 3 different dimensions: the market, the industry and the company. We discuss the resources leveraged in each of these dimensions, which results in a source of competitive advantage of HCO...|$|R
