5|$|At the Temple Mount (<b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif)</b> in Jerusalem, Ahmad Pasha ibn Ridwan had a khalwa, {{known as}} the Mamluk Khalwa, built for local Sufis headed by al-Ghazi Abu al-Sa'ud, and {{for the study of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} in 1601. The architect of the khalwa was Abd al-Muhsin ibn Nimr, who worked Ahmad Pasha's other projects in Jerusalem. Ahmad Pasha established a waqf to fund Abu al-Sa'ud and the khalwa's upkeep and management.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E

25|$|An archaeological tunnel {{running the}} length of the western side of the Temple Mount, as it is known to Jews, or the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> as it is known to Muslims, sparked a serious {{conflict}} in 1996. As a result, rioting broke out in Jerusalem and spread to the West Bank, leading to the deaths of 86 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{the local}} {{governors}} had been replaced by Ottoman officials who discontinued the local relationships their predecessors had cultivated. Under the new governors, the exploitation of the local population by Janissaries, timariots (fief holders) and subashis continued unabated. The governors could not bring order to the Jerusalem Sanjak, with the main roads from Jerusalem to Jaffa and from Nablus to Hebron facing frequent assaults by Bedouin tribesmen and instability remaining rampant in the countryside and major towns such as Hebron. Many peasants left their villages to avoid heavy taxation by the governors or exploitation by junior officials. The dignitaries of Jerusalem often served as mediators of disputes in the district in place of government officials. The dignitaries' loss of privileges previously enjoyed under the local governors brought them closer with the lower, dispossessed classes due to their shared frustrations with the changing order. Moreover, acts by the Janissaries, namely the desecration of mosques and religious sites, including the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> (Temple Mount) in Jerusalem, further incensed the population.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of this process, an archaeological tunnel running the length of the western side of the Temple Mount, as it is known to Jews, or the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> as it is known to Muslims, became a serious point of contestation in 1996. The tunnel had been in place for about a dozen years, but open {{conflict}} broke out after the government of Benjamin Netanyahu decided to open a new entrance to the tunnel from the Via Dolorosa in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Palestinians and the Islamic Waqf authorities were outraged that the decision was taken without prior consultation. They claimed that the work threatened the foundations of the compound and those of houses in the Muslim quarter and that it was actually aimed at tunnelling under the holy compound complex to find remains of Solomon's Temple, similar to previous accusations in the 1980s. As a result of the rumor, Arabs rioted in Jerusalem and then spread to the West Bank, leading to the deaths of 86 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Intifada, the {{generally}} non-violent {{methods of the}} earlier uprising gave way to more brutal methods against both IDF troops and Israeli citizens: stone-throwing as the hallmark of resistance yielded place to martyrdom operations, overwhelmingly conducted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The intifada broke out with rock throwing to protest Ariel Sharon's visit to the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> on 28 September 2000, {{which led to a}} clash in which 6 Palestinians were killed, and 220 wounded by Israeli gunfire, while 70 Israeli police were injured by stoning. The incident rapidly escalated into the Second Intifada when, as rock-and Molotov-cocktail-throwing continued over the next two days, 24 Palestinians were shot dead, and an Israeli soldier was killed. At the outset, participating teenagers resumed the traditional stone-throwing to deny vehicles access to settlements. Israel's response was, according to Lev Luis Grinberg, to use all the weapons in its arsenal, including snipers, and shooting missiles from Apache helicopters at demonstrators and buildings. He concludes 'It responded with disproportionate force that only an army can unleash totally out of place against stone-throwing civilians. Human Rights Watch documented early that IDF soldiers were shooting stone throwing youths where no serious threats to their safety existed.|$|E
500|$|Mount, {{which in}} effect {{would turn the}} entire complex into the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> ("the Noble Sanctuary"), Abd al-Malik wanted to replace the slipshod {{structure}} described by Arculf with a more sheltered structure enclosing the qibla ("direction"), a necessary element in his grand scheme. However, the entire <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> was meant to represent a mosque. How much he modified the aspect of the earlier building is unknown, but {{the length of the}} new building is indicated by the existence of traces of a bridge leading from the Umayyad palace just south of {{the western part of the}} complex. The bridge would have spanned the street running just outside the southern wall of the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> to give direct access to the mosque. Direct access from palace to mosque was a well-known feature in the Umayyad period, as evidenced at various early sites. Abd al-Malik shifted the central axis of the mosque some [...] westward, in accord with his overall plan for the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif.</b> The earlier axis is represented in the structure by the niche still known as the [...] "mihrab of 'Umar." [...] In placing emphasis on the Dome of the Rock, Abd al-Malik had his architects align his new al-Aqsa Mosque according to the position of the Rock, thus shifting the main north–south axis of the Noble Sanctuary, a line running through the Dome of the Chain and the Mihrab of Umar.|$|E
500|$|It {{is evident}} from the copy of the record of the {{deliberations}} of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> and also the spot where al-Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of Abu Madyan, may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Saladin's 1187 {{siege of}} the city, in 1193, the sultan's son and {{successor}} al-Afdal established the land {{adjacent to the}} wall as a charitable trust. It was named after an important mystic Abu Madyan Shu'aib and dedicated to Moroccan settlers who had taken up residence there. Houses were built only [...] away from the wall. The first mention of the Islamic tradition that Buraq was tethered at the site is from the 14th century. A manuscript by Ibn Furkah, (d. 1328), refers to Bab al-Nab (lit. [...] "Gate of the Prophet"), an old name for a gate along the southwestern wall of the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Palestinians demanded {{complete}} {{sovereignty over}} East Jerusalem and its holy sites, in particular, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, which {{are located on}} the Temple Mount (<b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif),</b> a site holy in both Islam and Judaism, and the dismantling of all Israeli neighborhoods built over the Green Line. The Palestinian position, according to Mahmoud Abbas, at that time Arafat's chief negotiator, was that: [...] "All of East Jerusalem {{should be returned to}} Palestinian sovereignty. The Jewish Quarter and Western Wall should be placed under Israeli authority, not Israeli sovereignty. An open city and cooperation on municipal services." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{controversy}} {{related to}} the book came from a passage in Facts on the Ground in which Abu El Haj wrote that during a dig in Jezreel, British and Israeli archaeologists used [...] "bulldozers ... {{in order to get}} down to the earlier strata, which are saturated with national significance, as quickly as possible." [...] She noted that [...] "among Palestinian officials at the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> and the Awqaf as well as many other archaeologists ... the use of bulldozers has become the ultimate sign of 'bad science' and of nationalist politics guiding research agendas." [...] She wrote that the incident took place [...] "a week after [...] stopped participating in the excavations" [...] and attributed the account to [...] "several participants, both archaeologists and student volunteers," [...] whom she did not name.|$|E
2500|$|The al-Aqsa Intifada, or Second Intifada, {{began in}} late September 2000, {{around the time}} Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon and a large contingent of armed bodyguards visited the Temple Mount (<b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif)</b> complex in Jerusalem and declared the area as an eternal Israeli territory. Widespread riots and attacks broke out among Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel in Jerusalem and many major Israeli cities, and spread throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority (PA) involvement in the Intifada was handled by the Tanzim organization, which was the secret armed branch of Arafat's Fatah party within the PLO. In January 2002, the [...] "PA's direct involvement in the Intifada was confirmed ... when the IDF intercepted a cargo ship in the Red Sea carrying tons of rockets, mortars, and other weapons and ammunition from Iran, earmarked for smuggling into PA [...] areas." [...] In March 2002, {{just prior to the}} Arab Peace Initiative, suicide bombings committed by Palestinians against Israeli civilians [...] "intensified ... in buses, restaurants, coffee shops, and other public places in Israel." [...] An Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, estimated the death toll to be 3,396 Palestinians and 994 Israelis, although this number is criticized for not showing the whole picture, and not differentiating between combatants and civilians (suicide bombers, for example, are counted in that death toll).|$|E
2500|$|According to Dov Yosef {{the turning}} point of Operation Nachshon was the death of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni on 8 April. 30,000 people {{attended}} his funeral at the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> and subsequently the morale of his forces collapsed. The end of the siege came {{with the opening of}} the [...] "Burma Road" [...] in June. In Yosef's words, [...] "by the time the first truce (11 June 1948) came it had already broken the siege." [...] This alternative route had been conceived in April after the failure of Nachshon to secure the entrance to the road to Jerusalem at Latrun. Work started on 18 May using bulldozers and several hundred quarrymen from Jerusalem. The major problem was a very steep section at the beginning of the ascent. After two weeks some supplies came through using mules and 200 men from the Home Guard (Mishmar Ha'am) to cover the three miles which were impassable to vehicles. These men, mostly conscripts in their fifties, each carried a 45-pound load and made the trip twice a night. This effort lasted for five nights. Three weeks later, 10 June, the steepest section was opened to vehicles, though they needed assistance from tractors to get up it. By the end of June the usual nightly convoy delivered 100 tons of supplies a night. Harry Levin in his diary entry, 7 June, says that 12 tons a night were getting through and he estimated that the city needed 17 tons daily. On 28 July he notes that during the first truce, 11 June to 8 July, 8,000 truckloads arrived. This remained the sole supply route for several months until the opening of the Valor Road (Kvish Hagevurah).|$|E
2500|$|Israel {{proposed}} that the Palestinians be granted [...] "custodianship," [...] though not sovereignty, on the Temple Mount (<b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif),</b> with Israel retaining control over the Western Wall, a remnant of the ancient wall that surrounded the Temple Mount, the most sacred site in Judaism outside of the Temple Mount itself. Israeli negotiators also {{proposed that}} the Palestinians be granted administration of, but not sovereignty over, the Muslim and Christian Quarters of the Old City, with the Jewish and Armenian Quarters remaining in Israeli hands. Palestinians would be granted administrative control over all Islamic and Christian holy sites, and {{would be allowed to}} raise the Palestinian flag over them. A passage linking northern Jerusalem to Islamic and Christian holy sites would be annexed by the Palestinian state. The Israeli team proposed annexing to Israeli Jerusalem settlements within the West Bank beyond the Green Line, such as Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, and Gush Etzion. Israel {{proposed that the}} Palestinians merge certain outer Arab villages and small cities that had been annexed to Jerusalem just after 1967 (such as Abu Dis, al-Eizariya, 'Anata, A-Ram, and eastern Sawahre) to create the city of Al-Quds, which would serve as the capital of Palestine. The historically important Arab neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and at-Tur would remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Palestinians would only have civilian autonomy. The Palestinians would exercise civil and administrative autonomy in the outer Arab neighborhoods. Israeli neighborhoods within East Jerusalem would remain under Israeli sovereignty. The holy places in the Old City would enjoy independent religious administration. In total, Israel demanded that Palestine's territory in East Jerusalem be reduced to eight sections including six small enclaves according to Palestine's delegation to the summit.|$|E
