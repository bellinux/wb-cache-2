With all her spirit and energy she had thrown herself into the organizing of the women of the valley to work for the interests of the war. She had made herself a leader who spared no effort, no sacrifice, no expense in what she considered her duty. Conservation of food, <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> production, knitting for soldiers, Liberty Loans and Red Cross--these she had studied and mastered, to the end that the women of the great valley had accomplished work which won national honor. It had been excitement, joy, and a strange fulfilment for her. But after the shock caused by the fatal news about Dorn she had lost interest, though she had worked on harder than ever.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of scientists have recently raised concerns about {{the threat posed by}} human intervention on the evolution of parasites and disease agents. New parasites (including pathogens) keep emerging and parasites which previously were considered to be ‘under control’ are re-emerging, sometimes in highly virulent forms. This re-emergence may be parasite evolution, driven by human activity, including ecological changes related to modern agricultural practices. <b>Intensive</b> <b>farming</b> creates conditions for parasite growth and transmission drastically different from what parasites experience in wild host populations and may therefore alter selection on various traits, such as life-history traits and virulence. Although recent epidemic outbreaks highlight the risks associated with <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> practices, most work has focused on reducing the short-term economic losses imposed by parasites, such as application of chemotherapy. Most of the research on parasite evolution has been conducted using laboratory model systems, often unrelated to economically important systems. Here, we review the possible evolutionary consequences of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> by relating current knowledge of the evolution of parasite life-history and virulence with specific conditions experienced by parasites on farms. We show that <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> practices are likely to select for fast-growing, early-transmitted, and hence probably more virulent parasites. As an illustration, we consider the case of the fish farming industry, a branch of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> which has dramatically expanded recently and present evidence that supports the idea that <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> conditions increase parasite virulence. We suggest that more studies should focus on the impact of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> on parasite evolution in order to build currently lacking, but necessary bridges between academia and decision-makers...|$|R

50|$|This daily milking routine goes on {{for about}} 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of the {{production}} cycle {{but this is not}} usual for large herds. If a cow is left unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately {{and the rest of the}} season may see her dried off (giving no milk) and still consuming feed. However, once-a-day milking is now being practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and lifestyle reasons. This is effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> systems in the United States that milk three or more times per day due to higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal labor costs.|$|E

40|$|Differences in {{environmental}} impact and economic returns between intensive and low-input organic dairy production are investigated using two simplified model farms with different amounts of concentrates being fed. In four scenarios, ecological and economic effects of restricting the more <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> management practice beyond the existing regulations of organic farming are analysed. In the initial situation, the <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> has a financial advantage of about 600. 00 € per ha {{compared with the}} low-input farm, while the environmental risks caused by its production system are higher in several Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) categories.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} Cryptosporidium from goats in three types of farm management systems in Terengganu, Malaysia and to determine the Cryptosporidium species infecting goats by using 18 S rRNA. Methods: A total of 478 fecal samples were randomly collected from goats in three farms; 199 samples were collected from <b>intensive</b> <b>farm,</b> 179 samples from semi-intensive farm and 100 samples from extensive farm. The samples were processed by using formol-ether concentration technique and stained by using modified Ziehl–Neelsen. Positive samples were performed by using nested PCR analysis by using 18 S rRNA. Results: Out of 478 goats, 207 (43. 3 %) {{were found to be}} infected with Cryptosporidium. Goats reared under the <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> management system reported the highest prevalence of infection (49. 7 %), followed by <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> management system (41 %) and the lowest prevalence was reported in the goats reared under semi-intensive management system (37. 4 %).

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of raw {{sunflower}} seeds on goat milk production. Two farms with different farming systems (intensive and semi-intensive) participated to the trial. In each farm about 60 mid-lactation Alpine goats were divided in two groups during spring-summer time. A diet containing 5 - 6 % of sunflower seeds on DM basis was compared with a control diet in a change-over design. In the semi-intensive farm milk yield of goats fed sunflower was 3. 46 kg/d compared to 3. 58 kg/d of goats fed control diet, whereas in the <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> milk yield was 4. 60 kg/d vs 4. 66 kg/d. Fat content increased significantly from 2. 99 % to 3. 23 % only in the <b>intensive</b> <b>farm.</b> The research in the <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> investigated also milk and cheese fatty acids composition.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{model the}} {{supply and demand}} for {{agricultural}} goods and assess and compare how welfare, land use, and biodiversity are affected under <b>intensive</b> and extensive <b>farming</b> systems at market equilibrium instead of at exogenous production levels. As long as demand is responsive to price, and <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> has lower production costs, there exists a rebound effect (larger market size) of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming.</b> <b>Intensive</b> <b>farming</b> is then less beneficial to biodiversity than extensive farming is, except {{when there is a}} high degree of convexity between biodiversity and yield. On the other hand, extensive farming leads to higher prices and smaller quantities for consumers. Depending on parameter values, it may increase or decrease agricultural producer profits. Implementing “active” land sparing by zoning some land for agriculture and other land for conservation could overcome the rebound effect of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming,</b> but we show that farmers have then incentives to encroach on land zoned for conservation, with higher incentives under <b>intensive</b> <b>farming.</b> We also show that the primary effect of the higher prices associated with extensive farming is a reduction of animal feed production, which has a higher price elasticity of demand, whereas less of an effect is observed on plant-based food production and almost no effect is observed on biofuel production if there are mandatory blending policies...|$|R

New Zealand (NZ) hos a strong agricultural history. As world leaders in research and development, agriculture shaped our nation structurally and socially and will continue to do so into the future. To facilitate the continued supply of affordable meat, exploration of initiatives in design to support sustainable agriculture is required. This paper presents a research project that has used landscape design methodology to anloyse and quantify existing intensive farming models (or chicken meat production (broiler shed farms) and explores potential design interventions that can contribute to improved quadruple bottom line outcomes in intensive farming practice in NZ. System approaches such as industrial ecology. cradle to cradle, permoculture and zero energy buildings informed a design model that reduces the intensive farming footprint while improving the interconnections between the multiple inputs and outputs required for such forming practices, within the site and brooder environment Comparison of quantitative data on aspects such as water; energy. biodiversity and waste between the existing <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> model and the proposed sustainable design model has shown that the inclusion of landscape architectural design methodology informing <b>intensive</b> <b>farm</b> development can improve sustainability in an economically viable way and contribute to a more appropriate approach to food production and land use...|$|E
