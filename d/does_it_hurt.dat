500|$|The {{song was}} not {{promoted}} through an official music video, although Houston {{appeared at the}} 1996 MTV Movie Awards held at Walt Disney Studios, Burbank and performed [...] "Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> So Bad".

Christopher John Farley of TIME commented Houston [...] "particularly held her own", with a [...] "masterly balance of pop, zip, and soulful melancholy". Steve Knopper of Newsday wrote: [...] "It's lower-key and the singer, who also {{stars in the}} film, doesn't feel compelled to perform constant vocal feats." [...] A writer for Boston Herald noted that the song was [...] "understated". Similarly, Larry Flick of Billboard commented that the song should have been released as the follow-up to [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)". [...] "Paired with Babyface, Houston is positively luminous on [...] heartbreak ballad, performing with a perfect blend of theatrical melodrama and guttural soul," [...] he added. [...] Deborah Wilker of South Florida Sun-Sentinel was mixed in her review commenting that the song was a [...] "predictably [...] follow-up" [...] to [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)". But, Nick Krewen of The Spectator was even less enthusiastic, writing [...] " [...] the two guaranteed [...] hits – 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' and 'Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> So Bad' – don't really offer anything new." [...] Similarly, Cary Darling of Rome News-Tribune gave a negative review. She noted that [...] " [...] ballad 'Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> So Bad' is [...] standard Whitney-fare".|$|E

500|$|The {{growth of}} lesbian {{feminism}} in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused {{to work with}} gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—entrapment and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized {{as an alternative to}} sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed [...] "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars".

It is set in time signature of common time and features a basic chord progression of B/E–Em–Cm–G7. Houston's vocals span from the note of Am7 to the note of D5. According to Stephen Holden of New York Times, the song is a [...] "lovelorn lament with a realistic twist". He noted that, through the verses, the singer congratulates herself for breaking up with an abusive boyfriend and admits that she is still in love.|$|E
500|$|... "Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> When I Pee?" [...] {{was written}} in the summer of 1978. Zappa's road manager, Phil Kaufman, alleged, that the song was written after Kaufman had asked that very question; {{within the context of the}} album's storyline, it is sung by Joe after he {{receives}} a sexually transmitted disease from Lucille, [...] "a girl, who works at the Jack in the Box". The Central Scrutinizer continues to express the hypothesis that [...] "girls, music, disease, heartbreak [...] all go together." [...] Halfway through the album's libretto, Zappa expressed the belief, that governments believe, that people are inherently criminals, and continue to invent laws, which gives states the legal grounds to arrest people, leading to the fictional criminalization of music, which occurs towards the end of the album's storyline.|$|E

Babyface, Houston and some other African-American female singers recorded songs for the album. The song was one of the final additions to the soundtrack. [...] "Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> So Bad" [...] was originally written by Babyface for Houston, two years prior to the release of Waiting to Exhale, but Houston refused to record it at that time. [...] "I wasn't really in the mood for singing about why it hurts so bad," [...] said Houston. Two years later, according to Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly, the emotions of the movie merged with the real-life circumstances of Houston's troubled marriage to Bobby Brown. [...] "Now, I'm ready to sing not only the joys of things, but the pains of things, also," [...] Houston explained.|$|E
500|$|After a cameo {{appearance}} in A Day at the Beach (1970), {{and a serious}} role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sinéad Cusack in Hoffman, Sellers starred in Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup opposite Goldie Hawn. According to The Times, the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he [...] "was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario [...] he played in There's a Girl in My Soup". The film {{was seen as a}} small revival of his career. However, Sellers's next films, including Rodney Amateau's Where <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt?</b> (1972) and Peter Medak's Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's The Optimists of Nine Elms. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers [...] "a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion". This was echoed by Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only There's a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the twenty-three-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers's private doubts—expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger—about his decision to re-marry.|$|E

Jean Rosenbluth of Los Angeles Times praised the song, saying [...] "Houston's elegant 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)' [...] exude maturity without resorting to the relentlessly big vocals that characterize so many R records aiming for adult audiences." [...] Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Sounding like someone who has just emptied her lungs after holding her breath a long time, Houston brings a surprisingly mature, world-weary tone to the song." [...] Robert Hilburn, pop music critic of Los Angeles Times, noted Babyface's achievement in the song, saying [...] "he [...] brings Houston down to earth, trading her normal vocal exuberance for convincing warmth." [...] Larry Flick of Billboard called the song [...] "a surprisingly understated shuffle-ballad with soul and far more interesting vocal colors than all the shrieking can provide."

[...] Anthony Violenti of The Buffalo News gave the song a positive review, commenting that Houston's vocals were intoxicating. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in their review of the soundtrack, viewed the song as [...] "easy and understated". Steve Knopper of Newsday wrote that the song was [...] "irresistibly catchy" [...] and irritating at the same time. However, Patricia Smith of The Boston Globe wrote that the [...] "Shoop Shoop"s were [...] "annoying". While reviewing Houston's compilation Whitney: The Greatest Hits (2000), Christine Galera of Orlando Sentinel also expressed her dislike for the song, stating the songs from Waiting to Exhale, including [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] and [...] "Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> So Bad," [...] were too mellow.|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{accompanying}} soundtrack, , {{was written}} and produced by Babyface. Though he originally wanted Houston {{to record the}} entire album, she declined. Instead, she [...] "wanted {{it to be an}} album of women with vocal distinction", and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, {{to go along with the}} film's message about strong women. Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R female recording artists along with Houston, such as Mary J. Blige, Brandy, Toni Braxton, Aretha Franklin, and Patti LaBelle. Houston's [...] "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" [...] peaked at No. 1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R Charts. [...] "Count On Me", a duet with CeCe Winans, hit the U.S. Top 10; and Houston's third contribution, [...] "Why <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Hurt</b> So Bad", made the Top 30. The album debuted at No. 1, and was certified 7× Platinum in the United States, denoting shipments of seven million copies. The soundtrack received strong reviews; as Entertainment Weekly stated: [...] "the album goes down easy, just as you'd expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks... the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense" [...] and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks. Later that year, Houston's children's charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work.|$|E
