This study investigated temperature, seeding depth and genotypic effects on crown development of barley; relationships between crown and seminal root systems; and classification and description of crown systems under deep seeding. Two greenhouse experiments were performed using PVC tubes. Low temperature and deep seeding reduced percentage and rate of emergence but increased <b>crown</b> number, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and <b>crown</b> weight in most genotypes. <b>Crown</b> number, <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>crown</b> weight showed increased associations with seminal root, whole root, and shoot weight at low temperature and deep seeding in most genotypes. Deep plantings showed that crown systems of barley can be classified as unicrown, bicrown and multicrown types with some variants.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a 3 D model-based tree interpreter, a semi-automatic method for tree measurement from highresolution aerial images. It emphasizes {{the extraction of}} the 3 D geometric information such as tree location, tree height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> (or <b>crown</b> height), crown radius, and surface curvature. First, trees are modeled as 30 hemi-ellipsoids with the following parameters: tree-top coordinates, trunk base height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> <b>crown</b> radius, and crown surface curvature. This model-based approach turns a tree interpretation task into a problem of optimal tree model determination. Multi-angular images are {{used to determine the}} optimal tree model for each tree. Tree tops in each image of a stereo pair are identified interactively with the epipolar constraint, and the 30 geometry of trees can be determined automatically. With such a semi-automatic scheme, efficiency and reliability of 3 ~ tree measurements are achieved by taking advantages of both the operator's interpretation skills and the machine's computation. This paper mainly deals with conifers. The method was tested with a closed conifer stand on 2 : 2, 400 -scale photographs. An overall accuracy of 94 percent and 90 percent was obtained for tree height and crown radius measurements, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{architecture}} determines a tree's light capture, stability, {{and efficiency}} of crown growth. The hypothesis that light demand and adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated-whether species differed in their tree height, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and <b>crown</b> diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15 -cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny. Tree height {{was positively correlated with}} adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>crown</b> diameter were negatively correlated with adult stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently small {{to reduce the risk of}} mechanical failure. All architectural patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height extension and mechanical stability. In general, light demand and adult stature represent independent axes of architectural differentiation, affecting tree architecture in different ways...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop regression prediction models for tree age, tree height, crown diameter, crown ratio and <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> for A. senegal growing in Ferlo, in the northern Senegal. F our plantations of different years old (ISRA, 10 years old plant ations, Ndodj, 8 years old plantations, Boulal, 5 years old plantations and Déali, 4 years old plantations) were selected. The following dendometric variables : crown height, crown diameter, stem diameter at the breast height, stem basal diameter (at 0. 30 m) and the height from the tree base to first branch were measured on a total of 489 trees. The results suggested that the ecological structure of the different year old A.

Thinning for renaturalisation - The first stages of {{management}} and renaturalisation of black pine plantations are founded on thinnings, which are primarily aimed at increasing physical stability and creating favourable ecological conditions for the natural regeneration of autochthones species. The research aims at experimenting two different intensities in the first thinning of a black pine young stand of good fertility {{in the area of}} Pratomagno (Arezzo). The effects of the thinning on the main dendrometric parameters have been evaluated by means of three different inventories: i) 1998 before and after thinning, ii) 2002, iii) 2006. In particular the dynamics of horizontal structure (permanent transects) and the trend of stability indicators (height – diameter ratio, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> <b>crown</b> area, crown diameter – stem diameter ratio) have been investigated. Thinning intensity is strictly related to increasing of the pine forest functionality. In a thirty years old stand in good fertility conditions a “strong thinning” (reduction of about half the number of trees and 35 % of basal area) is proved to be effective in increasing stability and stimulating crown growth. </span...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop an}} {{appropriate}} method of conservation for the native Rhododendron sections Brachycalyx and Tsutsusi, {{the symbol of}} Satoyama, field experiments were performed in the dry granite region in Japan. When carpet-type landscape of native rhododendrons was desired, all plants were cut at 20 cm above the ground level of all trees and shrubs, and the herbs and ferns were weeded (once and three times, respectively). When the shrubby-type landscape of native rhododendrons was desired, all plants, excluding native rhododendrons, were cut at 20 cm above the ground level of all trees and shrubs, the herbs and ferns were weeded, and the litter was swept. After three years of monitoring the percentage and <b>depth</b> of <b>crowns</b> with flower buds, the following major results were obtained. Cutting all plants excluding native rhododendrons was effective to keep the <b>depth</b> of <b>crowns</b> with flower buds.

40|$|Summary We {{compared}} {{the range and}} variation in shoot silhouette area to projected leaf area ratio (SPAR) in fertilized and unfertilized (control) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees. We measured SPAR for several view directions of 169 shoots at different <b>depths</b> in the <b>crown</b> of fertilized and control trees. There {{was an increase in}} SPAR with <b>depth</b> in the <b>crown</b> in both control and fertilized trees. In the fertilized trees, how-ever, mean SPAR was larger overall, the increase with <b>depth</b> in the <b>crown</b> was steeper, and there was a larger variation in SPAR with inclination and rotation angle of the shoot (relative to the view direction). In particular, shoots in the lower crown of fertilized trees were rotationally asymmetrical (“flat”) and had high values of the maximum ratio of shoot silhouette area to projected leaf area (SPARmax). Differences in SPAR between fertilized and control trees were explained by changes in shoot structure in response to fertilization and shading. Shoots of fertilized trees were larger and had more needle area than shoots of control trees. How-ever, the ratio of needle area to shoot size was smaller in fertil-ized trees than in control trees, implying less within-shoot shading and, consequently, a larger SPAR. Also, the increase in SPAR with increased shading (<b>depth</b> in the <b>crown)</b> could be explained by a decrease in the ratio of needle area to shoot size. In addition, because fertilized trees had more needle area than control trees, the effect of shading at a given <b>depth</b> in the <b>crown</b> was more pronounced in fertilized trees than in control trees...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of double-curvature arch dams {{is an attractive}} solution from an economic viewpoint due to the reduced volume of concrete necessary for their construction as compared to conventional gravity dams.

40|$|Background and Aims: Morphological {{variation}} in light-foraging strategies potentially plays {{important roles in}} efficient light utilization and carbon assimilation in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments such as tropical moist forest understorey. By considering a suite of morphological traits at various hierarchical scales, we examined the functional significance of crown shape diversity and plasticity in response to canopy openness. Methods: We conducted a field comparative study in French Guiana among tree saplings of 14 co-occurring species differing in light-niche optimum and breadth. Each leaf, axis or crown functional trait was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Key Results: We found divergent patterns between shade-tolerant and heliophilic species {{on the one hand}} and between shade and sun plants on the other. Across species, multiple regression analysis showed that relative <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> was positively correlated with leaf lifespan and not correlated with crown vertical growth rate. Within species displaying a reduction in <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> in the shade, we observed that <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> was limited by reduced crown vertical growth rate and not by accelerated leaf or branch shedding. In addition, the study provides contrasting examples of morphological multilevel plastic responses, which allow the maintenance of efficient foliage and enable effective whole-plant light capture in shaded conditions under a moderate vertical light gradient. Conclusions: This result suggests that plastic adjustment of relative <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> does not reflect a strategy maximizing light capture efficiency. Integrating and scaling-up leaf-level dynamics to shoot- and crown-level helps to interpret in functional and adaptive terms inter- and intraspecific patterns of crown traits and to better understand the mechanism of shade tolerance.

Endophytes can alter the growth as well as morphological and physiological characteristics of the host plant, thereby influencing the persistence and survival rate of infected plants. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of endophyte on phenotypic characteristics of Iranian tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.). The experiment was set up as a completely randomized design with three replications in a factorial arrangement. The first factor was the two plant accessions and the secondary factor was the endophyte-infected and noninfected plants. The results showed that most of phenotypic characteristics significantly altered as a result of endophyte infection in both tall fescue and meadow fescue plants. Results of analysis of variance showed that the influence of endophyte fungus was positive and significant on tiller number, herbage yield, dry crown weight, dry root weight per plant, and <b>crown</b> <b>depth.</b> Also between plant accessions, there were significant differences for dry herbage yield, crown weight, dry root weight per plant, <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and dry matter percentage.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Weedy rye (Secale spp.) is a weed in the winter-wheat- growing {{regions in}} the Pacific Northwest and {{surrounding}} regions. Ethiazin (4 -amino- 6 -(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 3 - (ehtylthio) - 1, 2, 4 -triazine- 5 (4 H) -one) has shown selective control of weedy rye in the cultivar 'Stephens', (Triticum aestivum). Field, greenhouse, and outdoor pot experiments were conducted to determine factors influencing selectivity. Field studies were conducted in eastern Oregon in 1985 - 86 to determine the optimum timing and rate to apply ethiazin for weedy rye control, and also {{to see if the}} addition of metribuzin would increase rye control while reducing the ethiazin rate. Stephens wheat tolerated the herbicide treatments at all locations. Optimum timing for application was the 2 - 3 leaf stage of rye for two of the locations. Application at the 1 - 2 leaf stage was most effective at the remaining location. Rye control was enhanced with increasing ethiazin rate. The addition of metribuzin enhanced rye control at a lower rate of ethiazin. Wheat grain yields, above ground biomass, and culm number of wheat increased with increasing rye control. Greenhouse and outdoor pot studies were conducted in Pendleton and Corvallis, Oregon, through 1985 - 87, to identify factors influencing this selectivity. Uptake experiments indicated that rye is more sensitive to ethiazin through root uptake than through foliar uptake. In time-of-application studies conducted outdoors, best control was at the one-, two-, and three-leaf stage of rye. Control was lower at preemergence and the four-leaf stage. Depth of seeding did not affect sensitivity of rye to ethiazin. Immersing roots of wheat and rye seedings into ethiazin solution at various concentrations showed Stephens to be 13 times more tolerant than cereal rye to ethiazin. This indicates that selectivity between wheat and rye seen in the field is primarily due to physiological differences. From a management standpoint, this is greatly preferable to selectivity based on differences in retention on the foliage, rooting <b>depth,</b> <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and other morphological factors. Weedy rye appears to be taxonomically different from the cultivated species (Secale cereale). Wild and weedy rye were equally sensitive to ethiazin when tested in a solution bioassay...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} studies of non-elongating subcrown internode (NE) in spring barley {{and its role}} in plant performance under reduced water use. Chapter 1 covers the inheritance study of NE. Chapter 2 reports a two year study of seeding depth and subcrown internode length (SIL) effects in performance of barley, wheat and durum genotypes. Chapter 3 reports on genetic and environmental factors that affect <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>crown</b> root development under a one-irrigation cultural regime. The research was conducted between 1990 and 1993 under field and greenhouse conditions. The NE character appears to be controlled by a major recessive gene. Selecting the NE trait is relatively easy by conventional plant breeding. SIL variation is continuous and seems regulated by several modifiers that interact strongly with the environment. Expression of genes for SIL require deep seeding. Under field conditions and regardless of genotype, shallow seeding inhibited SIL but produced shallow crowns while deep seeding stimulated SIL but produced deeper crowns. Deep seeding increased yield, 100 -seed weight, seeds/spike, an days to anthesis, but reduced tillers/m² and plant height in most genotypes. Short SIL genotypes (≤ 2. 6 mm) were more favored by deep seeding than long SIL genotypes (≥ 8. 2 mm). The correlations of SIL and <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> with yield and yield components increased with deep seeding. The time of crown root initiation varied tremendously among barley plants of CC XXXIX. Crown roots/plant could be predicted by leaves/plant (r = 0. 92; P ≤ 0. 01). Most plants in CC XXXIX had crown root initiation around the 3 -leaf stage. The rate of soil moisture decreased with soil depth. Soil moisture between day 7 and day 21 after the planting irrigation was depleted by 77 % at 0 - 2. 5 cm and by 40 % at 12. 5 - 15 cm depth. The construction of specific soil water tension curves based on soil moisture distribution over a dry period after the planting irrigation could be of great value in determining optimal seeding depth, choice of variety, and establishment of selection criteria for <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and time of crown root initiation in a breeding program for reduced water use. Line P 4 had no-SIL regardless of light and population density. Light deficiency increased SIL of Seco and the Yemen line more than high population density. The internodes below the crown in P 4 are insensitive to light and population density, but internodes above the crown in the same line are as sensitive as Seco and the Yemen line. Screening for NE can be very efficient in the greenhouse at the seedling stage...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} shows temperature {{to be the}} primary environmental factor controlling the phyllochron, or rate of leaf appearance, of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Experimental results suggest that soil temperature at <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> rather than air temperature above the canopy, would better predict wheat leaf appearance rates. To test this hypothesis, leaf appearance in spring wheat (2 ̆ 7 Nordic 2 ̆ 7) was measured in a 2 -year field experiment (Nunn clay loam soil; fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic, Argiustoll) with three planting dates and two soil temperature treatments. One temperature treatment (denoted + 3 C) consisted of heating the soil at <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> to 3 °C above the ambient soil temperature (denoted +OC). Main stem cumulative leaf number was measured at least weekly until flag leaf emergence. Leaf appearance was essentially linear with both air and soil growing degree-days (GDD), although there was a stronger linear relationship with soil GDD in the +OC plants than in + 3 C plants. A weak positive relationship between planting date and the phyllochron was observed. Unexpectedly, we found that heating the soil did not increase the rate of leaf appearance, as the paradigm would predict. To explain these results, we propose extending the paradigm in two ways. First, three processes are involved in leaf appearance: (1) cell division at the shoot apex forms the primordium; (2) cell division in the intercalary meristem forms the cells that then (3) expand to produce the leaf. Cell division is predominately controlled by temperature, but cell expansion is considerably more affected by factors other than temperature, explaining the influence of other factors on the phyllochron. Secondly, the vertical distribution of the two meristems and region of cell expansion occur over a significant distance, where temperature varies considerably, and temperature at a specific point (e. g. <b>crown</b> <b>depth)</b> does not account for the entire temperature regime under which leaves are developing...|$|R

Growth was compared over a 2 ½− 3 year period that immediately followed thinning at 5 ½− 7 ½ years of age. Towards {{the end of the}} growth period, tree <b>crown</b> <b>depths</b> and leaf mass per unit area were measured at one site. <b>Crown</b> <b>depth</b> and leaf mass per area of C. citriodora were greater than of E. dunnii, characteristics consistent with a more shade tolerant species. Gross stand basal area growth of E. dunnii was faster than that of C. citriodora. Individual-tree basal area growth behaviour was consistent with inter-tree competition involving asymmetric competition for light. Opening the stand by thinning reduced inter-tree competition to near zero. In unthinned control stands, smaller, more shaded trees of C. citriodora were better able to retain their basal area growth rates than those of E. dunniiin the face of competition. In consequence, the more shade tolerant C. citriodoradeveloped a more evenly spread frequency distribution of tree diameters than less shade tolerant E. dunnii.

The lowest recorded pH was 1. 7, and chlorinity ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 5 times that of seawater. The highest fluid temperatures recorded on site were 115 degrees C. Two main types of fluids were identified: low-chlorinity fluids containing low concentrations of alkalis (potassium, lithium, sodium) and calcium, and high concentrations of silica and sulphate; and high-chlorinity fluids containing high concentrations of alkalis and calcium, and lower concentrations of silica and sulphate. The type locality of the high-chlorinity fluids is shallow submarine in Palaeochori, near the cast end of the south coast of the island, whereas the type locality of the low-chlorinity fluids is a cave to the west of Palaeochori. The two fluid types are therefore often referred to as "submarine" and "cave" fluids respectively. Both fluid types had low magnesium and high metal concentrations but were otherwise consistently different from each other. The low-chlorinity fluids had the highest cobalt, nickel, aluminium, iron and chromium (up to 1. 6 mu M, 3. 6 mu M, 1586 mu M, 936 mu M and 3. 0 mu M, respectively) and the high-chlorinity fluids had the highest zinc, cadmium, manganese and lead (up to 4. 1 mu M, 1. 0 mu M, 230 mu M and 32 mu M, respectively). Geochemical modelling suggests that metals in the former are likely to have been transported as sulphate species or free ions and in the latter as chloride species or free ions. Isotopic values for both water types range between delta D - 12 to 33 parts per thousand and delta(18) O 1. 2 to 4. 6 parts per thousand. The range of fluid compositions and isotopic contents indicates a complex history of evolution for the system. Both types of fluids appear to be derived from seawater and thus are likely to represent end members of a single fluid phase that underwent phase separation at <b>depth.</b> <b>Crown</b> Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.

Don {{trees were}} {{examined}} on branches {{of different ages}} and orders over an 8 -month growing season in two stands of different spacing (6700 and 760 stems/ha) and age (7 and 9 years) growing on a fertile site. Trees of the more open stand consistently had three orders of branching and living branches up to 6 years old, while the close-spaced stand had only two orders of branching and living branches up to 4 years old. The main period of needle emergence was from August to November, although a few fascicles in the topmost crown level continued to emerge until March. Final needle length decreased with <b>depth</b> in the <b>crown</b> and generally with increasing branch order. Needle length of fascicles which emerged early in spring were {{in only a few}} cases significantly greater than those of summer-emerging needle fascicles. Generally needle elongation had ceased by mid-February while the main period of branch elongation was considerably less, i. e., from September to early November, and coincided with the period of needle emergence. The close-spaced trees showed net gains in numbers of fascicles in the first-order branches in the upper two crown levels {{at the end of the}} season. Trees of the medium-spaced stand showed greatest net foliage gains in the second- and third-order branches and losses in the first-order branches; the upper two crown levels, however, could not be reached. Values for specific needle areas of the needles, measured in May only, ranged from 121 to 293 cm-/g and increased with <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> and decreased with needle age...|$|R

In the unthinned treatment, upper crown ileedles were heavier and had more leaf area than lower crown needles. Branch- and crown-level leaf area of the thinned trees increased 91 and 1 O 9 %, respectively, and whole-crown foliage biomass doubled. The increased crown leaf area {{was a result of}} more live branches and foliated shoots and larger branch sizes in the thinned treatment. Branch leaf area increased with increasing <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> froin the top to the mid-crown and decreased towards the base of the crow 11. Thinning stimulated foliage growth chiefly in the lower crown. At the same <b>crown</b> <b>depth</b> in the lower crown, branch leaf area was greater in the thinned treatment than in the unthinrted treatment. Maxi~nu~n leaf area per branch was located nearly 3 - 4 In below the top of the crown in the unthinned treatment and 4 - 5 m in the thinned treatment. Leaf area of the tltin~led-treatment trees increased 70 % in the upper crown and 130 % in the lower crow 11. Fertilization enhanced needle size and leaf area ill the upper crown, but had no effect on leaf area and other variables at the shoot, branch and crown levcl.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Canopy structure, {{which can}} be defined as the sum of the sizes, shapes and {{relative}} placements of the tree crowns in a forest stand, is central to all aspects of forest ecology. But there is no accepted method for deriving canopy structure from the sizes, species and biomechanical properties of the individual trees in a stand. Any such method must capture the fact that trees are highly plastic in their growth, forming tessellating crown shapes that fill all or most of the canopy space. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We introduce a new, simple and rapidly-implemented model [...] the Ideal Tree Distribution, ITD [...] with tree form (height allometry and crown shape), growth plasticity, and space-filling, at its core. The ITD predicts the canopy status (in or out of canopy), <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and total and exposed crown area of the trees in a stand, given their species, sizes and potential crown shapes. We use maximum likelihood methods, in conjunction with data from over 100, 000 trees taken from forests across the coterminous US, to estimate ITD model parameters for 250 North American tree species. With only two free parameters per species [...] one aggregate parameter to describe crown shape, and one parameter to set the so-called depth bias [...] the model captures between-species patterns in average canopy status, crown radius, and <b>crown</b> <b>depth,</b> and within-species means of these metrics vs stem diameter. The model also predicts much of the variation in these metrics for a tree of a given species and size, resulting solely from deterministic responses to variation in stand structure.

40|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{has increased}} fuel loads and fuel continuity in mixed-conifer ecosystems, resulting in forest structures that {{are vulnerable to}} catastrophic fire. This paper models fire behaviour in a mixed-conifer forest and investigates how silvicultural and fuels treatments affect potential fire behaviour. The computer program FARSITE was used to spatially and temporally model fire growth and behaviour. Fire modelling was performed in the North Crane Creek watershed of Yosemite National Park. Treatments were simulated by adjusting fuel (total load, load-by-size class, <b>depth.)</b> height-to-live <b>crown</b> base, tree height, and crown density parameters. Treatments modeled included prescribed burn, pile and burn, cut and scatter, thinning and biomass, thinning and biomass followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection harvest with and without slash and landscape-level fuel treatment. The prescribed burn, thinning and biomassing followed by prescribed burn, and salvage or group selection with slash and landscape fuel treatments resulted in the lowest average fireline intensities, heat per unit area, rate of spread, area burned, and scorch heights. Cut and scatter, salvage or group selection treatments that do not treat slash fuels resulted in fire behaviour that is more extreme than the untreated forest. Restoration of mixed-conifer ecosystems must include an examination of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures. Combinations of prescribed fire and/or mechanical treatments {{can be used to}} reduce wildfire hazard...|$|R
