Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doubly</b> <b>fed</b> {{electric}} motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) {{power to the}} energy conversion process, {{with at least one}} of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed {{electric motors}} are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.|$|E

50|$|DTC {{techniques}} for the interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) {{were introduced in}} the late 1990s and synchronous reluctance motors (SynRM) in the 2010s. DTC was applied to <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> machine control in the early 2000s. <b>Doubly</b> <b>fed</b> generators are commonly used in 1-3 MW wind turbine applications.|$|E
50|$|New {{generator}} designs {{such as the}} asynchronous or induction singly-fed generator, the <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> generator, or the brushless wound-rotor <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> generator {{are seeing}} success in variable speed constant frequency applications, such as wind turbines or other renewable energy technologies. These systems thus offer cost, reliability and efficiency benefits in certain use cases.|$|E
50|$|In {{renewable}} energy systems, frequency converters are {{an essential component}} of <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generators (DFIGs) as used in modern multi-megawatt class wind turbines.|$|E
5000|$|For {{variable}} speed wind turbines, {{one of two}} types of generators can be used: a DFIG (<b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generator) or an FRC (fully rated converter).|$|E
50|$|The Vestas V90-3MW is a three bladed upwind {{wind turbine}} {{generator}} that uses pitch control and a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generator (50 Hz version). Its manufacturer claims to have installed over 500 units of this type globally since launch.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Doubly</b> <b>fed</b> {{generators}} are {{one solution}} to this problem. Instead of the usual field winding fed with DC, and an armature winding where the generated electricity comes out, there are two three-phase windings, one stationary and one rotating, both separately connected to equipment outside the generator. Thus the term [...] "doubly fed".|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of AC motors are {{classified}} as induction and synchronous. The induction motor (or asynchronous motor) always relies on a small difference in speed between the stator rotating magnetic field and the rotor shaft speed called slip to induce rotor current in the rotor AC winding. As a result, the induction motor cannot produce torque near synchronous speed where induction (or slip) is irrelevant or ceases to exist. In contrast, the synchronous motor does not rely on slip-induction for operation and uses either permanent magnets, salient poles (having projecting magnetic poles), or an independently excited rotor winding. The synchronous motor produces its rated torque at exactly synchronous speed. The brushless wound-rotor <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> synchronous motor system has an independently excited rotor winding that does not rely {{on the principles of}} slip-induction of current. The brushless wound-rotor <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> motor is a synchronous motor that can function exactly at the supply frequency or sub to super multiple of the supply frequency.|$|E
50|$|The {{generator}} in a {{wind turbine}} produces alternating current (AC) electricity. Some turbines drive an AC/AC converter—which converts the AC to direct current (DC) with a rectifier {{and then back}} to AC with an inverter—in order to match the frequency and phase of the grid. However, the most common method in large modern turbines is to instead use a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generator directly connected to the electricity grid.|$|E
50|$|Already in the mid-1990s, the D4 was {{produced}} with active pitch regulation {{as well as}} a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generator. This technology proved itself and, therefore, was implemented in the following models D6 and D8. Especially advantageous are the decoupling of the rotational speed of the turbine rotor and the grid frequency. By using the inertia of the turbine rotor, it reduces mechanical loads on turbine components and prevents peaks in electricity feed-in.|$|E
50|$|Today these {{generators}} aren't used {{any more}} in modern turbines. Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system, which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through-capabilities. Modern concepts use either <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators (both permanently and electrically excited) with full scale converters.|$|E
50|$|A wound-rotor motor {{can be used}} {{in several}} forms of adjustable-speed drive. Certain types of variable-speed drives recover slip-frequency power from the rotor circuit and feed it back to the supply, {{allowing}} wide speed range with high energy efficiency. <b>Doubly</b> <b>fed</b> electric machines use the slip rings to supply external power to the rotor circuit, allowing wide-range speed control. Today speed control by use of slip ring motor is mostly superseded by induction motors with variable-frequency drives.|$|E
50|$|A {{variable-frequency}} transformer is a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> {{electric machine}} resembling a vertical shaft hydroelectric generator with a three-phase wound rotor, connected by slip rings to one external power circuit. The stator {{is connected to}} the other. With no applied torque, the shaft rotates due to the difference in frequency between the networks connected to the rotor and stator. A direct-current torque motor is mounted on the same shaft; changing the direction of torque applied to the shaft changes the direction of power flow.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 Nordex {{launched}} the Delta-Class-Series, entering series production in January 2014 with prototypes installed in mid-2013. There {{will be two}} new types of turbines, the N100/3300 strong-wind turbine and the N117/3000, which is designed for medium-wind sites. Both turbines feature the rotorblades already used in the Gamma-Series, with the rotorblades of the N117 being slightly upgraded to withstand the higher wind speeds in IEC wind class 2a. Both turbines are equipped with a three-stage gearbox and a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> asynchronous generator.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1990s the company {{installed}} wind farms using its ECO20 150 kW model, from 1995 to 2000 the company's primary models were the ECO44 (640 kW) and ECO48 (750 kW) models. After 2003 most of the company's installations used its 1.67MW IEC-1400-1 class II ECO74, and class IIIA ECO80, three blade turbine models; both typically used a mechanically isolated Winergy AG PEAB 4390.2 planetary gearbox driving a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generator (typically ABB, Siemens, Winergy sourced) with IGBT inverter control, driven by individually pitch controlled LM manufactured blades.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doubly</b> <b>fed</b> {{electric}} motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) {{power to the}} energy conversion process, {{with at least one}} of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed {{electric motors}} are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.|$|E
50|$|The GE 2.5MW {{wind turbine}} (also called GE2.5XL) {{is the second}} and larger model of land based wind {{turbines}} sold by General Electric. It is currently in operation on three continents; Europe, Asia, and North America. The 845MW Shepherds Flat Wind Farm in Oregon is the first windpark in the United States to utilize this model as its primary wind turbine. Unlike GE's 1.5MW models, the 2.5XL uses a permanent magnet generator, and its entire output is converted to AC at mains frequency. A second generation, using a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> generator and rotor converter similar to the 1.5 series, is in planning.|$|E
50|$|If {{connections}} to the rotor coils of a three-phase motor are taken out on slip-rings and fed a separate field current to create a continuous magnetic field (or if the rotor consists of a permanent magnet), the result is called a synchronous motor because the rotor will rotate synchronously with the rotating magnetic field produced by the polyphase electrical supply. Another synchronous motor system is the brushless wound-rotor <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> synchronous motor system with an independently excited rotor multiphase AC winding set that may experience slip-induction beyond synchronous speeds but like all synchronous motors, does not rely on slip-induction for torque production.|$|E
50|$|An active crowbar is {{a crowbar}} that can remove the short circuit when the {{transient}} is over thus allowing {{the device to}} resume normal operation. Active crowbars use a transistor, gate turn off (GTO) thyristor or forced commutated thyristor instead of a thyristor to short the circuit. Active crowbars are commonly used to protect the frequency converter in the rotor circuit of <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> generators against high voltage and current transients caused by the voltage dips in the power network. Thus the generator can ride through the fault and quickly continue the operation even during the voltage dip.|$|E
50|$|Since {{industrial}} use of energy accounts for 51% of worldwide energy usage improving energy efficiency {{in this field}} is a top priority for environmental technology companies around the globe. Advanced energy efficient electric motor (and electric generator) technology that are cost effective to encourage their application, such as the brushless wound-rotor <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> electric machine and energy saving module, can {{reduce the amount of}} carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere, if electricity is generated using fossil fuels. Greasestock is an event held yearly in Yorktown Heights, New York {{which is one of the}} largest showcases of environmental technology in the United States.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} design, {{called the}} wound rotor, is used when variable speed is required. In this case, the rotor {{has the same}} number of poles as the stator and the windings are made of wire, connected to slip rings on the shaft. Carbon brushes connect the slip rings to a controller such as a variable resistor that allows changing the motor's slip rate. In certain high-power variable-speed wound rotor drives, the slip-frequency energy is captured, rectified, and returned to the power supply through an inverter. With bidirectionally controlled power, the wound rotor becomes an active participant in the energy conversion process, with the wound rotor <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> configuration showing twice the power density.|$|E
50|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor in which, at steady state,the {{rotation of the}} shaft is synchronized with {{the frequency of the}} supply current; the rotation period is exactly equal to an integral number of AC cycles. Synchronous motors contain multiphase AC electromagnets on the stator of the motor that create a magnetic field which rotates in time with the oscillations of the line current. The rotor with permanent magnets or electromagnets turns in step with the stator field at the same rate and as a result, provides the second synchronized rotating magnet field of any AC motor. A synchronous motor is only considered <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> if it is supplied with independently excited multiphase AC electromagnets on both the rotor and stator.|$|E
5000|$|The GE 1.5 {{megawatt}} {{series of}} wind turbines was developed {{with the cooperation}} of the United States Department of Energy. It consists of three fibreglass blades attached to a horizontal axis hub. The hub is connected to the main shaft which turns a multi-stage system of gears. The gears increase the rotational rate and send the kinetic energy obtained from the wind to a <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> electric machine, where it is converted into electrical energy. The angle of the blades and the direction which the turbine faces are controlled by an active, all electric pitch and yaw system. The generator has a maximum output of [...] The generator and gearbox are contained in the nacelle which is further insulated to minimize noise emissions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doubly</b> <b>fed</b> {{electrical}} generators {{are similar}} to AC electrical generators, but have additional features which allow them to run at speeds slightly above or below their natural synchronous speed. This is useful for large variable speed wind turbines, because wind speed can change suddenly. When {{a gust of wind}} hits a wind turbine, the blades try to speed up, but a synchronous generator is locked to the speed of the power grid and cannot speed up. So large forces are developed in the hub, gearbox, and generator as the power grid pushes back. This causes wear and damage to the mechanism. If the turbine is allowed to speed up immediately when hit by a wind gust, the stresses are lower and the power from the wind gust is converted to useful electricity.|$|E
50|$|Older style wind {{generators}} rotate at {{a constant}} speed, to match power line frequency, which allowed the use of less costly induction generators. Newer wind turbines often turn at whatever speed generates electricity most efficiently. The varying output frequency and voltage can be matched to the fixed values of the grid using multiple technologies such as <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> induction generators or full-effect converters where the variable frequency current produced is converted to DC {{and then back to}} AC. Although such alternatives require costly equipment and cause power loss, the turbine can capture a significantly larger fraction of the wind energy. In some cases, especially when turbines are sited offshore, the DC energy will be transmitted from the turbine to a central (onshore) inverter for connection to the grid.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{components of a}} synchronous motor are the stator and the rotor. The stator of synchronous motor and stator of induction motor are similar in construction. With the wound-rotor synchronous <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> electric machine as the exception, the stator frame contains wrapper plate. Circumferential ribs and keybars {{are attached to the}} wrapper plate. To carry the weight of the machine, frame mounts and footings are required. When the field winding is excited by DC excitation, brushes and slip rings are required to connect to the excitation supply. The field winding can also be excited by a brushless exciter. Cylindrical, round rotors, (also known as non salient pole rotor) are used for up to six poles. In some machines or when a large number of poles are needed, a salient pole rotor is used.The construction of synchronous motor {{is similar to that of}} a synchronous alternator.|$|E
5000|$|None of the NASA prototypes became {{commonly}} {{produced as}} commercial generators because {{the purpose of}} the program was to develop the technology and support the emerging industry. Many of the technologies such as <b>doubly</b> <b>fed</b> variable speed generators, light weight tubular towers, and the engineering design tools used in the wind industry today were developed and pioneered by the NASA program. Total cost of the program between 1974 and 1992 was $330 million. For reference, the global wind market had reached $47 billion annually by 2008. General Electric, Boeing Engineering and Construction, Westinghouse and United Technologies were the commercial partners on the program, some of whom are involved in the wind industry today. Although it has widely been stated that no commercial designs were produced, NASA's industry partners did indeed produce commercial turbines during this program such as the Boeing Mod-2 (described earlier) and Westinghouse 600 kW turbines at Kahuku wind farm in Hawaii. [...] When oil prices declined by a factor of three from 1980 through the early 1990s during what {{came to be known as}} the [...] "1980s oil glut", many turbine manufacturers, both large and small, left the business. The commercial sales of the NASA/Boeing Mod-5B, for example, came to an end in 1987 when Boeing Engineering and Construction announced they were [...] "planning to leave the market because low oil prices are keeping windmills for electricity generation uneconomical." [...] A summary of the DOE/NASA large wind turbine program was published in 1984.|$|E
