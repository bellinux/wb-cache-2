40|$|Abstract. Based on {{a cutting}} {{dynamics}} model, a new <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> process model that integrates workpiece quality and machining condition information is proposed, and the mapping relationship between machine tool structural dynamics and product quality information (e. g., dimension error, surface shape) is analyzed in detail. On {{the basis of}} the <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> process model, the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis method of the machining process is investigated, and an implementation flowchart of the method is proposed with explanations of critical techniques. Finally, the proposed model is applied to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the machining process of a CNC end milling machine. The damage of its spindle bearing is detected successfully, which provides the proof for the root cause identification of machining error in the <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> process...|$|R

2500|$|The Chinese {{room has}} a design {{analogous}} {{to that of}} a modern computer. It has a Von Neumann architecture, which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a CPU which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in theoretical computer science as [...] "Turing complete", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a Turing machine can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other <b>digital</b> <b>machine,</b> given enough memory and time. Alan Turing writes, [...] "all digital computers are in a sense equivalent." [...] The widely accepted Church-Turing thesis holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the album}} {{ready to be}} mixed, Yello decided to try the new digital mixing process instead of the {{standard}} analogue process, and in August 1984 they visited Hartmann Digital Studio in Nuremberg where engineer Tom Thiel began mixing the album. However, Yello abruptly cancelled the sessions after just ten days, unhappy {{with the sound of}} the album. Meier explained that the duo felt that the songs were losing their soul, saying, [...] "Getting technically more experienced was leading us onto a slick perfectionist track. We even went to a German digital studio to do the most perfect remixes on a <b>digital</b> <b>machine</b> with the SSL Desk and the rest of it. And we had to learn, a difficult process for us, that perfection is just a way to escape from having nothing to say... With Stella we were being dragged down by an excess of perfection." [...] Blank later said, [...] "All the balances were wrong and the dynamic was lost, so I did lots of remixes again in Zurich to save this album". The group returned to their studios in Zurich and Blank started the process of remixing the tracks himself, with the exception of [...] "Desert Inn" [...] which he felt was acceptable as it was, [...] "Blue Nabou" [...] which the duo had already decided would not appear on the album and hence there was no urgency to improve it, and [...] "Angel No" [...] because Blank did not have time to mix it to the standard that he wanted. With the delay in mixing, the album's provisional release date of 1 October 1984 could not be met, and in order to avoid being lost among the Christmas releases, a new release date in January 1985 was set.|$|E

40|$|With intensifying global competition, {{manufacturers}} are facing challenges {{to reduce the}} cost of production as much as possible and yet improve their product quality. A <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> system, which is the kernel of a virtual machining system, is desired to design optimal process conditions and evaluate processing alternatives with a minimal cost and time before the process is implemented on the shop floor. ^ The goal of this research is to develop a <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> system based on mechanistic models. The system consists of integrative dynamic machining process models, which combine the machining process modules developed by the previous researchers in the author 2 ÃÜ 7 s group, a spindle analysis model, and new machining process models, such as endmilling and grinding process models developed for the integrative system. To this end, the expandable general base model is built in the system and the interfaces for extending to upper level models are provided for easy integration. ^ A comprehensive endmilling model is developed that simulates the process under general cutting conditions. A new method to extract cutting pressure coefficients is also introduced. Time-domain dynamic models are also developed to simulate cylindrical plunge grinding, surface grinding and infeed centerless grinding processes under general grinding conditions. The models focus on the prediction of grinding chatter. Critical issues are considered in the model, including the distributed nonlinear forces along the contact length and the geometrical interaction between the wheel and workpiece based on their surface profiles. A simulation program is developed using the models to predict regenerative forces, dynamic responses, surface profiles, stability regions, and chatter thresholds. The models are validated using numerical and experimental results. ^ The development of the <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> system is completed by integrating the 2 ÃÜ 2 Dynamic Thermo-Mechanical Spindle-Bearing 2 ÃÜ 2 model (Li, 2002) through a modular interface using modal superposition methods. The <b>digital</b> <b>machining</b> system is evaluated in aspects of determining spindle related machining process constraints, predicting spindle status-dependent chatter boundaries and selecting cutting tools. ...|$|R
