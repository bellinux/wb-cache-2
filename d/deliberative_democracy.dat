5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E
25|$|Among modern {{political}} theorists, {{there are three}} contending conceptions of the fundamental rationale for democracy: aggregative democracy, <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy,</b> and radical democracy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deliberative</b> <b>{{democracy}}</b> {{is based}} on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E

25|$|Without overstating it (and without fully {{defending}} it) {{not only}} is there a consensus about the need for a conception of the good, there may even be a consensus about the particular conception of the good that should inform policies on these nonconstitutional political issues.

500|$|To {{explain how}} to break free of the prison and its institutions, Satin {{develops}} a [...] "psychocultural" [...] class analysis that reveals the existence of [...] "life-", [...] "thing-", and [...] "death-oriented" [...] classes. [...] According to Satin, life-oriented individuals constitute an emerging [...] "third force" [...] in post-industrial nations. [...] The third force is generating a [...] "prison-free" [...] consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes, spirituality, multiple perspectives, a cooperative mentality, local-and-global identities, and an ecological outlook. [...] To transform prison society, Satin argues, the third force {{is going to have}} to launch an [...] "evolutionary movement" [...] to replace– or at least supplement– monolithic institutions with life-affirming, [...] "biolithic" [...] ones. [...] Some representative biolithic institutions are: <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> as an alternative to bureaucratic government, bicycles and mass transit as an alternative to the private automobile, and mediation as an alternative to attorney-centered law. [...] According to Satin, the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism, since Western civilization– not capitalism– is said to be responsible for the prison. [...] But the third force will want to foster a prison-free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{contributes}} to the discussion on <b>deliberative,</b> direct <b>democracy</b> and volunteer mobilization in the Internet era by analyzing the participation levels of Wikipedia volunteer editors (Wikipedians). On 18 th January 2012 in the “first Internet strike” against the American SOPA legislation, over two thousands Wikipedians {{took part in the}} vote concerning whether their site should undertake a protest action, with vast majority expressing support for this action. However, the vote participants formed {{only a tiny fraction of}} the total number of Wikipedians who number in millions. Although Wikipedia can be seen as an open, democratic forum practicing <b>deliberative,</b> direct <b>democracy,</b> the process of voting on Wikipedia is significantly influenced by participation inequality, with a majority of the vote participation coming from a small group of most active contributors – an effective oligarchy. This paper discusses the intricate dynamics between Wikipedia egalitarian ethos and the creed to discuss project matters deliberately on one hand and conspicuous lack of promotion and advertisement stemming from a rule against “canvassing” and an overall skepticism regarding the status of majority votes. The core reason responsible for the low levels of participation is an inefficient information distribution system, as the vast majority of Wikipedians were not aware of the ongoing discussions and the vote itself until after their conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is to discuss the significance of a democratic approach in science education. Initially, the concept of "democracy" is outlined. According to the <b>deliberative</b> view, <b>democracy</b> is learnt and practiced in communication with others. Furthermore, according to sociocultural theory, communication also enhances scientific content knowledge. This implies that deliberative discussions could be helpful in carrying out teachers' dual assignment: to transmit knowledge and foster independent, judicious, democratic citizens. The discussion is approached through the presentation of a simulated teaching sequence. Based on this scenario, in which a socioscientific issue is the theme for deliberation, the possibilities and limitations of a deliberative approach in science education is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|Emanuel wrote Where Civic Republicanism and <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Democracy</b> Meet (1996) for the Hastings Center Report. In {{this article}} Emanuel {{questioned}} whether a defect in our medical ethics causes {{the failure of}} the US to enact universal health care coverage. The macro level of the issue is the proportion of total gross national product allotted to health care, the micro level is which individual patient will receive specific forms of health care, e.g., [...] "whether Mrs. White should receive this available liver for transplantation." [...] In between are the basic or essential health care services that should be provided to each citizen. The end-stage renal disease program {{is an example of a}} service that increases the total cost of health care, and reduces the amount that can be spent on basic or essential health care.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel {{distinguished}} between basic services {{that should be}} guaranteed to everybody from discretionary medical services that are not guaranteed. The result would be a two tiered system, where those with more money could afford more discretionary services. He saw a failure to define basic services as the reason attempts at universal health care coverage have failed. As a result, the belief that universal health care would require unlimited costs makes any attempt at providing universal health care seem likely to end in national bankruptcy. Instead of universal coverage of basic health care, those who are well insured have coverage for many discretionary forms {{of health care and}} no coverage for [...] some basic forms of health care. Emanuel said that while drawing a line separating basic and universal health care from discretionary health care is difficult, the attempt should be made. Emaniel mentioned the philosophies of Amy Gutmann, Norman Daniels and Daniel Callahan when arguing that there is an overlap between liberalism and communitarianism where civic republicanism and <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> meet. According to The Atlantic, Emanuel is describing the philosophy of John Rawls in arguing that society is choosing one value (equality) over another (a healthy society), and this substitution may be responsible for limited choices in health care. PolitiFact says that Emanuel was describing the fact that doctors often have to make difficult choices, such as who should get a liver transplant. [...] PolitiFact also said, [...] "Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> can {{be practiced}} by {{decision-makers}} in both representative democracies and direct democracies. In elitist <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy,</b> principles of <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> apply to elite societal decision-making bodies, such as legislatures and courts; in populist <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy,</b> principles of <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> apply {{to groups of}} lay citizens who are empowered to make decisions. One purpose of populist <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> can be to use deliberation {{among a group of}} lay citizens to distill a more authentic public opinion about societal issues but not directly create binding law; devices such as the deliberative opinion poll have been designed to achieve this goal. Another purpose of populist <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> can be to serve as a form of direct democracy, where deliberation among a group of lay citizens forms a [...] "public will" [...] and directly creates binding law. If political decisions are made by deliberation but not by the people themselves or their elected representatives, then there is no democratic element; this deliberative process is called elite deliberation.|$|E
40|$|Political protests {{are growing}} in {{emerging}} and established emocracies. Since the 1970 s, {{the demand for}} political participation has become obvious. The 1990 s saw more open dialogue-oriented participatory instruments, which began to be implemented in some countries (‘century of participation’). The proliferation of participatory instruments {{in the field of}} talk centric <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracies</b> has been called the ‘deliberative turn’ (Dryzek, 2002). A new push is also attributed to the open government data, the movement initiated by the US President Obama’s government when it set up its open government data initiative in 2009. These include online and offline participation (Kersting, 2013). It is a practice that most new instruments of participation are implemented at the local level. It is frequently argued that these deliberative forums do not lead to binding decisions. However, compared to elections, the number of citizens participating is rather small and selective. New forms of vote-centric direct democracy such as referenda and other initiatives are implemented in some countries. The paper presents a model of offline and online participation. The focus will be on representative and direct democratic participation. Participation in elections and proliferation of referenda and initiatives will be analysed. Participation in these spheres of numeric democracy can lead to binding decisions. Legal frameworks of different European countries is presented and compared.

50|$|The deliberative {{element of}} {{democracy}} was not widely studied by academics {{until the late}} 20th century. Although some of the seminal work {{was done in the}} 1970s and 80s, it was only in 1990 that <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> began to attract substantial attention from political scientists. According to Professor John Dryzek, early work on <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Democracy</b> was part of efforts to develop a theory of Democratic legitimacy. Theorists such as Carne Ross advocate <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> as a complete alternative to representative democracy. The more common view, held by contributors such as James Fishkin, is that direct <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> can be complementary to traditional representative democracy. Since 1994, hundreds of implementations of direct <b>deliberative</b> <b>democracy</b> have taken place throughout the world.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a contribution to}} knowledge by demonstrating that <b>deliberative</b> theories of <b>democracy</b> have failed to {{take sufficient account of}} social difference and by arguing for a more complex and relational understanding of social identity to be considered in democratic theory.

I show how some of the main deliberative theories to date have failed to commit to a sufficient understanding of social identity, before demonstrating how identity should be conceived for the purposes of deliberative models. I further argue that, in view of the importance of social identity in political participation, we should understand our civic and political spheres as porous, rather than as distinct. Identity is not something we can ignore in political life, and attempts to minimise its workings are more likely to result in problems, than promote greater political harmony. I will demonstrate throughout the course of this thesis that attempts to efface, minimise or overcome identity in deliberative theory leads to that theory being unable to recognise some of the important workings of social identity in democracy...|$|R
