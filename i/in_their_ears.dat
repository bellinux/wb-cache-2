5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each earring on a child had to be purchased at an expensive potlatch. Earrings were common in the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E

25|$|All Folds {{are born}} with straight, {{unfolded}} ears, and those with the Fold gene will begin to show the fold usually within about 21 days. The kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Straights. The original cats only had one fold <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears,</b> but due to selective breeding, breeders have increased the fold to a double or triple crease that causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head.|$|E

500|$|The Manx water bull mating with an {{ordinary}} cow usually {{results in the}} death of the cow after she produces a dead and [...] "rude lump of flesh and skin without bones", whereas its Scottish counterpart produces live calves whose only deformity is apparent <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b> The bulls have no ears themselves and therefore produce calves with only half ears, described by folklorist and Tiree Minister John Gregorson Campbell as [...] "knife-eared". Water cows living at Leverburgh produce offspring with disfigured crimson or purple-coloured ears.|$|E
500|$|Beneath the surface, {{freediving}} {{is necessarily}} restricted to shallow descents. Pearl divers have traditionally greased their skins, put cotton <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and clips on their noses, and dived to [...] with baskets {{in order to}} collect pearl oysters. Human eyes are not adapted for use underwater, but vision can be improved by wearing a diving mask. Other useful equipment includes fins and snorkels. Scuba equipment allows underwater breathing, permitting hours of time beneath the surface. The depths that {{can be reached by}} divers and the length of time they can stay underwater is limited by the increase of pressure they experience as they descend and the need to prevent decompression sickness as they return to the surface. Recreational divers are advised to restrict themselves to depths of under [...] beyond which the danger of nitrogen narcosis increases. Deeper dives can be made with specialized equipment and training.|$|E
2500|$|French and Saunders {{shared a}} flat whilst at college and were {{influenced}} to do comedy by their flatmates {{as part of}} their projects for college. After talking in depth for the first time, they came to be friends. While at college she broke up with her fiancé, a former Royal Navy officer. After they graduated, they formed a double-act called the Menopause Sisters. Saunders has described the act, which involved wearing tampons <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears,</b> as [...] "cringeworthy". The manager of the club recalled, [...] "They didn't seem to give a damn.

2500|$|After {{the initial}} {{friction}} while at college, Saunders and French shared a flat together. French has remarked on Saunders's messy habits when sharing the house, stating, [...] "When we lived together in Chalk Farm, {{she had a}} room {{at the top of the}} house. We got broken into and the police said, 'Well, it is quite bad, but the worst is that room at the top.' And, of course, nobody had been in there." [...] The two performed together after graduation, working the festival, cabaret, and stand-up circuits. They formed a double-act called The Menopause Sisters. Saunders described the act, which involved wearing tampons <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears,</b> as [...] "cringeworthy."

2500|$|The {{reverberation}} of {{the explosion}} was heard at North Shields, [...] distant, where residents thought the shock was an earthquake. Gas lights in a Jarrow paper mill were blown out. Light debris from the fire was scattered across [...] of Gateshead and environs. Miners in Monkwearmouth colliery, the deepest {{in the country and}} [...] away, heard the explosion and came to the surface, concerned as to the cause. [...] westward at Hexham; [...] north at Alnwick; and [...] south at Hartlepool the explosion was heard distinctly; and for [...] out to sea. The light of the flames could be seen, reflected in the sky, [...] away at Northallerton. And whilst the report {{of the explosion}} travelled so far, people on the scene were insensible of it. They describe themselves as having been lifted from their feet and dashed down, the violence completely stunning them; and when they awoke in a stupor they had only the dim idea of a rolling sound <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Oblina (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh) – Oblina {{comes from}} a wealthy monster family, and is {{considered}} by The Gromble to be his best student. She {{is the daughter of}} an overbearing mother named Sublima who she refers to as [...] "mumsy dearest". She is shaped like a black and white, upside-down candy cane, resembling a banded sea krait. One of her favorite methods of scaring humans is reaching within herself and pulling out her internal organs, and she has considerable talent for shapeshifting into various terrifying forms. She also has a talent for inducing nightmares in humans, by sticking her finger <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and tickling their brains while they sleep. She also has big red lips and temporarily lost them to a coy young human girl who wanted to be a model. When voicing Oblina, Christine Cavanaugh attempted to make the voice sound like a British version of the actress Agnes Moorehead.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{children}} and adults experience problems caused by foreign objects getting stuck in their bodies. Young children, in particular, are naturally curious and may intentionally put shiny objects, such as coins or button batteries, into their mouths. They also like to stick things <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears</b> and up their noses. The effect of a foreign body can be very different. For example, a coin causes local pressure on the tissue but generally, is not a medical emergency to remove. A button battery, {{which can be a}} very similar size to a coin, generates hydroxide ions at the anode and causes a chemical burn in 2 hours. [...] An ingested button battery that is stuck in the esophagus is a medical emergency. In 2009, Avolio Luigi and Martucciello Giuseppe showed that although ingested nonmagnetic foreign bodies are likely to be passed spontaneously without consequence, ingested magnets (magnetic toys) may attract each other through children's intestinal walls and cause severe damage, such as pressure necrosis, perforation, intestinal fistulas, volvulus, and obstruction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interpreter}} of the Lewis and Clark Expedition mistakenly identified this people as the Nez Perce {{when the team}} encountered the tribe in 1805.

[...] She wrote, [...] "It is never easy to come at {{the name of an}} Indian or even of an Indian tribe. A tribe has always at least two names; one they call themselves by and one by which they are known to other tribes. All the tribes living west of the Rocky Mountains were called [...] "Chupnit-pa-lu," [...] which means people of the pierced noses; it also means emerging from the bushes or forest; the people from the woods. [...] The tribes on the Columbia river used to pierce the nose and wear in it some ornament as you have seen some old fashioned white ladies wear <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>ears.</b> Lewis and Clark had with them an interpreter whose wife was a Shoshone or Snake woman and so it came about that when it was asked [...] "What Indians are these?" [...] the answer was [...] "They are 'Chupnit-pa-lu'" [...] and it was written down in the journal; spelled rather queerly, for white people's ears do not always catch Indian tones and of course the Indians could not spell any word." ...|$|E
