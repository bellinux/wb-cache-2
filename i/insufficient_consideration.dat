2500|$|The {{meaning of}} {{insolvency}} matters {{for the type}} of legal rule. In general terms insolvency has, since the earliest legislation, depended upon inability to pay debts. The concept is embodied in the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(f) which states that a court may grant a petition for a company to be wound-up if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts". This general phrase is, however, given particular definitions depending on the rules for which insolvency is relevant. First, the [...] "cash flow" [...] test for insolvency represented under section 123(1)(e) is that a company is insolvent if [...] "the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due". This is the main test used for most rules. It guides a court in granting a winding-up order or appoints an administrator. The cash flow test also guides a court in declaring transactions by a company to be avoided on the ground they were at an undervalue, were an unlawful preference or created a floating charge for <b>insufficient</b> <b>consideration.</b> The cash flow test is said to be based on a [...] "commercial view" [...] of insolvency, as opposed to a rigid legalistic view. In Re Cheyne Finance plc, involving a structured investment vehicle, Briggs J held that a court could take into account debts that would become payable in the near future, and perhaps further ahead, and whether paying those debts was likely. Creditors may, however, find it difficult to prove in the abstract that a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Because of this, section 122(1)(a) contains a specific test for insolvency. If a company owes an undisputed debt to a creditor of more than £750, the creditor sends a written demand, but after three weeks the sum is not forthcoming, this is evidence that a company is insolvent. In Cornhill Insurance plc v Improvement Services Ltd a small business was owed money, the debt undisputed, by Cornhill Insurance. The solicitors had repeatedly requested payment, but none had come. They presented a winding up petition in the Chancery Court for the company. Cornhill Insurance's solicitors rushed to get an injunction, arguing that there was no evidence at all that their multi-million business had any financial difficulties. Harman J refused to continue the injunction noting that, if the insurance company had [...] "chosen" [...] not to pay, a creditor was also entitled to choose to present a winding up petition when a debt is undisputed on substantial grounds.|$|E

First, a literature review has been carried out on the major development of buildability and constructability in different countries, including Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom the United States. A series of interviews with experienced industry practitioners in Hong Kong (including expatriates) aiming at exploring the present state-of-the-art on the subject has been conducted. The insights have provided solid groundwork for future buildability studies due to their practicality. Despite the sample size being small, the public and private sector interviewees were differentiated by their design-outcome oriented and design-process oriented perspectives. Buildability problems emerged {{because of the lack of}} clear project briefing and <b>insufficient</b> <b>considerations</b> of buildability at the design stage. Mitigation measures at the design stage include co-ordinating the delivery process, revisiting works done, training on site production techniques and cross-discipline communication, etc. From the procurement perspectives, Partnering in Design & Build would serve in a better way in alleviating buildability problems.

40|$|Complex {{engineering}} systems {{often require}} dynamic coordination of multidisciplinary teams with conflicting objectives. Failing {{to understand the}} complex relationships among the conflicting objectives may result in serious engineering failures. In engineering education, {{one of the challenges}} in teaching complex systems is the lack of effective tools to demonstrate system dynamics, especially spatial-temporal relationships in the system. The described project in this paper is supported by grants from Engineering Education program of the National Science Foundation. In the project civil/construction engineering cases are used as the context to test the proposed new teaching/learning tool on the subject and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed tool. In building system design, structural designs mainly focus on the behavior of structures under design loads specified for operating stage. Typically less attention is given to the dynamic transient load during various construction stages. The <b>insufficient</b> <b>considerations</b> of the construction related transient loads may reach the critical point during construction and cause structural failure. For example, there were cases of bridge collapse during construction due to inadequate considerations of the load dynamics during construction. Also, many factors affecting construction transient loads were not technical. Rather, they are management related such as construction sequence and cost considerations. Thus, enabling construction students to learn from the similar cases through effective media is critical to avoid repeating the mistakes...|$|R

Stigter 11 An “end to end ” scheme in agrometeorology, for the build-up and transfer of agrometeorological and agroclimatological information, which was recently developed by the author, is validated in this paper with case studies from the most recent literature from Latin America and Africa. The introduction places the {{establishment of}} needs for climate forecasts and other agrometeorological information for agriculture by local, national and regional decision-makers and users communities in the right context of the local, national and international livelihood conditions of farmers and their communities. It may be concluded that after this exercise this scheme is a good guideline for understanding the value of activities {{in the fields of}} data, research, education, training & extension and policies, for the design of agrometeorological services for end-users. The main bottlenecks appear to be: (i) <b>insufficient</b> <b>considerations</b> of these actual conditions of the livelihood of farmers and therefore; (ii) developments of inappropriate support systems.

40|$|One of the {{defining}} characteristics of sustainability assessment {{as a form}} of impact assessment is that it provides a forum for the explicit consideration of the trade-offs that are inherent in complex decision-making processes. Few sustainability assessments have achieved this goal though, and none has considered trade-offs in a holistic fashion throughout the process. Recent contributions such as the Gibson trade-off rules have significantly progressed thinking in this area by suggesting appropriate acceptability criteria for evaluating substantive trade-offs arising from proposed development, as well as process rules for how evaluations of acceptability should occur. However, there has been negligible uptake of these rules in practice. Overall, we argue that there is inadequate consideration of trade-offs, both process and substantive, throughout the sustainability assessment process, and <b>insufficient</b> <b>considerations</b> of how process decisions and compromises influence substantive outcomes. This paper presents a framework for understanding and managing both process and substantive trade-offs within each step of a typical sustainability assessment process. The framework draws together previously published literature and offers case studies that illustrate aspects of the practical application of the framework. The framing and design of sustainability assessment are vitally important, as process compromises or trade-offs can have substantive consequences in terms of sustainability outcomes delivered, with the choice of alternatives considered being a particularly significant determinant of substantive outcomes. The demarcation of acceptable from unacceptable impacts is a key aspect of managing trade-offs. Offsets can be considered {{as a form of}} trade-off within a category of sustainability that are utilised to enhance preferred alternatives once conditions of impact acceptability have been met. In this way they may enable net gains to be delivered; another imperative for progress to sustainability. Understanding the nature and implications of trade-offs within sustainability assessment is essential to improving practice...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is to}} develop an obstetrical CBCA adapted to the West African context and assess its reliability and validity.

Early 2010, two auditors applied the CBCA to identical samples at 8 sites in Mali and Senegal (n = 185) to evaluate inter-rater reliability. In 2010 - 11, we conducted CBCA at 32 hospitals to assess construct validity (n = 633 patients). We correlated hospital characteristics (resource availability, facility perinatal and maternal mortality) with mean hospital CBCA scores. We used generalized estimating equations to assess whether patient CBCA scores were associated with perinatal mortality. Results: Results demonstrate substantial (ICC = 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 54; 0. 76) to elevated inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 77; 0. 89) in Senegal and Mali, respectively. Resource availability positively correlated with mean hospital CBCA scores and maternal and perinatal mortality were inversely correlated with hospital CBCA scores. Poor CBCA scores, adjusted for hospital and patient characteristics, were significantly associated with perinatal mortality (OR 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 3. 34).

40|$|The {{extent to}} which Australian psychologists and psychiatrists are cognisant of the legal {{standard}} for Fitness to Stand Trial (FST) was investigated. 198 psychologists from The Australian Psychological Society (APS), and 125 psychiatrists from The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) responded to a survey. Psychiatrists identified {{a greater number of}} legal criteria than psychologists. This finding extended across clinicians who had experience in the evaluation of fitness to stand trial and those who did not. No difference was found between psychologists and psychiatrists for mentioning irrelevant or <b>insufficient</b> <b>considerations.</b> However, a within-group analysis revealed that the most likely condition under which psychologists and psychiatrists were found to incorporate 2 ̆ 2 mental state {{at the time of the}} offence 2 ̆ 2 was when they had done between 1 and 4 evaluations. Membership of both the Forensic and Clinical Colleges of the APS and the Forensic Section of RANZCP was also associated with the ability to identify more of the relevant legal criteria. The methods that psychologists and psychiatrists use to establish FST differed and were found to reflect basic training. Psychiatrists rely on the use of the clinical interview and consultation with lawyers, regardless of whether the basis of the request for assistance is intellectual disability or mental disorder. Psychologists place much greater emphasis on the use of psychometric tests, particularly when intellectual disability is implicated. The results indicate that generally both psychologists and psychiatrists have an insufficient understanding of the legal criteria for fitness to stand trial. This investigation also points to the urgent need for the APS and RANZCP to ensure membership of their forensic college or section is conditional on the completion of a formal forensic training program.

This study examined whether significant differences in bacterial content were detected when using a culture-independent, molecular profiling technique to analyze SES or IS samples. Moreover, this work examined what trends relating to bacterial species distributions and reproducibility were found in sequentially induced sputum samples and what implications this has for pathogen detection.

The reliance on analysis of a single respiratory sample was not sufficient for the detection of recognized CF pathogens in all instances.

40|$|Abstract—Wideband power {{spectrum}} sensing {{is essential for}} cognitive radio and many other applications. Aiming to crowdsource spectrum sensing operations, a novel frugal sensing framework was recently proposed, employing a network of low duty-cycle sensors (e. g., running in background mode on con-sumer devices) reporting randomly filtered broadband power measurement bits to a fusion center, which in turn estimates the ambient {{power spectrum}}. Frugal sensing is revisited here from a statistical estimation point of view. Taking into account fading and <b>insufficient</b> sample averaging <b>considerations,</b> maximum likelihood (ML) formulations are developed which outperform the original minimum power and interior point solutions when the soft power estimates prior to thresholding are noisy. Assuming availability of a downlink channel that the fusion center can use to send threshold information, active sensing strategies are developed that quickly narrow down and track the power spectrum estimate, using ideas borrowed from cutting plane methods to develop active ML solutions. Simulations show that satisfactory wideband power spectrum estimates can be obtained with passive ML sensing from few bits, and much better performance can be attained using active sensing. Various other aspects, such as known emitter spectral shapes and different types of non-negativity constraints, are also considered.

40|$|Landscape {{performance}} is a newly initiated effort {{to evaluate the}} outcomes of landscape solutions in constructed projects. Built upon the sustainability triad, the outcomes landscape performance attempts to measure consists of environmental, economic and social aspects. These outcomes are collected and used to guide future design. The primary {{purpose of this study}} is to enhance landscape performance measurement to better inform future decision making. To achieve this goal, I took a four step approach: 1) reviewing performance measurement in four design disciplines to learn experiences from other disciplines and provide recommendations for landscape performance measurement, 2) studying current published case studies to identify gaps in the current landscape performance quantification practices, 3) analyzing the currently used landscape metrics and methods to identify gaps, and providing recommendations for future improvement, and 4) integrating costs into the framework of landscape performance quantification and exploring economic evaluation methods to valuing non-market landscape performance benefits to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of sustainable solutions. The results show that compared to previous performance measurements and rating systems, landscape {{performance is}} the only one with a framework that addresses the three aspects of sustainability. Its framework uses practices to guide research and simultaneously uses research results to inform practices. It has a good potential of collecting evidence for sustainable solutions and promoting measureable sustainable landscape practices. However, since landscape performance research is still new, it has a number of gaps, such as insufficient social and economic benefit quantification, <b>insufficient</b> cost <b>consideration,</b> and a lack of core prototype measuring methods and explicitly defined performance benchmarks. These gaps undermine credibility of landscape performance results and restrict its contribution to future decision making. This study helps fill these gaps by providing a number of recommendations, such as developing performance benchmarks for typical landscape solutions, developing robust core measuring systems to facilitate efficient data collection and quantification, and developing sample questionnaires to help with social benefits quantification. The significance of this study is that it will enhance the framework of landscape performance quantification, clarify cost embedded benefits of sustainable solutions, and promote sustainable landscape design practices...|$|R

Results: Analgesics and sedatives were administered to 224 of 340 newborns before the end-of-life decision and to 292 newborns after the decision. The medication was increased in 94 of 289 newborns whose death was imminent and in 110 of 150 newborns with a poor prognosis. Reasons for the increase were treatment of pain and suffering, and in 4 % of cases hastening of death. Reasons were undocumented in 55 % of deaths. Neuromuscular blockers were administered in 16 % of patients because they already received these agents or to stop or prevent gasping. Conclusions: Analgesics and sedatives are generally increased after the end-of-life decision to treat pain and suffering and rarely to hasten death. Neurornuscular blockers were administered in 16 % of deaths. Medical files provide <b>insufficient</b> documentation of <b>considerations</b> leading to the increase of medication, which hinders (external) review...|$|R
