The <b>dimple</b> diameter is 5 cm kept constant. While <b>dimple</b> depth is varied as 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm, so that <b>dimple</b> depth to <b>dimple</b> diameter ratio is maintained as 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4.

Fluent 6. 3. 26, a finite volume flow solver is used for solving governing equations for present geometry. The cell count is based on grid independence study and y+ value.

The numerical analysis clarifies the flow structure due to <b>dimple</b> surface. The heat transfer enhancement because of <b>dimple</b> surface is due to flow separation at the leading edge and reattachment at the trailing edge of the <b>dimple.</b> For the <b>dimple</b> depth δ/D= 0. 3, the augmented strength and intensity of secondary vortices increases the rate of heat transfer enhancement compared to <b>dimple</b> depth δ/D= 0. 2 and δ/D= 0. 4. The heat transfer enhancement rate for <b>dimple</b> depth δ/D= 0. 4 decreases due to strong recirculation zone within the <b>dimple</b> and some fluid is trapped {{at the bottom of the}} <b>dimple...</b>|$|R
30|$|A novel method, named “ball dimpling”, {{has been}} used to detect {{subsurface}} damage in machining of optical parts. The method was developed by the Optical Manufacturing Center of the University of Rochester [28, 29]. Similar to the traditional taper polishing method, the ball <b>dimpling</b> method polishes a sample part with a steel ball to make a <b>dimple</b> in order to expose the subsurface damage of the part. The depth of the <b>dimple</b> is large enough so as to cross the damage layer to the matrix. The depth of SSD is calculated by measuring the characteristic dimensions of the <b>dimple.</b> There are also some other forms of <b>dimpling</b> [30]. The ball <b>dimpling</b> method is simple in operation and low in cost. However, the scratches in a <b>dimpling</b> process may remain on the part surface, which can result in measurement errors. Additionally, the ball <b>dimpling</b> method is time consuming in SSD measurements for the parts made of hard materials due to a low <b>dimpling</b> efficiency [31].|$|R

This paper describes a numerical modelling approach and results into the mechanical properties and structural behaviour of cold-formed <b>dimpled</b> steel. A series of mechanical tests including tensile, plate bending and column compression tests on cold-formed plain and <b>dimpled</b> steel material were conducted for evaluation of numerical results. A finite element approach to practically simulate the <b>dimpling</b> process and experimental tests was presented.

The simulation of the <b>dimpling</b> process revealed that during the process, various levels of plastic strain are developed throughout the thickness of the steel sheet; this could correlate to the increase in the strength of the <b>dimpled</b> steel as observed in experimental tests and simulations. The simulation of the mechanical tests of <b>dimpled</b> specimens predicted similar results to the experiments, in terms of mechanical properties and structural behaviour. Since the finite element approach was able to successfully represent mechanical properties and structural behaviour of <b>dimpled</b> steel, it can be a powerful method in analysis and design of <b>dimpled</b> steel material and completed sections...|$|R

25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by <b>dimples</b> in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed <b>dimples</b> to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|E
40|$|The <b>dimpling</b> {{process is}} a novel cold-roll forming process that {{involves}} <b>dimpling</b> of a rolled flat strip prior to the roll forming operation. This is a process undertaken to enhance the material properties and subsequent products’ structural performance while maintaining a minimum strip thickness. In {{order to understand the}} complex and interrelated nonlinear changes in contact, geometry and material properties that occur in the process, it is necessary to accurately simulate the process and validate through physical tests. In this paper, 3 D non-linear finite element analysis was employed to simulate the <b>dimpling</b> process and mechanical testing of the subsequent <b>dimpled</b> sheets, in which the <b>dimple</b> geometry and material properties data were directly transferred from the <b>dimpling</b> process. Physical measurements, tensile and bending tests on <b>dimpled</b> sheet steel were conducted to evaluate the simulation results. Simulation of the <b>dimpling</b> process identified the amount of non-uniform plastic strain introduced {{and the manner in which}} this was distributed through the sheet. The plastic strain resulted in strain hardening which could correlate to the increase in the strength of the <b>dimpled</b> steel when compared to plain steel originating from the same coil material. A parametric study revealed that the amount of plastic strain depends upon on the process parameters such as friction and overlapping gap between the two forming rolls. The results derived from simulations of the tensile and bending tests were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The validation indicates that the finite element analysis was able to successfully simulate the <b>dimpling</b> process and mechanical properties of the subsequent <b>dimpled</b> steel products...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dimpled</b> steel {{products}} are produced from {{the combination of}} an innovative <b>dimpling</b> process and a traditional forming process such as cold-roll forming or press-braking. The wider use of cold-formed <b>dimpled</b> steel members has promoted considerable interest in the local instability and strength of these members. Of particular interest is their buckling behaviour and ultimate strength capacity in columns under compressive loading. However, the <b>dimpling</b> process produces cold-formed sections with a complex ‘dimpled’ surface topography and the ‘dimpled’ material is non-uniformly work hardened through the entire thickness. Owing to these complex issues, there are no existing analytical and design methods to calculate the buckling strength of <b>dimpled</b> products and validate against physical measurements. This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} compressive behaviour of cold-formed channel and lipped channel <b>dimpled</b> steel columns using Finite Element techniques.
