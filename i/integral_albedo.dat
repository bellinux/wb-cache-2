40|$|The {{goal was}} the {{retrieving}} of hydrological land surface parameters using multisensor data. We got following results: - The {{data of the}} Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS) {{is used to calculate}} the spectral albedo, the <b>integral</b> <b>albedo</b> and some vegetation indices at the land surface. - We determined the column water vapour of the atmosphere using MOS with a ground IFOV of 520 m x 520 m. The achieved accuracy with a maximum error of 20 % is satisfying as it is of the same magnitude as that of other methods. - By using radar signals of ERS- 2 we retrieved soil moisture of unvegetated soil. We got a accuracy of 4 % volumetric soil moisture for different approaches. - We enhanced and modified a method for determining soil moisture in partly vegetated areas. The accuracy of our method is 5 - 8 % volumetric soil moisture. - We defined a new vegetation index, which takes into consideration the reflectance in the NIR region. On the base of this index the leaf area index can be retrieved with a higher accuracy with regard the methods in use, specially for high values of the LAI. We compared the remote sensing sensors being in operation in respect to retrieving of land surface parameters. - We proposed an approach for retrieving the surface temperature using ATSR on ERS- 2.

40|$|Using {{the white}} light {{measurements}} of Knowles Middleton and Mungall (1952), the Minnaert constants, k and B sub zero, are derived for six types of snow surfaces for phase angles up to 80 deg. The {{conclusion is that}} snow is in general a quasi-Lambert scatterer (k = 1. 04 to 1. 35). Even in an extreme case of specular reflection (a 'glazed rain crust'), k is less than 2 at these phase angles. The range in k and B sub zero suggested by these data are then used to estimate some fundamental photometric parameters of smooth snow-covered planets: geometric <b>albedos,</b> phase <b>integrals,</b> Bond <b>albedos,</b> and phase coefficients...|$|R
40|$|An {{approximate}} analytic {{solution is}} derived for the radiative transfer equation describing particulate surface light scattering, {{taking into account}} multiple scattering and mutual shadowing. Analytical expressions for the following quantities are found: bidirectional reflectance, radiance coefficient and factor, the normal, Bond, hemispherical, and physical <b>albedos,</b> <b>integral</b> phase function and phase integral, and limb-darkening profile. Scattering functions for mixtures can be calculated, as well as corrections for comparisons of experimental transmission or reflection spectra with observational planetary spectra. The theory should be useful for the interpretation of reflectance spectroscopy of laboratory surfaces and the photometry of solar system objects...|$|R
40|$|Hapke's (1981) {{photometric}} {{model has}} been combined with a plane-parallel thin atmospheric haze model to describe Voyager whole-disk observations of Triton, in the violet, blue, and green wavelength bands, {{in order to obtain}} estimates of Triton's geometric <b>albedo,</b> phase <b>integral,</b> and Bond <b>albedo.</b> Phase angle coverage in these filters ranging from about 12 to 159 deg was obtained by combining narrow- and wide-angle camera images. An upturn in the data at the highest phase angles observed can be explained by including scattering in a thin atmospheric haze layer with optical depths systematically decreasing with wavelength from about 0. 06 in the violet to 0. 03 for the green filter data...|$|R
40|$|Models {{possessing}} {{an upper}} haze layer of finite optical depth {{and a lower}} cloud layer of infinite optical depth at discrete altitudes are used to bound the wavelength-averaged phase <b>integrals</b> and bolometric <b>albedos</b> of Uranus and Neptune. The models differ in the assumed value of the particles' single scattering phase function and the wavelength dependence of the haze optical depth. A range of phase functions, from the isotropic to those characterizing Titan, Jupiter, and Saturn atmosphere particles, are discussed. The results obtained imply that the meteorological regimes in the observable atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune may differ considerably; internal heat flux could play a much more important role for Neptune than for Uranus...|$|R
40|$|Small scale surface {{features}} of the moons Deimos and Phobos were studied using star tracker observations made by the Mariner 9 and Viking orbiters. The whole-disk brightness/solar phase angle phase curves were developed out to a phase angle of 125 deg. An analysis was undertaken according to Lumme-Bowell theory to obtain accurate phase <b>integrals</b> zero-phase geometric <b>albedos,</b> and Bond albedos. The microstructural and particulate surface properties of the two moons {{were found to be}} very similar, as were the whole-body densities and the microphysical makeup, thereby suggesting a common origin. However, the presence of streamers on Deimos and the relatively smooth surfaces of both moons indicates a long-term influence of Mars producing surface morphologies different from what would occur with asteroids...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{curves of}} Io and Ganymede between 0 and 40 deg solar phase angle have been {{compiled}} from Voyager photopolarimeter and ground-based observations. Modeling the data with the Lumme-Bowell theory {{made it possible}} to determine improved estimates of the surface texture and particulate properties. Accurate V-band zero-phase geometric <b>albedos,</b> phase <b>integrals,</b> and Bond <b>albedos</b> are also obtained. The properties of the particles on Io's surface appear to be different from those of other solar system objects whose surfaces are totally controlled by impact cratering processes. Sulfur and SO 2 frost, previously identified by spectral analysis, seem to exist in a physical form not commonly found on earth. The agglomeration of volcanic ash into aggregates on Io's surface is postulated...|$|R
40|$|Visible and {{near-infrared}} {{spectra of}} chemically analyzed grains {{of glass and}} minerals from the Luna 20 sample were compared with diffuse reflectance spectra of the bulk soil. As in the spectra of soil samples from other localities on the moon, pyroxene contributes two broad absorption features near 1 and 2 microns. The soil has a high <b>integral</b> reflectance (or <b>albedo)</b> arising from plagioclase, {{which appears to be}} the dominant mineral in the lunar highlands. The Luna 20 soil curve is most similar to the reflectance curves of the non-rayed soils at Apollo 16, in agreement with the generally similar mineralogy of these samples. The average pyroxene composition in the Luna 20 soil, as determined from the absorption bands in the diffuse reflectance spectra, and analyses of single crystals, is more calcic than in the lithic fragments. Thus, the soil appears to have a few per cent of admixed material derived from mare basalts. Comparison of the soil spectrum with telescopic curves of nearby areas reveals a close similarity...|$|R
40|$|The Clementine {{mission to}} the Moon in 1994 {{provided}} the first multispectral observations of the lunar opposition surge below a few degrees. The brightness of the Moon increases more than 40 % between solar phase angles of 4 deg and 0 deg. The opposition effect exhibits a small wavelength dependence: the surge is - 3 - 4 % larger at 0. 41 microns than at 1. 00 microns. This result suggests that the principal cause of the lunar opposition surge is shadow hiding, while coherent backscatter, if present, makes only a minor contribution. The amplitude of the effect depends significantly on terrain: the surge is about 10 % greater in the lunar highlands. This difference is attributed to textural variations between the two terrains. The Clementine measurements provide a new basis for deriving spectral geometric <b>albedos,</b> phase <b>integrals,</b> and Bond <b>albedos.</b> A value of 0. 11 +/- 0. 01 was found for the lunar bolometric Bond albedo. This value is {{at the low end}} of the historical published values, but not as low as the recent result of 0. 080 +/- 0. 002...|$|R
40|$|Leonardo-BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) {{is a new}} NASA mission concept {{proposed}} to allow the investigation of radiative transfer {{and its effect on}} the Earth's climate and atmospheric phenomenon. Enabled by the recent developments in small-satellite and formation flying technology, the mission is envisioned to be composed of an array of spacecraft in carefully designed orbits. The different perspectives provided by a distributed array of spacecraft offer a unique advantage to study the Earth's albedo. This paper presents the flight dynamics analysis performed {{in the context of the}} Leonardo-BRDF science requirements. First, the <b>albedo</b> <b>integral</b> is investigated and the effect of viewing geometry on science return is studied. The method used in this paper, based on Gauss quadrature, provides the optimal formation geometry to ensure that the value of the integral is accurately approximated. An orbit design approach is presented to achieve specific relative orbit geometries while simultaneously satisfying orbit dynamics constraints to reduce formation-keeping fuel expenditure. The relative geometry afforded by the design is discussed in terms of mission requirements. An optimal Lambert initialization scheme is presented with the required Delta-V to distribute all spacecraft from a common parking orbit into their appropriate orbits in the formation. Finally, formation-keeping strategies are developed and the associated Delta-V's are calculated to maintain the formation in the presence of perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Three {{weeks prior}} to the {{commencement}} of Cassini's 4 year tour of the saturnian system, the spacecraft executed a close flyby of the outer satellite Phoebe. The infrared channel of the Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) obtained images of reflected light over the 0. 83 – 5. 1 μm spectral range with an average spectral resolution of 16. 5 nm, spatial resolution up to 2 km, and over a range of solar phase angles not observed before. These images have been analyzed to derive fundamental photometric parameters including the phase curve and phase <b>integral,</b> spectral geometric <b>albedo,</b> bolometric Bond albedo, and the single scattering albedo. Physical properties of the surface, including macroscopic roughness and the single particle phase function, have also been characterized. Maps of normal reflectance show the existence of two major albedo regimes in the infrared, with gradations between the two regimes and much terrain with substantially higher <b>albedos.</b> The phase <b>integral</b> of Phoebe is 0. 29 ± 0. 03, with no significant wavelength dependence. The bolometric Bond albedo is 0. 023 ± 007. We find that the surface of Phoebe is rough, with a mean slope angle of 33 °. The satellite's surface has a substantial forward scattering component, suggesting that its surface is dusty, perhaps from a history of outgassing. The spectrum of Phoebe is best matched by a composition including water ice, amorphous carbon, iron-bearing minerals, carbon dioxide, and Triton tholin. The characteristics of Phoebe suggest that it originated outside the saturnian system, perhaps in the Kuiper Belt, and was captured on its journey inward, as suggested by Johnson and Lunine (2005) ...|$|R
