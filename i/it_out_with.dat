5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either. The park made <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> only minor flooding, a few downed trees, and the loss of power at the park marina.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy fought <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> McCarthy in the primaries, as Humphrey used {{favorite}} son stand-ins {{to help him}} win delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Humphrey as McCarthy's main challenger. But Humphrey's organization was too strong for McCarthy to overcome, and his anti-war campaign was split after the late entrance of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota {{just ahead of the}} Democratic National Convention. Despite winning the popular vote, McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E

Owen {{supports}} her decision as he realizes no good could come from him asking her to stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E

She tried painting, tree-cutting, textile art, sculpture, folk singing and acting in a play by Ingmar Bergman. She also tried office work for two months.

Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond wrapped up a {{breakthrough}} year at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships, capturing their fourth title in their last six events with a 64 64 win on Sunday over Květa Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik, losing three straight games from 64 31 but regrouping and winning three straight games of their own to finish it. They fell short on their first two match points but Huber closed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a backhand volley at Srebotnik's body.|$|E

25|$|This {{version of}} Superboy was later seen {{again during the}} events of Zero Hour. He was time-{{displaced}} in the 30th century where he saw various incarnations of The Legion of Super Heroes before being displaced again in present-day Smallville where he encountered a still young and inexperienced modern day clone Superboy(Kon-El). Thinking he was somehow in his own future he was confused to see another Superboy and fought him until coming to realize that something bigger was going on. After talking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the modern Superboy the Pocket Universe Superboy vanished back to his proper time and reality. This Superboy was later retconned {{to have been the}} Earth-One Superboy.|$|E
25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed {{that none of the}} invitees are coming.|$|E

25|$|Chappell, the {{grandson}} of Victor Richardson, had no doubt been weaned on tales of the Bodyline tour by his grandfather, {{one of the few}} Australian batsmen to fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Larwood and his support bowlers. Forty years later, {{and it was time to}} pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E
25|$|For {{all of the}} {{advantages}} of a small ship, there were drawbacks that could sway captains to look to larger vessels. A sloop or a ship of similar size could not carry a large enough crew to take on bigger prizes by boarding and couldn't carry enough firepower to force submission or fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> larger foes; it was also limited in the amount of cargo it could carry. In terms of firepower, anything the size of a sloop would not carry more than fourteen guns, with the French sloop's carrying six guns or less. Conversely some of the largest pirate ships like Bartholomew Roberts flagship the Royal Fortune sported forty-two guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{put forth}} by the two captains was to utilize ships with appropriate characteristics of size and speed, converting them into rams by strengthening their bows with strips of railroad iron. Their machinery was to be protected by internal bulkheads. They would be lightly armed, {{only one or two}} guns apiece according to the wishes of their captains, as they would not be expected to slug <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the armored gunboats then being built for the Union. Instead, they were to rely on ramming, to hit the slow enemy gunboats where they were most vulnerable. The captains would be selected by Montgomery and Townsend from among the experienced rivermen at New Orleans, and each captain would subsequently hire his own crew.|$|E

25|$|He found a {{collaborator}} in Michel Albert, {{who provided}} him with extensive documentation to inform his editorials. One of Albert's reports struck him particularly. It presented the United States and Europe as engaged in a silent economic war, in which Europe appeared to be completely outclassed on all fronts: management techniques, technological tools, and research capacity. Servan-Schreiber saw in this thesis {{the potential for a}} seminal book. He fleshed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> reading keys and concrete proposals for a counter-offensive. The result was his international best-seller Le Défi Américain ("The American Challenge", 1967). It sold 600,000 copies in France, unprecedented for a political essay, and was translated into 15 languages. This book was instrumental in creating a resurgence of French nationalism and drawing attention to the importance of transnational cooperation in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Fury {{was joined}} in 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship by Glenn Seton. While Fury had a {{frustrating}} {{first half of}} the championship, Seton would battle <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the BMW M3 of Richards for the title. The series came down to the last race at Sydney's Oran Park Raceway where Richards used the nimble M3 to defeat Seton and win his second ATCC in three years. With Fury finishing third in the championship, this saw Nissan sharing victory with BMW in the 1987 Australian Manufacturers' Championship. The final competitive race for the Peter Jackson Nissan DR30s came in the Group A support race for the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide where Fury again finished second behind the Ford Sierra RS500 of Dick Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Because April 7 was {{the second}} day of the far bloodier Battle of Shiloh, the {{campaign}} for Island No. 10 soon fell from public notice. It has become memorable principally for the run of USS Carondelet past the batteries, whose passage marked the introduction of a new tactic in warfare. The use of steam for driving ships meant that they no longer had to slug <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> fixed forts. The tactic later became commonplace in the Civil War, being employed by Farragut at New Orleans, Port Hudson, Vicksburg, and Mobile, and by David D. Porter at Vicksburg. Consequently, the value of fixed fortifications was much diminished. The South did not learn this lesson, continuing to rely on forts until the end of the war, but the restored nation had to consider it when designing its defense system from 1865 on.|$|E
