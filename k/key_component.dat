40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is threefold. The first purpose is to review the literature on the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components</b> of an ideal model for the administration of drug courts. The model and its components were developed by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. The second purpose is to assess the extent to which Texas Drug Courts meet the criteria of the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components.</b> The third purpose is to provide recommendations to Texas Drug Courts on implementing the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components.</b> Method. The method relied upon for this applied research project is the survey instrument which was the sole method of data collection. The survey was sent to fifty-one Texas Drug Courts to measure the degree of adherence to the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components.</b> Results. Approximately 33 % of Texas Drug Courts responded to the survey. Of the responses, most courts adhered to the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components.</b> Some <b>key</b> <b>components</b> had better adherence rates than others but approximately 50 % of the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components</b> met the 80 % benchmark set by the author. Conclusion. The recommendations made to Texas Drug Courts are consistent with applying the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components</b> as set forth by the NADCP. The recommendations also include consolidating some components and creating two additional components: a funding component and a State Drug Court Office component. Overall, Texas Drug Courts do adhere to the Ten <b>Key</b> <b>Components,</b> but some components are adhered to more than others. ...|$|R

The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state.

On the eighth play of the drive, running back Ryan Williams gained one yard, then committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty.

5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one <b>key</b> <b>component</b> in {{equipping}} nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E

In April 1943, Robert Serber had {{proposed}} that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto {{to work on the}} development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks {{on the development of}} human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E
