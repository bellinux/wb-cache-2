6000|$|To {{such men}} {{the idea of}} the Incarnation, and still more, that of the Passion, is {{derogatory}} to the very notion of a God. That a God should suffer, and that a God should die, is shocking--and, to do them justice, I believe they speak sincerely--to their notions of the absolute majesty, the undisturbed serenity, of the Author of the universe; of Him in whom all things live and move and have their being; who dwells in the light to which none may approach. And therefore they have, in every age, tried various expedients to escape from a doctrine which seemed repugnant to that most precious part of them, their moral sense. In the earlier centuries of the Church they tried to shew that St John and St Paul spoke, not of one who was Very God of Very God, but of some highest and most primeval of all creatures, Emanation, AEon, or what not. In these later times, when the belief in such beings, and even their very names, have become dim and dead, men have tried to shew that the words of Scripture apply to a mere man. They have seen in Christ--and they have reverenced and loved Him for what they have seen in Him--the noblest and purest, the wisest and the most loving of all human beings; and have attributed such language as that in the text, which--translate it as you will--ascribes absolute divinity, and nothing less, to our Lord Jesus Christ--they have attributed it, I say, to some fondness for Oriental hyperbole, and mystic Theosophy, {{in the minds of the}} Apostles. Others, again, have gone further, and been, I think, more logically honest. They have perceived that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, as His words are reported, attributed divinity to Himself, just as much as did His Apostles. Such a saying as that one, [...] "Before Abraham was, I am," [...] and others beside it, could be escaped from only by one of two methods. To the first of them I shall not allude in this sacred place, popular as a late work has made it in its native France, and I fear in England likewise. The other alternative, more reverent indeed, but, as I believe, just as mistaken, is to suppose that the words were never uttered at all; that Christ--it is not I who say it--possibly never existed at all; that His whole story was gradually built up, like certain fabulous legends of Romish saints, out of the moral consciousness of various devout persons during the first three centuries; each of whom added to the portrait, as it grew more and more lovely under the hands of succeeding generations, some new touch of beauty, some fresh trait, half invented, <b>half</b> <b>traditional,</b> of purity, love, nobleness, majesty; till men at last became fascinated with the ideal to which they themselves had contributed; and fell down and worshipped their own humanity; and christened that The Son of God.|$|E

50|$|The key {{difference}} between a biweekly mortgage payment plan and a traditional mortgage payment plan is that instead of making 12 full payments each year, 26 half payments--the equivalent of 13 full payments--are made each year. On a biweekly mortgage payment plan, some months will require 3 payments or 1 and one <b>half</b> <b>traditional</b> payments. Finance companies use this pattern to their advantage. Finance companies charge interest on a per diem basis instead of monthly. The consumer's repayment is scheduled on a monthly basis. This allows the finance companies to collect an additional 2 weeks of interest every year. Paying biweekly payments allows consumers to eliminate the additional accrued interest charges.|$|E

50|$|For {{many years}} WAWZ carried {{teaching}} programs, talk shows, church services, and traditional Christian music. The station ran the tagline, WAWZ-Your Voice of Faith and Inspiration and featured mostly syndicated evangelical Christian teaching and {{talk shows and}} inspirational music. Local news, AP World News, public affairs programs and several call-in shows added a New Jersey feel to the station as it attempted to serve its license area it had just vigorously defended. Most of the schedule consisted of programming came from area church services and outside ministries via the state-of-the-art Chicago-based Moody Broadcasting Service satellite subscription. Among these was a local program called Search Light which served tri-state area prison inmates. The station ran Share-a-thons twice a year to solicit support from listeners. During the 1980s WAWZ began moving from a conservative format of traditional hymns to more of a Christian MOR format which included softer music by contemporary Christian artists {{as well as the}} traditional music they were playing. By 1990 the music mix was about <b>half</b> <b>traditional</b> and half contemporary By 1994 the music format was nearly all contemporary.

This paper explores in some detail a dozen matters, highlighting dilemmas and, on occasion, possible solutions. The questions posed are fundamental and diverse, relating to such varied aspects as the physical environment itself, the virtual world to which the study centre offers access, the role of traditional materials, the functions of staff responsible for the facility and the purposes for which the area should be used...|$|E

40|$|Vaughan Williams was an {{extraordinary}} ordinary man and a very great composer who has reached during his lifetime the hearts {{of a very large}} section of his countrymen. Music was the mainspring of his being and he put all that he knew into his music. The essential importance of this composer consists in symphonic and song work. He is an author of nine symphonies, ballet, film music and five operas but the very best success reached he with his choral works. He found the basis and inspiration in the music of his own land and has devoted a good deal of energy to the collecting and arranging of folksongs. The influence of that association on his work is obvious but it is egually evident that he is far from being merely an imitator of folksong. The accents of traditional melody appeal to him but his mode of expression is his own - it is wholly personal and it makes use of passing dissonance in a way which no study of folk melodies could possibly have suggested. He was a friend and admirer of romantics but showed distaste for several favourite romantic emotions. His style is <b>half</b> <b>traditional</b> half modern and that is why his music is understandable. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{image quality}} (IQ) of low-radiation-dose paediatric cardiovascular CT angiography (CTA), comparing iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS) and sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) with filtered back-projection (FBP) and estimate {{the potential for}} further dose reductions. METHODS: Forty neonates and children underwent low radiation CTA with or without ECG synchronisation. Data were reconstructed with FBP, IRIS and SAFIRE. For ECG-synchronised studies, half-dose image acquisitions were simulated. Signal noise was measured and IQ graded. Effective dose (ED) was estimated. RESULTS: Mean absolute and relative image noise with IRIS and full-dose SAFIRE was lower than with FBP (P[*]<[*] 0. 001), while SNR and CNR were higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Image noise was also lower and SNR and CNR higher in half-dose SAFIRE studies compared with full-and half-dose FBP studies (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). IQ scores were higher for IRIS, full-dose SAFIRE and half-dose SAFIRE than for full-dose FBP and higher for half-dose SAFIRE than for half-dose FBP (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Median weight-specific ED was 0. 3  mSv without and 1. 36  mSv with ECG synchronisation. The estimated ED of half-dose SAFIRE studies was 0. 68  mSv. CONCLUSIONS: IR improves image noise, SNR, CNR and subjective IQ compared with FBP in low-radiation-dose paediatric CTA and allows further dose reductions without compromising diagnostic IQ. KEY POINTS : • Iterative reconstruction techniques significantly improve non-invasive cardiovascular CT in children. • Using <b>half</b> <b>traditional</b> radiation dose image quality is higher with iterative reconstruction. • Iterative reconstruction techniques may allow further radiation reductions in paediatric cardiovascular CT...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the effectiveness of a computer-assisted lab environment in a course on leadership and to determine if undergraduate students believe that leadership concepts can be successfully taught in an asynchronous environment, in this case, using the technology of the world wide web. Students' attitudes toward computer-based leadership education were measured by a leadership perception index, a technology perception index, a class-inclusion acceptance index, and a discussion technology acceptance index administered through a post-activity survey that measured their responses in both a quantitative and qualitative format. Students participated in a leadership lab activity in one of three treatments: 1) no computer-facilitated interaction and traditional classroom interaction, 2) completely asynchronous, computer-facilitated interaction, or 3) hybrid interaction consisting of half computer-facilitated, and <b>half</b> <b>traditional</b> classroom interaction. A post-activity survey was used to collect data about the students' perceptions of their experiences. Post-activity survey scores indicated that a majority of students accept learning about leadership through asynchronous technological means such as the world wide web. Students who were not exposed to any technological experience in this activity quantitatively answered that the interpolation of technology into leadership education would not be successful. The hybrid group quantitatively felt the use of technology was most acceptable of the three treatment groups, with slightly fewer "positive" results from the completely asynchronous, solely computer-facilitated group. Students had a positive attitude toward computers, and qualitatively identified the need to use computers more prevalently in undergraduate teaching. Students' qualitative results also indicated that students felt that computers were important to their future and most seemed to enjoy to opportunity to complete a lab using them. Since the computer facilitated assignment was completed using the Internet as a connection medium, additional data were collected from students. Interestingly, of students involved in the asynchronous section, only 18 % completed their assignments during morning hours (from 6 : 00 a. m. to noon), while 39 % completed their assignments between 8 : 30 p. m. and 1 : 00 a. m...|$|E
