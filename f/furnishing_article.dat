50|$|Pliny {{states that}} twenty-five cities {{belonged to the}} Jurisdictio or Conventus of Cibyra; and he adds that the town of Cibyra belonged to Phrygia. This, like many other of the Roman {{political}} arrangements, was quite at variance with the physical divisions of the country. Laodicea on the Lycus {{was one of the}} chief cities of this Conventus. Under the Romans, Cibyra was a place of great trade, as it appears (Hor. Ep. i. 6. 33). Its position, however, does not seem very favourable for commerce, for it is neither on the sea nor on a great road. We may conclude, however, that the Roman negotiatores and mercatores found something to do here, and probably the grain of the valley of the Indus and the wool and iron of Cibyra might <b>furnish</b> <b>articles</b> of commerce. Iron ore is plentiful in the Cibyratis. We know nothing of any artists of Cibyra, except two, whom Cicero mentions (Verr. ii. 4. c. 13), who were more famed for their knavery than for artistic skill. Cibyra was much damaged by an earthquake, in the time of Tiberius, who recommended a Senatus Consultum to be enacted for relieving it from payment of taxes (tributum) for three years. In this passage of Tacitus (Ann. iv. 13), it is called civitas Cibyratica apud Asiam.|$|R

40|$|In this {{compendium}} of essays, {{some of the}} world’s leading thinkers discuss their conceptions of space and time, as viewed {{through the lens of}} their own discipline. With an epilogue on the limits of human understanding, this volume hosts contributions from six or more diverse fields. It presumes only rudimentary background knowledge {{on the part of the}} reader. Time and again, through the prism of intellect, humans have tried to diffract reality into various distinct, yet seamless, atomic, yet holistic, independent, yet interrelated disciplines and have attempted to study it contextually. Philosophers debate the paradoxes, or engage in meditations, dialogues and reflections on the content and nature of space and time. Physicists, too, have been trying to mold space and time to fit their notions concerning micro- and macro-worlds. Mathematicians focus on the abstract aspects of space, time and measurement. While cognitive scientists ponder over the perceptual and experiential facets of our consciousness of space and time, computer scientists theoretically and practically try to optimize the space-time complexities in storing and retrieving data/information. The list is never-ending. Linguists, logicians, artists, evolutionary biologists, geographers etc., all are trying to weave a web of understanding around the same duo. However, our endeavour into a world of such endless imagination is restrained by intellectual dilemmas such as: Can humans comprehend everything? Are there any limits? Can finite thought fathom infinity? We have sought far and wide among the best minds to <b>furnish</b> <b>articles</b> that provide an overview of the above topics. We hope that, through this journey, a symphony of patterns and tapestry of intuitions will emerge, providing the reader with insights into the questions: What is Space? What is Time?

The conditions employed involve the Hamming distance on the phase space { 0, 1 }nas well as the spectral condition on the Jacobian Boolean matrix of F: { 0, 1 }n→{ 0, 1 }n evaluated at each point of { 0, 1 }n.

The right-hand {{side of the}} differential equation is allowed to be unrestricted {{in the growth of}} its variables and may depend on the derivative of the solution, which incurs additional difficultly in the mathematical proofs. A new approach is introduced by using a singular differential inequality that ensures that all possible solutions satisfy certain a priori bounds, including their "derivatives", to the singular BVP under consideration. Topological methods, in particular Schauder's fixed point theorem are then applied to generate new existence results for solutions to the singular boundary value problems. Many of the results are novel for both the singular and the nonsingular cases...|$|R

The examples are discussed against the backdrop of an innovative theory which involves an opposition of an internal and an external circle of referents.
