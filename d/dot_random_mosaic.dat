The déviations are even more striking, particularly at large packing fraction where neither Aboav's nor Lewis' law hold; moreover, some distributions, such as thé distribution of thé number of sides of thé cells, or distribution of thé cell area, are split into two parts, each of them related to one species of dises.

Thresholds improved with increasing stimulus size and number of <b>random</b> <b>dots</b> at all eccentricities.

40|$|We have {{measured}} directly {{the forces}} across water between hydrophilic surfaces {{covered with a}} <b>random</b> <b>mosaic</b> {{of positive and negative}} charged domains. We find a strong, long-ranged attraction between them at a surface separation comparable with the charge domain size (many tens of nanometers). This attraction persists at higher salt concentration, but its range then becomes comparable to the Debye screening length. We attribute the attraction to correlation between negative and positive regions on opposing surfaces, facilitated by the lateral mobility of the charge patches on the surfaces...|$|R

We extend planar fiducial markers using <b>random</b> <b>dots</b> [8] to nonrigidly deformable markers. Because the recognition and tracking of <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> markers are based on keypoint matching, we can estimate the deformation of the markers with nonrigid surface detection from keypoint correspondences.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} results on various aspects of sets with positive reach, which are up to now not available in such a compact form. After recalling briefly the results before 1959, sets with positive reach and their associated curvature measures are introduced. We develop an integral and current representation of these curvature measures and show how the current representation helps to prove integralgeometric formulas, such as the principal kinematic formula. Also random sets with positive reach and <b>random</b> <b>mosaics</b> (or the more general random cell-complexes) with general cell shape are considered...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPhysically {{unidirectional}} {{motion of}} short-lived <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> arrays {{was found to}} perceptually decompose into two motion components (velocity decomposition) in a configuration in which two squares appear to partially overlap transparently (surface decomposition). In the experiments in which the velocity of the short-lived <b>random</b> <b>dots</b> in the overlapping area was varied, both the velocity decomposition and the surface decomposition {{were found to be}} strongest when the velocity of the overlapping area was close to the vector sum of the velocities of <b>random</b> <b>dots</b> in adjacent non-overlapping areas. On the other hand, neither velocity decomposition nor surface decomposition was found either when <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> arrays were put in occlusion configurations or when continuous <b>random</b> <b>dots</b> were used. While previous studies have indicated a one-way influence either from motion to form processing, or from form to motion processing, the present study further suggests that there is a strong reciprocal interaction between motion and form processing. A possibility is that the reciprocal interaction is iterative so that the representations for velocity and surface decomposition are gradually formed...|$|R

Our model arises from considerations on tropical plane curves, which are zeros of random tropical polynomials in two variables. In particular, the iterated Gilbert model convergence allows one to derive a scaling limit for Poisson tropical plane curves.

40|$|AbstractA {{stereoscopic}} {{rotational movement}} aftereffect (MAE) and a stereoscopic bi-directional MAE were generated by rotation of a cyclopean <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> cylinder in depth and by movement of two cyclopean <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> planes in opposite directions, respectively. Cross-adaptational MAEs were also generated on each other, {{but not with}} stimuli lacking any disparity. Cross-adaptation MAEs were generated between stereoscopic and non-stereoscopic <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> stimuli moving in the one X/Y plane.

It used a screen with a precise checkerboard of red, green, and blue elements as opposed to the <b>random</b> <b>mosaic</b> pattern used in the Autochrome system.

Whereas the chemical individuality of solid substances is represented in discrete terms of crystal lattices, the conventional description of solid state reaction dynamics is essentially continual. The recent progress in the theory of <b>random</b> <b>mosaics</b> and theory of planigons opens the way for developing an alternative discrete description in terms of Dirichlet tessellations.

40|$|We {{establish}} {{a close relationship}} between isoperimetric inequalities for convex bodies and asymptotic shapes of large random polytopes, which arise as cells in certain <b>random</b> <b>mosaics</b> in d-dimensional Euclidean space. These mosaics are generated by Poisson hyperplane processes satisfying a few natural assumptions (not necessarily stationarity or isotropy). The size of large cells is measured by a class of general functionals. The main result implies that the asymptotic shapes of large cells are completely determined by the extremal bodies of an inequality of isoperimetric type, which connects the size functional and the expected number of hyperplanes of the generating process hitting a given convex body. We obtain exponential estimates for the conditional probability of large deviations of zero cells from asymptotic or limit shapes, {{under the condition that}} the cells have large size...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{experiments}} three different motion discrimination tasks were studied using a <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> pattern as stimulus: velocity discrimination, direction discrimination and discrimination of opposite directions. The {{analysis of the}} motion of <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> patterns is based on motion sensitive mechanisms without the confounding interference of position sensitive mechanisms (Nakayama and Tyler, I 98 1). Furthermore, since isotropic <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> patterns contain no dominant orientation, {{a change in the}} direction of motion does not parallel a change in orientation. Hence the use of a <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> pattern as stimulus allows velocity and direction discrimination to be compared. Human velocity discrimination displays a U-shaped dependence on the stimulus velocity: the JNDs, expressed as Weber-fractions. are minimal for velocities ranging from 4 to 64 deg set-‘. The Weber-fractions in velocity, determined with a staircase procedure tracking a 84 % correct response level, were about 7 % at the optimal speeds. The velocity discrimination curve obtained with the <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> pattern is similar to that obtained with light bars. Human direction discrimination, defined as the smallest difference in direction which can be resolved, also displays a U-shaped dependence on the stimulus velocity. Direction discrimination thresholds decrease up to a velocity of 4 deg’secc’, they then stay at a constant level up to 128 deg,sec-‘. Beyond this velocity the thresholds increase again. The mean direction discrimination threshold was 1. 8 deg a...|$|R

40|$|AbstractComputationally, {{audio-visual}} temporal synchrony detection {{is analogous}} to visual motion detection {{in the sense that}} both solve the correspondence problem. We examined whether audio-visual synchrony detection is mediated by a mechanism similar to low-level motion sensors, by one similar to a higher-level feature matching process, or by both types of mechanisms {{as in the case of}} visual motion detection. We found that audio-visual synchrony–asynchrony discrimination for temporally dense random pulse trains was difficult, whereas motion detection is known to be easy for spatially dense <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> patterns (<b>random</b> <b>dot</b> kinematograms) due to the operation of low-level motion sensors. Subsequent experiments further indicated that the temporal limiting factor of audio-visual synchrony discrimination is the temporal density of salient features not the temporal frequency of the stimulus, nor the physical density of the stimulus. These results suggest that audio-visual synchrony perception is based solely on a salient feature matching mechanism similar to that proposed for high-level visual motion detection...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} extract retinal {{disparity}} from a visual scene, the brain must match corresponding {{points in the}} left and right retinae. This computationally demanding task is known as the stereo correspondence problem. The initial stage of the solution to the correspondence problem is generally thought to consist of a correlation-based computation. However, recent work by Doi et al suggests that human observers can see depth in a class of stimuli where the mean binocular correlation is 0 (half-matched <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> stereograms). Half-matched <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> stereograms are made up of an equal number of correlated and anticorrelated dots, and the binocular energy model-a well-known model of V 1 binocular complex cells-fails to signal disparity here. This has led to the proposition that a second, match-based computation must be extracting disparity in these stimuli. Here we show that a straightforward modification to the binocular energy model-adding a point output nonlinearity-is by itself sufficient to produce cells that are disparity-tuned to half-matched <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> stereograms. We then show that a simple decision model using this single mechanism can reproduce psychometric functions generated by human observers, including reduced performance to large disparities and rapidly updating dot patterns. The model makes predictions about how performance should change with dot size in half-matched stereograms and temporal alternation in correlation, which we test in human observers. We conclude that a single correlation-based computation, based directly on already-known properties of V 1 neurons, can account for the literature on mixed correlation <b>random</b> <b>dot</b> stereograms...|$|R
