[...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kidding</b> me!" [...] Davis said. [...] "What could this little fella possibly know about football?" [...] Noting that it's a rare day when all three Oakland teams are represented in one room, Davis said, [...] "To think it was Bill King who brought us together. Bill King never played for the Oakland Raiders, nor did he play for the Los Angeles Raiders. Nor did he wear the famed colors of silver and black.

[...] Davis added that King gets a cloak of immortality, because time never stops for the great ones.

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1969-70 season saw a brief surge in audience numbers with CBS's two-part world TV premiere of The Guns of Navarone (1961), based on the Alistair Maclean best-seller. Then 14 days later, the comedy Doctor, You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Kidding</b> (1966) qualified as the sixth most-watched program of the Nielsen's rating period, while the Glenn Ford thriller Fate is the Hunter (1964) scored at #16 during the same week. [...] And in the season's fifth week, the Gothic thriller Two on a Guillotine and another Glenn Ford picture, The Last Challenge, both {{wound up in the}} Top 20. But another trend became evident in CBS's film-anthologies as viewers began to notice a sharp increase of repeat broadcasts. As a result, there was a corresponding decrease in new films available for showing, and there was a good reason for this. Production of new theatrical films had slackened to a near-standstill in Hollywood and as a result, some studios, among them 20th Century Fox and Paramount, <b>were</b> [...] "waiting <b>to</b> unload their expensive backlog of films" [...] to the networks. Indeed, CBS had completed a deal with Fox a year earlier for exclusive rights to televise some of its most recent films (Rio Conchos and Guns at Batasi, to name some), but the network had <b>been</b> allowing those <b>to</b> merely trickle through to viewers at a rate of 5 or 6 per season. This was becoming CBS's programming strategy with product leased from other studios as well. Consequently, the films listed below for the new season, 1969-70, included a greater number of reruns than in previous years.|$|R

40|$|I {{remember}} {{telling my}} wife, the mathematician, that historians typically work on {{one time and}} place their entire careers. If you begin, say, as a historian of Russia in the 1600 s (as I did), you <b>are</b> likely <b>to</b> end as a historian of Russia in the 1600 s (I didn 2 ̆ 7 t, but that 2 ̆ 7 s another story). 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kidding,</b> 2 ̆ 2 she said. 2 ̆ 2 Don 2 ̆ 7 t historians get bored with their little time and place? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Yes, 2 ̆ 2 I replied. 2 ̆ 2 Don 2 ̆ 7 t they exhaust the topic and begin to work in circles? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Yes, quite often 2 ̆ 2 I replied. 2 ̆ 2 Don 2 ̆ 7 t they want to compare what they 2 ̆ 7 ve learned about time/place X with time/place Y {{in order to better}} understand both X and Y? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Probably, 2 ̆ 2 I replied. 2 ̆ 2 Then why, 2 ̆ 2 she asked, 2 ̆ 2 do historians continue to work the way they do? 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s a good question, and one that deserves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> answered. On the one hand, 2 ̆ 7 more and more about less and less 2 ̆ 7 has certainly enabled us—that is, the historical profession—to uncover a lot of the past that might have been forgotten. But, on the other hand, we 2 ̆ 7 ve gone so far 2 ̆ 7 inside baseball 2 ̆ 7 that we can 2 ̆ 7 t and don 2 ̆ 7 t talk to one another, let alone talk to colleagues in other disciplines or the public at large. There are exceptions, but they only improve the rule. In their very readable new book Natural Experiments of History (Harvard, 2010), Jared Diamond and James A. Robinson point out that this way of going about history is a lost opportunity. If historians would pull up for a moment and look around, they would discover a world of 2 ̆ 2 natural experiments 2 ̆ 2 that could both shed light on their particular time/place and speak to larger patterns in world history. More specifically, 2 ̆ 2 natural experiments 2 ̆ 2 —what historians usually call the 2 ̆ 2 comparative method 2 ̆ 2 —would permit them to speak about the general causes of the specific events they study. To my mind, that is a laudable goal and one that we should pursue. Knowledge, as we know, is difference. If all you know is Russia in the 1600 s, then you won 2 ̆ 7 t really know Russia in the 1600 s. We should do what we tell our undergraduates to do: compare and contrast...|$|R
