5|$|The {{northern}} half of Africa {{is occupied}} by the world's most extensive hot, <b>dry</b> <b>region,</b> the Sahara Desert. Some deserts are also occupying much of southern Africa : the Namib and the Kalahari. Across Asia, a large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia west-southwest through western Pakistan (Balochistan) and Iran into the Arabian Desert in Saudi Arabia. Most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, making it the world's driest inhabited continent. In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The drier areas of the United States are regions where the Sonoran Desert overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|Today, the sediments of the Honda Group {{are exposed}} in the Middle (Valle Medio del Magdalena, VMM) and Upper Magdalena Basin (Valle Superior del Magdalena, VSM) in an intermontane valley between the Central Ranges {{in the west}} and the Eastern Ranges in the east. The valley in between the two major orogenic chains is filled by the Magdalena River, the longest river of Colombia. The Upper Magdalena Valley geologically is {{subdivided}} into the Neiva Sub-basin with the Girardot Sub-basin of the southernmost Middle Magdalena Valley to the north, divided by the Natagaima Arch. The Neiva Sub-basin is bound by the Chusma Fault {{in the west and}} to the east by the west-verging Garzon Fault. The Tatacoa Desert, where the type section of the Honda Group has been redefined is an unusually <b>dry</b> <b>region</b> in Colombia, caused by a mountain induced rain-shadow effect. In Middle Miocene times, the geography was more comparable to the present eastern foothills of the Andes.|$|E
500|$|The Bureau of Reclamation's Columbia Basin Project {{focused on}} the {{generally}} <b>dry</b> <b>region</b> of central Washington known as the Columbia Basin, which features rich loess soil. Several groups developed competing proposals, and in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee Dam was the project's central component; upon completion, it pumped water up from the Columbia to fill the formerly dry Grand Coulee, forming Banks Lake. By 1935, the intended height of the dam was increased from a range between [...] to , a height that would extend the lake impounded by the dam {{all the way to}} the Canada–US border; the project had grown from a local New Deal relief measure to a major national project.|$|E

Without long-term sustainable management strategies, large areas may lose their economic and floristic value. Our {{results show that}} climate change will increase the prominence of plant species more commonly found in <b>drier</b> <b>regions</b> of the Middle East. <b>Drier</b> <b>regions,</b> and species from <b>drier</b> <b>regions,</b> are affected more by heavy grazing, and would therefore be affected dramatically by a drying environment under current grazing rates.

2500|$|After his {{political}} defeat, he remained active in West Toronto where {{he founded the}} Inter-Church Temperance League. When the community joined the city of Toronto in 1909, it did so on condition of remaining a [...] "dry" [...] district where alcohol sales were prohibited, {{as they had been}} since 1904. Temple and his Temperance League fought for half a century to maintain that regulation despite attempts by the city to reverse it. Over the years, several plebiscites were held on allowing alcohol sales, and Temple and his supporters successfully fought against permitting alcohol sales in referendums held in 1966, 1972, 1984. He died several months before a 1988 plebiscite, but had already begun the campaign, and his supporters credited him with their victory. It was not until after Temple's death that neighbourhoods in the area finally voted to allow alcohol sales beginning in 1994 in the St. Clair West area, and ending in The Junction in 2000, when the last <b>dry</b> <b>region</b> in west Toronto became wet.|$|E
60|$|We {{discussed}} the matter fully {{for two or}} three days before we made up our minds. Lady Meadowcroft was undecided between her hatred of dulness and her haunting fear that scorpions and snakes would intrude upon our tents and beds while we were camping. In the end, however, the desire for change carried the day. She decided to dodge the rainy season by getting behind the Himalayan-passes, in the <b>dry</b> <b>region</b> to the north of the great range, where rain seldom falls, the country being watered only by the melting of the snows on the high summits.|$|E
6000|$|On the 2nd of February we {{proceeded}} to Tofe-Choney, the hills increasing in height to nearly 1000 feet, {{and the country}} becoming more picturesque. We passed some tanks covered with Villarsia, and frequented by flocks of white egrets. The existence of artificial tanks so near a lofty mountain, from whose sides innumerable water-courses descend, indicates the great natural dryness of the country during one season of the year. The hills and vallies were richer than I expected, though far from luxuriant. A fine Nauclea is a common shady tree, and Bignonia indica, now leafless, but with immense pods hanging from the branches. Acanthaceae is the prevalent natural order, consisting of gay-flowered Eranthemums, Ruellias, Barlerias, and such hothouse favourites.* [Other plants gathered here, and very typical of the Flora of this <b>dry</b> <b>region,</b> were Linum trigynum, Feronia elephantum, Aegle marmelos, Helicteres Asoca, Abrus precatorius, Flemingia; various Desmodia, Rhynchosiae, Glycine, and Grislea tomentosa very abundant, Conocarpus latifoliusa, Loranthus longiflorus, and another species; Phyllanthus Emblica, various Convolvuli, Cuscuta, and several herbaceous Compositae.] ...|$|E

60|$|Our {{last day}} in the crater, Ukiukiu gave us a taste of his strength. He smashed Naulu back all along the line, filled the House of the Sun to {{overflowing}} with clouds, and drowned us out. Our rain-gauge was a pint cup under a tiny hole in the tent. That last night of storm and rain filled the cup, {{and there was no}} way of measuring the water that spilled over into the blankets. With the rain-gauge out of business there was no longer any reason for remaining; so we broke camp in the wet-gray of dawn, and plunged eastward across the lava to the Kaupo Gap. East Maui is nothing more or less than the vast lava stream that flowed long ago through the Kaupo Gap; and down this stream we picked our way from an altitude of six thousand five hundred feet to the sea. This was a day's work in itself for the horses; but never were there such horses. Safe in the bad places, never rushing, never losing their heads, as soon as they found a trail wide and smooth enough to run on, they ran. There was no stopping them until the trail became bad again, and then they stopped of themselves. Continuously, for days, they had performed the hardest kind of work, and fed most of the time on grass foraged by themselves at night while we slept, and yet that day they covered twenty-eight leg-breaking miles and galloped into Hana like a bunch of colts. Also, there were several of them, reared in the <b>dry</b> <b>region</b> on the leeward side of Haleakala, that had never worn shoes in all their lives. Day after day, and all day long, unshod, they had travelled over the sharp lava, with the extra weight of a man on their backs, and their hoofs were in better condition than those of the shod horses.|$|E
