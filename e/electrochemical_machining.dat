50|$|The {{processes}} that affect surface integrity can be conveniently broken up into three classes: traditional processes, non-traditional processes, and finishing treatments. Traditional processes {{are defined as}} processes where the tool contacts the workpiece surface; for example: grinding, turning, and machining. These processes will only damage the surface integrity if the improper parameters are used, such as dull tools, too high feed speeds, improper coolant or lubrication, or incorrect grinding wheel hardness. Nontraditional processes are defined as processes where the tool does not contact the workpiece; examples {{of this type of}} process include EDM, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining,</b> and chemical milling. These processes will produce different surface integrity depending on how the processes are controlled; for instance, they can leave a stress-free surface, a remelted surface, or excessive surface roughness. Finishing treatments are defined as {{processes that}} negate surface finishes imparted by traditional and non-traditional processes or improve the surface integrity.

5000|$|The {{electrochemical}} grinding process combines traditional <b>electrochemical</b> <b>machining</b> and grinding processes to remove material from a workpiece. A grinding wheel {{is used as}} a cutting tool as a cathode and the workpiece is an anode. During the process, electrolytic fluid, typically sodium nitrate, is pumped into the space between the workpiece and the grinding wheel. Other electrolytes used include sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium chlorate. This electrolytic fluid will cause electrochemical reactions to occur at the workpiece surface which oxidize the surface, thereby removing material. As a consequence of the oxidation which occurs, layers of oxide films will form on the workpiece surface, and these need to be removed by the grinding wheel. A couple schematics of the process are provided below.Abrasive materials, either diamond or aluminum oxide, are bonded to the grinding wheel which allows the wheel to remove the oxide layers on the workpiece surface by abrasive action. Appropriate materials used for electrolyte fluid and the grinding wheel abrasives are summarized in the table below.Most material removal is by the electrochemical reactions which occur at the workpiece surface. Five percent or less of the material removal is carried out by the abrasive action of the grinding wheel. The fact that most material is not removed by abrasive action helps increase the life of the grinding wheel, that is, the tool {{will take a long time}} to wear down. The electrolytic fluid serves another useful purpose - it flushes out leftover material in between the grinding wheel and work piece.
