40|$|Based on {{the data}} given in the EU ExternE project, this report {{describes}} the health risks associated with electricity production, {{expressed in terms of}} number of deaths per TWh. The results are presented partly {{in the form of a}} summary diagram, showing the health risks associated with the use of various forms of power generation in different EU countries, and partly in the form of a number of examples, linked to Sweden and the Swedish energy debate. Some interesting conclusions are: • Coal, lignite and oil produce more extensive health risks than do other forms of energy • Hydro power and nuclear power produce health risks that are two orders of magnitude less than those resulting from coal and oil • Energy savings resulting from <b>draughtproofing</b> of Swedish buildings result in a greater number of deaths • The closure of Barsebäck will result in a greater number of deaths, most of which will occur in Denmark. The main objective of this report is systematically and clearly to present differences in healt...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Nottingham energy, health and housing study, a project where seven Nottingham City Council households subject to either fuel poverty or heat poverty have been refurbished {{to improve the}} internal environmental conditions and therefore {{the health of the}} occupants. The main aim was to provide improvements in ventilation, insulation, <b>draughtproofing</b> and heating control in the dwellings. An intervention study was carried out in the seven dwellings where temperature, relative humidity, health, dust mite numbers and ventilation were measured before the introduction of a range of heating, ventilation and insulation improvements. These were then monitored again a year later. The results of the study indicate that with a limited budget, significant improvements have been realised in the comfort levels of the occupants and in their health. Modelling of the environmental conditions and energy consumption in each dwelling has been carried out using the steady-state Condensation Targeter II model. Comparisons between the model predictions and the measured data show that Condensation Targeter II can be used as an effective tool for selecting the most appropriate design modifications for an individual dwelling and can assess the impact that these modifications will have on the energy efficiency of the dwelling and the health of the occupants...|$|E
