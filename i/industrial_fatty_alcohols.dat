40|$|Pomace {{olive oil}} is a {{by-product}} of olive oil extraction that is traditionally produced and consumed in Spain. The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols,</b> which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of pomace olive oil, and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> were tetracosanol, hexacosanol and octacosanol. We investigated the ability of long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> from pomace olive oil to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols,</b> reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml. These results showed that long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> may have a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development, suggesting its potential value as a putative functional component of pomace olive oil.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method for the {{isolation}} of fatty acid methyl esters and <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> from the lipid fraction of marine zooplankton is described.

Current procedures for the separation and purification of lipid classes by preparative thin-layer chromatography are time-consuming and are subject to low recovery of the analytes.

50|$|Most <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> {{in nature}} are found as waxes which are esters with fatty acids and <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols.</b> They are {{produced}} by bacteria, plants and animals for purposes of buoyancy, as source of metabolic water and energy, biosonar lenses (marine mammals) and for thermal insulation {{in the form of}} waxes (in plants and insects). <b>Fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> were unavailable until the early 1900s. They were originally obtained by reduction of wax esters with sodium by the Bouveault-Blanc reduction process. In the 1930s catalytic hydrogenation was commercialized, which allowed the conversion of fatty acid esters, typically tallow, to the alcohols. In the 1940s and 1950s, petrochemicals became an important source of chemicals, and Karl Ziegler had discovered the polymerization of ethylene.

50|$|Very {{long-chain}} <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> (VLCFA), {{obtained from}} plant waxes and beeswax {{have been reported}} to lower plasma cholesterol in humans. They can be found in unrefined cereal grains, beeswax, and many plant-derived foods. Reports suggest that 5-20 mg per day of mixed C24-C34 alcohols, including octacosanol and triacontanol, lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 21%-29% and raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8%-15%.

40|$|Excessive {{consumption}} of saturated and {{trans fatty acids}} is positively correlated with {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and Type II diabetes. The search for new materials able to replace and/or reduce saturated/hydrogenated fats using structural design principles is a timely topic. A novel strategy consists on gelation of oil using small molecules (organogelators) that are able to self-assemble in liquid oils. The resulting material, an organogel or oleogel, has similar physical properties to those of fats. Different molecules have been proposed as organogelators such as monoglycerides, <b>fatty</b> acids, <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols,</b> 12 -hydroxystearic acid, waxes, phytosterols, etc. However, among them, <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> have received little attention in literature. The aim of this research was to study the ability of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> with different even carbon chain length (1 -tetradecanol, 1 -hexadecanol, 1 -octadecanol, 1 -eicosanol, and 1 -docosanol) to gel peanut oil under different cooling rates. To this aim, minimum gelling concentrations, oil release, solid fat content, back extrusion firmness, microstructure by polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and ultra-small X-ray scattering analysis were carried out. Results highlighted that organogels were composed of monotectic phases where <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> crystals aggregated forming a network that entrapped the oil. The gelling ability of <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohols</b> increased increasing the chain length and decreasing the cooling rate.

40|$|Sjögren-Larsson {{syndrome}} (SLS) is {{an inherited}} disorder associated with impaired <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohol</b> oxidation due to deficient activity of fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase (FAO). FAO {{is a complex}} enzyme which consists of two separate proteins that sequentially catalyze the oxidation of <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohol</b> to <b>fatty</b> aldehyde and fatty acid. To determine which enzymatic component of FAO was deficient in SLS, we assayed fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH) and <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohol</b> dehydrogenase in cultured fibroblasts from seven unrelated SLS patients. All SLS cells were selectively deficient in the FALDH component of FAO, and had normal activity of <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohol</b> dehydrogenase. The extent of FALDH deficiency in SLS cells depended on the aliphatic aldehyde used as substrate, ranging from 62 % of mean normal activity using propionaldehyde as substrate to 8 % of mean normal activity with octadecanal. FALDH activity in obligate SLS heterozygotes was partially decreased to 49 +/- 7 % of mean normal activity using octadecanal as substrate. Differential centrifugation studies in fibroblasts indicated that this FALDH enzyme was largely particulate; soluble FALDH activity was normal in SLS cells. Intact SLS fibroblasts oxidized octadecanol to fatty acid at less than 10 % of the normal rate, but oxidized free octadecanal normally, suggesting that the FALDH affected in SLS is chiefly involved in the oxidation of <b>fatty</b> <b>alcohol</b> to <b>fatty</b> acid.
