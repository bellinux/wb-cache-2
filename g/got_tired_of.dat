5|$|The discography of John Frusciante, who is {{best known}} as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{consists}} of eleven solo albums and four EPs, as well as two albums with collaborators Joe Lally and Josh Klinghoffer under the name Ataxia and one EP and one album under the alias of Trickfinger. After recording Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992 when he <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the growing success of the band. He released his first solo album, Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt, in 1994 on American Recordings. His second record, Smile From the Streets You Hold, was released in 1997 and later taken off the market at his request in 1999. After returning to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1998, Frusciante recorded Californication with the band and subsequently released his third solo album, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, in February 2001 on Warner Music Group.|$|E
5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built sluice gates for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the sluice gates along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the sluice gates, it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and sluice gates {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E
25|$|In 1794 {{the ideas}} of the French Revolution reached Rende. The harassment, taxes and the inequities {{increased}} the hate towards the Bourbon domain. Spokesman of this grumpiness was Domenico Vanni who received Joachim Murat, Marshal of Napoleon, when they passed by Cosenza. In 1817 the castle was sold to the Magdalone family, owner of many lands in the Marquisate. During the Resurgence, also Rendesis <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> the French and Borbonics and many of them became Carbonari participating in the insurrections of 1820-21 and 1831.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Paul {{went into}} semi-retirement, {{although}} he did return to the studio occasionally. He and Ford had divorced {{at the end of}} 1964 after she <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> touring. Paul's most recognizable recordings from then through the mid-1970s were an album for London Records/Phase 4 Stereo, Les Paul Now (1968), on which he updated some of his earlier hits; and two albums comprising a meld of jazz and country improvisation with guitar virtuoso Chet Atkins, backed by some of Nashville's celebrated studio musicians, Chester and Lester (1976) and Guitar Monsters (1978), for RCA Victor.|$|E
25|$|Lithuania's {{first and}} most popular movie musical 'Velnio nuotaka' ('The Devil's Bride'), written by Viačeslavas Ganelinas, was {{released}} in 1975. Its catchy melodies combine traditional folk motifs with a rock-and-roll rhythm. Spirited and emotional, The Devil's Bride tells the supernatural story of an impish devil {{who used to be}} an angel but <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> singing Hosannah, and was thus condemned to live on Earth. From his home in a windmill, he pursued love and happiness in a hilarious and sometimes tragic tale of turmoil that affects the whole countryside.|$|E

Both decided to leave the band, and began to pursue a career together, marking the beginning of Savage Garden.|$|E

25|$|At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob {{goes into}} the freezer to get Krabby Patties, only to {{discover}} that none are left. He and Mr. Krabs try to make more, but Plankton comes out of the vault with the formula.

500|$|Mills portrayed Abby from 1980–1989. Prior {{to being}} cast in Knots Landing, Mills was {{primarily}} known {{for playing the}} [...] "damsel in distress" [...] archetype in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting. In an interview with Jerry Buck for the Toledo Blade, Mills said: [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> playing the victim. It's a more active role. Abby keeps things stirred up, and I like that." [...] According to Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female J.R. Ewing-esque character. However, he had a different sense of the character and who would {{wind up in the}} role. With Mills' reputation of playing the victim, he initially didn't choose her for the part.|$|E

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money.

Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't worth it to me.

500|$|Despite being a prequel, {{the second}} game {{introduces}} upgraded versions of the original characters called Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and Mangle, along with old, ripped, and worn out versions of the original animatronics.

He also mentions that the employees nicknamed it [...] "the Mangle". [...] Two new characters are also introduced: BB (known as Balloon Boy), who has no jumpscare and can only disable the players' lights, and The Puppet (also known as The Marionette), who must be quelled by constantly winding up a music box.The only true animatronic in the third game is Springtrap, who looks like a decayed golden version of Bonnie. Additionally, Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and The Puppet return as hallucinations (or [...] "phantoms"), and although their jumpscares don't kill the player, they can disable certain features that are essential for the player to complete the night easily.|$|E
