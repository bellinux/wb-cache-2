50|$|Once {{aware of}} his own status as a target, GDR {{opponent}} Wolfgang Templin tried, with some success, to bring details of the Stasi's Zersetzung activities {{to the attention of}} western journalists. In 1977 Der Spiegel published a five-part article series, “Du sollst zerbrechen!” ("You're going to crack!"), by the exiled Jürgen Fuchs, in which he describes the Stasi's “operational psychology”. The Stasi tried to discredit Fuchs and the contents of similar articles, publishing in turn claims that he had a paranoid view of its function, and intending that Der Spiegel and other media would assume he was suffering from a persecution complex. This, however, was refuted by the official Stasi <b>documents</b> <b>examined</b> after Die Wende (the political power shift in the GDR in 1989-90).|$|E
50|$|Modern Polish historians — such as Janusz Tazbir — have, however, {{questioned}} whether the Doruchów witch trial really took place in 1775, whether it happened as described, and whether it had the claimed effect on the law. Tazbir {{points out that the}} most detailed account of this event was given by early-19th-century writer Konstanty Majeranowski, who has been found by later historians to have authored several historical hoaxes. Tazbir notes that the existing primary sources can prove that only six - not fourteen - women, were sentenced to death, and it is not even clear whether they were actually executed. Further, the <b>documents</b> <b>examined</b> by Tazbir indicate that the trial took place not in 1775, but later, in 1783 or shortly before — in any case, after 1776, because it has been recorded that the judges who conducted this trial were punished for pronouncing the sentence, in defiance of the law abolishing witch trials, which had been issued in that year. Therefore, the trial could not have influenced in any way the 1776 Sejm legislation that led to the ban on torture and witch trials, because it occurred when that law was already in force. There is no trace of such a trial in the rich collection of documents of the Polish Sejm or in the contemporary press in 1776.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores five {{documents}} {{written by}} Tagore between 1906 and 1940. Tagore was writing {{at a time}} when India was struggling for independence. Among his numerous concerns, he wanted an India which could be compassionate and humane. He realized that such a lofty goal could only be achieved through an education system which not only encouraged these qualities but allowed students to cultivate them by understanding the world around them. Central to the arguments in this thesis is Tagore's discussion of the tapobon, the Indian meditative forest. The tapobon is seen as metaphorical place for contemplation in deciphering the world and developing an understanding of one's place in it. The <b>documents</b> <b>examined</b> here reflect the breadth and depth of Tagore's thoughts on education though they are only a sampling of the extensive work he did in his lifetime...|$|E
