40|$|Axis {{formation}} in Xenopus laevis requires {{generation of the}} three primary germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, as well as establishment of Spemann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizer.</b> Spemann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizer</b> patterns the primary germ layers to establish the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. To better understand vertebrate axis formation, I have characterized molecular events that generate the primary germ layers and Spemann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizer.</b> I have characterized {{the role of the}} maternal transcription factor VegT and the TGFβ family member Nodal in the regulation of early endodermal and mesodermal gene expression. Also, I have demonstrated the ability of the endoderm-specific transcription factor Sox 17 α to prevent the expression of mesodermal genes in response to Nodal signals. My results suggest that direct regulation of Sox 17 α by VegT establishes the endoderm, distinct from the mesoderm, by preventing the expression of mesodermal genes in response to Nodal signals. Finally, I have characterized the cooperation between vegetal TGFβ signals, known to regulate endoderm and mesoderm formation and Siamois, a Wnt target gene, in generation of the organizer. These data support a model in which the organizer forms in the region of overlap between maternal Wnt signals, localized to the dorsal side of the embryo, and TGFβ signals present in the vegetal hemisphere. While the distinct responses of the three germ layers to the influence of Spemann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizer</b> are critical for proper axis formation, my results indicate that establishment of Spemann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizer</b> is dependent on the signals that generate the endoderm and mesoderm. ...|$|R

However, imported cases continue to cause illness and outbreaks among susceptible U. S. residents (2 – 5). In August 2007, a participant in an international youth sporting event who traveled from Japan to the United States became ill with measles.

However, workload analysis on a Hadoop cluster, especially in a large-scale e-commerce production environment, has not been well studied yet. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive workload analysis using the trace collected from a 2, 000 -node Hadoop cluster at Taobao, which is the biggest online e-commerce enterprise in Asia, ranked 10 th in the world as reported by Alexa. The results of the workload analysis are representative and generally consistent with the data warehouses for e-commerce web sites, which can help researchers and engineers understand the workload characteristics of Hadoop in their production environments. Based on the observations and implications derived from the trace, we designed a workload generator Ankus, to expedite the performance evaluation and debugging of new mechanisms. Ankus supports synthesizing an e-commerce style MapReduce workload at a low cost. Furthermore, we proposed and implemented a job scheduling algorithm <b>Fair</b> 4 <b>S,</b> which is designed to be biased towards small jobs. Small jobs account {{for the majority of the}} workload and most of them require instant and interactive responses, which is an important phenomenon at production Hadoop systems.

40|$|From May to November of 1926, Philadelphia {{held the}} Sesquicentennial International Exposition, a world 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fair</b> celebrating the 150 th {{anniversary of the}} signing of the Declaration of Independence. While the fair 2 ̆ 7 s {{promoters}} advertised the Sesquicentennial as a commemoration of the past and while much of the fair was built in the Colonial-Revival style, the fair offered a forum in which Philadelphians confronted some of the most pressing issues of the early twentieth century: urbanization, consumerism, the changing role of women, immigration, racism, racial diversity and mass culture. Even though the fair 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizers</b> touted peace, the event proved to be battleground, an arena in which numerous interests fought to control the depiction of the past in order to control the shape of the future. Portrayals of history at the Sesquicentennial became a metaphor, a means for numerous groups to grapple with the upheavals affecting modern America. This dissertation examines the ways in which groups including politicians, middle-class white women, corporations, civic and fraternal organizations, immigrants, and African Americans, deployed particular visions of the past at the Sesquicentennial in order to shape the future and their place in it. Even as the fair 2 ̆ 7 s planners debated the nature and location of Philadelphia 2 ̆ 7 s historic celebration, they argued not so much about the past, as they did about the shape of the city 2 ̆ 7 s urban development in the twentieth century. Corporations and white women used Colonial Revival representations to accommodate fairgoers to two threatening twentieth-century changes: the burgeoning consumer culture and the changing role of women. Amidst the growing racial and ethnic diversity of 1920 s Philadelphia, white native-born Protestants used historical representations at the fair as a means to reassert their contested cultural and social dominance. Immigrants and second- and third-generation Americans portrayed their ancestors 2 ̆ 7 roles in American history at the Sesquicentennial to secure better citizenship and treatment in 1920 s Philadelphia. Finally, by demonstrating through speeches, pageants, and exhibits their invaluable contributions to American history, African Americans made a strong case for greater social, economic, and political equality. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} the Colloquium, {{as can be seen}} from the great attention given to the papers presented by the second panel, was to discuss the uses of customary international human rights law in the defense of human rights before national courts. More generally, these discussions focused on the effectiveness of customary international human rights rules in influencing legislative and policy-making, administrative decisions and, particularly, judicial adjudication, at international and national levels. The initial and wider question of the feasibility of using custom as a source of human rights rules formed the underlying aspects of the debates in the Colloquium on the question of the sources for the international law of human rights. This included the issue of the relative importance of the actual practice of states and of opinio juris in the creation of a rule of customary international law.

Eichler et al. [17], while reviewing the treatment of ischemic contractures at Mayo Clinic, reported 13 patients who underwent muscle slide operations. Nine of the 13 patients showed excellent correction. In another study by Dianming et al. [28], seven cases of Volkmann’s ischemic contracture underwent muscle slide operations.

40|$|Goosecoid (Gsc), a {{homeodomain}} transcription factor, {{is expressed}} in the head organizer domain of Spermann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>organizer</b> at the gastrula stage and {{later on in the}} head mesoderm, a pattern consistent with a potential role in dorsoanterior development. The role of Gsc in early patterning has been examined by fusing defined transcriptional regulatory domains to the Gsc homeodomain. Like native Gsc, ventral injection of the engrailed repressor fusion (Eng-Gsc) induces a partial secondary axis, suggesting that Gsc functions as a transcriptional repressor in axis induction. Dorsal injection of VP 16 -Gsc leads to anterior truncations at the hindbrain level, while axial mesoderm is unaffected. The anterior defects resulting from VP 16 -Gsc are fully rescued by Gsc, indicating that VP 16 -Gsc is a specific inhibitor of Gsc and that endogenous Gsc function may be required for anterior development. The anterior truncation is also rescued by coinjection of Frzb- 1, a secreted inhibitor of Wnt function, suggesting that activation of ectopic Wnt expression by VP 16 -Gsc is responsible for the observed defects. Supporting this idea, Xwnt 8 expression is activated by VP 16 -Gsc in animal caps and in the dorsal marginal zone and repressed by Gsc in the ventral marginal zone and in activin-treated animal caps. Overexpression of Gsc throughout the marginal zone results in embryos with enlarged heads and shortened trunks, identical to the effects of Frzb- 1 and other Wnt inhibitors, suggesting that Gsc functions by inhibiting zygotic Wnt expression. Furthermore, a 4 kb fragment of the Xwnt 8 promoter region was isolated and was shown to be a direct target of Gsc repression. Gsc binds to the Xwnt 8 promoter through multiple consensus paired-type homeodomain protein binding site (P 3) and represses its transcription. ^ This work is significant in the: (1) demonstration of a requirement for Gsc function in organizer activity and anterior development; (2) identification of zygotic Xwnt 8 as a direct transcriptional target of Gsc; and (3) demonstration that repression of Xwnt 8 transcription by Gsc is important for anterior development. ...|$|R
