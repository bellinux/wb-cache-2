Several Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) calculations based on equivalent simplistic sources are conducted, enabling {{the estimation of}} the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> possibly induced by the QFF environment on the measured acoustic signatures during typical airframe noise experiments.

40|$|Transit-time {{ultrasonic}} flowmeters present {{advantages for}} district heating applications, {{since they are}} accurate, non-intrusive, and cheap.

40|$|Flow {{metering}} plays a {{major role}} in modern life. In the process industry, flow metering is critical in industries ranging from food processing to cosmetics. It is also essential in custody transfer or billing, as flow meters are present in gas pumps and district heating substations. In the district heating industry, the ultrasonic flow meter has become the desired meter in many of its applications because it has a low cost while being accurate. This accuracy is however sensitive to <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> and other sources of errors. This thesis stems from research that addresses the recognition of these <b>installation</b> <b>effects,</b> informs when they are unacceptable and considers reducing the measurement errors. To present these concepts, the thesis details the estimation of the mean flow velocity, the calibration of the meter and the measurement noise properties. Once installed, any kind of meter provides larger errors than in the facility where it has been calibrated and compensated. It is particularly true for ultrasonic flow meters as they are very sensitive to <b>installation</b> <b>effects.</b> <b>Installation</b> <b>effects</b> can either be static or dynamic. Special attention is paid to errors generated by temperature and velocity profile variations. Velocity profile variations can be due to pipe bends or flow pulsations. Such disturbances often induce a bias error and change the properties of the measurement noise. It is therefore with help of the change in noise that velocity profile disturbances can be detected. The detection of such abnormal behaviour of the measurement process constitutes a diagnosis. A diagnosis of the sensitivity of the meter to <b>installations</b> <b>effects</b> would allow for compensations for the errors. Signal analysis allows detection of specific noise properties, characteristic of <b>installation</b> <b>effects.</b> An example of self-diagnosis showing the detection of real pulsations in a flow is described in details. The detection of the flow pulsations and the estimation of their frequency allow to reduce the error of estimation on the flow rate. This technique is confirmed by the simulations of a pulsating flow. To empower one with the decision whether a flowmeter performance is normal or abnormal, a study of the relative error as a function of flow rate and temperature has been conducted.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{assessment of the}} working principles of pylon trailing-edge blowing for the mitigation {{of the interaction between}} a pusher propeller and its associated pylon. The experiments were performed at the Large Low-Speed Facility of the German–Dutch wind tunnels (DNW–LLF), using a powered propeller model and an upstream pylon equipped with a trailing-edge blowing system. In-flow microphone measurements demonstrated the impact of pylon installation on the propeller’s tonal noise emissions, with increases of up to 16 dB relative to the isolated propeller. Analysis of the unsteady blade pressures showed that this <b>installation</b> <b>effect</b> is caused by the impulsive increase in blade loading during the pylon-wake passage. The efficacy of pylon trailing-edge blowing to reduce the momentum deficit in the pylon wake was confirmed by stereoscopic particle-image-velocimetry measurements between the pylon and the propeller. Consequently, application of the pylon-blowing system alleviated the pylon-installation effects at the source. At an intermediate thrust setting, the root-mean-square of the blade-load fluctuations due to the wake encounter was reduced by up to 60 %, resulting in noise emissions approximately equal to those recorded for the isolated propeller.

Steel side blocks, one of the displacement restrainers, are set near both sides of isolating bearings. Here, a more rational seismic response of the isolated bridge in the transverse direction can {{be considered to be}} that the displacement of the superstructure during a small and moderate earthquake like Level 1 Earthquake defined in the JSHB (Specification of Highway Bridges) is restraint and the displacement during a strong earthquake like Level 2 Earthquake is released to mitigate damage of bridge pier and/or base structure and to enhance redundancy against a strong earthquake.

40|$|As {{extensive}} experimental {{campaign was}} performed to study the aeroacoustic <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> of an open rotor with respect to both a conventional tube and wing type airframe and an unconventional hybrid wing body airframe. The open rotor rig had two counter rotating rows of blades each with eight blades of a design originally flight tested in the 1980 s. The aeroacoustic <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> measured in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel included those from flow effects due to inflow distortion or wake interaction and acoustic propagation effects such as shielding and reflection. The objective of the test campaign was to quantify the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> {{for a wide range}} of parameters and configurations derived from the two airframe types. For the conventional airframe, the open rotor was positioned in increments in front of and then over the main wing and then in positions representative of tail mounted aircraft with a conventional tail, a T-tail and a U-tail. The interaction of the wake of the open rotor as well as acoustic scattering results in an increase of about 10 dB when the rotor is positioned in front of the main wing. When positioned over the main wing a substantial amount of noise reduction is obtained and this is also observed for tail-mounted installations with a large U-tail. For the hybrid wing body airframe, the open rotor was positioned over the airframe along the centerline as well as off-center representing a twin engine location. A primary result was the documentation of the noise reduction from shielding as a function of the location of the open rotor upstream of the trailing edge of the hybrid wing body. The effects from vertical surfaces and elevon deflection were also measured. Acoustic lining was specially designed and inserted flush with the elevon and airframe surface, the result was an additional reduction in open rotor noise propagating to the far field microphones.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the assessment of}} the effect of engine installation parameters such as engine position, size and power setting on the performance of a typical 300 seater aircraft at cruise condition. Two engines with very-high by-pass ratio and with different fan diameters and specific thrusts are initially simulated in isolation to determine the thrust and drag forces for an isolated configuration. The two engines are then assessed in an engine-airframe configuration to determine the sensitivity of the overall installation penalty to the vertical and axial engine location. The breakdown of the interference force is investigated to determine the aerodynamic origins of beneficial or penalising forces. To complete the cruise study a range of engine power settings were considered to determine the installation penalty at different phases of cruise. This work concludes with the preliminary assessment of cruise fuel burn for two engines. For the baseline engine, across the range of installed positions the resultant thrust requirement varied by 1. 7 % of standard net thrust. The larger engine was less sensitive with a variation of 1. 3 %.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{oil and gas}} mining has moved into {{increasingly}} deeper water in search of undeveloped fields. As water depths approach and exceed 3000 m conventional offshore foundation systems become inefficient and ineffective in stabilising platforms and floating production storage units. The trend of supporting structure design in deep water has been to install catenary and taut leg mooring systems. Consequently, many types of anchoring systems are being developed and used in order to withstand large mooring forces. The SEPLA (Suction Embedded Plate Anchor) is ideal for use in this situation. This project has employed advanced numerical techniques and centrifuge testing to study pullout behaviour of plate anchor foundations in different soil profiles and suction caisson <b>installation</b> <b>effect</b> {{with the aim of}} generating a robust framework for design. The behaviour of strip and circular plate anchors during vertical pullout in uniform and normally consolidated clays has been studied by means of small strain and large deformation finite element analyses. Both fully bonded (attached), and ‘vented’ (no suction on rear face), anchors have been considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite element results and analytical solutions. This study showed that the ultimate pullout capacity factors (Nc) for deep embedment were 11. 6 and 11. 7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13. 1 and 13. 7 for smooth and rough circular anchors respectively. When the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, Hs/B or Hs/D was found to increase linearly with the normalised strength ratio, su/γ'B or su/γ'D. Numerical simulation has been conducted to assess the bearing capacity for inclined pullout plate anchors. This bearing capacity analysis was performed by embedding the anchors in clay with different initial inclinations and different embedment ratios. Both the attached anchor base and vented base were evaluated. The results showed that the bearing capacities of the inclined plate anchors were associated with the inclination angles and base conditions. The separation depth of the plate anchors can be assessed by a simple equation from vertically pulled out plate anchors. Large deformation finite element analyses of plate anchor keying in clay has been performed. The effects of anchor thickness, anchor padeye eccentricity, anchor-soil interface roughness, soil shear strength, anchor submerged weight and soil disturbance have been studied with anchors in uniform or normally consolidated clays. The numerical results were compared with transparent soil test and existing centrifuge test data. The study showed that the RITSS method works well in simulating the anchor keying process. Anchor padeye eccentricity {{played an important role in}} anchor keying. A normalised anchor geometry ratio was used to estimate the loss in embedment during plate anchor’s keying. Both finite element analysis and centrifuge tests have been conducted to study the suction caisson <b>installation</b> <b>effect.</b> In finite element analysis, the soil disturbed zone varied from 3 times the caisson wall thickness to a full area inside a caisson. Centrifuge tests of suction embedded plate anchors were conducted in normally consolidated kaolin clay and transparent uniform soil. It can be concluded that the reduction in anchor capacity due to soil disturbance after suction caisson installation depends on re-consolidation time and soil sensitivity. The soil disturbance also reduced the loss of embedment during the anchor keying process...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{traditional}} methods for supporting structures resting on soft soils {{is the use of}} piles. They generally work by transferring the loads to deeper soil layers, which can provide sufficient bearing capacity when mobilised. This type of foundations has been commonly used throughout the world and also {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands due to the typical soil profile which consists of a thick (10 - 20 m) soft soil layer underlain with a stiff bearing stratum composed mostly of quartz sand. In this perspective, this study sheds a light on the behaviour of piles installed in silica sand. The bearing capacity of a pile depends on the soil properties and the stress state it is surrounded with. This is because the behaviour of granular material is governed by the packing of the grains and the contact stresses in between. The mean stress and the density can be described as the soil state, and the soil behaviour is determined on the basis of this state and the loading conditions. In the case of a displacement pile, the installation process causes a considerable amount of soil displacement and high levels of (reaction) stresses. These <b>effects</b> of pile <b>installation</b> are transmitted to soil through the interaction between sand grains and the pile, resulting in an altered soil state and properties. A more realistic behaviour and therefore an improved design would be achieved by considering the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> in the analyses than performing the analysis considering a geostatic stress state around the pile(s) modelled. In current practice, the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> are taken into account by some empirical design methods in order to estimate the bearing capacity of foundation piles. Several field and model tests performed to investigate the influence of pile installation on the bearing capacity, have led to an evolution of the empirical models to estimate the bearing capacity of displacement piles. Recent attempts to investigate the change in the soil state were also limited either to the measurement domain (generally close to the pile) or resolution as well as the variables (e. g. displacement, strain, stress, density) that can be quantified. However, the behaviour of piles during installation, the interaction with the surrounding soil and the resulting alteration of soil properties during installation are still not well known. This information is essential, not only to make better predictions of the pile bearing capacity and its behaviour in the soil under different loading conditions, but also to be able to predict the (side) <b>effects</b> of pile <b>installation</b> on the neighbourhood. This study is the numerical part of a larger project in which the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> of displacement piles are investigated both experimentally and numerically. The objective of this numerical study is to investigate the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> of pile jacking in sand in a numerical framework. Since the jacking operation can be considered as quasi-static loading, the dynamic effects are not considered in the analyses. For the same reason, drained conditions are assumed such that the pore pressures are only taken into account as a reduction of total stress (giving the effective stresses). As a common tool used in engineering practice, FE modelling is selected as the numerical method. In order to model pile jacking using the FEM in a standard FE code, some additional aspects have to be considered to account for the large deformation effects. In this perspective possibilities to simulate <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> as well as the installation process were investigated and a simplified technique (the Press-Replace technique) is proposed. After a sensitivity study, the method is employed to investigate the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> around a jacked pile for different sand densities. In the view of the results obtained from FE simulations, the possibilities of incorporating the installation fields were investigated. Furthermore, describing the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> in a functional form, which allows flexibility for imposing the installation field around a so-called wished-in-place pile to model it as a jacked pile, was studied. A novel technique is introduced to describe the <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> of a jacked pile without simulating the penetration process. This way a jacked pile can be modelled wished-in-place and corresponding <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e. stress, density and stiffness change) can be imposed. By the proposed method, there will be an enormous gain in term of computational effort and time in the analyses of displacement piles. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|An {{aircraft}} system noise assessment was conducted for a hybrid wing body freighter aircraft concept configured with three open rotor engines. The primary {{objective of the}} study was to determine the {{aircraft system}} level noise given the significant impact of <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> including shielding the open rotor noise by the airframe. The aircraft was designed to carry a payload of 100, 000 lbs on a 6, 500 nautical mile mission. An experimental database was used to establish the propulsion airframe aeroacoustic <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> including those from shielding by the airframe planform, interactions with the control surfaces, and additional noise reduction technologies. A second objective of the study applied the impacts of projected low noise airframe technology and a projection of advanced low noise rotors appropriate for the NASA N+ 2 2025 timeframe. With the projection of low noise rotors and <b>installation</b> <b>effects,</b> the aircraft system level was 26. 0 EPNLdB below Stage 4 level with the engine installed at 1. 0 rotor diameters upstream of the trailing edge. Moving the engine to 1. 5 rotor diameters brought the system level noise to 30. 8 EPNLdB below Stage 4. At these locations on the airframe, the integrated level of <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> including shielding can be as much as 20 EPNLdB cumulative in addition to lower engine source noise from advanced low noise rotors. And finally, an additional set of technology effects were identified and the potential impact at the system level was estimated for noise only without assessing the impact on aircraft performance. If these additional effects were to be included it is estimated that the potential aircraft system noise could reach as low as 38. 0 EPNLdB cumulative below Stage 4...|$|R
