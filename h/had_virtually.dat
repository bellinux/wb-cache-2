5|$|By 1911 {{the textile}} {{industry}} in Bolton employed about 36,000 people. The last mill to be constructed was Sir John Holden's Mill in 1927. The cotton industry declined from the 1920s. A brief upturn after the Second World War was not sustained, {{and the industry}} <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> vanished {{by the end of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 September, with only the {{shattered}} remnants its E Company at hand, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> no troops to defend Yongsan.

5|$|Smetana <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> no {{precursors}} in Czech opera {{apart from}} František Škroup, whose works had rarely lasted beyond {{one or two}} performances. In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music of his youth, especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.|$|E

However, contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection.

5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became {{a significant source of}} employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594. By 1901, farming <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> died out, and the town became a residence for the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the very}} next day, Thiệu ordered Trưởng and General Lâm Quang Thi to abandon Huế and to {{concentrate}} only sufficient numbers of South Vietnamese units to hold Da Nang. On March 29, as Trưởng was about to board the navy transport ship HQ-404, he {{received a phone call}} from Thiệu, who ordered him to turn back and retake Da Nang from the North Vietnamese forces. By then, however, South Vietnamese units in I Corps <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> disappeared, and their commanding officers had fled from their posts.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 February, Blücher, {{commanding}} a Prussian Corps and elements of two Russian Corps, resumed his attack against Marmont. The latter continued to fall back until he was reinforced. Napoleon arrived on the battlefield with strong combined-arms forces, which allowed the French to launch a determined counterattack and drive back the leading elements of the Army of Silesia. Blücher {{realized that he was}} facing the Emperor in person and decided to pull back and avoid another battle against Napoleon. In practice, Blücher's attempt to disengage proved extremely difficult to execute, as the Coalition force was by now in an advanced position, <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> no cavalry present to cover its retreat and was facing an enemy who was ready to commit its numerous cavalry.|$|E

The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest.|$|E

5|$|The canals faced {{competition}} from the Vale of Neath Railway after 1851, but remained profitable until the early 1880s, {{in the case of}} the Neath Canal, and the 1890s for the Tennant. An unusual aspect of the Tennant's success was that tolls were maintained, although tonnage dropped. Most canals at this time made significant cuts to tolls in an attempt to remain competitive with the railways. After 1883, the Neath Canal carried small amounts of silica and gunpowder, but traffic <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> ceased by 1921. Navigation on the Neath Canal came to an end in 1934, and on the Tennant Canal soon afterwards. However, most of the infrastructure was maintained as the canals supplied water to local industries.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{was a major}} {{supplier}} of materiel in the First and Second World Wars, producing the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. At its peak in 1945, an estimated 75,000workers were employed in the park. That number began to decline in the 1960s as companies closed in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. By 1967 employment had fallen to 50,000, and the decline continued throughout the 1970s. The new generation of container ships was too large for the Manchester Ship Canal, {{which led to a}} further decline in Trafford Park's fortunes. The workforce had fallen to 15,000 by 1976, and by the 1980s industry <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> disappeared from the park.|$|E
5|$|When 1925 arrived – {{five years}} after the ACLU was formed – the {{organization}} <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> no success to show for its efforts. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded John T. Scopes to defy Tennessee's anti-evolution law in The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes. Clarence Darrow, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by William Jennings Bryan, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching creationism in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.|$|E

5|$|After 1906, the Canadian Government {{took over}} the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This {{dockyard}} later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910. Just before the First World War, the Canadian government began to make a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with her brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother <b>had</b> <b>virtually</b> excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
