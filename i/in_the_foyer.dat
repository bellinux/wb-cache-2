50|$|Heritage Victoria {{describes}} the Malvern Town Hall as aesthetically and historically significant. It {{is an extraordinary}} and essentially intact example of a building of its type, having two towers. The building demonstrates a changing sequence of styles from the Late Victorian Boom period to interwar Adamesque. The use of marble and terrazzo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyers</b> and <b>the</b> plaster Adamesque ornamentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall is of note.|$|R

5|$|Animal Lifestyles, in {{the western}} {{quadrant}} of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals. The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, {{a part of the}} larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being used as {{the exterior of the}} school, Studio C holds sets for the school's entrance foyer, the gymnasium, the media lab and a hallway with lockers. As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E
50|$|Also on <b>the</b> upper level, <b>in</b> {{front of}} <b>the</b> {{vestibule}} {{leading to the}} house, three doors open onto <b>the</b> grand <b>foyer,</b> with three bay windows opening the view out on place Neuve. <b>The</b> grand <b>foyer</b> with, on <b>the</b> right hand side, <b>the</b> little <b>foyer</b> and, on <b>the</b> left hand side, the little salon, are the piano nobile of the main façade. The enfilade effect of <b>the</b> three spaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grand <b>foyer</b> is magnified by the subtle visual interplay of reflections from several oversized mirrors. The grandeur of <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> recalls <b>the</b> Louvre's famous Galerie d’Apollon <b>in</b> Paris. <b>The</b> ceiling panels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> little <b>foyer</b> are by Léon Gaud. Several artists—painters and sculptors—were commissioned to decorate the inside and the outside of <b>the</b> building <b>in</b> an eclectic style.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed {{to show off}} the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Foyer,</b> ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to make the demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E

5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>foyer</b> of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
