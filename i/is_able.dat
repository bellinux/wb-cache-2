5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

Soon after, Joan <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to wound Joan.

5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such it <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to find nutrition in almost any environment, and it <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

Classification of students cognitive styles used group embedded figures test (GEFT). The subjects of this research were 4 students of XI year of SMA Negeri 1 Kartasura selected by purposive sampling. Validity of the data used time triangulation and the technique of data analysis were done by: (1) classifying the data into four problem solving steps: (a) understand the problem, (b) make a plan, (c) carry out the plan, and (d) look back at the completed solution, (2) presenting the data in narrative text, and (3) concluding the thinking process of students in each problem solving steps. The results show as follows: (1) Male students with a field dependent cognitive style in understanding: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to organize and analyze information or aspects of a problem. In making a plan: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to identify the material that is needed in formulating steps or solutions. In carrying out the plan: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> in the rational thinking and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make a valid conclusions. In looking back: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to think rationally. (2) Male students with field independent cognitive styles in understanding: students <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to organize and analyze information or aspect of a problem, capable of conceptualizing, understanding an attitude and thinking rationally. In making a plan: the students <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to identify the material that is needed in formulating steps or solutions.
