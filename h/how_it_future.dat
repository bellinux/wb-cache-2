40|$|Purpose of Review This paper {{reviews the}} use of {{conceptual}} frameworks in research on active travel, such as walking and cycling. Generic framework features and {{a wide range of}} contents are identified and synthesized into a comprehensive framework of active travel behavior, as part of the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches project (PASTA). PASTA is a European multinational, interdisciplinary research project on active travel and health. Recent Findings Along with an exponential growth in active travel research, a growing number of conceptual frameworks has been published since the early 2000 s. Earlier frameworks are simpler and emphasize the distinction of environmental vs. individual factors, while more recently several studies have integrated travel behavior theories more thoroughly. Summary Based on the reviewed frameworks and various behavioral theories, we propose the comprehensive PASTA conceptual framework of active travel behavior. We discuss <b>how</b> <b>it</b> can guide <b>future</b> research, such as data collection, data analysis, and modeling of active travel behavior, and present some examples from the PASTA project...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{changing}} climate, {{particularly in}} regard to temperature and precipitation, is already affecting tree species’ distributions. Pinus armandii, which dominates on the Yungui Plateau and in the Qinba Mountains in China, is of economic, cultural and ecological value. We wish to test {{the correlations between the}} distribution shift of P. armandii and changing climate, and figure out <b>how</b> <b>it</b> tracks <b>future</b> climate change. Methods We sampled the surface soil at sites throughout the distribution of P. armandii to compare the relative abundance of pollen to the current percent cover of plant species. This was used to determine possible changes in the distribution P. armandii. Given the hilly terrain, elevation was considered together with temperature and precipitation as variables correlated with distribution shifts of P. armandii. Results We show that P. armandii is undergoing change in its geographic range, including retraction, a shift to more northern areas and from the upper high part of the mountains to a lower-altitude part in hilly areas. Temperature was the strongest correlate of this distribution shift. Elevation and precipitation were also both significantly correlated with distribution change of P. armandii, but to a lesser degree than temperature. Conclusion The geographic range of P. armandii has been gradually decreasing under the influence of climate change. This provides evidence of the effect of climate change on trees at the species level and suggests that at least some species will have a limited ability to track the changing climate...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} the subject of intense research, {{covering}} a broad range of causes and effects over long periods of time. Large data sources are needed to support this research, prompting scientists to turn to repositories to collect and share data. Many repositories exist with various data formats and access methods, presenting a challenging environment for researchers. Data portals help to address this by providing a central location for data on a specific topic or region. The Nevada Climate Change Portal is one example, which provides data to support research on Nevada’s climate. This portal was funded under an NSF EPSCoR grant with a goal of sharing resources with similar portals in New Mexico and Idaho. This paper proposes the ATMOS toolkit to help meet this goal and to address challenges facing climate change researchers.

We use two waves of detailed German survey data of newly unemployed individuals to study the effect of home-ownership on the job search behavior of unemployed and their re-employment outcomes.

However, we do not find any evidence for compensations of their restricted mobility by more intensive (more search channels or applications) or different (more active or informal) search behavior. Furthermore, we find that home-ownership does not seem to harm the employment prospects of the unemployed. Although the re-employment probability in the short-run is slightly lower, we find that after one year home-owning unemployed have found better re-employment jobs, in terms of wages and job satisfaction, than their renting counterparts...|$|R
