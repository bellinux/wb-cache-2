5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based {{on the amount of}} seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 hours with the union in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours with the union. C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for the first choice of jobs when the office opened.|$|E
25|$|One such {{position}} is Obama's stance on health care. Obama has repeatedly {{said that he}} wants to see that every American has the option of having affordable health care as good as every U. S. Senator has. He has proposed a major overhaul of the nation’s health care system, aimed at covering the nearly 45 million uninsured Americans, reducing premium costs <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> and breaking what he asserted was “the stranglehold” that the biggest drug and insurance companies have on the health care market.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> health {{insurance}} {{must be paid}} for privately. Some 59% of U.S. residents have {{access to health care}} insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers' expected contributions vary widely. Those whose employers do not offer {{health insurance}}, {{as well as those who}} are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.|$|E

25|$|The {{common people}} {{benefited from the}} {{suppression}} of the traditional elites and from the expansion of the state. Francia took land from the elite and the church and leased it to the poor. About 875 families received homesteads from the lands of the former seminary. The various fines and confiscations levied on the elites helped to reduce taxes <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> As a result, Francia's attacks on the elite and his state-socialist policies provoked little popular resistance. The fines, expropriations, and confiscations of foreign-held property meant that the state quickly became the nation's largest landowner, eventually operating forty-five animal-breeding farms. Run by army personnel, these farms were so successful that surplus animals were given away to the peasants.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 Alfredo Binda won {{a record}} eight {{consecutive}} stages {{on the way}} to his third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory. This Giro began in Rome, which was the second time that the Giro had not started in Milan in the history of its running. When Binda came to the finish in Milan, he was booed by some of the spectators. The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire— {{the same amount of money}} the winner of the Giro would get— not to participate in the Giro. Binda's absence left the field open <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race. Marchisio held a slim fifty-two second lead for the last six stages of the race to the finish in Milan. Marchisio became the youngest rider to win the Giro at 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days; his record stood for ten years before being broken by Fausto Coppi.|$|E

500|$|English {{director}} Ken Loach {{has stated}} that the mixture of professional and non-professional actors in Loves of a Blonde had a significant influence on him and other international filmmakers, by creating an atmosphere in which non-professionals {{who live in the}} milieu depicted by the film bring an expertise and authenticity which serves as [...] "a touchstone <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in the film", while professionals bring knowledge of film craft, which can be helpful to their inexperienced colleagues. Although some performers who, at the time, were not professional later became so, one of the professional actors, Vladimír Pucholt, who played a major role, Milda the pianist, soon gave up acting, relocated to Canada and became a dentist.|$|E

Lasseter described how the boy's excitement to show it to his father touched him deeply. [...] Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well.

500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> but {{for me it was}} a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the idea}} of a general duty of care is now widely accepted, there are {{significant}} differences among the common law jurisdictions concerning the specific circumstances under which that duty of care exists.

Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|His {{performance}} {{style has}} been studied by academics who analysed gender, image and sexuality. For example one author noted that Jagger's performance style [...] "opened up definitions of gendered masculinity and so laid the foundations for self-invention and sexual plasticity which are now {{an integral part of}} contemporary youth culture". His stage personas also contributed significantly to the British tradition of popular music that always featured the character song and where the art of singing becomes a matter of actingwhich creates a question about the singer's relationship to his own words. His voice {{has been described as a}} powerful expressive tool for communicating feelings to his audience, and expressing an alternative vision of society. To express [...] "virility and unrestrained passion" [...] he developed techniques previously used by African American preachers and gospel singers such as [...] "the roar, the guttural belt style of singing, and the buzz, a more nasal and raspy sound". Steven Van Zandt wrote: [...] "The acceptance of Jagger's voice on pop radio was a turning point in rock & roll. He broke open the door <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> Suddenly, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison weren't so weird – even Bob Dylan." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics of {{the welfare}} state claim that, in {{addition}} to the vast expense, by relieving citizens of personal responsibility for their own welfare the government has inadvertently promoted irresponsible and immature attitudes, with the result that squalor, ignorance, and idleness are common.

Utley, wrote that the welfare state was [...] "an arrangement under which we all largely cease to be responsible for our own behaviour and in return become responsible <b>for</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's.</b> The temptations which this way of doing things offers to synthetic anger, fraudulent penitence, all other forms of hypocrisy and the sheer evasion of duty are infinitely too strong for fallen man".|$|R

500|$|Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic {{initially}} {{seems to}} need no defense, given its success, {{it is considered}} a film [...] "for 15-year-old girls" [...] by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: [...] "that [...] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys." [...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe.

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers.

[...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful.
