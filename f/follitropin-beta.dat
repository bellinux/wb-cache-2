40|$|Given {{the higher}} {{efficacy}} of <b>follitropin-beta,</b> a new recombinant {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (r-FSH), versus urinary-FSH (u-FSH), {{the present study was}} carried out to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of <b>follitropin-beta</b> in comparison with u-FSH in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in Italy. Clinical decision analysis techniques were used to retrospectively model the direct medical costs of women undergoing IVF treatment. Seven Italian experts were interviewed, using a semi-structured questionnaire, in order to adapt the results of all clinical trials to the Italian patterns of care. Three analyses were conducted considering the public, the private sectors and a mixture of them (currently representing the Italian situation). The estimated total cost of IVF treatments varies from 106. 9 and 211. 7 billion Lire (63. 2 and 125. 2 million US$) depending on setting and type of treatment. The average CER varies from 21. 5 and 37. 7 million Lire (12 700 and 22 300 $US) in the different hypotheses considered. The incremental CER varies from 19. 2 and 26. 0 million Lire (11 300 and 15 400 $US) depending on setting and type of treatment...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{administration}} of <b>follitropin-beta</b> with a pen device (Puregon Pen(R)) is more convenient, less painful and 16 - 18 % more efficient. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform an economic evaluation of the administration of <b>follitropin-beta</b> by this pen device against follitropin-alpha by multidose and highly purified (HP) HMG by conventional syringe in IVF treatment by comparing the process utilities and the costs for the Dutch setting. Conjoint analysis assessed the process utilities for the three administration modes on a scale from 0 to 1. A decision analytic model estimated the costs of an average IVF cycle from a societal perspective. Patients estimated the process utility at 0. 96 for the pen, 0. 53 for the multidose and 0. 36 for the conventional syringe. Additional costs were estimated at 0 Euros and 194 Euros, comparing the pen with multidose or conventional methods respectively. Assuming a 16 % efficiency gain of the pen, costs ranged from Euros- 135 (savings) to 60 Euros (extra costs). In conclusion, patients perceive sufficient benefits to the pen device to choose it over other dosing methods. Dominance of the pen device over the multidose method was shown. Compared with the conventional administration method, the added value of the pen device was 2. 7 (0. 96 / 0. 36) times higher...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{purified}} bovine follitropin was dissociated {{into its}} alpha- and beta-subunits after treatment with 1 M-propionic acid. The dissociated subunits were fractionated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100. The isolated alpha- and beta-subunits were biologically inactive, but their recombinants regenerated 80 % of the follitropin activity. The alpha-subunit of bovine follitropin recombined with the beta-subunits of bovine lutropin and thyrotropin to regenerate 70 % of lutropin and 50 % of thyrotropin activities respectively. The beta-subunit of bovine follitropin recombined with the alpha-subunit of either bovine lutropin or thyrotropin to regenerate about 75 % of follitropin activity. Recombinations were monitored by specific radioligand-receptor assays and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The elution {{volumes of the}} alpha- and beta-subunits of bovine follitropin after gel filtration on Sephadex G- 100 were almost identical. The amino acid composition of bovine follitropin-alpha was low in histidine, arginine, isoleucine and leucine, but relatively high in lysine, threonine and glutamic acid. The bovine <b>follitropin-beta</b> contained one methionine residue and low amounts of histidine and phenylalanine, but relatively high in aspartic acid, threonine and glutamic acid. The N-terminal residues of the alpha- and beta-subunits of bovine follitropin were identified to be phenylalanine and glycine respectively...|$|E
