5|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|These signs {{give us some}} of the {{terminology}} used today. The <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of Aries was named when the vernal equinox was actually in the constellation Aries; it has since moved into Pisces.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} improved for {{the following}} race in Bahrain though, as Webber picked up his <b>first</b> <b>point</b> for the season despite a small mistake in qualifying which left him starting 14th and {{marked the first time}} he had been outqualified by his teammate in F1. He was unable to continue his point scoring form, however, as intermittent electrical problems in San Marino and a lack of grip in Spain meant that he could do no better than 13th and 12th in those races.|$|E
5|$|After five-and-a-half seasons playing {{within the}} Canadiens organization, Lapierre {{was traded to}} the Anaheim Ducks in {{exchange}} for defenceman Brett Festerling and a fifth-round draft pick in 2012 on December 31, 2010.

5|$|After turning {{professional}} in 2001–02, Torres {{was assigned to}} the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers following his second NHL training camp.

5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Before this match, the Kerala Blasters and Atlético de Kolkata {{had played}} each other twice {{during the regular}} season.

Baljit Sahni scored the opening goal in the 22nd minute before Iain Hume {{equalized}} for the Blasters to earn the Blasters their <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of the season. In the second game, on 21 November 2014, it was the Kerala Blasters who came out on top as 2–1 winners. Iain Hume and Pedro Gusmão gave the Blasters the 2–0 lead before Fikru Teferra scored the consolation for Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|Bok was {{aided by}} people of diverse {{cultures}} and faiths in his journey to freedom. His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum. Upon arriving in Khartoum, Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman {{and members of the}} Fur people, and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church. His <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo, North Dakota.|$|E

5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island was not the <b>first</b> <b>point</b> of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs {{to a point of}} land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the <b>first</b> <b>point,</b> that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2010, Phaneuf {{made his}} Toronto Maple Leaf debut, leading all Maple Leafs players in time on ice and ended {{the night with}} a fight and given second star of the game honours.

Phaneuf was named an {{alternate}} captain in Toronto nine games after being acquired after Mike Komisarek suffered a season-ending injury. While Phaneuf struggled offensively to begin his tenure in Toronto – he played 25 games in Toronto before scoring his first goal – then-Leafs Head Coach Ron Wilson credited him with creating a positive change in the mood in the Toronto dressing room.|$|E
