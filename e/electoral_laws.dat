5|$|In 1838, the <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> were {{reformed}} {{leading to}} {{elections for the}} 15 seats on the city council. The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run. In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified {{out of a total}} population of more than 7,000. The first city council, mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the Aarhus River. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the city council, as it is to this day.|$|E

25|$|The {{elections}} of September 1889 marked a decisive defeat for the Boulangists. Changes in the <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> prevented Boulanger from running in multiple constituencies and the aggressive {{opposition of the}} established government, combined with Boulanger's self-imposed exile, all contributed to a rapid decline of the movement. The decline of Boulanger severely undermined the political strength of the conservative and royalist elements of French political life; they would not recover strength until {{the establishment of the}} Vichy regime in 1940. The defeat of the Boulangists ushered in a period of political dominance by the Opportunist Republicans.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the former Confederate states had adopted new constitutions and <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> that {{effectively}} disenfranchised black voters and, in Alabama, many poor white voters as well. Under the white-established Jim Crow laws, passed after Democrats regained control of southern legislatures, racial segregation was imposed in public facilities and retail stores in the South, including public transportation. Bus and train companies enforced seating policies with separate sections for blacks and whites. School bus transportation was unavailable in any form for black schoolchildren in the South, and black education was always underfunded.|$|E

After the re-election as Secretary, Renzi proposed a new <b>electoral</b> <b>law</b> called Mattarellum bis, better known as Rosatellum, from the name of his main proponent Ettore Rosato, Democratic leader in the Chamber of Deputies.

New <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> mandated that any political party which failed to field 50 candidates in a general federal election would be automatically de-registered and its assets seized. The CPC {{was not in a}} position to run 50 candidates in the 1993 federal election (it fielded only eight candidates during that election), and therefore its assets were seized and the party was de-listed. The CPC had sought an interim injunction to prevent its imminent de-registration, but this legal action failed.|$|E
25|$|The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the Albertine Statute of 1848, was {{extended}} to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom {{took place in a}} framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As Northern Italy quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment. Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing Somalia, Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese under its rule.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February, the Croatian Parliament adopted {{amendments}} to the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia and passed a package of <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> to facilitate multiparty elections, but left the parliamentary system unchanged. Elections were scheduled for all 356 seats in the tricameral parliament consisting of the Socio-Political Council (80 seats), the Council of Associated Labour (160 seats) and the Council of Municipalities (116 seats). The electoral legislation established constituencies for each parliamentary chamber, whose sizes varied greatly. The eighty Socio-Political Council constituencies encompassed many small municipalities or parts of large ones, varying in population from fewer than 32,000 to more than 80,000. Council of Municipalities constituencies corresponded to municipalities with greater population variations of fewer than 1,000 to more than 150,000. The Associated Labour Council members were to be elected in 160 constituencies whose populations also varied greatly. There was no universal suffrage for the Associated Labour Council elections; voting was restricted to the employed, the self-employed and students.|$|E

25|$|Since Bosniaks compose roughly 70.4% of Federation's population, Croats 22.4% and Serbs {{just around}} 2%, Parliament's House of Peoples (with equal {{representation}} {{for all three}} nationalities) is supposed {{to ensure that the}} interests of Croats, Serbs and national minorities are fairly represented during government creation and in the legislative process. Since 2001-02 and foreign-imposed amendments to the constitution and <b>electoral</b> <b>laws,</b> Bosnian Croats have claimed the election system for the deputies in the House of Peoples is rigged, depriving them of their rights to representation and in fact enabling Bosniaks to control the majority in the upper house as well. Namely, after 2002 each nations' deputies to the House of Peoples are elected by 10 Cantonal assemblies, 6 of them with clear Bosniak majority. This dismantled checks the Federation's Croats and Serbs had on the Federal legislature as well as the executive, particularly government-building. In 2010-14 Federation's Government was formed by Bosniak SDP without the consent of major Croat political parties. After Croatian politician Božo Ljubić filed an appeal, in December 2016 Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found the election system of the deputies in the House of Peoples unconstitutional and abrogated the controversial rules.|$|E
25|$|The {{collaboration}} with socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta was praised {{by both sides}} {{at the start of}} the mandate, but deteriorated thereafter once with foreign visits of the Head of the Executive, without informing the President, but especially with the criminal prosecution of Victor Ponta for 22 alleged corruption charges, prompting Iohannis to demand his resignation from the head of the Government. Relations with Parliament went similarly. Iohannis criticized the Parliament for defending MPs by rejecting the requests of the National Anticorruption Directorate for lifting their immunity, as in the case of PSD senator Dan Șova or Prime Minister Victor Ponta. Regarding the judicial system, Klaus Iohannis pleads for a sustained fight against corruption. Likewise, Iohannis expressed dissatisfaction with attempted amendments to the Penal Code. Since coming into office, President Klaus Iohannis has made a habit to hold consultations with parliamentary parties. The first round of consultations took place on 12 January, the purpose of these discussions being a political agreement that would ensure, by 2017, a minimum threshold of 2% of GDP for the Ministry of Defence, agreement signed by all parties. The second round of consultations focused on the legislative priorities of the parliamentary session: voting in diaspora, financing electoral campaigns and parties and lifting parliamentary immunity. Because the Parliament has not implemented the commitments made on 28 January, Iohannis has organised another series of consultations on the state of <b>electoral</b> <b>laws,</b> but also on rejection of Justice requests for approval of arrest or prosecution of MPs. The topics of other meetings between the president and parties aimed the Big Brother law package and the national defense strategy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South.

[...] Beginning with Mississippi in 1890, legislatures began to ratify new constitutions, amendments or <b>electoral</b> <b>laws</b> that disfranchised African-American voters, devising means such as poll taxes, literacy tests and residential requirements that passed Supreme Court review but worked against poor blacks and many poor whites. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, six Southern states had essentially eliminated the black vote, and pressure mounted among whites in Virginia to do the same, ostensibly as a way to stop electoral fraud and corruption.|$|E
