25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks. In the United States, an air kiss is becoming more common. This involves kissing in the air near the cheek, with the cheeks touching or not. After a first date, {{it is common for}} the couple to give each other a quick <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> (or lips where that is the norm) on parting, to indicate that a good time was had and perhaps to indicate an interest in another meeting.|$|E

25|$|Frequency {{of touch}} also varies {{significantly}} between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, {{one of which}} examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know if someone was touching more frequently than normal {{it would be necessary}} to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries a <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> is considered a polite greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love (85).|$|E

2500|$|Theories for the hit {{took several}} forms. Initially, law {{enforcement}} officials believed that the hit had been ordered {{by one of the}} Five Families in New York City in an attempt to take over Philadelphia's organized crime operations. But police later said they suspected Joey Merlino of being the gunman, with Nicky Scarfo Jr. seen as a proxy for his father—the message being that the elder Scarfo was no longer in control of the Philadelphia crime family. Merlino has steadfastly denied any involvement. However, Gaetano [...] "Tommy Horsehead" [...] Scafidi would testify in 2001 that Merlino was the gunman and that Merlino second-in-command Michael [...] "Mikey Chang" [...] Ciancaglini drove the getaway car. Scafidi said he was asked to participate in the hit, but refused. This was confirmed by testimony from former Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale, who also turned state's evidence and said that Merlino told him about committing the crime while they served time together in 1990. At least one other mobster testifying on behalf of the government alleged that soldier Pete [...] "Pete the Crumb" [...] Caprio also knew of the hit and attempted to prevent it. Authorities also suspected Charles [...] "Chaz" [...] Iannece of the attempted murder because he delivered a controversial <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> to Scarfo shortly before the gunman attacked.|$|E
2500|$|A {{procession}} is now allowed at the Offertory or Presentation of the Gifts, when bread, wine, {{and water}} {{are brought to}} the altar. The homily has been made {{an integral part of}} the Mass instead of being treated as an adjunct, and the ancient Prayer of the Faithful has been restored. The exchange of a sign of peace before Communion, previously limited to the clergy at High Mass, is permitted (not made obligatory) at every Mass, even for the laity. [...] "As for the actual sign of peace to be given, the manner is to be established by Conferences of Bishops in accordance with the culture and customs of the peoples. However, it is appropriate that each person, in a sober manner, offer the sign of peace only to those who are nearest." [...] (GIRM, 82.) [...] "While the Sign of Peace is being given, it is permissible to say, The peace of the Lord be with you always, to which the reply is Amen" [...] (GIRM, 154). In countries of European tradition, a simple clasping of hands is most common, though sometimes family members will exchange a <b>kiss</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> especially in Latin countries.
