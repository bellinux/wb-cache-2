50|$|Hylotrupes is a {{monotypic}} genus of woodboring beetles in {{the family}} Cerambycidae, the longhorn beetles. The sole species, Hylotrupes bajulus, is known by several common names, including <b>house</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> old house borer, and European house borer. Originating in Europe, and having been spread in timber and wood products, the beetle now has a practically cosmopolitan distribution, including Southern Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and much of Europe and the Mediterranean.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{comparative}} tests of {{a method for}} the detection of <b>house</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) were carried out by means of recording the acoustic effects caused by these insects, as well as another instrumental method based on the use of X-ray pictures. Insofar as the X-ray method brings completely reliable results as regards the detection of the presence of fully-grown <b>house</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae in wood, the accuracy of situation assessment based on the electro-acoustic method is estimated to be approximately 70 - 80 %, {{based on the results of}} the research pre-sented herein. In this research the accuracy of situation assessment is understood as the correct determination of an estimated number of larvae and their condition. The differences in situation assessment accuracies using both methods were stati-stically verified by means of the Czebyszew method. Since the tests were initial in nature without the use of standard patterns, as these have not been developed yet, the obtained results are considered highly satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis was to make a constructive-technical {{research}} on timbers of St. Francis Seraph church in Lipník nad Bečvou. This church is registered into national list of sights as a sight number 29870 / 8 - 485. It is a Gothic-Renaissance building dating from 1590 - 1593. The roof above the cancel and nave consists of free floors dollar beams, queen post and truss frames. The aim was to reveal biotic damage to individual elements of timbers and {{to determine the extent}} of the damage. The evaluation of timbers was based on sensory and devices research. The roof was attacked mostly <b>house</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> rotting, especially in places where there was high humidity. The damage was caused mainly on wall beams and camping piece of tie beams. Based on achieved results we suggested remedial measures which are intended to preserve the built of wood, which is in a satisfactory condition. This thesis also deals with dendrochronological dating where we tried to determine the age of construction by dendrochronological analysis. The roof above the nave and chancel was dated to the period 1769 - 1771. Thesis is completed with anatomical determination of forest species which were used in individual parts of timbers. The results provide information for planned reconstruction of monument considering its current constructive - technical condition...|$|E

40|$|Preservation of {{historical}} buildings {{is a hot}} topic, and g e t t i n g hotter if predictions about global warming and climate change impact upon the built environment {{in the way we}} think they will. Invasions of exotic insect species and extre m e population fluctuations of indigenous species are widely re p o rted around the world. Timber pests are no exception, and we have already seen termites establish themselves in Southwest England and observed an increase in the p revalence of the <b>house</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> H y l o t rupes bajulus. This may be partly due to climate change, but it is also p robably related to changes in lifestyle. Central heating systems are now present in most historical buildings. And coupled with reduced ventilation, it can lead to condensation and warm e r, more humid environments inside buildings, c reating a more conducive environment for timber pests. It is also feared that another European timber pest, the death-watch beetle (Xestobium rufovillosum), is on the increase, which is a particular worry for architectural conservationists as the beetle has a preference for ancient oak timber found in cathedrals, palaces and stately homes (Belmain et al., 1998). Historically, beginning with attempts to treat the roof timbers of Westminster Hall {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, surface treatment with chemicals has been employed as the treatment method of choice. Surf a c e t reatment has proved, however, of very limited effect in controlling the death-watch beetle in such historic buildings. As a result, between 1993 and 1997 the European Commission funded the international collaborative research project Woodcare, led by English Heritage, to understand the interaction between beetle behaviour, timber and fungus with a view to understand why surface treatments so often fail, and to evolve alternative environmentally acceptable treatment methods (Ridout, 1999). This short article outlines the problems involved in the effective control of death-watch beetle and some of the research which has been carried out to discover why it is so problematical and to develop better methods of control...|$|E

40|$|<b>Longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) {{have been}} used to {{identify}} sites of high biological diversity and conservation value in cultivated landscapes, but were rarely studied in changing landscapes of humid tropics. This study was conducted in a region of southern Yunnan, China, which was dominated by natural rainforest until 30 years ago, but is successively transformed into commercial rubber monoculture plantations since that time. The objectives were to investigate <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species diversity and distribution in the major land use types of this landscape and to estimate the effects of an expected expansion of rubber plantations on the <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblages. The results showed that tree species diversity (181 species in total) and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity (220 species in total) were closely related with {{no significant differences between the}} tree and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> assemblages shown by similarity distance analysis. There was a highly positive relationship between the estimated species richness of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and the number of tree species. Individual numbers of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and trees were also highly positive related at the sampling sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the degree of canopy coverage, succession age and tree diversity explained 78. 5 % of the total variation in <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblage composition. Natural forest sites had significantly higher numbers of species and individuals than any other type of habitat. Although young rubber plantations bear the highest <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity outside forests (half of the total number of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species recorded in total), they can not provide permanen...|$|R
