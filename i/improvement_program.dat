5|$|Foundation {{construction}} {{began in}} May 1896. However, work was stopped when Roberts took ill in August; he died the next January. The Panic of 1896 led Roberts' successor, Frank Thomson, not to continue work. When Thomson died in 1899, Alexander Cassatt was recalled to the PRR {{to serve as}} president. Cassatt immediately began a major capital <b>improvement</b> <b>program,</b> which included both adding capacity to mainlines and constructing large stations including Washington Union Station and New York Penn Station. Work resumed in 1900 with an enlarged floor plan, and the new station was complete in April 1901.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the Multinational Staged <b>Improvement</b> <b>Program</b> (MSIP) was {{conducted}} to evolve the F-16's capabilities, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure the aircraft's worth. The program upgraded the F-16 in three stages. The MSIP process permitted the quick introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs and with reduced risks compared to traditional independent upgrade programs. In 2012, the USAF had allocated $2.8 billion to upgrade 350 F-16s {{while waiting for the}} F-35 to enter service. One key upgrade has been an auto-GCAS (Ground collision avoidance system) to reduce instances of controlled flight into terrain. Onboard power and cooling capacities limits the scope of upgrades, which often involves the addition of more power-hungry avionics.|$|E

At the end of six years, each boat comes in for her 'full cycle docking', which involves completely refurbishing the submarine. During these dockings, the submarines are fitted with any enhancements or new technologies as part of the Collins Continuous <b>Improvement</b> <b>Program</b> (part of Defence procurement project SEA 1439).|$|E

5|$|The Radar System <b>Improvement</b> <b>Program</b> (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product <b>improvement</b> <b>program</b> (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging <b>improvement</b> <b>program</b> as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E

40|$|Exterior {{changes to}} {{existing}} and historic buildings in depressed historic areas signify financial investment and change, {{and have the}} potential to {{play a significant role in}} both urban preservation and revitalization. Changes to exterior architectural colors are perhaps the most visible signifier of such revitalization, as the use of color changes as a tool in façade <b>improvement</b> <b>programs</b> nationwide demonstrates. As part of façade <b>improvement</b> <b>programs,</b> changes to the exteriors of existing buildings in historic cities are most often a visual indication of adaptive reuse. Urban façade <b>improvement</b> <b>programs</b> that are dedicated to commercial corridor revitalization provide a variety of funding and services to business and property owners. The existence of such programs suggests that beautifying neighborhoods through changes to existing building exteriors will benefit business and property owners economically. This thesis proposes to explore and analyze the various government-sponsored façade <b>improvement</b> <b>programs</b> in Philadelphia to determine their impact on commercial corridor revitalization (or economic success as determined by the City) and on their long-term sustainability after initial investment. If façade <b>improvement</b> <b>programs</b> are indeed successful as indicators of change within a community, and thereby adaptive reuse of existing buildings, then the application of such programs within historic districts has the potential to dramatically impact the way we view, use, and reuse the existing buil...|$|R
