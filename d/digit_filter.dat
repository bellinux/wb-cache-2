Based on finite unit impulse response, FIR <b>digit</b> <b>filter</b> is designed according as the given {{power spectral density}} (PSD) characteristics beforehand. By controlling the parameters of filter, amplitude-phase characteristics that can meet completely the preconditions and demand is obtained. And then white noise is inputted to filter, random vibration time signal is generated. Moreover, the method of parameters analysis of AR autoregressive model is used to estimate and validate power spectrum of the gotten random vibration time domain signal. The result shows that the accuracy and error of PSD between AR model and the given function are {{within the range of}} the permitted value. And random vibration time signal obtained by using the redesigned FIR filter can meet absolutely the precision demand beforehand in the simulation and test...|$|E
40|$|Software-Defined Radio (SDR) {{technology}} is evolving rapidly, offering higher flexibility for wireless communication networks. For {{the sake of}} performance, and power consumption, filtering is commonly implemented in hardware using FPGAs. Pulse shaping in the transmitter and the corresponding matched filtering in the receiver, which together satisfy the Nyquist inter symbol interference (ISI) criterion, are no exception to this. To decrease the FPGA resources used by filters, to increase speed and to decrease power consumption the filter coefficients can be optimized by expressing them in canonical signed digit (CSD) form, using as few arithmetic operations per filter as possible, while maintaining acceptable filter characteristics. In this paper a new method to decrease the number of nonzero signed digits is presented. With this method a reduction of up to 65 % of the nonzero signed <b>digits</b> per <b>filter</b> is realized, while decreasing the ISI ratio too...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the use of}} a genetic {{algorithm}} to design QMF bank with canonical signed <b>digit</b> coefficients. A <b>filter</b> bank has applications in areas like video and audio coding, data communication, etc. Filter bank design is a multiobjective optimization problem. The performance depends on the reconstruction error of the overall filter bank and the individual performance of the composing lowpass filter. In this thesis we have used reconstruction error of the overall filter bank as our main objective and passband error, stopband error, stopband and passband ripples and transition width of the individual lowpass filter as constraints. Therefore filter bank design can be formulated as single objective multiple constraint optimization problem. A unique genetic algorithm is developed to optimize filer bank coefficients such that the corresponding system 2 ̆ 7 s response matches that of an ideal system with an additional constraint that all coefficients are in canonical signed digit (CSD) format. A special restoration technique is used to restore the CSD format of the coefficients after crossover and mutation operators in Genetic algorithm. The proposed restoration technique maintains the specified word length and the maximum number of nonzero <b>digits</b> in <b>filter</b> banks coefficients. Experimental results are presented at the end. It is demonstrated that the designed genetic algorithm is reliable, and efficient for designing QMF banks. Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

30|$|Hence, on average, CSD numbers contain about 33 % fewer non-zero bits than two's {{complement}} numbers [11]. Now the multipliers in {{the digital}} filters are realized using shifters and adders/subtractors. This results in the area reduction for digital filters. Here, the complexity of a digital filter {{is a function of}} the number of non-zero <b>digits</b> in the <b>filter</b> coefficient. Encoding the filter coefficient using the CSD representation reduces the number of partial products as well as the area and the power consumption. Hence, it is a useful technique for implementing FIR Filters with fixed coefficients. Digital FIR filters can take advantage of this CSD representation.|$|R

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: It {{is unclear}} whether Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, type 1 A, causes {{auditory}} processing disorders. Therefore, auditory processing abilities were investigated in five CMT 1 A patients with normal hearing. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have failed to separate peripheral from central auditory processing disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five genetically confirmed CMT 1 A cases in patients with normal hearing underwent behavioral and objective testing. Pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and OAE assessment were followed-up by an auditory processing test battery comprising sentences-in-noise test, pattern recognition tests, words-in-noise test, dichotic <b>digit</b> test, <b>filtered</b> speech test, binaural fusion test, and categorical speech perception test. Subsequently, ABR and ERP measurements were conducted. RESULTS: Either the behavioral or objective test scores of 4 out of the 5 CMT 1 A patients {{did not differ significantly}} from those of subjects with normal hearing. Significantly lower scores of one patient on auditory processing tests and ABR measurements could be ascribed to subnormal hearing. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that CMT 1 A patients with normal peripheral hearing have auditory processing abilities that were not indicative for an auditory processing disorder. Furthermore, the presence of a peripheral hearing loss complicates the interpretation of auditory processing abilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} adders (subtractors) needed to {{implement}} the coefficient multipliers determines {{the complexity of the}} finite impulse response (FIR) filters. A greedy common subexpression elimination (CSE) algorithm based on the canonic signed <b>digit</b> representation of <b>filter</b> coefficients for implementing low complexity FIR filters is proposed in this paper. Our look-ahead algorithm chooses the maximum number of frequently occurring subexpressions to eliminate redundant computations in coefficient multiplication and hence reduces the number of adders required {{to implement the}} filter. When compared to existing CSE algorithms, our method results in a very low number of unpaired bits. Design examples of FIR filters show that the proposed method offers an average adder reduction of about 20 % over the best known CSE method...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} Thurstonian Boltzmann Machines (TBM), {{a unified}} architecture that can naturally incorporate {{a wide range}} of data inputs at the same time. Our motivation rests in the Thurstonian view that many discrete data types can be con-sidered as being generated from a subset of underlying latent continuous variables, and in the observation that each realisation of a discrete type imposes certain in-equalities on those variables. Thus learning and inference in TBM reduce to making sense of a set of inequalities. Our proposed TBM naturally supports the following types: Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary, categorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in) -complete rank with and without ties. We demonstrate the versatility and ca-pacity of the proposed model on three applications of very different natures; namely handwritten <b>digit</b> recognition, collaborative <b>filtering</b> and complex social survey anal-ysis. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} {{modification}} to the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) learning algorithm to incorporate inductive biases. These latent activation biases are ideal solutions of the latent activity {{and may be}} designed either by modeling neural phenomenon or inductive principles of the task. In this paper, we design activation biases for sparseness and selectivity based on the activation distributions of biological neurons. With this model, one can manipulate the selectivity of individual hidden units and the sparsity of population codes. The biased RBM yields a filter bank of Gabor-like filters when trained on natural images, while modeling handwritten <b>digits</b> results in <b>filters</b> with stroke-like features. We quantitatively verify that the latent representations assume {{the properties of the}} activation biases. We further demonstrate that RBMs biased with selectivity and sparsity can significantly outperform standard RBMs for discriminative tasks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The JPEG 2000 {{image coding}} {{standard}} employs the biorthogonal 9 / 7 wavelet for lossy compression. The performance of hardware implementation of 9 / 7 -filter bank depends on accuracy and efficiency. A method for processing signal in a canonical signed <b>digit</b> format, <b>filter</b> due to fractional coefficient includes {{the steps of}} obtaining real coefficients optimized to desired filter characteristics, calculating scaling factors for each real coefficients which minimizes errors between the real coefficients and converted canonical signed digit codes, producing optimum canonical signed digit coefficients by using the calculated scaling factors and filtering input data by using the optimum canonical signed digit form coefficient. For multiplierless operation canonical sign digit plays an important roll in processing signal. Advantage of this implementation {{is to reduce the}} number of adders in hardware and also increase the speed of operation. Filter bank filters the low resolution information using lowpass filter and high resolution information by using high pass filter. Wavelet co-efficient decides the characteristic of filter. In this method we used 9 / 7 wavelet transform to implement multiplierless operation. To implement multiplierless Hardware we used sum or difference of power two-representation i. e. canonical signed digit form. The canonical signed digit form is optimal in terms of how many nonzero digits are required to represent a given number. On an average, a canonical representation used two thirds as many nonzero digits as a binary representation, so the canonical signed digit form can significantly reduce the number of adders required in hardware...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Various {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that organic solvent exposure may induce auditory damage. Studies conducted in workers occupationally exposed to solvents suggest, on the one hand, poorer hearing thresholds than in matched non-exposed workers, and on the other hand, central auditory damage due to solvent exposure. Taking into account the potential auditory damage induced by solvent exposure due to the neurotoxic properties of such substances, the present research aimed at studying the possible auditory processing disorder (APD), and possible hearing difficulties in daily life listening situations that solvent-exposed workers may acquire. Materials and Methods: Fifty workers exposed to a mixture of organic solvents (xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone) and 50 non-exposed workers matched by age, gender and education were assessed. Only subjects with no history of ear infections, high blood pressure, kidney failure, metabolic and neurological diseases, or alcoholism were selected. The subjects had either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss, and normal tympanometric results. Hearing-in-noise (HINT), dichotic <b>digit</b> (DD), <b>filtered</b> speech (FS), pitch pattern sequence (PPS), and random gap detection (RGD) tests were carried out in the exposed and non-exposed groups. A self-report inventory of each subject's performance in daily life listening situations, the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, was also administered. Results: Significant threshold differences between exposed and non-exposed workers were found at some of the hearing test frequencies, for both ears. However, exposed workers still presented normal hearing thresholds as a group (equal or better than 20 dB HL). Also, for the HINT, DD, PPS, FS and RGD tests, non-exposed workers obtained better results than exposed workers. Finally, solvent-exposed workers reported significantly more hearing complaints in daily life listening situations than non-exposed workers. Conclusions: It is concluded that subjects exposed to solvents may acquire an APD and thus the sole use of pure-tone audiometry is insufficient to assess hearing in solvent-exposed populations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported on a}} novel number representation using 2 bases which we {{refer to as the}} double-base number system (DBNS). Our preferred implementation uses the relatively prime bases { 2, 3 }. If we allow the exponents of the bases to be arbitrarily large signed integers, then we can represent any real number to any arbitrary precision by a single digit DBNS representation. By representing the digit position by the exponent values, we generate a logarithmic-like representation which we can manipulate using an index calculus. A multiplier accumulator architecture for a FIR filter application has been reported which uses a half-index domain to remove the problem of addition within the index calculus. In this paper we show that using a 2 digit DBNS representation for both the input data and the filter coefficients can result in substantial hardware savings compared to both the single-digit a DBNS approach and an equivalent binary implementation of a general multiplier accumulator. In the paper we discuss the filter architecture, techniques for converting between binary and the 2 -digit DBNS representations, and also the design technique used to generate the 2 <b>digit</b> DBNS FIR <b>filter</b> coefficients...|$|R
