The neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation, first on invertebrates and then on small mammals {{before moving on to}} humans. Sometimes the animals would <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> euthanized in order to extract, slice, and scan their brains, but sometimes behavioral and in vivo measures would be required, which might cause pain to living animals.|$|E
25|$|Moral {{philosophers}} {{have defined}} discrimination as disadvantageous treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual {{need not be}} actually harmed {{in order to be}} discriminated against. They <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated worse than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way {{despite the fact that the}} people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation. In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{how long}} musical {{instruments}} should last, {{it is important}} to try to maintain their playable conditions as long as possible. Similarly to automobiles that have been used on a daily basis over the years, musical instruments do not sound the same or work in the same manner that they once did when they were new. Parts wear out and at times <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. On a side note, the average lifespan of instruments depends on the classification of them: “woodwinds or brass instruments last about twenty years, while pianos last about 100 years, and string instruments for a maximum of 200 years." [...] With proper conservation techniques used on instruments, {{they will be able to}} last longer than their projected lifespans.|$|E

If, as he points out in his article, the document <b>just</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> scanned and committed to a SharePoint system and doesn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent <b>to</b> some other centralized server, this is just a remote capture situation.|$|R
50|$|Another, often overlooked, {{challenge}} the library presents is {{the weight of}} the books. A common strategy in green design is to raise the floors to increase circulation, but {{the weight of the}} stacks can be an impediment to this strategy. To deal with this challenge, many designers have resorted to zoning the library into designated areas, so these strategies can be enacted in certain areas, and alternatives can be used in others.Libraries need to be built flexibly, in order to make room for expansions in size and in wiring capabilities. Library buildings are long term investments into the community, so when designing them architects need to be looking 50 or 100 years into the future. These obstacles by no means present insurmountable challenges to green libraries. The special needs of the library <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into consideration {{from the beginning of the}} project.|$|E
5000|$|Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative {{is a book}} {{on coming}} up with {{creative}} ideas written by Austin Kleon and published in 2012 from Workman Publishing. The book, has since then become a New York Times Bestseller. Kleon presents himself as a young writer and artist emphasizing that creativity is everywhere and is for everyone. In his own words, [...] "You don’t {{need to be a}} genius, you <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> yourself".Kleon points out that no artist's work is ever completely original, and that trying to be completely original will daunt an artist and eventually smothers his creativity. He suggests artists embrace the inevitability of influence, to celebrate living outside of a vacuum, to relax, and have fun with their art. Beyond that, he also goes on to offer tips on how to stay focused, upbeat, and be receptive to incoming inspiration.|$|E
5000|$|Grievous Angel was {{released}} in January 1974 and peaked at a disappointing 195 on the Billboard 200. In {{the wake of his}} death, however, the album received much interest and was deemed an artistic triumph. Allan Jones of Melody Maker wrote, [...] "Both GP and Grievous Angel need no analysis. There are no words to describe the sense of desperation and the haunting quality of these last works. They <b>just</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> listened to." [...] Tom Russell of Helix concurred, writing, [...] "His influence on bringing country music to rock and roll is as important as Bob Dylan's combining folk lyrics with rock." [...] Mark Deming of AllMusic writes that the LP [...] "may not have been the finest work of his career, but one would be hard pressed to name an artist who made an album this strong only a few weeks before their death - or at any time of their life, for that matter." [...] When Uncut compiled Parsons' [...] "20 Greatest Tracks" [...] in their February 2013 issue, the top three - [...] "Hickory Wind," [...] "Brass Buttons," [...] and [...] "$1000 Wedding," [...] all appear on Grievous Angel.|$|E

Apple sauce has a more liquid consistency while apple butter is thicker and is more spreadable.|$|R
