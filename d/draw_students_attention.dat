40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{deal with}} a method created for {{interactive}} teaching of decimal numbers by the help of interactive whiteboards at basic schools. At present, interactive whiteboards are considered a very modern teaching tool. The amount of whiteboards at schools has increased considerably and teachers enjoy using it during their lessons. However, some teachers do not take advantages of the whiteboard and still {{use it as a}} common black board, and in that case, the interactive teaching misses its point. The teaching method suggested will be prepared in the SMART Notebook programme which is a programme designed for SmartBoard interactive whiteboards. The aim of the method is to <b>draw</b> <b>students?</b> <b>attention,</b> increase their activity, drag them into the lesson?s topic, whilst offering clearer demonstration compared to standard lessons. My further intention is to support and motivate elderly pedagogues to use the interactive whiteboards more frequently since there are no special IT knowledge and skills required. Therefore, even those teachers will manage to master such teaching tool with ease. In my opinion, not only will the interactive teaching have a positive influence on students? efforts, but it will contribute to easier absorbing and memorising the current topic studied...|$|E

It emphasizes in a note which depict real situation to support data presentation. Content analysis is used as research methodology. It analyzes the research result of the observed speech event. The data are collected from three sources: informant, events, and documents. Results of the study demonstrate {{that the use of}} Javanese language is still dominant in the learning process at primary schools in Surakarta. Many factors affect the use of Javanese language as mother tongue in classroom teaching-learning process. They are (1) balancing the learning process, so that learners are able to better understand the material presented by the teacher (2) teacher’s habit to speak Javanese language, and (3) <b>drawing</b> <b>student’s</b> <b>attention.</b> The factors underlying this phenomenon are explained by teacher and student’s lack of Indonesian language vocabulary.

40|$|Focus on form {{instruction}} {{is a kind}} of instruction that <b>draws</b> <b>students,</b> <b>attention</b> to linguistic elements as they arise incidentally in meaning based instruction.   There are different types of focus on form instruction. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of incidental focus on form on grammatical accuracy among Iranian L 2 learners. Eighty learners from Sahand language Institute in Miandoab after taking grammatical judgment test which was administered to homogenize them, were placed in two control and experimental groups. Learners in experimental group received feedback through recasting during retelling the reading passage according to principles of Jigsaw task. But learners in control group did not receive any feedback. After treatment, which lasted for eight sessions, post-test was given to both control and experimental groups to observe the difference resulted from the treatment. To be sure about the significance of the difference between post-test means of both groups, a t-test was used. The results at the end supported the hypotheses of the study and positive effect of incidental focus on form on grammatical accuracy of L 2 learners. After that, for the purpose of analyzing the effect of incidental focus on form on accuracy of pronouns, tenses, articles and propositions separately, other tests (pronoun, article, tense, proposition tests) was given to the learners in both control and experimental groups. The data collected was computed through t-test which revealed that the effect of incidental focus on form on grammatical accuracy of articles is greater than pronouns and tenses but incidental focus on form didn’t have any effect on accuracy of propositions. Pedagogical implications have been discussed. Keywords:  Focus on form, Incidental focus on form, recast, task, Accurac...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{critical}} reflection {{on the effectiveness of}} an experimental teaching tool for the college classroom. In an experimental seminar, students are asked to wander around—across campus, in the city of the college, in their respective hometowns, and in shopping malls. By describing and theorizing their own experiences in “travelogues” <b>students</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> to highly political and often contentious issues, i. e., questions of class, social position, gender, race, agency, and the body. This article critically analyzes the successes and limits of such a project.

40|$|Body Language is {{expressing a}} certain meaning {{in a kind}} of silent {{language}} by its elements such as eye contact, gestures, posture, smile, movements, and expressions which are important media through which people communicate with each other. In the EFL process, teachers can use the body to create a vivid, confidential, and realistic atmosphere in the classroom, and realize how body language plays a constructive role in educating the students' characters. Our body movements are expressing how we feel by the way we sit, stand, move, etc, rather than by words. Our bodies send out messages constantly, and often we don't recognize that we're communicating a lot more than we realize. Foreign language teachers should be able to perform and dance for joy, make a passionate gesture, movement, and countenance as an actor; should not always be a lady or a gentleman or just stand on the platform thinking that simply teachers have the reason. If the teacher can use Body Language appropriately, accurately, and proficiently to assist the teaching process in the classroom, it can not only <b>draw</b> the <b>students</b> <b>attention</b> and bring up their study interest, but also enable them to develop accurate understanding of language contents, and make them build their knowledge by themselves consciously. Lastly, Eyesight, Countenance, Gesture, and Manner are the four key attributes of Non-verbal communication.

Throughout the 1970 - 1980, the reform of public education has moved up modern political rationalities and governmental technologies intrinsically linked to developments in scientific knowledge and to the powers of expertise. Contemporary problematic of government are dependent upon technologies for governing the conduct at a distance, seeking to create locales, entities and subjectivities able to operate a regulated autonomy. The analysis is exemplified trough an archaeological investigation of central educational planning and assessment, and of local strategic planning. The thesis draw attention to the conceptual history without individual subject: analyses the complex processes of negotiation involved in the assemblage of loose networks that can bring persons, organizations and educational objectives in alignment. The argument is also exemplified trough considering the genealogy of the modem school subjectivity of the autonomous <b>student</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>attention</b> to the new technologies of the self.

To incorporate <b>student</b> <b>attention</b> element, this thesis propose an integration model of mobile learning through Augmented Reality, which the focused user is Standard 1 Primary School Student. To validate the model integration, this study has developed the AR prototype called AF-LAR (Animal Fun Learning - Augmented Reality) through smart phone technology as mobile based learning device.

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} body of literature scrutinising and theorising negative and hostile behaviour such as violence and interpersonal conflict in the nursing workplace. However, relatively little empirical work has examined the experiences of undergraduate nursing students {{in the context of}} negative workplace cultures, and even fewer studies have explored how students develop and enact strategies to counter hostile behaviours in the clinical workplace. Based on qualitative analysis of open-ended survey questions, this study explored undergraduate students 2 ̆ 7 experiences of negative behaviours in the clinical environment to identify strategies used to manage and resist such behaviours. While dominant individuals in the clinical environment sought to enforce and uphold their version of legitimacy - one where students were relegated to complete subordination - the tenacity and resourcefulness of students was evident in their attempts to counter this oppression with acts of resistance. Our findings provide new and valuable insights into organisational aggression and acts of resistance in the nursing workplace. The resistance offered by these <b>students</b> <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> to the struggles for legitimacy within institutions.
