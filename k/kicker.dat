5|$|On December 4, Michigan was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} Sugar Bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies. It was Michigan's first BCS bowl game since the 2006 season, when Michigan was defeated by the USC Trojans in the 2007 Rose Bowl. The meeting between the Hokies and the Wolverines was the first between the two schools. Virginia Tech was forced to use its third-string <b>kicker</b> during the game, as first-string <b>kicker</b> Cody Journell was suspended for the game {{as a result of an}} arrest for breaking-and-entering, while second-string <b>kicker</b> Tyler Weiss was suspended from the game and sent home for missing curfew.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the <b>kicker</b> can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the <b>kicker</b> does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the <b>kicker</b> to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

5|$|A 19-yard {{punt return}} by Mikey Henderson put Georgia into good field position. Stafford {{capitalized}} on the opportunity, completing a 26-yard pass to put Georgia into field-goal range. After three unsuccessful plays, <b>kicker</b> Brandon Coutu connected on a 51-yard field goal {{to cut the}} Virginia Tech lead to 21–6.|$|E
5|$|Auburn quarterback Jason Campbell {{completed}} 11 of 16 {{passes for}} 189yards, one touchdown, and one interception, {{and was named}} the game's most valuable player. Despite his performance, he was neither the leading scorer on his team nor the overall best performer in the game. Auburn <b>kicker</b> John Vaughn was successful on all three of his field goal attempts and also succeeded on his sole extra point kick in the game, resulting in 10Auburn points. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall completed 21 of his 38passes for 299yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. Virginia Tech <b>kicker</b> Branden Pace missed his sole field goal attempt of the game, a 23-yard kick.|$|E

5|$|Kickers {{experience}} further disadvantages when attempting {{field goals}} at CenturyLink Field. Both the stadium's proximity to Puget Sound {{and the open}} north end create winds that are challenging to gauge. Former Seahawks <b>kicker</b> Josh Brown adjusted to the winds, and he believed the moisture in the air caused trouble for others.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies within striking distance, but failures on special teams also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. <b>Kicker</b> Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate <b>kicker</b> in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Grey Cup is {{considered}} one of the finest games in Canadian football history: The Saskatchewan Roughriders defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 43–40 in the highest scoring Grey Cup game of all-time.

5|$|The Midshipmen {{began the}} second quarter with a two-play, 30-second drive that ended with a 61-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Polanco to receiver Corey Dryden, increasing the team's lead to 21–7. The Lobos responded with a rushing touchdown from running back Rodney Ferguson, but <b>kicker</b> Wes Zunker's extra point attempt was no good, making the score 21–13. Midshipmen <b>kicker</b> Geoff Blumenfeld added a 27-yard field goal to bring the score to 24–13. McKamey scored another rushing touchdown to cap off another long drive, this time taking up over five minutes of game time, but the team's two-point conversion attempt failed. Lane Jackson intercepted McKamey's pass on the Lobos final drive before half-time, ending {{the first half of}} the game with a score of 24–19 in favor of the Midshipmen.|$|E
5|$|After the punt, the Pirates {{were unable}} to obtain a first down. Three plays netted only twoyards, and ECU was forced to punt the ball away. On the ensuing drive, Boise State {{completed}} three first downs on the series. BSU <b>kicker</b> Kyle Brotzman, converted a 31yard field goal and the Broncos shrank the ECU lead further. The series went 40yards in nine plays. It took the team two minutes and 37seconds to score.|$|E
5|$|All {{the scoring}} {{in the game}} came via five field goals, and Wake Forest's <b>kicker,</b> Sam Swank, was named the game's most {{valuable}} player. By virtue of its victory, Wake Forest earned its first ACC football championship since 1970 and was awarded a bid to the 2007 Orange Bowl. Georgia Tech's loss and second-place ACC finish earned it {{a position in the}} 2007 Gator Bowl.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball, deep inside Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to continue its drive. Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in <b>kicker</b> Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E
5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and <b>kicker</b> through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{dominated}} in {{the first}} quarter of the game. Virginia Tech received the opening kickoff, but failed to capitalize on its opening drive thanks to a personal foul penalty that forced the Hokies to punt. On its first possession, Georgia moved into scoring position courtesy of a 26-yard run by Kregg Lumpkin. Failing to advance the ball further, Georgia sent in <b>kicker</b> Brandon Coutu who kicked a 39-yard field goal to give Georgia the early lead, 3–0.|$|E
