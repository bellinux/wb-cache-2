40|$|Chemotaxis {{involves}} the coordinated action of separable but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. We have hypothesized {{that these are}} mediated by separate modules that account for these processes individually and that, when combined, recreate most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells. Here, we describe a mathematical model where the modules are implemented in terms of reaction-diffusion equations. Migration and the accompanying changes in cellular morphology are demonstrated in simulations using a mechanical model of the cell cortex implemented in the level set framework. The central module is an excitable network that accounts for random migration. The response to combinations of uniform stimuli and gradients is mediated by a local excitation, global inhibition module that biases {{the direction in which}} excitability is directed. A polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and, for cells in gradients, to gradually acquire distinct sensitivity between front and back. Finally, by varying the strengths of various feedback loops in the model we obtain cellular behaviors that mirror those of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cell</b> lines...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHow cells {{regulate}} their dimensions is {{a long-standing}} question [1, 2]. In fission and budding yeast, cell-cycle progression depends on cell size, {{although it is}} still unclear how size is assessed [3 – 5]. In animals, {{it has been suggested}} that cell size is modulated primarily by the balance of external signals controlling growth and the cell cycle [1], although there is evidence of cell-autonomous control in cell cultures [6 – 9]. Regardless of whether regulation is external or cell autonomous, the role of cell-size control in the development of multicellular organisms remains unclear. Plants are a convenient system to study this question: the shoot meristem, which continuously provides new cells to form new organs, maintains a population of actively dividing and characteristically small cells for extended periods [10]. Here, we used live imaging and quantitative, 4 D image analysis to measure the sources of cell-size variability in the meristem and then used these measurements in computer simulations to show that the uniform cell sizes seen in the meristem likely require coordinated control of cell growth and cell cycle in individual cells. A genetically induced transient increase in cell size was quickly corrected by more frequent cell division, showing that the cell cycle was adjusted to maintain cell-size homeostasis. <b>Genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cell</b> sizes had little effect on tissue growth but perturbed the establishment of organ boundaries and the emergence of organ primordia. We conclude that meristem cells actively control their sizes to achieve the resolution required to pattern small-scale structures...|$|E

40|$|Somatic {{mutations}} must happen {{often during}} development {{because of the}} large number of cell divisions to expand from a single-cell zygote to a full organism. A mutation in development carries forward to all descendant cells, causing genetic mosaicism. Widespread genetic mosaicism may influence diseases that derive from a few <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells,</b> such as cancer. I show how to predict the expected amount of mosaicism and the variation in mosaicism between individuals. I then calculate the predicted risk of cancer derived from developmental mutations. The calculations show that a significant fraction of cancer in later life likely arises from developmental mutations in early life. In addition, much of the variation in the risk of cancer between individuals may arise from variation in the degree of genetic mosaicism set in early life. I also suggest that certain types of neurodegeneration, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), may derive from a small focus of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells.</b> If so, then the risk of ALS would be influenced by developmental mutations and the consequent variation in genetic mosaicism. New technologies promise the ability to measure genetic mosaicism by sampling a large number of cellular genomes within an individual.

Several studies using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have indicated that these cells have enormous therapeutic potential in HD and other disorders. Advantages of using MSCs for cell therapies include their ease of isolation, rapid propagation in culture, and favorable immunomodulatory profiles. However, the lack of consistent neuronal differentiation of transplanted MSCs has limited their therapeutic efficacy to slowing the progression of HD-like symptoms in animal models of HD. The use of MSCs which have been <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> to overexpress brain derived neurotrophic factor to enhance support of surviving cells in a rodent model of HD provides proof-of-principle that these cells may provide such prophylactic benefits. New techniques that may prove useful for cell replacement therapies in HD include the use of <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> fate-restricted <b>cells</b> to produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSCs appear to have certain advantages over the use of embryonic stem cells, including being readily available, easy to obtain, less evidence of tumor formation, and a reduced immune response following their transplantation.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} tenets of oncology is that tumors arise from stem cells. In the colon, stem cells are thought to reside {{at the base of}} crypts. In the early stages of tumorigenesis, however, dysplastic cells are routinely found at the luminal surface of the crypts whereas the cells at the bases of these same crypts appear morphologically normal. To understand this discrepancy, we evaluated the molecular characteristics of cells isolated from the bases and orifices of the same crypts in small colorectal adenomas. We found that the dysplastic cells at the tops of the crypts often exhibited genetic alterations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and neoplasia-associated patterns of gene expression. In contrast, cells located at the base of these same crypts did not contain such alterations and were not clonally related to the contiguous transformed cells above them. These results imply that development of adenomatous polyps proceeds through a top-down mechanism. <b>Genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells</b> in the superficial portions of the mucosae spread laterally and downward to form new crypts that first connect to preexisting normal crypts and eventually replace them...|$|R

OSCC arising from the grafted skin have been described, however, it is still unclear whether primary and second tumours have a common clonal origin. By screening mitochondrial DNA D-loop region (mtDNA), we evaluated the clonal relationship between the primary OSCC and the second neoplastic features appearing in the skin graft in three patients.

40|$|Abstract: Comparative {{oncology}} is {{a branch}} of comparative pathology that is relatively new biomedical discipline. The need for a comparative research into tumors across different groups of living beings has arisen from a relatively old notion that most of multicellular organisms may develop tumors. This apparently very simple fact indicate the possible nature of tumor growth, which {{can be associated with}} the basic features of the cells of multicellular organisms such as the division, development, growth and differentiation of cells and tissues. Regarding this, tumor growth is commonly defined as a fundamental disorder in the regulation of cell division, growth, differentiation and cell socialization. In all vertebrates, neoplasia is a disease in which <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells</b> escape from the normal cell-cycle regulation and monitoring of the immune system. This results in a persistent, expanding or infiltrating growth without control and the architecture of the normal tissue. Concerning the facts that mechanisms of cell sociability control and anti-tumor immune monitoring might be different in different group of animals, especially, in different classes of vertebrates, development of disciplines such as comparative oncology and comparative tumor immunology can be of great scientific importance...|$|R

HPRT-negative clones were obtained at a frequency of approximately 1 per 520 G 418 r clones. Southern analysis and the polymerase chain reaction were used to demonstrate that 3 of 36 of the 6 -TG-resistant clones had the desired 4 -bp insertion without any other disruption of the HPRT locus.

40|$|The {{development}} of safe vectors for gene therapy requires fail-safe mechanisms to terminate therapy or remove <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells.</b> The ideal “suicide switch” would be nonimmunogenic and nontoxic when uninduced {{and able to}} trigger cell death independent of tissue type or cell cycle stage. By using chemically induced dimerization, we have developed powerful death switches based on the cysteine proteases, caspase- 1 ICE (interleukin- 1 β converting enzyme) and caspase- 3 YAMA. In both cases, aggregation of the target protein is achieved by a nontoxic lipid-permeable dimeric FK 506 analog that binds to the attached FK 506 -binding proteins, FKBPs. We find that intracellular cross-linking of caspase- 1 or caspase- 3 is sufficient to trigger rapid apoptosis in a Bcl-xL-independent manner, suggesting that these conditional proapoptotic molecules can bypass intracellular checkpoint genes, such as Bcl-xL, that limit apoptosis. Because these chimeric molecules are derived from autologous proteins, they should be nonimmunogenic and thus ideal for long-lived gene therapy vectors. These properties should also make chemically induced apoptosis useful for developmental studies, for treating hyperproliferative disorders, and for developing animal models {{to a wide variety}} of diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} "field cancerization" was first {{introduced}} by Slaughter in 1953 when studying the presence of histologically abnormal tissue surrounding oral squamous cell carcinoma. It was proposed to explain the development of multiple primary tumors and locally recurrent cancer. Organ systems in which field cancerization has been described since then are: head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx), lung, vulva, esophagus, cervix, breast, skin, colon, and bladder. Recent molecular studies support the carcinogenesis model in which {{the development of a}} field with <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells</b> plays a central role. An important clinical implication is that fields often remain after the surgery for the primary tumor and may lead to new cancers, designated presently as "a second primary tumor" or "local recurrence," depending on the exact site and time interval.

We used cultured melanocytes derived from human skin samples as a model system for such investigations. Normal melanocytes have a very well defined shape consisting of a cell body and two dendrites arranged 180 ° relative to each other. In contrast, neurofibromin 1 -melanocytes (NF 1 -melanocytes) have up to a 50 [*]% reduction of neurofibromin 1, which results in an altered morphology {{that can be easily}} measured. NF 1 -melanocytes deviate from the defined structure of normal melanocytes by forming more than two dendrites per cell. We show that morphology consequences of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> melanocytes can be canceled if cells interact with substrates microstructured by stripes that apply mechanophysical signals in the form of physical topography. The strength of the mechanophysical signal was varied systematically by increasing the height of the microstructures. Melanocytes respond to surface topographical features that are larger than 50 nm and have lateral confinements smaller 4 μm. The response of normal and NF 1 -melanocytes to different topographies was analyzed quantitatively by determining density distributions for the number of dendrites per cell, the angles between dendrites, and the orientation imprinted in the substrate. The synthesis of melanin, a pigment produced by melanocytes, differs in the case of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> NF 1 - and normal melanocytes.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

40|$|All insect ovaries are {{composed}} of functional units called ovarioles, which contain sequentially developing egg chambers. The number of ovarioles varies between and within species. Ovariole number is an important determinant of fecundity and thus affects individual fitness. Although Drosophila oogenesis has been inten-sively studied, the genetic and cellular basis for determination of ovariole number remains unknown. Ovar-iole formation begins during larval development with the morphogenesis of terminal filament cells (TFCs) into stacks called terminal filaments (TFs). We induced changes in ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster by <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> <b>cell</b> size and cell number in the TFC population, and analyzed TF morphogenesis in these ovaries to understand the cellular basis for the changes in ovariole number. Increasing TFC size contributed to higher ovariole number by increasing TF number. Similarly, increasing total TFC number led to higher ovariole number via an increase in TF number. By analyzing ovarian morphogenesis in another Drosophila species we showed that TFC number regulation is a target of evolutionary change that affects ovariole number. In contrast, temperature-dependent plasticity in ovariole numberwas due to changes in cell–cell sorting during TFmorpho-genesis, rather than changes in cell size or cell number. We have thus identified two distinct developmental pro-cesses that regulate ovariole number: establishment of total TFC number, and TFC sorting during TF morphogenesis.

These foci occur spontaneously in early-passage NIH 3 T 3 cells grown to confluency in 10 % calf serum (CS) but are not seen in cultures grown to confluency in 2 % CS. However, repeated passage of the cells at low density in 2 % CS gives rise to an adapted population that grows to increasingly higher saturation densities and produces large numbers of foci in 2 % CS. The increased saturation density of the adapted population in 2 % CS is retained upon repeated passage in 10 % CS, but the number and size of the foci produced in 2 % CS gradually decrease under this regime. Clonal analysis confirms that the focus-forming potential of most if not all of the cells in a population increases in response to a continuously applied growth constraint, although {{only a small fraction of}} the population may actually form foci in a given assay. The acquired capacity for focus formation varies widely in clones derived from the adapted population and changes in diverse ways upon further passage of the clones. We propose that the adaptive changes result from progressive selection of successive phenotypic variations in growth capacity that occur spontaneously. The process designated progressive state selection resolves the apparent dichotomy between spontaneous mutation with selection on the one hand and induction on the other, by introducing selection among fluctuating states or metabolic patterns rather than among <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Growth {{of cancer}} cells {{results from the}} {{disturbance}} {{of positive and negative}} growth control mechanisms and the prolonged survival of these <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells</b> due to the failure of cellular suicide programs. Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified Raf family serine/threonine kinases B-Raf and C-Raf as major mediators of cell survival. C-Raf cooperates with Bcl- 2 /Bcl-X L in suppression of apoptosis by a mechanism that involves targeting of C-Raf to the outer mitochondrial membrane and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. However, apoptosis suppression by C-Raf also occurs in cells lacking expression of Bad or Bcl- 2. Results Here we show that {{even in the absence of}} Bcl- 2 /Bcl-X L, mitochondria-targeted C-Raf inhibits cytochrome c release and caspase activation induced by growth factor withdrawal. To clarify the mechanism of Bcl- 2 independent survival control by C-Raf at the mitochondria a search for novel mitochondrial targets was undertaken that identified voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a mitochondrial protein (porin) involved in exchange of metabolites for oxidative phosphorylation. C-Raf forms a complex with VDAC in vivo and blocks reconstitution of VDAC channels in planar bilayer membranes in vitro. Conclusion We propose that this interaction may be responsible for the Raf-induced inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria in growth factor starved cells. Moreover, C-Raf kinase-induced VDAC inhibition may regulate the metabolic function of mitochondria and mediate the switch to aerobic glycolysis that is common to cancer cells. </p...|$|R

These findings define a unique approach for analyzing the effects of mutations of any genes that are expressed in mast cells, including embryonic lethal mutations, in vitro or in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAll insect ovaries are {{composed}} of functional units called ovarioles, which contain sequentially developing egg chambers. The number of ovarioles varies between and within species. Ovariole number is an important determinant of fecundity and thus affects individual fitness. Although Drosophila oogenesis has been intensively studied, the genetic and cellular basis for determination of ovariole number remains unknown. Ovariole formation begins during larval development with the morphogenesis of terminal filament cells (TFCs) into stacks called terminal filaments (TFs). We induced changes in ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster by <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> <b>cell</b> size and cell number in the TFC population, and analyzed TF morphogenesis in these ovaries to understand the cellular basis for the changes in ovariole number. Increasing TFC size contributed to higher ovariole number by increasing TF number. Similarly, increasing total TFC number led to higher ovariole number via an increase in TF number. By analyzing ovarian morphogenesis in another Drosophila species we showed that TFC number regulation is a target of evolutionary change that affects ovariole number. In contrast, temperature-dependent plasticity in ovariole number was due to changes in cell–cell sorting during TF morphogenesis, rather than changes in cell size or cell number. We have thus identified two distinct developmental processes that regulate ovariole number: establishment of total TFC number, and TFC sorting during TF morphogenesis. Our {{data suggest that the}} genetic changes underlying species-specific ovariole number may alter the total number of TFCs available to contribute to TF formation. This work provides for the first time specific and quantitative developmental tools to investigate the evolution of a highly conserved reproductive structure...|$|R
40|$|Diploids of {{the yeast}} Hansenula wingei are nonagglutinative {{and do not}} form zygotes in mixed {{cultures}} with either sexually agglutinative haploid mating type. However, a low frequency of diploid x haploid cell fusions (about 10 - 3) is detectable by prototrophic selection. This frequency of rare diploid x haploid matings is not increased after the diploid culture is induced for sexual agglutination. Therefore, we conclude that genes that repress mating {{are different from those}} that repress sexual agglutination. ——Six prototrophs isolated from one diploid x haploid cross had an average DNA value (µg DNA per 108 cells) of 6. 19, compared to 2. 53 and 4. 35 for the haploid and diploid strains, respectively. Four prototrophs were clearly cell-fusion products because they contained genes from both the diploid and the haploid partners. However, genetic analysis of the prototrophs yielded results inconsistent with triploid meiosis; all six isolates yielded a 2 : 2 segregation for the mating-type alleles and linked genes. ——Mitotic segregation of monosomic (2 n- 1) cells lacking one homolog of the chromosome carrying the mating-type locus is proposed to explain the rare production of sexually active cells in the diploid cultures. Fusion between such monosomic cells and normal haploids is thought to have produced 3 n- 1 cells, disomic for the chromosome carrying the mating-type locus. We conclude that in the diploid strain we studied, the physiological mechanisms repressing sexual agglutination and conjugation function efficiently, but events occuring during mitosis lead to a low frequency of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells</b> in the population...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} DNA {{integrity}} in mammalian cells {{is important to}} maintain the cell homeostasis and prevent neoplastic transformation. Control of cell division and cell death permits repair or elimination of damaged cells. Since asbestos fibers can produce DNA damage, chromosome alterations and apoptosis in several sorts of cells, including mesothelial cells, {{it was interesting to}} investigate cell cycle disturbances in rat pleural mesothelial cells (RPMC) treated with asbestos fibers. Cell cycle analyses were performed in RPMC exposed to crocidolite (10 and 20 �g/cm 2) and chrysotile (5 and 10 �g/cm 2) for different times (4 to 48 h). Both fiber types entailed a G 2 /M accumulation in agreement with a delay in the mitosis course. Chrysotile fibers produced a G 0 /G 1 accumulation associated with a time-dependent p 53 and p 21 expression. Crocidolite exposure resulted in a delay in the G 1 /S transition paralleling a low rate of p 53 expression. These results are in agreement with a DNA damaging potential of asbestos fibers since similar results were found following RPMC exposure to � rays. In asbestos-treated RPMC, a low rate of apoptosis was found suggesting that RPMC may follow a DNA repair pathway that could contribute to the formation of DNA lesions. In addition, the cell cycle disturbances at the G 2 /M checkpoint suggest that <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells</b> have progressed through the cycle and support the already published findings on the ability of asbestos fibers to impair cell division.

40|$|Studies of {{prostate}} cancer pathogenesis and development of new therapies have been hampered {{by a lack of}} appropriate mouse models. We have generated PSA-Cre-ER(T 2) mice that express the tamoxifen-dependent Cre-ER(T 2) recombinase selectively in prostatic epithelium, thus allowing us to target floxed genes selectively in epithelial cells of fully differentiated prostate of adult mice and to modulate the number of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> <b>cells.</b> Our present mouse model, in which prostate carcinogenesis is initiated through Cre-ER(T 2) -mediated somatic biallelic ablation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN after puberty, closely mimics the course of human cancer formation. Indeed, mutant mice developed prostate epithelium hyperplasia within 4 weeks after PTEN ablation and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in all lobes within 2 - 3 months, with the highest incidence in the dorsolateral lobe, which is considered to be the most similar to the peripheral zone of the human prostate, in which adenocarcinoma is preferentially localized. Eight to 10 months after PTEN ablation some PINs of the dorsolateral lobe had progressed to adenocarcinoma, but no distant metastases were found up to 20 months after PTEN ablation, indicating that progression to metastasis requires an additional mutation or mutations. Interestingly, monoallelic Cre-ER(T 2) -mediated PTEN ablation in epithelial cells of adult prostate also generated focal hyperplasia and PINs, but exclusively in the dorsolateral lobe, and in much lower number and after a longer latency. However, no progression to adenocarcinoma was observed. Because PTEN expression was undetectable in epithelial cells from these PINs, loss of PTEN function appears to act as a permissive event for uncontrolled cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in tumor biology {{have revealed that}} {{a detailed analysis of}} the complex interactions of tumor cells with their adjacent microenvironment (tumor stroma) is mandatory {{in order to understand the}} various mechanisms involved in tumor growth and the development of metastasis. The mutual interactions between tumor cells and cellular and non-cellular components (extracellular matrix = ECM) of the tumor microenvironment will eventually lead to a loss of tissue homeostasis and promote tumor development and progression. Thus, interactions of <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> tumor <b>cells</b> and the ECM on the one hand and reactive non-neoplastic cells on the other hand essentially control most aspects of tumorigenesis such as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), migration, invasion (i. e. migration through connective tissue), metastasis formation, neovascularisation, apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drug resistance. In this mini-review we will focus on these issues that were recently raised by two review articles in CCS...|$|R
