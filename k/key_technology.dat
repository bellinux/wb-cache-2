25|$|The {{company is}} {{headquartered}} at Whitacre Tower in downtown Dallas, Texas. On June 27, 2008, AT {{announced that it}} would move its corporate headquarters from downtown San Antonio to One AT Plaza in downtown Dallas. The company said that it moved to gain better access to its customers and operations throughout the world, and to the <b>key</b> <b>technology</b> partners, suppliers, innovation and human resources needed as it continues to grow, domestically and internationally. AT Inc. previously relocated its corporate headquarters to San Antonio from St. Louis, Missouri, in 1992, when it was then named Southwestern Bell Corporation. The company's Telecom Operations group, which serves residential and regional business customers in 22 U.S. states, remains in San Antonio. Atlanta, Georgia, continues to be the headquarters for AT Mobility, with significant offices in Redmond, Washington, the former home of AT Wireless. Bedminster, New Jersey, is the headquarters for the company's Global Business Services group and AT Labs.

After the shooting {{down of the}} U-2 piloted by [...] Gary Powers in 1960, {{a number of different}} concepts were proposed as alternatives. Kelly Johnson, the leader of Skunk Works, {{developed the}} concept of a long-range drone that used much of the A-12's technology. In October 1962 the CIA and the US Air Force instructed Lockheed to study a high-speed, high-altitude drone concept. Johnson specified speeds of Mach 3.3–3.5, an operational altitude of , and a range of [...] It was intended to make a one-way trip, eject its camera payload {{at the end of the}} mission for recovery, then self-destruct. [...] It had a double-delta wing similar to the A-12's wing design.

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of the Skylon's design is its powerplant, known as Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of liquid air cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around Mach5.5 (1,700m/s), [...] altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the <b>key</b> <b>technology</b> for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.|$|E
500|$|As in Myst and Riven, the {{developers}} used live-action sequences instead of computer-generated actors and props; Irish stated that using computer graphics would have reminded players {{they were in}} a game, [...] "which would wreck the immersion that is so critical to the Myst games". Live actors were filmed on a blue screen and then placed in the digital environments using chroma <b>key</b> <b>technology.</b> Before any shooting could begin, all the sets were constructed and filled with props the actors could use, costumes for all the characters were fashioned, and each scene was plotted out by storyboard. Rand Miller returned to play Atrus, a role he had filled since the first Myst game. Brad Dourif, a professional actor best known for the Child's Play films, agreed to play Saavedro because he was a huge Myst fan. Dourif noted that acting for a game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player or interact with the game environment. Other actors included Maria Galante as Atrus' wife Catherine, and Greg Uhler's daughter Audrey in a cameo as Atrus' daughter Yeesha. Preparation for the video shoots took four months; filming the scenes took just seven days. Uhler noted that the video was one aspect of Myst that Presto [...] "did wrong"; because high-definition video cameras were not used, the resulting video was not as crisp as developers had hoped.|$|E

[...] The shared technology included the cavity magnetron (<b>key</b> <b>technology</b> at the time for highly effective radar; the American historian James Phinney Baxter III later called [...] "the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores"), the design for the VT fuze, details of Frank Whittle's jet engine and the Frisch–Peierls memorandum describing the feasibility of an atomic bomb.
