It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge {{that they need to}} nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible <b>heatwave</b> hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico is set {{during a}} <b>heatwave</b> that {{occurred}} in Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948's abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, {{which led to the}} film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an attempt to get the first successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an attempt to get two and a half minutes of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw as poor direction. Cornelius left Ealing Studios after working on Passport to Pimlico and did not work for the studio again.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:  <b>Heatwaves</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} climate-related risks for Australians. The extreme heat in Melbourne that plagued the 2014 Australian Open Tennis Tournament and the record-breaking heat in large areas of Queensland this summer reminded us of the risks that <b>heatwaves</b> pose. Coming on the heels of a record-breaking summer of 2012 / 2013, this summer’s heat is part of a longer- term trend towards hotter weather. The link between climate change and more extreme <b>heatwaves</b> is clear. This report begins by exploring the long-term observations of hot weather to show how the nature of <b>heatwaves</b> is changing—their length, their frequency, their intensity and when they are occurring. We then describe what these trends mean for Australians—their impacts on our health and well-being, infrastructure, agriculture, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems. But <b>heatwaves</b> don’t occur in isolation from other factors and their interactions with events such as droughts can exacerbate the effects of extreme heat. Finally, we take a look at the future—how the risks of extreme heat change as the Earth warms further, and what we need to do to stabilize the climate and avoid the more severe projections for future <b>heatwaves...</b>|$|R

25|$|June 2015 was {{incredibly}} {{hot and humid}} in Karachi, being 1.8°C warmer than an average June in the metropolis. Between 18 June and 23 June 2015, a severe <b>heatwave</b> struck the city; during these days, the maximum temperature remained {{in the range of}} 40°C to 45°C whereas the minimum temperature was between 30°C and 33°C. Due to humidity levels ranging between 40–50%, coupled with high temperature, the heat indices recorded in the city were above 50°C during these days. The highest temperature during this <b>heatwave</b> was 45°C (reached first time since 8 June 2000, when the temperature had soared to 45.5°C), recorded on 20 June 2015, while the minimum temperature on this day was 31°C.

40|$|Background: Vietnam suffers {{consequences}} of global warming. There is limited {{data of the}} relationship between weather, extreme heat and potential mental health problems. It is therefore crucial to study heat-related mental illnesses and to establish good solutions with relevant adaptations to global warming. The adaptation measures should give attention to people that live in areas facing annual extreme weather, and protecting health in general and more specifically mental health of citizens. The study aimed to examine relationships between weather patterns, extreme heat or <b>heatwaves,</b> and mental disorders, and to investigate factors contributing to increased vulnerability and susceptibility. Methods: The thesis includes a systematic review and a hospital-based study using data from the Hanoi Mental Hospital for five years (2008 – 2012), with mental disorders diagnosed by ICD 10 (F 00 - 99) to estimate the effects of weather variation, seasonality, increased temperatures, and <b>heatwaves</b> on hospital admissions for depression and other mental disorders. A negative binomial regression model accounting for yearly study period, time trends, and day of the week was used to analyze the relationship between seasonality, <b>heatwaves,</b> and monthly and daily mental disorder hospitalizations. Results: Our findings showed (i) a general tendency for more admissions between May and December, with a seasonal bi-annual high between May-June and November-December, and elevated ambient temperature was significantly related to increasing admissions for depressive disorders; (ii) the number of hospital cases for mental disorders increased in the summer seasone specially in June, and two percent of cases emerged during elevated temperature of one degree Celsius; and (iii) when compared with non-heatwave periods, <b>heatwaves</b> amounted to increasing risks for admission for the whole group of mental disorders (F 00 - 79), and admissions for mental disorders among residents in rural communities and in the elderly population increased significantly during <b>heatwaves.</b> Conclusion: There were associations between hospital admissions for depression and other mental disorders and seasonality, weather patterns, elevated temperatures, and <b>heatwaves.</b> The associations grew stronger with the length of the <b>heatwaves</b> and particularly the elderly appeared more sensitive to seasonality, hot weather and <b>heatwaves...</b>|$|R
40|$|Rising global {{temperatures}} are causing {{increases in the}} frequency and severity of extreme climatic events such as floods, droughts, and <b>heatwaves.</b> Here, we analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity and duration of <b>heatwaves,</b> and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009, {{using data from the}} India Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0. 5 °C over this period, with statistically significant increases in <b>heatwaves.</b> Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146 % increase in the probability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing, low-latitude countries such as India where <b>heatwaves</b> will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures may cause great increases in heat-related mortality, and support efforts of governments and international organizations to build-up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more and more severe <b>heatwaves...</b>|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{intensity}} of marine <b>heatwaves</b> has caused widespread mass coral bleaching events, threatening {{the integrity and}} functional diversity of coral reefs. Here we demonstrate the role of inter-ocean coupling in amplifying thermal stress on reefs in the poorly studied southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO), through a robust 215 -year (1795 – 2010) geochemical coral proxy sea surface temperature (SST) record. We show that marine <b>heatwaves</b> affecting the SEIO {{are linked to the}} behaviour of the Western Pacific Warm Pool on decadal to centennial timescales, and are most pronounced when an anomalously strong zonal SST gradient between the western and central Pacific co-occurs with strong La Niña’s. This SST gradient forces large-scale changes in heat flux that exacerbate SEIO <b>heatwaves.</b> Better understanding of the zonal SST gradient in the Western Pacific is expected to improve projections of the frequency of extreme SEIO <b>heatwaves</b> and their ecological impacts on the important cora...|$|R
25|$|According to {{writings}} of the period, Thomas Heywood {{had been living in}} Clerkenwell since 1623 and it was there, at St. James's Church that he was buried eighteen years later. Because of the uncertainty regarding the year of his birth, his age can only be estimated, but he was likely in his late sixties, possibly having reached seventy. The date of the burial, 16 August 1641, the only documented date, also appears in a number of reference books as Heywood's death date, although he may actually have died days earlier. It may be presumed, however, that due to a possible August <b>heatwave,</b> the burial occurred on an expedited basis.|$|E

The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying to conjure up an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.|$|E

Paramount said that the <b>heatwave</b> in Europe negatively impacted the weekend's results. Beyond debuted at first place in 16 of them and recorded the biggest opening weekend ever for the franchise in 17 markets, including Russia, Taiwan and Thailand. It debuted in third place overall at the international box office, behind Skiptrace and The Legend of Tarzan. Beyond set numerous records in IMAX theaters. Led by very strong results in the UK and Russia, it grossed an estimated weekend of $3.2 million on 184 screens besting Star Trek Into Darkness $2.8 million debut. In its second weekend, it fell drastically by 57% earning $13 million. As a result, it slipped into sixth place at the box office. After fluctuating {{up and down the}} charts, it finally topped the international box office in its seventh weekend due to a robust debut in China and remained at the top for the second weekend in a row.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of quality wine grapes {{is sensitive to}} <b>heatwaves,</b> especially at key phenostages such as flowering and ripening. Climatological models of <b>heatwaves</b> with application in viticulture need to account for (a) a range of meteorological variables, (b) intensity, (c) duration and (d) timing of events. The meteorological variable most commonly associated with <b>heatwaves</b> is maximum temperature; however, high minimum temperatures associated with <b>heatwaves</b> are also relevant for viticulture. Intensity should be expressible as either exceeding a categorical threshold such as 35 °C or a relative threshold such as the 90 th percentile. In addition to the chance of <b>heatwaves</b> of a given intensity and duration for the growing season (September to April), viticulturists are interested in monthly and fortnightly windows {{to account for the}} timing of critical phenostages. The model presented here is an attempt to meet these four requirements. The model is stochastic and incorporates seasonality and daily persistence of temperature through a Markov process and implies that frequency (or the return period) of <b>heatwaves</b> decreases (increases) geometrically with each additional day of duration. The final model is expressed as a simple equation involving a single location-specific parameter, M, which relates to the maritime influence. The model was tested over the viticultural regions of southeastern Australia by comparison with observed data, and by assessing the physical and climatological meaning of parameter M. Cross-validated model estimates of annual frequency of <b>heatwaves</b> were in good agreement with observations. The parameter M proved robust and physically meaningful: it is location-specific, its isopleths have the qualitative impression of sea-breeze or maritime influence and it is quantitatively related to the skewness of the summertime maximum temperature distribution.

Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective study. Data were obtained from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care and from the Catalan Meteorological Service. The outcome was first emergency hospitalizations due to coronary heart disease, stroke, or heart failure. Exposures were: cold spells; cold spells and 3 or 7 subsequent days; and <b>heatwaves.</b> Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using the self-controlled case series method. We accounted for age, time trends, and air pollutants; results were shown by age groups, gender or cardiovascular event type. Results There were 22, 611 cardiovascular hospitalizations in winter and 17, 017 in summer between 2006 and 2013. The overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalizations significantly increased during cold spells (IRR[*]=[*] 1. 120; CI 95 %: 1. 10 – 1. 30) and the effect was even stronger in the 7 days subsequent to the cold spell (IRR[*]=[*] 1. 29; CI 95 %: 1. 22 – 1. 36).
