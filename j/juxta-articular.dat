50|$|Treatment is difficult, often {{requiring}} a joint replacement. Spontaneous improvement occasionally happens and some <b>juxta-articular</b> lesions do not progress to collapse. Other treatments include immobilization and osteotomy of the femur. Cancellous bone grafts are of little help.|$|E
50|$|Early {{on there}} is {{flattening}} of articular surfaces, thinning of cartilage with osteophyte (spur) formation. In <b>juxta-articular</b> lesions without symptoms, there is dead bone and marrow separated from living bone by {{a line of}} dense collagen. Microscopic cysts form, fill with necrotic material and there is massive necrosis with replacement by cancellous bone with collapse of the lesions.|$|E

As a treatment for leprosy, he advocated a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, camphor and guaiacol.|$|E
50|$|There is the {{potential}} for worsening of DON for any diving where there might be a need for decompression, experimental or helium diving. Physically stressful diving should probably be restricted, both in sport diving and work diving due to the possibility of unnecessary stress to the joint. Any diving should be less than 40 feet/12 meters. These risks are affected by the degree of disability and by the type of lesion (<b>juxta-articular</b> or shaft).|$|E
50|$|If the diver has {{not been}} exposed to {{excessive}} depth and decompression and presents as DON, {{there may be a}} predisposition for the condition. Diving should be restricted to shallow depths. Divers who have suffered from DON are at increased risk of future fracture of a <b>juxta-articular</b> lesion during a dive, and may face complications with future joint replacements. Because of the young age of the population normally affected, little data is available regarding joint replacement complications.|$|E
50|$|A few {{patients}} noted {{some improvement}} when treated with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone), whereas others experienced worsening of the pain. Weinberg et al. treated two patients with <b>juxta-articular</b> Dercum’s disease with intralesional injections of methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol). The patients experienced a dramatic improvement.The {{mechanism for the}} pain-reducing ability of corticosteroids in some conditions is unknown. One theory is that they inhibit the effects of substances, such as histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. As the aetiology of Dercum’s disease is probably not inflammatory, it is plausible that the improvement some of the patients experience when using corticosteroids is not caused by an anti-inflammatory effect.|$|E
50|$|Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a {{significant}} occupational hazard, occurring in 50% of commercial Japanese divers, 65% of Hawaiian fishermen and 16% of commercial and caisson divers in the UK.Its relationship to compressed air is strong in that it may follow a single exposure to compressed air, may occur with no history of DCS but is usually associated with significant compressed air exposure. The distribution of lesions differs {{with the type of}} exposure - the <b>juxta-articular</b> lesions being more common in caisson workers than in divers.There is a definite relationship between length of time exposed to extreme depths and the percentage of divers with bone lesions. Evidence does not suggest that dysbaric osteonecrosis is {{a significant}} risk in recreational scuba diving.|$|E
30|$|Differential {{diagnosis}} of intraspinal extradural mass lesions includes ligamentum flavum cyst, <b>juxta-articular</b> cysts (ganglion and synovial cysts), arachnoid cyst, perineural cyst, dermoid cyst, infectious cyst, schwannoma, meningioma, and metastasis or nontumorous-type mass lesions including neurofibromas, fibrous dysplasia, ependymal cyst, and rheumatoid arthritis pannus [15, 20, 23]. The nomenclature of cysts in the spinal canal is somewhat unclear in the literature. Most intraspinal cysts reported are <b>juxta-articular</b> cysts.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the radiographic and MR appearance of idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis {{of the hip}}. Materials and Methods: Radiographs and MR images of 15 patients with idiopathic synovial osteochondromatosis of the hip were assessed. The former were analysed {{in terms of the}} presence of 1) <b>juxta-articular</b> calcified and / or ossified bodies, 2) osteophytes, 3) bone erosion, 4) <b>juxta-articular</b> osteopenia, and 5) joint space narrowing, while for the latter, analysis focused on 1) the configuration of intra-articular bodies, 2) bone erosion, 3) synovial thickening, 4) conglomeration of intra-articular bodies, and 5) extra-articular extension. Results: At hip radiography, <b>juxta-articular</b> calcified and / or ossified bodies were seen in 12 of the 15 patients (80 %), bone erosion in eight (53 %), osteophytes in seven (47 %), <b>juxta-articular</b> osteopenia in five (33 %) and joint space narrowing in five (33 %).

Here we present a case of osteoid osteoma of neck of talus which was presented as ankle pain. It puzzled us until MRI was done. Diagnostic dilemma and delay can be avoided by high index of suspicion. The patient was treated with open removal of the tumor. We also present brief review of literature about <b>juxta-articular,</b> subperiosteal osteoid osteoma which is uncommon from the typical osteoid osteoma occurring elsewhere in the body.

30|$|Synovial cysts {{are defined}} as <b>juxta-articular</b> fluid {{collections}} that are lined by synovial cells [1, 2]. The synovial lining is the characteristic histological feature that distinguishes them from other <b>juxta-articular</b> fluid collections [1, 2, 6, 8]. From a pathophysiological point of view a synovial cyst represents a focal extension of joint fluid that may extend in any direction and may, or may not, communicate with the joint. They can be encountered as incidental findings in MR examinations, but regarding their aetiology, they {{have been associated with}} other underlying knee disorders such as osteoarthritis, trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [1, 2, 4 – 6]. Although usually asymptomatic, they can manifest with pain and swelling. The most common examples of a synovial cyst in the knee are the popliteal cyst (Baker’s cyst) and the proximal tibiofibular joint (PTFJ) synovial cyst.|$|E
40|$|Ibanez {{and colleagues}} [1] {{report on the}} ‘rational ’ use of gluco {{corticoids}} (GCs) {{in the management of}} early arthritis.

Although this article is notable for examining the eff ect of GCs on BMD at fi ve anatomic sites, a ‘rational ’ use of GCs for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still elusive.

40|$|A {{group of}} {{patients}} were studied 10 years after stopping work in a high-pressure environment. Radiographs of their long bones showed little change during the period, but only two of 12 scintigrams were normal. The 10 abnormal scintigrams contained 18 “hot-spots ” which were not always associated with an abnormal radiographic appearance; {{the findings suggest that}} some lesions may never become visible on a radiograph. A reactive or repair process associated with these lesions may be prolonged and may not be beneficial, as structural failure ofthejoint may subsequently occur. Prognosis should therefore be guarded. Caisson disease of bone remains a potentially serious hazard for men working in a hyperbaric environment. The condition is characterised by regions of necrosis in the bone and marrow of the long bones, especially the humerus, femur and tibia; these are sited in the <b>juxta-articular</b> area or in the shaft.
