5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. <b>His</b> <b>palms</b> are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
25|$|Brennan Mulwray (Victor Webster) is an Elemental Electrical {{with the}} ability to {{generate}} enough electricity from his body to power a small city. He can also shoot powerful electrical bolts from <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> which, if fired downward, are capable of launching him high into the air. His primary weakness is water. Before Adam Kane found Mulwray, he was a thief. Mason Eckhart captured him and used him to hunt down the other New Mutants. However, Mulwray escaped and managed to join Mutant X along with Emma DeLauro.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{was careful}} with his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on <b>his</b> <b>palms.</b>|$|E

A pale, androgynous man, {{he is a member of}} the Ōtsutsuki clan who was the reason Kaguya created the Zetsu Army for, who comes to Earth to plant a new Shinju as the one he used is dying from using up its world's resources. Momoshiki possesses both a pair of Byakugan and Rinnegan, the latter located on <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> which he uses to absorb and release ninjutsu. He also consumes red pills that enhances his abilities. Having apparently captured Gyuki from Killer Bee, Momoshiki and his partner Kinshiki come to Konohagakure with the objective of capturing Kurama from Naruto. The two manage to abduct Naruto to their dimension after destroying the Chunin Exams stadium, but before they could finish the extraction process, the pair are confronted by Boruto, Sasuke, and the four Kage. Overwhelmed, Momoshiki consumes a makeshift red pill from Kinshiki's body, making him even stronger with another Rinnegan appearing on his forehead. However, he is ultimately killed by Naruto and Boruto's combined Rasengan. But Momoshiki used his final living moments to have a private discussion with Boruto by freezing time, noting the untapped potential the boy possesses while cryptically warning him of the tribulations he will face in his future. Momoshiki is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and by Xander Mobus in the English dub.|$|E

2500|$|The Hornpipe mimics {{a sailor}} in her majesty's navy doing work aboard ship: hauling rope, sliding on the rollicking deck, and getting his paycheck, and {{has quite a}} lot of detail {{involved}} that portrays the character (e.g. the dancer does not touch <b>his</b> <b>palms,</b> assumed to be dirty, on his uniform). Performed in a British sailor's uniform, its name derives from the accompanying instrument, the hornpipe. [...] It is performed to tunes such as Crossing the Minch, Jackie Tar, My Love She’s But a Lassie Yet and Yankee Doodle Dandy.|$|E
2500|$|Chichele died on 12 April 1443. He {{is buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral, in a [...] "cadaver tomb" [...] between the upper choir and the choir ambulatory, {{adjacent}} to the north-east transept. The neighbouring gateway, from the transept into the choir, {{is known as the}} 'Chichele Gate'. His elaborate and colourful tomb, built many years before his death, depicts his naked corpse on the lower level, whilst on the upper level he is depicted resplendent in archiepiscopal vesture, <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> together in prayer.

He has long al-masrubah which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders.

Goku is depicted as carefree, cheerful and friendly when at ease, but quickly serious and strategic-minded when in battle. He is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature , in which Goku launches a blue energy blast from <b>his</b> <b>palms.</b> Also pure of heart, Goku has frequently granted mercy to his enemies, which has often earned him additional allies in the process (though has also resulted in others taking advantage of his kindness), and he is one of the few who can ride the magic cloud called which was another element adapted from Journey to the West.|$|E
2500|$|The , , {{is one of}} the Seven Warlords of the Sea; {{the only}} one with a {{reputation}} for complete obedience to the World Government, when in fact he is an officer of the Revolutionary Army. The power of the Paramecia-type [...] allows <b>his</b> <b>palms</b> to repel anything, from physical objects such as people or air to abstracts such as pain and fatigue. He can use this ability to safely transport himself or others over long distances. Kuma is the model for the , a class of experimental cyborgs created by the Government. Their bodies are made of a substance harder than steel, and [...] they can shoot powerful blasts from their mouths that can melt metal. The other Pacifista look just like Kuma, sharing his towering, bear-like stature, but lack the Paw-Paw Fruit's ability. Instead, they possess the ability to shoot laser beams from their palms. At some point during his gradual conversion into the human weapon [...] "PX-0", Kuma's personality is destroyed, leaving him a programmable fighting machine under the Government's control.|$|E
