5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to retinitis pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from sudden <b>infant</b> <b>death</b> syndrome, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} youth in various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother had taught him to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E

40|$|Infant {{mortality}} data {{had been}} collected through a National Household Health Survey in 7 provin­ces, which {{was conducted in}} August 1985 through May 1986. Retrospectively, the sampled population were interviewed about the occurence of births and deaths in the last one year period. Diagnosis for causes of deaths were made by medical doctors, based on verbal "autopsy". In the survey, 7951 live births and 571 <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> were recorded, and the infant mortality rate was 71. 8 per 1000 live births. Comparing to 1980 Health Survey, the infant mortality rate was 99. 7 per 1000 live births.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the medical causes and social determinants of <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> occurring in Kayseri. Material and Method: Parents of 343 babies who died in 1997 were visited by qualified midwives and a questionnaire about risk factors and causes of <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> was performed. Results : One hundred and ninety six of the 343 deaths (57. 1 %) occurred during the neonatal period. Postneonatal mortality was higher in infants living in rural areas and in those who had less educated parents. The leading causes of deaths were pneumonia, prematurity and congenital abnormalities. Prematurity and congenital abnormalities were higher in urban areas but pneumonia and gastroenteritis were the leading causes of <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> in rural areas. It was found out that 58. 3 % of all <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> occurred at home and half of them had not been examined by a doctor before death. Conclusion: Although 57. 1 % of <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> occurred in the neonatal period, preventable diseases such as pneumonia and gastro-enteritis were the leading causes of <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> particularly in rural areas...|$|R
40|$|Objective. It has {{previously}} been demonstrated that a peak in registered <b>infant</b> <b>deaths,</b> at 2 - 3 months of age at death, developed between 1997 and 2002 in South Africa, alongside the evolving HIV epidemic. The objective of this analysis was to explore the age distribution of post-neonatal <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> in South Africa by province, and relate the observed distributions to HIV and intervention characteristics. Design. Ecological study based on registered <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> and published HIV and intervention characteristics. Methods. Numbers of registered <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> beyond 1 month of age at death were plotted by year of death, province of South Africa and age at death in months, for the years 1997 - 2007. Results. The total number of registered <b>deaths</b> in <b>infants</b> aged 1 - 11 months increased from 15 404 in 1997 to 34 479 in 2006. Eight of the 9 provinces experienced an annual peak in registered <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> at 2 - 3 months of age between 1997 and 2007. This peak in mortality was not observed in the Western Cape. In 7 of 9 provinces registered post-neonatal <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> did not rise markedly in 2007 compared with 2005. Conclusions. We identified a single province out of 9 South African provinces in which a peak in early <b>infant</b> <b>deaths</b> at age 2 - 3 months did not occur during the period 1997 - 2007. This was the province with the earliest and highest coverage of antiretroviral interventions from 1999 onwards.
