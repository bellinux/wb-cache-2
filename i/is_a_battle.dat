5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E
5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when to swing the bat.|$|E

50|$|The {{battle for}} Niš {{was not one}} battle, but five {{different}} battles. The first engagement <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> against <b>a</b> small garrison in Niš and the capture of the town. This was followed by three different battles against three different Ottoman armies advancing on Niš. Finally there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> against {{the remnants of the}} three Ottoman armies.|$|R
25|$|Reading: to read {{a person}} is to {{highlight}} and exaggerate all of the flaws of a person, from their ridiculous clothes, to their flawed makeup and anything else the reader can come up with. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> of wit, in which the winner is one who gets the crowd to laugh the most.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} lot {{of musical}} talent shown by the younger {{community}} of Jersey. The dominant genres are indie, punk and metal. The main event that these bands take part in <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Battle</b> of the Bands each summer, the most recent winners being No Star Hotel. The bands often have trouble getting their music well known due to the isolation of the island. However, pop singer Nerina Pallot has enjoyed international success.|$|E
25|$|In this series, Magneto uses {{a device}} aboard Asteroid M to advance his evolution, and {{propelling}} his abilities to further heights. Evidently, this advancement pushes him onto another plateau of existing as a mutant. A {{claim that he}} references {{when he goes to}} fight Apocalypse, declaring that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between 'higher evolutionaries.' This is enforced by Caliban's claim that Magneto is too far advanced for him to locate, but that any other mutant was still within his capabilities.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Nagara-gawa (Nagara-gawa no tatakai) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> {{that took}} place {{along the banks of}} the Nagara River in Mino Province in April 1556. The site of the battle is in present-day Gifu city, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between Saitō Dōsan and his son, Saitō Yoshitatsu, who had instigated a coup d'etat.|$|R

25|$|Counter punchers are slippery, {{defensive}} style {{fighters who}} often {{rely on their}} opponent's mistakes {{in order to gain}} the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.|$|E
25|$|A taunt <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> cry, {{a method}} in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or insult {{intended}} to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can {{exist as a}} form of social competition to gain control of the target's cultural capital (i.e. status). In sociological theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly bullying, or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to fighting words and trash-talk.|$|E

500|$|The {{late nineteenth}} century also brought the {{systematic}} study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The Night Cafe, to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> and antithesis of the most different reds and greens." ...|$|E
500|$|The Budapest Gambit {{contains}} several specific strategic themes. After 3.dxe5 Ng4, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> over White's extra pawn on e5, which Black typically attacks with ...Nc6 and (after ...Bc5 or ...Bb4+) ...Qe7, while White often defends it with Bf4, Nf3, {{and sometimes}} Qd5. In the 4.Nf3 variation the game can evolve either with Black attacking White's kingside with manoeuvres of rook lifts, or with White attacking Black's kingside with the push f2–f4, {{in which case}} Black reacts in the centre against the e3-pawn. In numerous variations the move c4–c5 allows White to gain space and to open prospects for his light-square bishop. For Black, the check Bf8–b4+ often allows rapid development.|$|E

500|$|The Fifth Symphony has two {{movements}} {{instead of}} the usual four, which is the only time Nielsen used this structure. Nielsen explained jokingly in an interview that it was not difficult to write the first three movements of a symphony but by the finale most composers had run out of ideas. The work has a craggy profile as [...] "it is littered with false climaxes at every turn". In summary, the first movement <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> between the orchestra and a renegade snare-drummer, who can only be silenced by the full forces of his colleagues in the final bars. The second movement continues the struggle with shivers of anxiety, building through repetitions and detours to the final victorious grand explosion.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Na'vi habitat {{to make way for}} mining operations has also evoked parallels with the oppressive policies of some states often involving forcible evictions related to development. [...] David Boaz of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in Los Angeles Times that the film's essential conflict <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> over property rights, [...] "the foundation of the free market and indeed of civilization." [...] Melinda Liu found this storyline reminiscent of the policies of the authorities in China, where 30 million citizens have been evicted {{in the course of a}} three-decade long development boom. [...] An article in the Global Times, published by the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper People's Daily, called the film's plot [...] "the spitting image of the violent demolition in our everyday life.... acing the violent demolition conducted by chengguan but instigated by real estate developers, some ordinary people have wept or burned themselves desperately, while most continue to bear unfairness in silence." [...] Others saw similar links to the displacement of tribes in the Amazon basin and the forcible demolition of private houses in a Moscow suburb.|$|E
500|$|With these issues, Kavanagh {{argues that}} there {{are likely to be}} consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single {{minister}} in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under Pepper, every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source; [...] "the debate on the Bill <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness {{to do whatever it takes}} to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>battle</b> of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E
