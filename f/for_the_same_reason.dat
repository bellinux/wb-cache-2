5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason,</b> to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E

5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason,</b> the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST {{will face a}} temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason,</b> the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Air Force {{inventory}} in April 1941 {{included more}} than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, {{in addition to}} 20 largely civilian transport aircraft which had been pressed into military service. Of these, 107 of the fighter aircraft were of modern design, the remainder were not capable of meeting front line Axis aircraft on close to equal terms, and were therefore considered obsolete. Some bomber and reconnaissance aircraft were also considered obsolete <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|This was a {{recognition}} of the de facto political situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the political control of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned that having a Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason,</b> they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|Young Mallory {{prepared}} for a profession by reading law {{in the office of}} Judge William Marvin.

Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law, particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage, and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason,</b> the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>reason.</b> During this month, {{wear and tear on}} the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
