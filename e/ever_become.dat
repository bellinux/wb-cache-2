5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> economically practical.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. As a result, the Brill Tramway {{became a part of}} the London Underground. The management of London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and the improvement of passenger services in London, and saw little possibility that the former Metropolitan Railway routes in Buckinghamshire could <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> viable passenger routes. In 1935 all services on the Brill Tramway were withdrawn, and the line was closed. The infrastructure of the route was dismantled and sold shortly afterwards. Very little trace of the Brill Tramway remains, other than the former junction station at Quainton Road, now the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{politics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to abortion in the city should it <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Palace {{is one of}} the {{historical}} attractions in the city, and is an example of Victorian-style architecture with a garden. Figure Museum is another historical colonial building since 1886 which <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> the house for the Johor first Menteri Besar Jaafar Mohamed; it is located on the top of Smile Hill (Bukit Senyum) overlooking the Johor Straits. The English College (now Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar) established in 1914 was located close to the Sungai Chat Palace before being moved to its present location at Sungai Chat Road; some of the ruins are visible at the old site. The Sultan Ibrahim Building is another historical building in the city; built in 1936 by British architect Palmer and Turner, it was the centre of the administration of Johor as since the relocation from Telok Blangah in Singapore, the Johor government never had its own building. Before the current railway station was built, there was Johor Bahru railway station (formerly Wooden Railway) which has now been turned into a museum after serving for 100 years since the British colonial era.|$|E

25|$|Machen is {{considered}} to be the last of the great Princeton theologians who had, since the formation of the college in the early 19th century, developed Princeton theology: a conservative and Calvinist form of Evangelical Christianity. Although Machen can be compared to the great Princeton theologians (Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, and B. B. Warfield), he was neither a lecturer in theology (he was a New Testament scholar) nor did he <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> the seminary's principal.|$|E
25|$|Matsuhashi and Hallett's {{study can}} be {{summarized}} thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> aware of a movement only after {{it has already been}} started, our awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.|$|E

25|$|Hegel {{wanted to}} philosophize about Christianity {{but had no}} {{intention}} to <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to {{know who he is}} by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.|$|E
25|$|Insight into {{killings of}} Communists is {{provided}} by the events surrounding a boy name Kliwon. Kliwon’s father was killed in his fight for Communism which led to his mother living in fear that her son would <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> a Communist. Furthermore, a character named Salim is introduced in Kliwon’s storyline. Salim enters the novel as a Communist fugitive, and he struggles to escape from army officials. His death scene where he is shot sitting on a toilet naked reflects an exaggeration of the brutality of the killings of communists in Indonesia during the Suharto Regime.|$|E

25|$|The {{taxpayer}} whose residence {{has been}} ‘locked’ into a trust {{has now been}} given another opportunity {{to take advantage of}} these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that it will <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> available thereafter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} a leap second event, ntpd {{receives}} notification {{from either}} a configuration file, an attached reference clock, or a remote server. Because of the requirement that time must appear to be monotonically increasing, a leap second is inserted with the sequence 23:59:59, 23:59:60, 00:00:00. Although the clock is actually halted during the event, any processes that query the system time cause it to increase by a tiny amount, preserving the order of events. If a negative leap second should <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> necessary, it would be deleted with the sequence 23:59:58, 00:00:00, skipping 23:59:59.|$|E
25|$|The name National Ignition Facility {{refers to}} the goal of igniting the fusion fuel, a long-sought {{threshold}} in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually {{in order to keep the}} reactions going. Ignition {{refers to the}} point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against all losses of energy, so that fusion reactions can continue. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear burn. Ignition is considered a key requirement if fusion power is to <b>ever</b> <b>become</b> practical.|$|E
