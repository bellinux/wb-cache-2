60|$|Trick. I fear him not; he {{has this}} morning armed me against himself, by this settlement; {{the next time he}} rebels, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> fair {{occasion}} of leaving him for ever.|$|E
6000|$|Corvick almost groaned. [...] "Oh you know, I don't {{put them}} back to back that way; it's the infancy of art! But <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasure}} so rare; the sense of"--he mused a little--"something or other." ...|$|E
2500|$|... <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> broad smile—looking {{incredibly}} {{peaceful and}} inwardly quiet— ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> sidelong glance {{out of his}} {{sinister}} red eyes, and laughed.|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} hit Rocky the same way, for <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{pleading}} look.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll do that, in {{the first}} place, and when I've got through I'll do a little more. I went to Maverick most two weeks ago when my stomach was sour, and <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bottle for a dollar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> scrattlin' twenty-five, an' {{his club}} this week! But I know him. He thinks because YOU'RE earning he needn't {{keep the house}} any longer. No, {{all he has to}} do with his money is to guttle it. But I'll show him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father Sebastian {{agreed that}} he was, and I haven't much doubt. He {{said the man}} was evil and I think evil's the proper word. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> strange nervous shrinking. Have you felt a kind of nausea when you looked at {{something}} repulsive? Well, I feel like that when he's about." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> it <b>a</b> look. Then <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> look, and I didn't {{like his}} eye.|$|R
60|$|I {{was afraid}} {{it was all}} over, but luckily <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> opening again after gulping down his wine.|$|R
6000|$|... "You meddlesome fool! You oaf! You toad! This {{for your}} interference!" [...] he added as <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{vigorous}} punch on the head.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, if <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to}} say {{anything}} at all," [...] she thought ruefully, as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut across the fields, golden {{in the light of}} the dreamy August evening. [...] "I know now just how people feel who are being led to execution." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{the next}} morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let 'em graze on a little {{hillside}} on the prairie. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of instructions about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd, and driving 'em down to a water-hole to drink at noon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{cares for}} the country?" [...] {{answered}} Thousandacres fiercely. [...] "If it wants young Littlepage, let it come and s'arch for him, as we've been doin'. If that chap falls {{into my hands}} once more, he never quits 'em alive, unless <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good and sufficient deed to two hundred acres, includin' the mill, and a receipt in full, on his father's behalf, for all back claims. On them two principles my mind is set, {{and not to be}} altered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, no indeed! He {{ought to}} be fired. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> room {{as though he were}} the {{superintendent}} of a free lodging-house." ...|$|R
6000|$|Next morning Eliceo was back, {{but without}} the skins. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> letter, written in Spanish, of which the {{following}} is a free translation: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A {{month later}} I saw Allo with his horses--by the Temple of Pan, O Faun--and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great {{necklace}} of gold studded with coral.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] he said, [...] "describes {{a certain}} ten-round unpleasantness with one Mexican Joe. 'Joe {{comes up for}} the second round and <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> nasty look, but I thinks of my mother and swats him one in the lower ribs. He gives me another nasty look. [...] "All right, Kid," [...] he says; [...] "now I'll knock you up into the gallery." [...] And with that he cuts loose with a right swing, but I falls into the clinch, and then--'" ...|$|E
60|$|FAG Assuredly, sir, {{your father}} is wrath to a degree; he comes down stairs eight or ten steps at a time--muttering, growling, and thumping the {{banisters}} all the way: I and the cook's dog stand bowing at the door--rap! <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> stroke {{on the head with}} his cane; bids me carry that to my master; then kicking the poor turnspit into the area, damns us all, for a puppy triumvirate!--Upon my credit, sir, were I in your place, and found my father such very bad company, I should certainly drop his acquaintance.|$|E
6000|$|... "In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so {{does his}} pap's nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake {{whenever}} he wants me to, and any time I ask him <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little something to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat WITH him. But you needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want {{to do as a}} steady thing." ...|$|E
60|$|And the Admiral stumped up like <b>a</b> man. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cheque for the money, and I've {{just this}} moment sent {{it on to}} Montgomerie.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{look that}} showed no white man could have felt a deeper {{degradation}} in remembering and confessing these last acts of brotherly oppression.|$|R
60|$|When Mrs. Strickland {{introduced}} me to her husband, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> rather indifferent hand to shake. Turning to him gaily, she attempted a small jest.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] he said. [...] "Describing {{a certain}} ten-round unpleasantness with one Mexican Joe. 'Joe {{comes up for}} the second round and <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> nasty look, but I thinks of my mother and swats him one in the lower ribs. He hollers foul, but nix on that. Referee says, [...] "Fight on." [...] Joe gives me another nasty look. [...] "All right, Kid," [...] he says; [...] "now I'll knock you up into the gallery." [...] And with that he cuts loose with a right swing, but I falls into the clinch, and then---!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anything to anybody. If I haven't {{got what}} the buyer wants I promise {{to bring it}} next journey, or bewilder him with an oration until <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar for {{something}} he has no possible use for. That, however, isn't a {{thing you can do}} very frequently, which is why some folks in my profession fail disastrously. They can't realize that if you sell a man what he doesn't want too often he's apt to turn out with a club on the next occasion." [...] He paused and sighed whimsically. [...] "If I hadn't been troubled with a conscience I could have been running a store by now. That is, it must be added, if I had wanted to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has no hat." [...] Then {{seeing in}} her face that she already, in this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to stroke. [...] "He has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face, long in shape, with straight, good {{features}} and little, rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and {{as if they might}} move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange--awfully; but I only know clearly that they're rather small and very fixed. His mouth's wide, and his lips are thin, and except for his little whiskers he's quite clean-shaven. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> sort of sense of looking like an actor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you wish}} to hear this. I wanted to make him tell me why he objected to my gambling, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little sermon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{seen the}} {{sergeant}} and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> {{outline of the}} affair," [...] he said. [...] "It was cleverly thought out--I suppose the idea was yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aw, I know. It's {{all over}} the valley thet y'u'd ride in ter-day. Shore I wus the one thet tole yer dad an' <b>he</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have written}} to Fanny {{this morning and}} {{received}} a note from Haslam. I was to have dined with him to-morrow: <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bad account of his Father, {{who has not been}} in Town for five weeks, and is not well enough for company. Haslam is well--and from the prosperous state of some love affair he does not mind the double tides he has to work. I have been a Walk past west end--and was going to call at Mr. Monkhouse's--but I did not, not being in the humour. I know not why Poetry and I have been so distant lately; I must make some advances soon or she will cut me entirely. Hazlitt has this fine Passage in his Letter: Gifford in his Review of Hazlitt's characters of Shakspeare's plays attacks the Coriolanus critique. He says that Hazlitt has slandered Shakspeare in saying that he had a leaning to the arbitrary side of the question. Hazlitt thus defends himself, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay! my {{commission}} to a half-pay ensigncy, {{that some of}} these lazy fellows, who must have a four-legged beast to carry them to the wars, have heard of the 'south side.' South side! I believe I must put an advertisement in the London Gazette, calling that amphibious soldier to an account If he be a true man, he will not hide himself under his incognito, but will give me a meeting. If that should fail, damme, I'll ride across to Yarmouth, and call out the first of the mongrel breed that I fall in with. 'Sdeath! Was ever such an insult practised on a gentleman and a soldier before? Would that I only knew his name! Why, if the tale should get abroad, I shall be the standing joke of the mess- table, until some greater fool than myself can be found. It would cost me at least six duels to get rid of it. No, no; not a trigger will I pull in my own regiment about the silly affair: but I'll have a crack at some marine in very revenge; for that is no more than reasonable. That Peters! if the scoundrel should dare whisper anything of the manner in which he was stamped with the breech of the musket! I can't flog him for it; but if I don't make it up to him the first time <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance, I am ignorant of the true art of balancing regimental accounts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's my uncle's idea," [...] he said. [...] "Muriel doesn't {{know about}} it yet. The portrait's to be a {{surprise}} for her on her birthday. The nurse takes the kid out ostensibly to get a breather, and they beat it down here. If you want an instance of the irony of fate, Bertie, get acquainted with this. Here's the first commission I have ever had to paint a portrait, and the sitter is that human poached egg that has butted in and bounced {{me out of my}} inheritance. Can you beat it! I call it rubbing the thing in to expect me to spend my afternoons gazing into the ugly face of a little brat who to all intents and purposes has hit me behind the ear with a blackjack and swiped all I possess. I can't refuse to paint the portrait because if I did my uncle would stop my allowance; yet every time I look up and catch that kid's vacant eye, I suffer agonies. I tell you, Bertie, sometimes when <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> patronizing glance and then turns away and is sick, as if it revolted him to look at me, I come within an ace of occupying the entire front page of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation. There are moments when I can almost see the headlines: 'Promising Young Artist Beans Baby With Axe.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> hard look. [...] "I guess there's wilder cats in it. It {{must come}} to this, George. I say, you mustn't tell Madam," [...] he adds.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> queer glance, the {{significance}} of which I left untranslated. My excitement was too great to analyze {{what he meant by}} this mention of my father....|$|R
6000|$|... "I had a {{few lines}} on parish {{business}} from Mr. Weston this morning, {{and at the end}} of them <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> brief account of what had happened." ...|$|R
