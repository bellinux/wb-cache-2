40|$|Focusing on {{the work}} of Thomas Campion, Samuel Daniel, Ben Jonson, and John Dryden, this {{dissertation}} argues that the modern critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was constructed in seventeenth-century England. It supplements contemporary scholarly accounts of the origin of modern criticism by looking at the topic from a fresh perspective. Many contemporary studies assume that the modern critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> cultural <b>identity</b> was formed prior to or simultaneously with the concepts of literature, the author, and the canon. While the critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was constructed during the same period as these concepts, why it emerged has not yet been fully explored. This dissertation treats the origin, construction, and development of this identity. ^ Beginning at least as early as {{the last decade of the}} sixteenth century, significant debates about vernacular “criticism” took the form of battles between ancients and moderns. By tracing these battles, scholars can observe the construction of the modern critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity.</b> Such an analysis amends traditional chronologies of criticism 2 ̆ 7 s development, for it suggests that some of the cultural forces that scholarship associates with the formation of criticism in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were already in evidence by the last decade of the sixteenth. At this time, the critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was being constructed to perform a dual function: to address the effects of nascent print-capitalism and to aid in the formation of England 2 ̆ 7 s national literary tradition. The critic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> was then continually reconstructed throughout the seventeenth century in response to these same cultural forces. Most notably, critics, responding to the changing conditions of textual production, dissemination, and consumption, attempted to form and regulate the tastes of readers so that the “best” texts would survive in the expanding print marketplace. Thus, modern criticism emerges earlier than has previously been argued. This dissertation concludes that John Dryden does not usher in modern criticism, but is the heir of Renaissance humanist concerns about the effects of print-capitalism, and that Alexander Pope 2 ̆ 7 s An Essay on Criticism is thoroughly anticipated by Ben Jonson 2 ̆ 7 s commonplace book, Discoveries. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{identity as a}} source of prosocial motivation in young adulthood. Blasi (1993) posited that identity has two components: subjective identity maturity (the degree to which individuals have hierarchically organized their identity around an essential core) and identity content (the elements most important to an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity,</b> such as values, emotions, relationships, roles, and behaviors). Mature subjective identity entails a greater sense of agency and ownership over one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity,</b> and greater desire to live consistent with one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> core <b>identity</b> contents. Blasi (1993) suggests an individual has a moral identity when his or her identity is centered on moral values. The present study examined two primary hypotheses about Blasi 2 ̆ 7 s model of moral identity, as it pertains to prosocial morality. First, the link between prosocial identity content (i. e., the extent to which one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> is based on prosocial values) and prosocial behavior would be moderated by subjective identity maturity, in that this association would be stronger at higher levels of subjective identity maturity. Second, prosocial identity content would remain significantly related to prosocial behavior even when accounting for differences in sympathy and prosocial moral reasoning. The sample included 91 university students, ages 19 to 35 years (M = 21. 89; SD = 3. 01; 80...|$|R

40|$|Since 1990, the {{development}} of tacrolimus-based immunosuppression and improved surgical techniques, the increased array of potent immunosuppressive medications, infection prophylaxis, and suitable patient selection helped improve actuarial graft and patient survival rates {{for all types of}} intestine transplantation. Patients with irreversible intestinal failure and complications of parenteral nutrition should now be routinely considered for small intestine transplantation. However, Survival rates for small intestinal transplantation have been slow to improve compares increasingly favorably with renal, liver, heart and lung. The small bowel transplantation is still unsatisfactory compared with other organs. Further progress may depend on better understanding of immunology and physiology of the graft and can be greatly facilitated by animal models. A wider use of mouse small bowel transplantation model is needed in the study of immunology and physiology of the transplantation gut as well as efficient methods in diagnosing early rejection. However, this model is limited to use because the techniques involved is an extremely technically challenging. We have developed a modified technique. When making anastomosis of portal vein and inferior vena cava, two stay sutures are made at the proximal apex and distal apex of the recipient s inferior vena cava with the <b>donor</b> <b>s</b> portal vein.

This method is easier to perform because anastomosis is made just on the one side of the inferior vena cava and 10 - 0 sutures is the right size to avoid bleeding and thrombosis.

I explore tensions between the collective imaginary of rural Mexico and rural women 2 ̆ 7 s emerging sense of independence and self-determination in light of higher education 2 ̆ 7 s expanding opportunities. Educational opportunities lead to community formation around commonality of experience in addition to ascribed community relationships and roles. I situate this analysis {{within the context of}} the Universidad Tecnológica de los Valles Centrales de Oaxaca (UT), a small university in San Pablo Huixtepec, Oaxaca, Mexico. Through interviews and participant observation, I answer the following questions: (1) How is rural women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> produced through policy, geography, and social influences? (2) In what ways do college women experience change in terms of family relationships and professional trajectories? and (3) How do changes in rural women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> collective <b>identity</b> through professional development contribute to social movements for gender equality? This thesis provides a broader examination of the implications of shifts in family trajectory for belonging and women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> in Mexico, contributing to larger discussions regarding higher education in rural areas, women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences and interactions within institutions, and women 2 ̆ 7 s collectives as venues for societal transformation.

The {{aim of this study}} was to address how exogenous H 2 S acts on the meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes, including key maturation factors such as MPF and MAPK, and cumulus expansion intensity of cumulus-oocyte complexes. We observed that the H 2 <b>S</b> <b>donor,</b> Na 2 <b>S,</b> accelerated oocyte in vitro maturation in a dose-dependent manner, following an increase of MPF activity around germinal vesicle breakdown.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} efforts of three contemporary theologians whose work {{is a part of}} the search for a new methodology for doing ecclesiology located on the continuum between the Church 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> and relevance. They are the Catholic theologian Nicholas Healy, Anglican theologian Ephraim Radner, and Presbyterian theologian Darrell Guder. They come to the subject matter from different ecclesiological backgrounds, and, as such, their work can be taken as representative in as much as it stands for their unique efforts to theologize within their own traditions and contexts. By critiquing and analyzing their proposals I will bring them into dialog which will yield what I hope are the contours of a new way of thinking about ecclesiology. In my study of their ecclesiological proposals I examine first their approach to the Holy Scriptures relative to their search for the Church 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity.</b> Special attention will be given to Christological and Pneumatological concerns, but also to the role of corporate and individual repentance (or conversion), as a means of re-appropriating one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> true <b>identity</b> as Church. Second, I take a critical look at their proposals of how the Church 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>identity</b> can and should enable its practical embodiment in the context of the 21 st Century 2 ̆ 7 s marketplace of ideas and be expressed in its God-given mission, i. e., the Church 2 ̆ 7 s relevance. Then, based on a careful examination of the postmodern context, I argue that the aforementioned theologians represent the emergence of a new methodological axis, namely the one defined by 2 ̆ 2 identity and relevance, 2 ̆ 2 for doing ecclesiology. I will argue that this methodological axis gives rise to a new model, which I will call, 2 ̆ 2 missional ecclesiology. 2 ̆ 2 My critical evaluation of this new methodology concludes with an evaluation of its potential viability arguing in favor of missional ecclesiology as a viable model...|$|R
