40|$|The Fastener Starter is a {{creative}} solution {{to prevent the}} loss of small fasteners during their installation. This is the only currently available tool that can firmly grip and hold a single screw, bolt, nut, washer, spacer, or any combination of these parts. Other commercially available fastener starters are unable to accommodate a variety of parts simultaneously. The Fastener Starter is a more capable and easier tool to use than prior tools. Its compact size allows it to be used effectively in cramped, difficult-to-see locations. Its design also allows it {{to be used with}} or without handles and extenders in other difficult-to-reach locations. It provides better protection against cross threading and loss of fasteners and associated parts. The Fastener Starter is non-magnetic and does not off-gas, thus meeting flight hardware requirements. The Fastener Starter incorporates a combination of features of several commercially available tools, providing an improved means of installing small fasteners. The Fastener Starter includes a custom molded insert that can be removed easily and replaced with a conventional tool bit (e. g., a screwdriver or hex-driver bit). When used with the insert, the Fastener Starter prevents cross threading and damage to internal threaded holes. This is achieved by allowing the fastener to slip within the tool insert when used without a conventional tool bit. Alternatively, without the insert and with a tool bit, the Fastener Starter can torque a fastener. The Fastener Starter has a square recess hole that accepts a conventional square <b>drive</b> <b>handle</b> or extension to accommodate a variety of applications by providing flexibility in handle style and length...|$|E

50|$|Disadvantages of the Haldex Traction system include: {{the vehicle}} has {{inherent}} front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics (as when engine braking, load is only applied {{on the front}} wheels, and due to the reactive nature of the Haldex system and slight lag time in the redistribution of engine power), and the Haldex LSC unit also requires additional maintenance, {{in the form of}} an oil and filter change every 60000 km (whereas the Torsen is generally considered to be maintenance-free). Another important disadvantage of the Haldex system is the requirement for all four tyres to be of identical wear levels (and rolling radii), due to the Haldex requiring data from all four road wheel speed sensors. A final significant disadvantage is the reduction in luggage capacity in the boot (trunk), due to the bulky Haldex LSC unit necessitating a raised boot floor by some three inches.|$|R

25|$|Being {{a genetically}} {{enhanced}} human being gives the Agent various skills namely Strength (punching and lifting power), Agility (jumping and movement speed), <b>Driving</b> (<b>handling</b> vehicles), Explosives (the use of grenades and rocket launchers), Firearms (shooting ability). These {{skills can be}} upgraded by collecting specific orbs and killing enemies. Upgrading strength and agility increases the Agent's physicality, while upgrading Driving, Explosives and Weapons gives unlocks new vehicles and weapons. The Agent is also covered in a high-tech armor with a rechargeable shield that protects him from melee attacks, firearms and explosions. The armor also evolves as the Agent upgrade his skills, becoming more thicker and bulkier. Crackdown 2 improved upon this gameplay by allowing the player to unlock new armor abilities as they upgrade their armor, such as a ground and pound ability that causes powerful shockwaves, a charge ability, and a wingsuit and thrusters that gives the Agent the ability to fly. The player can also play various minigames such as on-foot and vehicle racing as well as street and aerial stunts.|$|R
50|$|The Onmyou Taisenki manga {{does not}} tell the same history as the anime. The story happens years before {{the events in the}} anime.
