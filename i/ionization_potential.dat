5|$|The {{noble gas}} atoms, like atoms in most groups, {{increase}} steadily in atomic radius from one period {{to the next}} due to {{the increasing number of}} electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the nucleus and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and molecules. It was the insight that xenon has an <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> {{similar to that of the}} oxygen molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using platinum hexafluoride, an oxidizing agent known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable anions; that is, they have a negative electron affinity.|$|E
5|$|Ubiquitousness and {{stability}} of atoms relies on their binding energy, which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the temperature {{is much higher than}} <b>ionization</b> <b>potential,</b> the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the <b>ionization</b> <b>potential,</b> atoms become statistically favorable.

5|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{physical properties}} of the noble gases are dominated by the weak van der Waals forces between the atoms. The attractive force increases {{with the size of}} the atom {{as a result of the}} increase in polarizability and the decrease in <b>ionization</b> <b>potential.</b> This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, and solubility. The increase in density is due to the increase in atomic mass.|$|E

40|$|We have {{performed}} relativistic calculations of single and double core 1 s hole {{states of the}} noble gas atoms in order to explore the relativistic corrections and their additivity to the <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials.</b> Our study unravels the interplay of progression of relaxation, dominating in the single and double <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> of the light elements, versus relativistic one-electron effects and quantum electrodynamic effects, which dominate toward the heavy end. The degree of direct relative additivity of the relativistic corrections for the single electron <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> to the double electron <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> is found to gradually improve toward the heavy elements. The Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is found to predict a scaling ratio of similar to 4 for the relaxation induced relativistic energies between double and single ionization. Z-scaling of the computed quantities were obtained by fitting to power law. The effects of nuclear size and form were also investigated and found to be small.

5|$|Xenon is the {{preferred}} propellant for ion propulsion of spacecraft because it has low <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> per atomic weight and can be stored as a liquid at near room temperature (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an ion engine than other fuels such as mercury or caesium. Xenon was first used for satellite ion engines during the 1970s.

5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted <b>ionization</b> <b>potential,</b> ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of single and double core <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> of the aminophenol molecule is reported. The role of relaxation, correlation, relativistic, and basis set effects in these potentials is clarified. Special {{attention is paid to}} the isomer dependence of the single and double core <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials.</b> Some of them are also compared with the respective values of the phenol and aniline molecules. It is shown that the core level single <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> of the para-, meta-, and ortho-aminophenol molecules differ only slightly from each other, rendering these structural isomers challenging to distinguish for conventional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In contrast, the energy needed to remove two core electrons from different atoms depends noticeably on the mutual arrangement and even on the relative orientations of the hydroxyl and amine groups. Together with the electrostatic repulsion between the two core holes, relaxation effects accompanying double core ionization play a crucial role here. The pronounced sensitivity of the double <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials,</b> therefore, enables a spectroscopic characterization of the electronic structure of aminophenol isomers by means of x-ray two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy...|$|R
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the electron configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The electron configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|While the {{remaining}} valence electrons in a singly ionized dubnium ion (Db+) organize {{themselves in a}} 6d27s2 configuration, the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms eliminate the 7s electrons, the opposite order to that of its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, however, dubnium is still expected to use five electrons as its valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db3+ {{is expected to have}} two d, rather than s, electrons remaining, the resulting oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The <b>ionization</b> <b>potential</b> of dubnium in its maximum oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry (see below).|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously.

The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well.

Empirical correlations between electron numbers in atoms and chemical bond stabilities in molecules are first reviewed and extended. Quantitative chemical bond strengths are then related to <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> in elements. Striking patterns in <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> are revealed when the data are viewed in an element-independent way, where element-specific details are removed via an appropriate scaling law. The scale factor involved is not explained by quantum mechanics; it is revealed only when one goes back further, to the development of Einstein’s special relativity theory...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The APSLG-MINDO/ 3 {{method is}} evolved to {{reproduce}} the vertical <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> for organic molecules. Two different schemes—one allowing for adjustment of the local electronic structure to the hole in each configuration and another one with a fixed local electronic structure—are developed and implemented. These methods are applied {{to a series of}} normal hydrocarbons. The possibility of localization of a hole in the polyethylene cation is discussed. Vertical <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials</b> are also obtained for a set of organic molecules with heteroatoms. Their values together with degeneracy of ionized states are compared with the data of photoelectron spectroscopy. c © 2001 Joh...|$|R
40|$|Heats of formation, {{molecular}} geometries, <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials,</b> and dipole {{moments are}} calculated by the MNDO method {{for a large}} number of molecules. The MNDO results are compared with the corresponding MIND 0 / 3 results on a statistical basis. For the properties investigated, the mean absolute errors in MNDO are uniformly smaller than those in MINDO/ 3 by a factor of about 2. Major improvements of MNDO over MINDO/ 3 are found for heats of formation of unsaturated systems and molecules with NN bonds, for bond angles, for higher <b>ionization</b> <b>potentials,</b> and for dipole moments of compounds with heteroatoms...|$|R
