In our longitudinal case study we examine the evolution of multinational <b>hard</b> <b>discounter</b> Lidl’s labour relations in Finland between 2002 - 2012. We show how Lidl Finland’s entry to Finnish markets was labelled by constant struggles between cross-border standardization and local adaptation of labour practices. We identify several tactics employed by Lidl management in order to weaken the effects of institutional pressures. Our analysis emphasises the dynamic interplay between labour market institutions and Lidl’s global retail strategy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{concerns}} the spatial organization of a retail network. During {{the expansion of}} a retail network, the location decision process does not necessarily lead to a regular distribution of outlets throughout the territory. The case of 5 hard discount store networks in France in their development stage illustrates this situation. A hard discount network strategy to fight against incumbent stores relies on the postulate that its competitiveness stems from its perfect cost control, and consequently, its ability to impose its brands to the consumers. To explain <b>hard</b> <b>discounter</b> spatial strategies, the diffusion theory was primarily developed by retaining only the temporal dimension of the process. But this model is not well established for the disordered {{environment in which the}} networks are managed. The percolation theory facilitates a new approach of the diffusion in this disordered medium that represents the retail network...|$|E
40|$|When patronizing stores, {{consumers}} may exhibit loyalty {{not only to}} a retail chain but also to a specific outlet. This distinction is important in a dynamic retail environment: if a store changes ownership, chain loyalty makes customers inclined to seek out another outlet of the former chain, whereas outlet loyalty enhances their stay rate after the takeover. This article distinguishes the two forms of loyalty conceptually and discusses how both can be identified empirically in a model of consumers' reactions to store acquisitions. The authors estimate their model on unique scanner panel data covering ± 200 local markets and takeovers. The results confirm that after an acquisition, consumers exhibit outlet loyalty, regardless of changes in chain and marketing mix. Counterfactual simulations point to important managerial implications. Acquiring outlets with a clientele in place leads to higher store traffic levels than the new owner could otherwise reach. Notably, these benefits cannot be reaped if the acquiring chain is a <b>hard</b> <b>discounter,</b> in which case customers' previous store knowledge is less relevant, and incentives to seek out new outlets are greater. © 2014, American Marketing Association...|$|E

These limited spots are {{in high demand}} by national-brand manufacturers. We examine whether private-label production by leading national-brand manufacturers for two important <b>discounters</b> (one <b>hard</b> and one soft) creates discounter goodwill. We estimate a selection model {{that is based on}} a sample of 450 manufacturer-category combinations from two leading discounters (Aldi in Germany and Mercadona in Spain), and we show that private-label production is indeed rewarded: national-brand manufacturers that are involved in such practices have a higher likelihood of procuring shelf presence for their brands. Moreover, while powerful manufacturers are intrinsically more likely to obtain shelf presence with soft discounters, manufacturers with less power can compensate for this by producing private labels. No such dependence on power exists for <b>hard</b> <b>discounters.</b> However, not all national-brand manufacturers are equally likely to produce private labels for discounters. We find that national-brand manufacturers are less likely to do so when: (a) they experience more sales growth, (b) it is more difficult to produce high-quality products in a specific category, (c) they invest more advertising support into their brands, and (d) they introduce more innovations. Moreover, a higher price differential relative to the discounter's private labels makes national-brand manufacturers less likely to engage in private-label production for <b>hard</b> <b>discounters...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{switch from}} single- to {{multichannel}} grocery shopping can affect consumers’ purchase allocations. This study investigates whether {{and to what}} extent a consumer’s decision to start buying groceries online at a particular chain can lead to expansion of the share in grocery spending allocated to that chain. To obtain a better insight into the underlying mechanisms and to provide more accurate and refined managerial guidelines, we further investigate the moderating effects of a comprehensive set of factors that may stimulate or withhold these expansion effects. To analyze these effects, we use a large and representative U. K. household panel data set, composed of multichannel grocery shoppers and a matched group of single-channel shoppers, for a 2. 5 -year period across all multichannel grocery chains. The empirical analysis confirms that multichannel grocery shoppers expand the share of wallet allocated to the online-visited chain, and that the extent of this expansion depends on chain as well as consumer characteristics. Expansion effects appear to be more profound for chains that adopt an integrated multichannel strategy for product prices and category assortments. In addition, customers who face more stringent time constraints, live farther away from the chain’s offline store, and/or purchase fewer competitive private-label or <b>hard</b> <b>discounter</b> products, are more likely to increase their share of grocery spending at the online-visited chain. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{research}} {{outlined in}} this paper seeks to establish {{whether or not there}} are discernible differences in the positioning attributes of Aldi and Sainsbury's. Particular emphasis is given to price positioning and to what extent this can be explained by product quality differences. Design/methodology/approach – Price differences are assessed using the shopping basket technique and product quality differences are evaluated using perceptual discrimination tests conducted blind of brand. Where differences between products are discernible, product preference is identified. Findings – The study identified discernible differences in the pricing strategies of Sainsbury's and Aldi particularly amongst the higher added value products. Although differences in product quality were evident in some product categories, there was no statistically significant preference for one brand over the other. Research limitations/implications – Owing to the resource intensive nature of perceptual discrimination tests, this research was conducted on {{a relatively small number of}} products and cannot be extrapolated to the full range of products available from either retailer, though it may indicate comparable quality. Originality/value – This paper evaluates the brand description of two UK-based retailers, Sainsbury's and Aldi. In market positioning, they are at different ends of the retailing spectrum, with Sainsbury's a high added value retailer with an ABC 1 consumer profile, and Aldi a <b>hard</b> <b>discounter</b> with a largely C 2 D consumer base. However, this study is based on a retail site that has the two brands located directly opposite each other in a conspicuously AB suburb of a major UK city. This location deviates from the holistic profile of the Aldi brand and as such provides a special research site...|$|E

This paper tries to tell the story of this retail format in Europe and focuses on the French situation where the war between German <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> and French hypermarkets seem to be critical for the future of both German and French retail industry. Three theories are mobilized to explain this evolution: the wheel of retailing, the retail life cycle and the population ecology. The French retail situation is described through all the strategies implemented by local retailers to resist to the hard discount invasion.

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{developments in the}} French large food retailers’ logistical systems and questions {{the validity of the}} conventional pattern where the maturation of logistical systems leads firms to grant priority to service quality, by continuously improving their performances in this area. The authors show that the French large food retailers have for some years developed a low price strategy together with a deliberate degradation of customer logistical services. There exist several analyses to explain this apparent paradox. First, it seems that service improvement is compatible with cost control in specific circumstances only, which prevailed in the 1990 s and disappeared later on. Looking at competition also shows that the pressure from <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> played an important part. Finally, the use of McNair’s (1957) wheel of retailing theory and its adaptation to the logistical field enable the authors to apply general rules to the phenomena today observed in France...|$|R
40|$|Like {{many other}} industrialised {{countries}} Germany {{has experienced a}} powerful concentration process in food retailing. There are some issues, however, which make Germany a special case in Europe and among industrialised countries in general. This holds true in terms of market structure and concentration, market development and pricing strategies. The market share of <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> like Aldi and Lidl has grown continuously in recent decades and the market share of discounters in general has reached a magnitude that is well above that found in other European countries. This has led to robust price competition in German food retailing. Along with this development, {{it has been very}} difficult for inward foreign direct investment (FDI) to gain ground in the German food retailing industry. One example was the market entry by Wal-Mart which, given its initial ambitious goals, was not successful. On the other hand, German <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> have strongly affected outward FDI by other German food retailers. In the process of expanding into other markets abroad, these companies have had a positive impact on exporting by the German food industry. This article describes and analyses these major trends in German food retailing in detail. It is organised as follows. The structure of food retailing is described and explained in Section 2. Section 3 deals with the importance of inward and outward FDI in German food retailing. It is discussed in both sections how increased concentration in food retailing affects the marketing chain. Price competition is intense in Germany, and studies of food pricing strategies have used scanner data. Therefore a special case study in Section 4 is the analysis of food pricing strategies in Germany based on scanner-data evidence. The analysis shows that the pricing behaviour of food retailers is characterised by the every-day-low-pricing (EDLP) strategies of discounters and the high-lowpricing (HiLo) strategies of their major competitors. The main elements of pricing policies are indicative of firms' market power: repeated price discounts for major food brands, frequent changes of loss leaders, the dominant role of psychological pricing, and a strong price rigidity for all other foods which are not on special offer.

40|$|The authors empirically {{explore how}} {{consumers}} update beliefs about a store's overall expensiveness. They estimate a learning model of store price image (SPI) formation {{with the impact}} of actual prices linked to category characteristics, on a unique dataset combining store visit and purchase information with price perceptions of the same consumers. The results identify characteristics driving categories' store-price signaling power, for different store formats. ‘Big ticket’ categories, with a narrow price range, strongly shape consumers' store price beliefs, while (volatile) prices of frequently or deeply promoted categories are less influential. At traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities, and where quality differentiation is high. For <b>hard</b> <b>discounters,</b> however, SPI is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow assortments. Interestingly, categories' SPI signaling power is not proportional to their share-of-wallet at either type of chain. Managers can use these results to identify ‘Lighthouse’ categories that signal low prices, yet make up a small portion of store spending and in which price cuts do not overly hurt revenue...|$|R
40|$|At {{a time of}} a {{consolidation}} and {{an increasing}} internationalisation of the distributive trade sector, three major phenomena have been simultaneously altering the structure of euro area trade {{for several years now}} : the success of <b>hard</b> <b>discounters,</b> the emergence of private-label products, and the growth in online shopping. All three tend to exert downward pressure on price levels. Whereas the first two factors are particularly pronounced in Belgium, online shopping is less of a factor. There have been no significant competition anomalies uncovered in the sector in Belgium. Retailers are not particularly concentrated at either the local or national level. And yet, despite improvements in recent years, Belgian regulation of the sector remains very invasive and could discourage the opening of new points of sale. Given the impact of the distributive trade sector’s structural characteristics on price-setting behaviour, and the differences in price levels within each country and between euro area countries, structural reforms are needed to enhance competition and take better advantage of the common market. However, even though harmonising regulations and eliminating implicit barriers should help lessen differences within the euro area, some differences are unavoidable due to consumer preferences and cultural differences from one country to the next, and even regionally. retail, regulation, competition, market structure, pricing...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{show how}} new realities in the private-label (PL) landscape, {{including}} differential PL-sourcing relationships and differentiated, three-tiered PL portfolios, affect the gross margins that retailers realize on their PLs. In addition, they examine the moderating {{role of the}} identity of the PL supplier (dual brander vs. dedicated supplier). Retailer PL margins are lower for stockkeeping units from PL suppliers with whom the retailer shares a more intense relationship, as reflected in their relationship breadth and depth, but this negative effect can be countered through multisourcing. Building prolonged relationships with PL suppliers also results in lower retailer PL margins, but only for more national brand–oriented suppliers. Dedicated PL suppliers have little to gain by building long-term retailer relationships, but they are less vulnerable to the retailer’s practice of multisourcing than dual branders. Although economy PLs may appeal to conventional supermarkets to keep (<b>hard)</b> <b>discounters</b> at bay, they result in lower margins (percentage-wise and absolute) than the standard PLs they cannibalize. Premium PLs, in turn, offer the retailer a higher margin, but only when produced by suppliers with a sufficient extent of national brand focus. However, the higher promotional support often given to premium PLs tends to mitigate the actual margin advantage...|$|R

40|$|The price-aggressive {{discount}} format, {{popularized by}} chains such as Aldi and Lidl, is {{very successful in}} most Western economies. Its success is {{a major source of}} concern for traditional supermarkets. Discounters not only have a direct effect on supermarkets' market shares, but they also exert considerable pressure to improve operational efficiency and/or to decrease prices. We use an empirical entry model to study the degree of intra- and interformat competition between discounters and supermarkets. Information on the competitive impact of new entrants is derived from the observed entry decisions of supermarkets and discounters in a large cross section of local markets, after controlling for a number of local market characteristics. In our modeling framework, we endogenize the number of retailers and allow for asymmetric intra- and interformat competitive effects in a flexible way. We apply our modeling approach to the German grocery industry, where the discount format has stabilized after two decades of continued growth. We find evidence of intense competition within both the supermarket and discounter format, although competition between supermarkets is found to be more severe. Most importantly, discounters only start to affect the profitability of conventional supermarkets from the third entrant onwards. This may explain why many retailers rush to add a discount chain to their portfolio: early entrants may benefit from the growth of the discount-prone segment without cannibalizing the profits of their more conventional supermarket stores. empirical entry model, <b>hard</b> <b>discounters,</b> interformat competition, grocery industry...|$|R

Although retail price wars have received much business press and some research attention, it is unclear how they affect consumer purchase behavior. This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the short- and longterm effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (<b>hard</b> <b>discounters).</b> The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image sensitivity. The authors provide managerial implications for firms that are (or about to be) involved in a price war. Marketing Science Institute; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Researc...|$|R
40|$|While being a {{key sector}} in all {{developed}} economies, retail trade does actually {{appear to be}} one of the reasons for Europe’s lagging behind in potential output growth. One of the reasons for this lag could be regulation. By determining conditions for market access and for carrying out a commercial activity, the regulatory framework may exert some influence on both economic performance and market structure and, ultimately, on the degree of competition. The article assesses the retail trade situation in Belgium along these lines. As far as possible, Belgium’s performance is compared with that of neighbouring countries and the findings are assessed by cross-matching the various sources of information available. First, evidence from international indicators (such as those regularly published by the OECD), as well as from a review of the main legislation governing retail trade in Belgium, tend to suggest that regulation in Belgium is relatively abundant and restrictive for this sector. Operating conditions in particular appear to be more regulated than in neighbouring countries. As regards the retail trade sector’s economic performance, it should be noted that, like most other economic sectors, the retailing business in Belgium still has a higher productivity rate than in the majority of other European countries and even the United States too. However, unlike trends noted in other branches of activity, this favourable position has been gradually eroded over the last ten years. It does actually seem that Belgium’s main problem lies in its inability to improve the efficiency of the production factors being used. However, looking more closely at the food retailing sub-sector, no striking anomalies are noted in the market structure and the degree of competition in Belgium. Even though the overall indicators point to some concentration at national level, local competition – assessed with an original approach applied to detailed data – appears to be quite strong; only a few sales outlets have a dominant position. Moreover, the non-specialised food retail sector has a growing number of big shops, as well as an increasing number of <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> and a larger share of generic brand products in traditional retail outlets. Using detailed consumption price data from CityData and Eurostat, this analysis throws up evidence that prices charged by the retail sector are higher in Belgium than in the three neighbouring countries and the euro area as a whole. There have also been signs of a recent deterioration in the differential between prices in Belgian supermarkets and prices charged by German and Dutch supermarkets in particular. Adverse developments in labour costs in Belgium and higher retail business margins can go some way to explaining the trend in price differentials compared to Germany, where <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> are more common. Then again, the sharp deterioration in the price differentials between Belgium and the Netherlands recorded in supermarkets can largely be explained by the price war that raged between the major Dutch retail groups from October 2003 to December 2006. Overall, it therefore appears that the actual influence of specific regulatory requirements for the retail trade on the efficiency of the sector, on the degree of competition and, ultimately, on consumer prices needs to be looked at very carefully. On the one hand, simplifying regulations in force in Belgium would no doubt break down the barriers to entry without necessarily impeding other policy objectives. On the other hand, the performance of the retail distribution sector must be examined taking account of the specific features of the economy, such as population density and cultural preferences. retail, regulation, market structure, pricing, productivity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse {{everyday}} appropriations of ‘responsible’ eating habits – seen as a set of plural ways of how people put into practice plural ideas of sustainability. In order not to pre-empt normative or socially desirable results, but to find out if the motor for ‘responsible’ consumption is driven by personal, social, ecological, geopolitical or political motivations, the notion of sustainability is not addressed directly in my empirical surveys. It is rather characterised, in a first stage, by quantitative indicators of possible sustainability in the food domain. These indicators are related either to the consumed foods themselves such as organic, fair trade, regional, seasonal, etc. or to the individual practices, namely the array of places where people procure different food stuffs – commercial ones ranging from <b>hard</b> <b>discounters,</b> supermarkets, etc. to more specific ones (groceries, delicatessens, retailers, box subscription scheme, etc.) and non-commercial ones (common, own garden, exchange barter, etc.). This survey (N = 3000), situated in Luxembourg and the surrounding Greater Region, is completed, in a second stage, by 50 qualitative, semi-directive interviews, which provide in-depth insights into the meanings of, and values behind, those indicators. What is of interest here are the everyday priorities, criteria, appropriations and strategies of consumption, as well as the justifications of this consumption in a perspective of regional/spatial identification. This approach not only shows which aspects of the polysemic idea of sustainability are relevant to people’s preoccupations (shaped by their everyday constraints and, in turn, shaping selective purchases), but uncovers to what extent people are reflexive in their ‘responsible’ food choices and in which ways, as well as for which reasons, consumers engage in the political domain of food issues...|$|R

KIWI currently {{has a strong}} position in their domestic market, and they wish to evaluate their possibilities for further international expansion. Based on their request the researchers have examined the UK grocery market by identifying main competitors, trends and the changing consumer behaviour within the market. Upon late request, the researchers have also evaluated possible modes of entry for KIWI into the UK market. The primary research includes; expert interviews, semi-structured interviews and observation. This research will present key findings of their competitors, consumer behaviour and overall changes found in the UK market. The UK grocery market {{is dominated by the}} “Big Four¨ (Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury´s and Morrisons), and is changing dramatically. Changes in the market are alterations to the entire British operating infrastructure; by <b>hard</b> <b>discounters</b> ALDI and LIDL. Further research reveals that the changing consumer behaviour is forcing the industry to adapt to meet the customers needs. The two main factors found that shoppers value, are convenience and choice. Secondary research complied with the primary data, has provided the researchers with a greater understanding of the UK grocery market, which has been used to draw a conclusion and recommendation for KIWI. Conclusions found are that KIWI would need to adapt to the British consumer’s shopping patterns. There are also too many competitors offering the same within the supermarket sector, KIWI would need to be innovative and offer something that does not currently exist. Based on this report’s findings, the researchers’ recommended KIWI to stay in their domestic market. The researchers recommend KIWI to continue success in Norway and focus on Scandinavian possibilities. However if they chose to enter the market, recommended modes of entry are; alliances through joint venture and acquisition.
