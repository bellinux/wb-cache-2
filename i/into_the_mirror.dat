5|$|Soma meets Arikado, who is {{initially}} angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma {{a letter and}} a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals. Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him. Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> in the room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma {{to come to the}} castle's center.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore was {{haunted by}} his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the {{circumstances}} surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured {{for the rest of his}} life by the possibility that he might have been the one who cast the spell that killed his sister. When he looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> of Erised, he saw himself redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and together.|$|E
25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women to walk {{up a flight of}} stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{they were supposed to be}} able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E

25|$|Queen Nehelenia {{was once}} a queen of her own kingdom that was absorbed by vanity. In fear of losing her beauty, she {{consumed}} the dreams of her subjects to stay young. She sought the Golden Crystal {{in the possession of}} a priest named Helios (Pegasus's true form) and was sealed within a mirror by Queen Serenity as a result. Queen Nehelenia formed the Dead Moon Circus and used Zirconia as a proxy to track Pegasus down. Although she obtains the Golden Crystal, she is betrayed by the Amazoness Quartet who gives the crystal to Chibiusa. Using the crystal, Queen Nehelenia is defeated and begins to wither with age, forcing her back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> she was once sealed within. Helios returns to his home world of Elysion.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a curved mirror to form an image may have been known {{since the time of}} Euclid and had been {{extensively}} studied by Alhazen in the 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. Niccolò Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book Optica philosophia of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.|$|E

Journalist Kaveree Bamzai elaborated, [...] "She hardly looks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> barely even glances at the set monitor, usually the crutch of every insecure actor, puts on make-up only under extreme duress, and [...] never watches her old movies." ...|$|E

While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character [...] "always coming out" [...] instead of his new role. To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop where he had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond {{so that he could}} look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and see a different person.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills {{applying}} red lipstick, {{in a car}} mirror, while the instrumental of the song plays. She leaves the car and passes by a man, who is afterwards seen standing between two women wearing plastic masks of Kills' face. The music mutes {{and the sound of}} footsteps is heard repeatedly as Kills approaches a cracked mirror. After hearing a noise behind her, she looks over her shoulder as her reflection looks to her as well. Kills is dragged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and the title card of the first act, [...] "Vanity". During the section, a metal skull is shown while Kills lip-synchs the song in front of a mirror. The visual transitions to its second act, dubbed [...] "Control", in which she holds an axe while standing on top of a glass box. A man is seen inside the box, filming her as she moves around it. The video then shifts to act three, named [...] "Sex", in which Kill is depicted singing to a skull. Towards the end of the video, Kills is seen handcuffed and chained while sitting on the floor, and seducing a blindfolded man.|$|E
500|$|The {{motel room}} that Cranston and Beaver appear in {{was a set}} {{constructed}} by Breaking Bad production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Director Michelle MacLaren wanted a genuine [...] "rundown motel feel", but believed {{it would be too}} difficult to film in an actual motel room because it would be too small for the cast and crew to fit inside. Instead, the set was designed so that several of the walls could be removed to make space for the cameras and crew. This allowed greater flexibility in shooting and camera angles, and the walls could be placed back into position if they were needed for the background of a shot. The first shot of the episode includes Walter speaking directly into the camera, and it quickly revealed he is speaking into a mirror in the motel room. MacLaren filmed the shot so it would be deliberately disorienting and unclear to the viewer where Walter was until the camera movement revealed the motel room. New York magazine writer Logan Hill interpreted Walter's speaking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as a symbol for self-reflection: [...] "He stares at a mirror reflection of himself, studying his own image, wondering if the Walt other people see gives any hint of what he’s carrying inside." ...|$|E

500|$|Nico tracks a stone down to {{a museum}} in London, England, where she {{encounters}} but does not recognize Professor Oubier. After he leaves, the stone is discovered to be missing and the museum is locked down. Nico escapes via an abandoned subway station and finds Oubier on a boat in the Thames with Karzac. Nico witnesses Karzac killing Oubier, and then sneaks in, takes the stone and escapes. Meanwhile, George tracks the remaining stone to a small museum in the Caribbean. Following subtle clues left by Captain Ketch, George learns that the stone was left on the nearby [...] "Zombie Island". George explores Zombie Island and finds that a butchered remake of Treasure Island is being filmed there. He poses as a stuntman {{to gain access to}} the place where the stone is being kept, but gets captured by Pablo and his men to be used as a sacrifice to Tezcatlipoca. Nico travels back to Quaramonte and saves George; together with Titipoco they enter Tezcatlipoca's pyramid. As they reach the central room, Karzac frees the ancient god there. However, Tezcatlipoca promptly kills Karzac. President Grasiento appears and attacks Titipoco, and their struggle sends them over a cliff. Raoul, realizing that he is expendable to his mother, chooses to save Titipoco. The protagonists place the stones into their respective slots, which causes Tezcatlipoca to be pushed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> George and Nico briefly celebrate and the final cut-scene fades into the credits.|$|E
500|$|... "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz compared {{the direction in}} [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to the film-making of Sergio Leone, particularly in its [...] "extreme close-ups", [...] "tense silences" [...] and the [...] "saloon fight" [...] between Walter and Mike. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the filming techniques used in Jesse's party [...] "which starts off like a rap video then turns {{into some kind of}} distorted, jumpy tweak-vision" [...] effectively conveyed Jesse's frame of mind. He also liked the way the script conveyed Marie's [...] "increasing isolation" [...] in dealing with Hank. [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode a [...] "terrific, unsettling hour" [...] and particularly complimented director Michelle MacLaren and cinematographer Michael Slovis, especially for shooting Jesse's party scenes [...] "in a way that let you experience the chaos just as Jesse was trying to". Sepinwall strongly praised Aaron Paul, who he said [...] "keeps finding new layers of Jesse, and new talents to show them with". New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised the film noir elements in the episode's photography, and said the opening scene, with Walter staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> asking, [...] "So, how's it look?", refers to the season's ongoing theme of internal self-reflection and surveillance. Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff said while the episode didn't advance the plot very far, it included a great deal of internal development among the characters, which he called [...] "an interesting new dynamic for the show to explore". He also called Jesse's emotional breakdown at the end [...] "easily the most chilling thing so far this season".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{time after}} {{entering}} the Lodge, Cooper and Annie reappear in the woods.

Annie is bloodied and hospitalized, but Cooper's injuries are minor enough that Doctor Hayward is able to treat them in Cooper's room at the Great Northern Hotel. Upon waking, Cooper asks about Annie's condition, and then states he needs to brush his teeth. When Cooper enters the bathroom and looks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> his reflection is Bob, revealing that he is Cooper's doppelgänger from the Black Lodge. He then rams his head <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and, while laughing maniacally, repeatedly mocks his earlier question about Annie's condition.|$|E

2500|$|We see Darwin {{portrayed as}} a monkey with his own human head. He holds a mirror up to another monkey which is sitting next to him. It seems {{as if he would}} invite the monkey to ponder over himself and his existence. This is {{underlined}} by the two accompanying quotations of Shakespeare: [...] "This is the ape of form" [...] (from: Love's Labour's Lost, act 5, scene 2) and [...] "Some four or five descents since" [...] (All's Well that Ends Well, act 3, scene 7). Darwin's facial expression seems to encourage the monkey to recognise their common ancestry. The ape, in turn, looks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and tries to touch the reflection to literally grasp Darwin's suggestion and to assure himself of the authenticity of their kinship.|$|E
2500|$|Kamo later {{discussed}} his experiences at feigning insanity {{for over three}} years: [...] "What can I tell you? [...] They threw me about, hit me over the legs and the like.

[...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But {{they do not know}} the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine.

He is also responsible for somehow enchanting the Mirror so that it hides the Philosopher's Stone and only someone who looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mirror</b> and whose desire was [...] "to find the Stone ... but not use it" [...] would receive it, as anybody else would only see themselves using the Stone due to the Mirror's special magic. He is called out to the Ministry of Magic by a false message on the night when Professor Quirinus Quirrell, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger enter the dungeons to retrieve the Stone, but realises during the trip that he is needed at Hogwarts and returns in time to rescue Harry from Quirrell and Voldemort. He also has a final conversation with Harry after the events down in the dungeons and tells him that he is too young to comprehend the information about why Voldemort attempts to kill him.|$|E

He turns to the Magic Mirror in desperation to speak with Cora, believing {{that the best way to}} force Regina to get over Snow White is to just help her complete her plot, which Prince Henry is not in favor of. Unknown to Prince Henry and Regina, Cora has managed to enter the realm of the Enchanted Forest through the mirror again. Later on, Prince Henry meets with Snow White in the woods. When she sees the real Prince Henry approaching her, she realizes that the first Prince Henry was actually Cora, who rips out her heart while she is distracted. Cora takes Snow's heart to Regina as a birthday present, only to then learn that Snow switched it out with that of a guard. It turned out that Prince Henry saved Snow White by switching the hearts.

There she sees a beautiful oval mirror, which she is given as a gift by the elderly owner of the shop [...] who comments that the mirror is meant for her. Jo is delighted, and the mirror is placed in her bedroom. That night, Jo is stunned to see the image of another girl in the mirror, instead of her own reflection, and {{it is obvious that}} the other girl, Louisa Iredale (also fourteen years old), can see her just as clearly. Louisa is able to 'introduce' herself to Jo by writing her name on a book for Jo to read. However, when Jo tries to write her name on the mirror to introduce herself to Louisa, she is startled when the pen begins to disappear <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> After Louisa is called away to dinner, Jo investigates the mystery and is accidentally pulled through the mirror into Louisa's bedroom in 1919. This leads to the discovery, by Jo and Louisa, that they can visit each other's times, through the mirror, any time they want to do so [...] provided that the mirror is situated in exactly the same place and that the mirror's alignment and orientation are identical within the mirror's frame, at corresponding moments in 1919 and 1995.|$|E
