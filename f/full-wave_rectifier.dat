2500|$|A {{particularly}} important class of non-linear loads is {{the millions of}} personal computers that typically incorporate switched-mode power supplies (SMPS) with rated output power ranging from a few watts to more than 1kW. Historically, these very-low-cost power supplies incorporated a simple <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifier</b> that conducted only when the mains instantaneous voltage exceeded the voltage on the input capacitors. [...] This leads to very high ratios of peak-to-average input current, which also lead to a low distortion power factor and potentially serious phase and neutral loading concerns.|$|E
2500|$|The 0Z4 was a {{gas-filled}} rectifier tube {{commonly used in}} vacuum tube car radios in the 1940s and 1950s. It was a conventional <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifier</b> tube with two anodes and one cathode, but was unique in {{that it had no}} filament (thus the [...] "0" [...] in its type number). The electrodes were shaped such that the reverse breakdown voltage was much higher than the forward breakdown voltage. Once the breakdown voltage was exceeded, the 0Z4 switched to a low-resistance state with a forward voltage drop of about 24 V.|$|E
2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifier.</b> [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a reservoir capacitor or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, zener diode & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|E

50|$|Efficiency {{is reduced}} by losses in {{transformer}} windings and power dissipation in the rectifier element itself. Efficiency can be improved {{with the use of}} smoothing circuits which reduce the ripple and hence reduce the AC content of the output. Three-phase <b>rectifiers,</b> especially three-phase <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> have much greater efficiencies because the ripple is intrinsically smaller. In some three-phase and multi-phase applications the efficiency is high enough that smoothing circuitry is unnecessary.|$|R

2500|$|Thermionic diode {{rectifiers}} {{were widely}} used in power supplies in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the All American Five radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes. [...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifier.</b> [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E

25|$|In {{half-wave}} rectification of a single-phase supply, also called uncontrolled one-pulse midpoint circuit, either the {{positive or negative}} half of the AC wave is passed, while the other half is blocked. Mathematically, it is a ramp function (for positive pass, negative block): passing positive corresponds to the ramp function being the identity on positive inputs, blocking negative corresponds to being zero on negative inputs. Because only one half of the input waveform reaches the output, mean voltage is lower. Half-wave rectification requires a single diode in a single-phase supply, or three in a three-phase supply. Rectifiers yield a unidirectional but pulsating direct current; half-wave rectifiers produce far more ripple than <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> and much more filtering is needed to eliminate harmonics of the AC frequency from the output.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals in the {{analysis}} of microelectrode recordings (MER) is to estimate the time-varying component of the firing rate, also known as the process intensity. This is typically done by applying a spike detection algorithm to create a spike train and then smoothing the spike train to estimate the slowly-varying fluctuations in intensity. In noisy recordings from microelectrode arrays or low-impedance microelectrodes used in stereotactic neurosurgery, this approach is often not possible because spike detection algorithms cannot accurately discriminate action potentials from single neurons. This paper compares the performance of a traditional spike-detection approach with an optimal threshold to a power demodulation approach similar to the <b>full-wave</b> <b>rectifiers</b> that are often used for the analysis of electromyograms (EMG). The results demonstrate that, in most cases, the power demodulation approach is as accurate as an optimal threshold detector. In signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) less than 0. 1, the power demodulation approach performs slightly better than the detection-based approach...|$|R
