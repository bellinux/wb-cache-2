500|$|Having {{begun to}} write love songs that were {{directed}} at both God and a woman, with his White Album track [...] "Long, Long, Long", Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for [...] "Something". In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his {{friends from the}} Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna; {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: [...] "all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> see." [...] By 1996, Harrison had denied writing [...] "Something" [...] for Boyd, adding that [...] "everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie" [...] because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles' recording, which showed each member of the band with his respective wife.|$|E

The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E

[...] Commentators have remarked on how, like many other Harrison compositions – [...] "Long, Long, Long", [...] "Something", [...] "What Is Life", [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", [...] "Learning How to Love You" [...] and [...] "Your Love Is Forever" [...] among them – it serves as both a conventional love song to a woman and a declaration of devotion to God. Harrison said in a 1976 interview: [...] "I think all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> see." ...|$|E

Can't you dream it three nights running, and tell <b>'er</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel certain sure he's alive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? I would tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not been blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. I would tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{wanted to}} know what you did--how you spent your time. When I told <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had no profession, that you did nothing except play cricket and polo, and hunt and shoot, she seemed most unaccountably surprised. She {{appeared}} almost incredulous when I told <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> seldom came to London, and still more seldom went abroad. I wonder what she had in her head?" ...|$|E

It is for <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are to weep, with <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are to sympathize, and at <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are to wonder. I would that I could find it compatible with my duty to introduce her to this circle without any minute details of her bodily and mental charms; but I have already been idle {{in the case of}} Adela Gauntlet, and I feel that a donna primissima has claims to description which I cannot get over. Only not exactly now; in a few chapters hence we shall have Miss Waddington actively engaged upon the scene, and then she shall be described.|$|E

6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Catherine; [...] "for, besides <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{know not}} in the least how to do <b>her</b> <b>that</b> service, <b>you</b> will bring a chiding my way, and I get enough of that in the regular course of things." ...|$|R

6000|$|Hearken, brethren. When She-who-has-a-right-to-ask interrogates you {{concerning}} a change she finds in your mood answer her thus: Tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> {{in a sudden}} rage, have murdered your grandmother; tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you; tell her your fortune is swept away; that you are beset by enemies, by bunions, by any kind of malevolent fate; but do not, if peace and happiness are {{worth as much as}} a grain of mustard seed to you--do not answer her [...] "Nothing." ...|$|E
