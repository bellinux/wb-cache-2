5|$|After {{the brigade}} had been disbanded in June 1948, its battalions were reformed, by {{renumbering}} {{those in the}} 2nd Parachute Brigade. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion became the 2nd Parachute Battalion, the 4th/6th Parachute Battalion the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion the 3rd Parachute Battalion. Finally, in July 1948, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade Group, taking <b>its</b> <b>one</b> and six numbers from the two wartime divisions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1889–90 season, Ottawa HC {{played two}} {{competitive}} games {{but this was}} to increase greatly the next season. The 1890–91 season saw the club play 14 games, playing in three leagues. Ottawa HC was {{a founding member of}} two new leagues, the Ottawa City Hockey League (OCHL) and the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and also rejoined the AHAC. Ottawa HC won the Ottawa and Ontario championships, and two games against AHAC opponents, but lost to the AHAC champion Montreal HC in <b>its</b> <b>one</b> challenge for the championship.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Official Magazine - UK {{praised the}} story's {{blurring}} of Gallia's moral standing, art style, and most points about its gameplay, positively noting the latter for both its continued {{quality and the}} tweaks to balance and content. <b>Its</b> <b>one</b> major criticism were multiple difficulty spikes, something that had affected the previous games. Heath Hindman of gaming website PlayStation Lifestyle praised the addition of non-linear elements and improvements or removal of mechanics from Valkyria Chronicles II in addition to praising the returning gameplay style of previous games. He also positively noted the story's serious tone. Points criticized in the review were recycled elements, awkward cutscenes that seemed to include all characters in a scene for no good reason, pacing issues, and occasional problems with the game's AI.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's {{view on the}} position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from <b>its</b> <b>one</b> feature of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from <b>its</b> <b>one</b> onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries. Investment in research and development remained very low in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The John Dory, {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, <b>its</b> <b>one</b> large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its very ugly head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E

5|$|The tram was jointly {{funded by}} OHSU, the City of Portland, and by South Waterfront {{property}} owners, {{with most of}} the funding coming from OHSU. It is owned by the city and operated by OHSU. While most passengers are affiliated with OHSU, it {{is open to the public}} and operated as part of Portland's public transportation network that includes the Portland Streetcar, MAX Light Rail, and TriMet buses. After opening in December 2006, the tram carried <b>its</b> <b>one</b> millionth passenger on October 17, 2007 and its ten millionth rider on January 8, 2014. A round-trip ticket costs $4.70 but are free for OHSU patients and certain visitors; OHSU employees and students ride free by showing their ID badges.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting {{a higher priority}} on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; <b>its</b> <b>one</b> issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E
5|$|Europe {{had been}} embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against {{a series of}} coalitions, nearly {{continuously}} since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, only to be defeated. In March 1802, France (now under Napoleon, as First Consul) and Great Britain, <b>its</b> <b>one</b> remaining enemy, agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For {{the first time in}} ten years, all of Europe was at peace. However, many disagreements between the two sides remained unresolved, and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all of its colonial conquests since 1793 when France was permitted to retain most of its conquered territory in Europe. France, meanwhile, was upset that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.|$|E

5|$|The unranked group Isostylis, with <b>its</b> <b>one</b> species, was {{reclassified}} as {{a section}} in the 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, and 1870 arrangement of George Bentham. In his 1981 revision of the genus, Alex George reclassified {{the group as a}} subgenus—Banksia subg. Isostylis—defined by the dome-shaped flower heads, with B.ilicifolia joined by newly described species B.cuneata and later B.oligantha. Banksia ilicifolia is the only common member of that subgenus; the two other species are rare and threatened, and are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Relationships between B.ilicifolia and the other members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Although DNA studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic divergence within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E
