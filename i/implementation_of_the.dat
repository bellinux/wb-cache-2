5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
