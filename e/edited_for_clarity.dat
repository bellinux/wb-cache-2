40|$|Given a database, {{computing}} {{the fraction}} of rows that contain a query itemset or determining whether this fraction is above some threshold are fundamental operations in data mining. A uniform sample of rows is a good sketch of the database {{in the sense that}} all sufficiently frequent itemsets and their approximate frequencies are recoverable from the sample, and the sketch size is independent of the number of rows in the original database. For many seemingly similar problems there are better sketching algorithms than uniform sampling. In this paper we show that for itemset frequency sketching this is not the case. That is, we prove that there exist classes of databases for which uniform sampling is a space optimal sketch for approximate itemset frequency analysis, up to constant or iterated-logarithmic factors.

40|$|Greither and Pareigis have {{established}} a connection between Hopf Galois structures on a Galois extension $L/K$ with Galois group $G$, and the regular subgroups {{of the group of}} permutations on $G$, which are normalized by $G$. Byott has rephrased this connection in terms of certain equivalence classes of injective morphisms of $G$ into the holomorph of the groups $N$ with the same cardinality of $G$. Childs and Corradino have used this theory to construct such Hopf Galois structures, starting from fixed-point-free endomorphisms of $G$ that have abelian images. In this paper we show that a fixed-point-free endomorphism has an abelian image if and only if there is another endomorphism that is its inverse with respect to the circle operation in the near-ring of maps on $G$, and give a fairly explicit recipe for constructing all such endomorphisms.

40|$|We report {{one-dimensional}} pinning of {{a single}} ion by an optical lattice. The lattice potential is produced by a standing-wave cavity along the rf-field-free axis of a linear Paul trap. The ion's localization is detected by measuring its fluorescence when excited by standing-wave fields with the same period, but different spatial phases. The experiments agree with an analytical model of the localization process, which we test against numerical simulations. For the best localization achieved, the ion's average coupling to the cavity field is enhanced from 50 % to 81 (3) % of its maximum possible value, and we infer that the ion is bound in a lattice well with over 97 % probability.

The spin {{degrees of freedom}} of the in-states {{are assumed to be}} in unentangled, pure states, as defined by the entropy of entanglement. Because of the restriction of rotationally-symmetric interactions, perfectly-entangling S-matrices, i. e. those that lead to a maximally entangled out-state, only exist for a certain class of separable in-states. Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the rotation group, the scattering phases that determine the S-matrix are determined for the case of spin systems with σ = 1 / 2, 1, and 3 / 2.

40|$|The Jeffreys-Lindley paradox {{displays}} how {{the use of}} a p-value (or {{number of}} standard deviations z) in a frequentist hypothesis test can lead to an inference that is radically different from that of a Bayesian hypothesis test in the form advocated by Harold Jeffreys in the 1930 s and common today. The setting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, possibly with "nuisance parameters") versus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of nature of unknown strength). The p-value, as well as the ratio of the likelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the alternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian posterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The academic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this paradox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific communication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to frontier research in high energy physics.

In this article we shall collect and survey a number of known analytic results, and develop several new analytic results - specifically we shall provide several new QNF results and estimates, in a form amenable for comparison with the extant literature. Apart from their intrinsic interest, these exact and approximate results serve as a backdrop and a consistency check on ongoing efforts to find general model-independent estimates for QNFs, and general model-independent bounds on transmission probabilities. Our calculations also provide yet another physics application of the Lambert W function. These ideas have relevance to fields as diverse as black hole physics, (where they are related to the damped oscillations of astrophysical black holes, to greybody factors for the Hawking radiation, and to more speculative state-counting models for the Bekenstein entropy), to quantum field theory (where they are related to Casimir energies in unbounded systems), through to condensed matter physics, (where one may literally be interested in an electron tunelling through a physical barrier).
