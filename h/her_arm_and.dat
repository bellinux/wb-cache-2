5|$|By {{the events}} of Drakengard 3, Zero had forged a {{partnership}} with the dragon Michael: as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help Zero kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower. Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with Zero losing <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually: after killing one, Zero takes on their disciple, a servant created to magnify the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude. During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail-safe in the event of Zero's victory.|$|E

5|$|The six-man {{match at}} SummerSlam was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. Two reasons have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests. As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline. The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated When Tatanka came to the help of Sherri, who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow. Subsequently, Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some of the hair Tatanka had dyed red as a tribute to his Lumbee heritage.|$|E
5|$|Two predatory lenders awaken {{on either}} side of a room split by a caged-in scale, wearing head {{harnesses}} with screws poised to pierce their temples. The one who sets more flesh weight upon their tray will survive. Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called to the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who has found Peter Strahm's fingerprints. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.|$|E

25|$|Young moviegoers began emulating romantic {{stars on}} the screen, such as Ronald Colman and Rudolph Valentino, the latter known for ending his passionate scenes with a kiss. Valentino also began his romantic scenes with women by kissing her hand, {{traveling}} up <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> then kissing her {{on the back of}} her neck. Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like Nazimova, Pola Negri, Vilma Bánky and Greta Garbo, became screen idols as a result.|$|E

25|$|Less publicized is film shot by British {{television}} cameraman Alan Downes for the British ITN {{news service}} and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Phuc Dinh {{who was working}} for the American television network NBC, which shows the events just before and after the photograph was taken (see image on right). In the top-left frame, a man stands and appears to take photographs as a passing airplane drops bombs. A group of children, Kim Phúc among them, run away in fear. After a few seconds, she encounters the reporters dressed in military fatigues, including Christopher Wain who gave her water (top-right frame) and poured some over her burns. As she turns sideways, the severity of the burns on <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> back can be seen (bottom-left frame). A crying woman runs in the opposite direction holding her badly burned child (bottom-right frame). Sections of the film shot were included in Hearts and Minds, the 1974 Academy Award-winning documentary about the Vietnam War directed by Peter Davis.|$|E
500|$|As {{the chorus}} starts, Foucan {{is joined by}} parkour traceur Levi Meeuwenberg and Exo as they {{continue}} their routine around buildings. The video ends with Madonna stretching <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> {{a shot of the}} Tokyo evening-sky. Entertainment Weekly was not impressed with the video overall commenting, [...] "orget about low concept, we're talking no concept! For all the money spent capturing footage of impressive rooftop leaps, I wish Madonna had chosen instead to offer us a visually sumptuous slice of storytelling, {{something along the lines of}} 'Express Yourself' or 'Bedtime Story'." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the quote, she had the Roman numeral [...] "V" [...] above the quote near the crevice of her elbow. While the [...] "V" [...] was meant to represent the five members of her immediate family, she had the tattoo covered up in early 2014. In its place is a black rectangle with the words [...] "keep going" [...] inscribed inside. At the same time, she had teal zigzag lines inked around her entire right forearm, surrounding the Washington Irving quote, a large owl wrapped around <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> script around her wrist, the latter two of which she got right after the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E

500|$|By 1925, Tschaikovsky had {{developed}} a tuberculous infection of <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> she {{was placed in a}} succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight. She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov; Anastasia's tutor Pierre Gilliard; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Olga. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia. In March 1926, she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, Herluf Zahle, while her identity was investigated. To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as [...] "Anastasia Tschaikovsky", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details. After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of a Carey's {{personal}} family album. As the pages open, the camera zooms to one particular photograph, of her young mother facing a wall, with her back turned. As the picture comes into full view, it turns into actual footage. Her mother turns around in anguish, as her own mother begins shouting at her and calling her a disgrace to the family. This {{is due to the fact}} that she is pregnant with the child of a black man, with whom she wants to move out with. As she goes to leave the home, her mother grabs <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> rips off a [...] "charmbracelet" [...] from her wrist. As she picks it up off the floor, she tells her mother she hates her and leaves in a taxi. From the clothing and scenery, it is notable that the scenes depicted are happening in the late 1960s, prior to Carey's birth. As the song starts playing, the video focuses on Carey, walking down the street in New York City. As she continues singing and walking down the street, the camera aims to the sky, which is darkened with cloud while light starts to peer through.|$|E
500|$|In March 1809 {{a miracle}} was {{reported}} as occurring at the convent. It is recorded {{that one of}} the nuns, Sister Mary Ann Wood, sustained a deep cut across her arm while opening a sash window. She was attended by a local surgeon, who judged that the muscles, and most of the tendons had been severed. The wound healed over after three weeks, but she continued to suffer sharp pain for four months. During all this time, she was not able to use her hand or arm, and despite attempting a variety of different methods to repair the broken tendons, the doctor eventually declared that she may regain use of her forefinger and thumb, but not the rest of her fingers. By this time, <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> hand had withered, and Sister Mary Ann decided to make a novena (nine prayers) to Saint Winifred. She began her prayers on 6 August, and placed a piece of moss on her arm; she said that she felt intense pain, and considered removing the moss, but opted not to. The following morning, she awoke, and her hand and arm were returned to full strength. The surgeon who had been tending to her was said to have [...] "at first declared the case a miracle; but human respect prevented him from publicly attesting it." [...] The Right Reverend Peter Collingridge, Vicar Apostolic of the Western District, after consulting a Catholic surgeon in London, declared [...] "that the cure was supernatural and an evident miracle." ...|$|E
