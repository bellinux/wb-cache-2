40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the {{correlation}} between the frequency of errors that seventh grade pupils make in their calculations with <b>fractions</b> and their level of understanding of <b>fractions.</b> <b>Fractions</b> are a relevant and demanding theme in the mathematics curriculum. Although we use <b>fractions</b> on a daily basis, pupils find learning <b>fractions</b> to be very difficult. They generally do not struggle with the concept of <b>fractions</b> itself, but they frequently have problems with mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, comparing and cancelling. The empirical part of the thesis is based on two tests: the first focused on pupils' errors in dealing with <b>fractions</b> and the second focused on the level of understanding <b>fractions.</b> These tests are abridged and adapted versions of the tests from articles Levels of students’ “conception” of <b>fractions</b> (Pantziara, Philippou, 2012) and Algebra students' difficulty with fractions: an error analysis (Brown, Quinn, 2006). The correlation between the number of errors in dealing with <b>fractions</b> and the level of understanding <b>fractions</b> was determined with the Pearson correlation coefficient. ...|$|R
