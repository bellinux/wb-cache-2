PRE-MIER was a multicenter clinical trial testing the effects of two lifestyle interventions on blood pressure control, com-pared with advice only. Both interventions <b>implemented</b> <b>established</b> national guidelines for blood pressure control (weight loss, reduced sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity), and one intervention also included the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Both interventions focused on behavioral self-management, motivational enhancement, and per-sonalized feedback. This article describes the design and evaluation approaches for these interventions. Evaluation of multicomponent lifestyle change interventions can {{help us understand the}} benefits and difficulties of making multiple lifestyle changes concurrently and the effects such changes can have on blood pressure, particularly in minorities at higher risk for hypertension...|$|E

Estimates of the true size and spread of the opiate epidemic are difficult to obtain due to the hidden nature of opiate use however these estimates are vital for policy makers and service providers when planning for the provision of effective treatment services. In a bid to estimate the true size of the epidemic this research focuses on deriving suitable models to estimate the prevalence and incidence of opiate use in Ireland...|$|R

50|$|The Isle of Man {{received}} {{its first two}} fire engines from England in October 1803. These were independently operated by an insurance company, and were horse-drawn and hand-operated. In {{the late nineteenth century}} legislation was introduced permitting town commissioners to establish local fire brigades. The Peel commissioners did so in 1884, followed by Port Erin in 1903 and Laxey in 1920. Some larger settlements, such as Ramsey and Douglas, had entered into local arrangements with the military or with the privately owned insurance company fire brigades, for local fire cover. The outbreak of war brought calls for a unified fire brigade. In February 1940 the Local Government (Fires) Act was <b>implemented,</b> <b>establishing</b> a single Isle of Man Fire Brigade, with seven fire areas - Douglas, Laxey, Ramsey, Kirk Michael, Peel, Port Erin and Castletown. These fire areas are the same today.|$|R
