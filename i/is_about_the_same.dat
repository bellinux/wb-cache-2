He is the fourth member to join the SSS, at which time he had no facial hair. He first met Yuri and Hinata by holding the {{principal}} of the school hostage at gun point in an attempt to learn more about God, causing him to get stabbed by Kanade.|$|E
5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake except {{that it is in}} a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune. It <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size as Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008.|$|E

It comprises a smaller fraction in the crust. It is industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquefied air.|$|E

5|$|The luteal {{phase of}} the menstrual cycle <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length in most {{individuals}} (mean 14.13 days, SD 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, five are looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest {{that the image of}} the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size as Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E

5|$|Students {{living on}} campus occupy a {{dormitory}} {{referred to as}} the , although its correct name is Astraea Dormitory, named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size. It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian {{health care}} system is {{continuously}} faced with a shortage of doctors known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe. In 1995, it was estimated that 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practising in the United States alone, which <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as {{one of the goals of}} the government.|$|E
5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E

5|$|The {{practicality}} of {{this approach}} is questionable with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, which <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E
5|$|Travel {{time from}} Nydalen and Storo {{stations}} {{to the city}} centre stations <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> independent of which direction on the Ring Line travellers choose. Passengers heading for the city centre can therefore take the first train that comes, independent of which direction it is heading, thus giving Nydalen and Storo a five-minute headway service to the city centre. The trains are operated by Sporveien T-banen, a subsidiary of Sporveien, on contract with the public transport authority Ruter.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E
