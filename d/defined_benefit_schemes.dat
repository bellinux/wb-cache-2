5000|$|Pension {{release is}} only {{available}} from a defined contribution pension fund that allows income drawdown, {{which is the}} mechanism that allows tax-free cash to be removed while keeping the rest [...] invested. Members of a [...] defined benefit, or final salary, scheme must transfer to a defined contribution scheme to {{have the option of}} pension release, but advice should be sought before doing so as it can mean relinquishing a number of benefits. The government has announced that only funded <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes</b> will be able to transfer out after April 2015, which will exclude most public sector pensions.|$|E
5000|$|A pension buyout (alternatively buy-out) {{is a type}} of {{financial}} transfer whereby a pension fund sponsor (such as a large company) pays a fixed amount in order to free itself of any liabilities (and assets) relating to that fund. The other party, usually an insurer, receives the payment but takes on responsibility for meeting those liabilities. Since the liabilities associated with a fund, particularly those associated with <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes,</b> are not known precisely {{at the time of the}} buyout (as they depend upon how long the members live and investment returns on the fund assets among other factors), the transaction is regarded as a form of de-risking for the sponsor. From 2006 onwards, buyouts of this sort have become increasingly popular in both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, the extent of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> {{provision}} has declined substantially in the United Kingdom. Whilst most of the {{focus has been on}} deficits relating to past benefit accrual, the increasing cost of future benefit accrual is also important. There are two reasons for this. First, the change in the cost of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> accrual represents the difference in the earnings for employees with membership of a <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme</b> and those with membership of a defined contribution scheme. Second, the current cost of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> accrual gives an indication of the cost of an adequate pension. As such, it can be compared with levels of contribution to defined contribution schemes to determine whether these are adequate. I therefore look at how the cost of pensions has changed relative to the cost of non-pensions earnings. I also look at the main components of the change in pensions cost - those relating to benefits payable, discount rates and longevi ty - to analyse their relative importance. I find that the cost of employing a member of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>scheme</b> has consistently outpaced the cost of employing someone in a defined contribution arrangement. I also find that the current cost of accrual is significantly higher than the average level of payments to defined contribution schemes...|$|R

50|$|The largest form of {{retirement}} fund {{has become the}} 401(k) defined contribution scheme. This is often an individual account that an employer sets up, named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to defer tax on money that is saved in the fund until an employee retires. The individual invariably loses any voice over how shareholder voting rights that their money buys will be exercised. Investment management firms, that are regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and ERISA 1974, will almost always take shareholder voting rights. By contrast, larger and collective pension funds, many still <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes</b> such as CalPERS or TIAA, organize to take voting in house, or to instruct their investment managers. Two main types of pension fund to do this are labor union organized Taft-Hartley plans, and state public pension plans. A major example of a mixture is TIAA, established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918, which requires participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. Under the amended National Labor Relations Act of 1935 §302(c)(5)(B) a union organized plan has to be jointly managed by representatives of employers and employees. Many local pension funds are not consolidated and have had critical funding notices from the Department of Labor. But more funds with beneficiary representation ensure that corporate voting rights are cast according to the preferences of their members. State public pensions are often larger, and have greater bargaining power to use on their members' behalf. State pension schemes usually disclose the way trustees are selected. In 2005, on average {{more than a third}} of trustees were elected by employees or beneficiaries. For example, the California Government Code §20090 requires that its public employee pension fund, CalPERS has 13 members on its board, 6 elected by employees and beneficiaries. However, only pension funds of sufficient size have acted to replace investment manager voting. No federal law requires voting rights for employees in pension funds, despite several proposals. For example, the Joint Trusteeship Bill of 1989, sponsored by Peter Visclosky in the US House of Representatives, would have required all single employer pension plans to have trustees appointed equally by employers and employee representatives. There is also currently no legislation to stop investment managers voting with other people's money, in the way that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 §78f(b)(10) bans broker-dealers voting on significant issues without instructions.|$|E

A particularly knotty issue is the mode of collecting benefits after retirement. It would seem that many retirees prefer programmed withdrawal to annuities without considering their individual circumstances. This portends a dangerous trend for the pension scheme. In this paper we attempt to bring in the individual characteristics into the decision making process by comparing the replacement rates of a potential retiree under the programmed withdrawal with that of life annuity. Our study reveals that life annuity may be the future direction if the scheme is not to face the same fate as the previous <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis describes, {{analyzes}} and {{applies the}} Solvency II on life and pension insurance {{by using the}} standard formulas in the Quantitative Impact Study 5 (QIS 5) to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). We specifically examine the consequences for the Norwegian occupational <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes,</b> primarily for the private sector. The standard formulas in QIS 5 to some extent specify stress scenarios without giving explicit formulas {{as they should be}} exact for the application. We therefore outline exact formulas for the Norwegian occupational <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>schemes.</b> We do this both for the net expected cash flows and for the stressed cash flow. The latter we do by giving a method for calculating the stressed survival and hazard rate functions. We also price the embedded interest rate guarantee using market consistent prices from the Norwegian swaption market. We discuss bonds specifically and redistribution of cash flows generally to improve the precision. Using the contract boundary principle in Solvency II we base our calculations on that all policies are converted to paid up policies. This may primarily be relevant for pension schemes in the private sector. However, formulas for active policies are also given. Additionally one would only need the future risk premiums for market risk. At the end we perform a full QIS 5 consequence study for a Norwegian pension fund, using the outlined formulas and discussing all relevant steps. To support this part we have developed algorithms in Mathematica to perform the necessary calculations...|$|E

40|$|Social {{insurance}} schemes usually carry {{a certain degree}} of implicit redistribution, as certain individuals receive more or less than the monetary equivalents of the contributions they have made. This is usually the case of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> insurance programs. In contrast with traditional designs, Chile has followed a different approach in their pension and unemployment {{insurance schemes}}. In the case of retirement, a structural reform undergone in 1980 replaced the traditional PAYG <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme</b> with a program based on individual accounts and financial savings. Redistribution occurs mainly through an explicit solidarity pillar introduced in 2008, which provides targeted non contributory benefits to individuals with low pensions. The current UI scheme was introduced in 2002 following a similar structure of the pension system but with the inclusion of a solidarity fund. We use contribution histories to compute the level of lifetime redistribution implicit in these two programs. We find essentially no redistribution in the contributory pension pillar but the inclusion of the recently created Solidarity Pillar greatly improves the pension distribution. In contrast, the UI scheme implies fairly limited redistribution – and not necessarily a progressive one – as eligibility conditions are relatively restrictive and tend to favor individuals with relatively stable careers. We also analyze the counterfactual effect of having benefits calculated according to a <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>scheme.</b> To make the two systems comparable, we incorporate a distribution neutral tax schedule (with a fixed tax rate) used to finance the solidarity benefits or the DB scheme deficit. The results show that the neutral financing scheme has only a marginal effect in reducing inequality. In contrast, the DB scheme has only a marginal impact in reducing overall income inequality but a significant redistributive impact in reducing the income gap between men and women...|$|R
