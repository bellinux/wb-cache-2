40|$|Feedback network makes {{resistance}} of field-effect transistor (FET) same for current flowing in <b>either</b> <b>direction.</b> It combines control voltage with source and load voltages to give symmetric current/voltage characteristics. Since circuit produces same magnitude output voltage for current flowing in <b>either</b> <b>direction,</b> it introduces no offset in presense of altering polarity signals. It is therefore ideal for sensor and effector circuits in servocontrol systems...|$|R
