40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> {{models and}} optimal control theory to study power management in energy storage/conversion systems. This topic {{is motivated by}} the need to enhance the performance and longevity of battery electric systems. In particular, the rapid progress in battery material science and energy conversion presents an opportunity to bridge the knowledge gap between electrochemistry and control. Ultimately, this dissertation elucidates the key physical phenomena which enable opportunities to improve performance and battery longevity through control. We address this topic in three phases. First we provide an overview of battery fundamentals and relevant degradation mechanisms. Then we develop mathematical models for the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> phenomena, plug-in hybrid vehicle drivetrain dynamics, and stochastic drive cycle dynamics. A battery-in-the-loop experimental test system is fabricated to identify the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> model. Second, we investigate the battery-health conscious power management problem for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This effort designs controllers to split engine and battery power to minimize both fuel/electricity consumption costs and battery state-of-health degradation. Mathematically, this problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program. The degradation phenomena considered include anode-side solid electrolyte interphase film growth and the "Ah-processed" model. This work is the first to utilize fundamental <b>electrochemical</b> <b>battery</b> models to optimize power management. The final phase proposes a novel battery pack management strategy which investigates the potential health advantages of allowing unequal yet controlled charge levels across batteries connected in parallel. Mathematically, this problem is formulated as a deterministic dynamic program. The optimal solutions reveal that capacity fade can be mitigated through controlled charge unequalization if concavity properties exist in the health degradation dynamics. The sensitivity of these results are analyzed across various degradation models derived from existing literature and experimental data. In total, this dissertation utilizes physics-based battery models to optimize power management in energy storage systems. The unique overarching contribution is a systematic optimal control approach for elucidating the physical electrochemical properties one can exploit through control to enhance battery performance and life. The second and third phases described above demonstrate how this approach can be very useful for PHEV and battery pack management applications...|$|R

An electrochemical battery typically uses two metals, separated into two chambers and connected by a bridge or a membrane which permits the exchange of electrons between the two metals, thereby producing energy. Paper can be integrated into <b>electrochemical</b> <b>batteries</b> by depositing the electrode onto the paper and by using paper to contain the fluid used to activate the battery.

Micro-combustors are an attractive alternate to batteries as they have large surface area to volume ratio, due to which, signiﬁcant amount of heat is transferred through the walls which leads to flame quenching. However, the increased rate of heat transfer through solid walls is advantageous in the case of steam reformers used for hydrogen production.|$|E

Enhanced paper is used as the electrode and as the separator which results in a sturdy, flexible battery that have great performance capabilities such as good cycling, great efficiency, and good reversibility. Using paper as a separator is more effective than using plastic. The process of enhancing the paper, however, can be complicated and costly, depending on the materials used. A carbon nanotube and silver nanowire film can be used to coat regular paper to create a simpler and less expensive separator and battery support.

Lithium-ion paper batteries are flexible, durable, rechargeable, and produce significantly more power than <b>electrochemical</b> <b>batteries.</b> In spite of these advantages, there are still some drawbacks. In order for paper to be integrated with the Li-ion battery, complex layering and insulating techniques are required for the battery to function as desired. One reason these complex techniques are used is to strengthen the paper used so that it does not tear as easily. This contributes to the overall strength and flexibility of the battery. These techniques require time, training, and costly materials. Additionally, the individual materials required are not environmentally friendly and require specific disposal procedures.

The paper is inserted in between the electrode and cathode.The use of a carbon paper as an interlayer in Li-S batteries improves the batteries efficiency and capacity. The carbon paper increases the contact area between the cathode and the electrode which allows for greater flow of electrons. The pores in the paper allow the electrons to travel easily while preventing the anode and the cathode from being in contact with one another. This translates into greater output, battery capacity and cycle stability; these are improvements to conventional Li-S batteries.
