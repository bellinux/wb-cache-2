[...] "Washington, July 19,04 [...] In receipt of your letter asking employment in the Navy <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> [...] I enclosed it to the Secretary of the Navy. [...] He is at present at Baltimore. [...] His answer is that your son can take his station with the midshipmen, and that his first employment will be {{in one of the}} gunboats. [...] You omitted to mention his name, or the warrant would now have been sent. [...] As I set out for Montecello in six days, it will be shorter for you to address the information to Robert Smith, Secretary of the Navy at Baltimore. [...] He will forward the warrant and instructions to whatever place you shall direct. [...] Accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great asteem and respect. [...] Thos Jefferson" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I am surprised, madam,' he {{observed}} with severity, 'that in your old age {{you have the}} face to claim Mr. Bounderby <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course, sir, I shall obey your commands; but {{it seems}} to me an unworthy part <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> to play, to be flying the country and leaving a {{stranger}} here to look after your daughters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "you will be {{instantly}} well, {{if you will}} sit down for half an hour--but half an hour. It is eight hours to dawn, and dawn were time enough <b>for</b> <b>your</b> father's <b>son</b> to begin such a journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} plain, friend Bush," [...] he said, [...] "that {{there are two}} {{opinions}} in this matter; yours <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons,</b> and mine <b>for</b> myself. I see but one amicable way of settling this dispute, which is as follows:--do you make a choice among your boys of any you will, and let us walk off together for the {{matter of a few}} miles into the prairies; the one who stays behind, can never trouble any man's house or his fixen, and the one who comes back may make the best of his way he can, in the good wishes of the young woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The black-browed maid--I {{recollect}} her. Let her e'en {{follow her}} mother. Queen Mary likes a young face, and is kindly disposed to little maids. She taught Bess Pierrepoint to speak French {{and work with}} her needle, and I cannot see that she did the lass any harm, nay, {{she is the only}} one of them all that can rule her tongue to give a soft answer if things go not after her will, and a maid might learn worse things. Besides, your wife will be there to look after the maiden, so you need have no fears. And <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons,</b> they will be at school, and can eat with us." ...|$|R

5000|$|Jean Nougayrol {{thought this}} letter to be a lettre d'envoi. The letter reads (as {{translated}} by W.L.Moran):-------- Say to Mimmuwareya, {{the king of}} Egypt, my brother: Thus Kadašman-Enlil, the king of Karaduniyaš. For me and my country all goes well. <b>For</b> you, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> wives, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>sons,</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> magnates, your horses, your chariots, and your entire country, may all go very well.

6000|$|... "Faith, I know more--much more. I {{can even}} tell you to what house you rode, and on what errand. You were for {{the sign of the}} Anchor in Thames Street, <b>for</b> news of <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> whom Joseph Ashburn hath told you lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't wish to pry {{into your}} affairs, Mrs. Andrews," [...] he said, after {{asking about the}} boys; [...] "but I have a motive <b>for</b> asking if <b>your</b> <b>son</b> has, as I suppose he has, from his way of speaking, had a fair education." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{returned}} I inquired {{after my}} slave and the child. [...] "Your slave is dead," [...] she said, [...] "and as <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> I {{have not seen}} him for two months, and I {{do not know where}} he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was too much, {{it seemed}} to Waterville; Nancy Beck was open to criticism, and he himself had {{declared}} she was a barbarian. Yet she wasn’t horrible. “It’s <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> to pity you. If he doesn’t how can you expect it of others?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I pray you, {{fair and}} honored sir," [...] said Nigel, [...] "that {{you will take}} me <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> this night, that I may handle this matter in the way which seems best. On {{jeopardy}} of my honor I will do all that a man may." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a direct}} one. I {{have kept the}} secret out of {{consideration}} <b>for</b> you and <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> but since I have done so, I ventured to believe you would not refuse me a favour that would only cost you {{a few words to}} your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right to {{keep him}} out of the way. Ethel has been {{disposed}} of these ten years. Did not Anne tell you? How foolish of her! But all mothers like to have young men dying <b>for</b> their daughters. <b>Your</b> <b>son</b> is really the handsomest boy in London. Who is that conceited-looking young man in the window? Mr. Pen--what? has <b>your</b> <b>son</b> really been very wicked? I was told he was a sad scapegrace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I adopt {{you from}} this day," [...] says the Dowager, [...] "and I wish I was richer, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> sake, <b>son</b> Esmond," [...] she {{added with a}} wave of her hand; and as Mr. Esmond dutifully went down on his knee before her ladyship, she cast her eyes up to the ceiling, (the gilt chandelier, and the twelve wax-candles in it, for the party was numerous,) and invoked a blessing from that quarter upon the newly adopted son.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your husband's tranquillity," [...] I added, [...] "is as {{precious}} to me as my own. As <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son,</b> {{you know what he}} thinks of the mother who deserted him.

60|$|SNOW. We {{shall have}} to charge him with the assault, sir. It would be as well <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son</b> {{to come down to}} the Court. There'll be a remand, no doubt. The queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him, and a crimson silk purse.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} where I feel a difficulty," [...] Madame Fontaine replied. [...] "To my mind, sir, Mr. David {{is not at}} all a {{desirable}} companion <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>son.</b> The admirable candor and simplicity of Fritz's disposition might suffer by association with a person of Mr. David's very peculiar character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha, ha, ha! Why, of course, Colebrook. Where else? That's {{the only}} place in the United Kingdom <b>for</b> <b>your</b> long-lost <b>sons.</b> So he sold up his old home in Colchester, and down he comes here. Well, it's a craze, like any other.
