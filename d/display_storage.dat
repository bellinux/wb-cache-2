40|$|Colour and {{oxidative}} {{stability of}} minced meat from fresh and frozen/thawed fallow deer was investigated. For the seven fallow deer harvested, {{half of the}} meat was minced fresh and half was frozen (− 20 °C) for 2 months under vacuum prior to grinding. Surface colour attributes, myoglobin content and surface redox forms, pH and lipid oxidation of the mince were measured during eight days of <b>display</b> <b>storage.</b> Proximate composition was determined in mince on day 0, fatty acid composition on day 0 and 8.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{transition}} process of scattering signals is investigated as an incident monochromatic light irradiates rectangular channels with sizes from micrometers to submicrometers. Monochromatic light scattering from open groove cavities {{is important in}} many design analyses for such fields as optical communications, <b>display,</b> <b>storage,</b> sensing, MENS and nano-technology. The distribution of scattering signals for light incident on the groove starts to change due to the diffraction as the opening width of the groove {{is close to the}} wavelength of monochromatic light. This study revealed {{the transition}} process of scattering signals of monochromatic light irradiating rectangular microchannels with sizes from micrometers to submicrometers. The results showed that the profile for the intensity of scattering signals changes from concave to convex shape in the direction of width and from irregular to regular wave in the direction of depth if the opening width of the rectangular microchannel reduces from micrometer to submicrometer...|$|E
