In this paper we investigate the operational ability and the accuracy of both DIAS models carrying out a metrics-based evaluation of their performance under all possible conditions.

The most challenging and important <b>ionospheric</b> events to <b>forecast</b> are storms.

The aim is to determine whether data assimilation could be used to improve storm time forecast accuracy. The results show that, {{in the case of the}} storm of Halloween 2003, changes made to the model's initial thermospheric conditions improve electron density forecasts by at least 10 % for 18 h, while changes to ionospheric fields alone result in > 10 % forecast accuracy improvement for less than 4 h.

40|$|The Utah State University Gauss-Markov Kalman Filter (GMKF) was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (GAIM) program. The GMKF uses a physics-based model of the ionosphere and a Gauss-Markov Kalman filter as a basis for assimilating a diverse set of real-time (or near real-time) observations. The physics-based model is the <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Forecast</b> Model (IFM), which accounts for five ion species and covers the E region, F region, and the topside from 90 to 1400 km altitude. Within the GMKF, the IFM derived ionospheric densities constitute a background density field on which perturbations are superimposed based on the available data and their errors. In the current configuration, the GMKF assimilates slant total electron content (TEC) from a variable number of global positioning satellite (GPS) ground sites, bottomside electron density (Ne) profiles from a variable number of ionosondes, in situ Ne from four Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, and nighttime line-of-sight ultraviolet (UV) radiances measured by satellites. To test the GMKF for real-time operations and to validate its ionospheric density specifications, we have tested the model performance for a variety of geophysical conditions. During these model runs various combination of data types and data quantities were assimilated.

This study uses tomographically reconstructed electron density profiles (EDPs) from the nightside emissions. The ionospheric reconstruction {{is performed using}} a two-dimensional O+ 1356 Å radiative recombination forward model and discrete inverse theory. The forward model assumes a Chapman layer for the vertical electron density distribution from which h m F 2, N m F 2, and topside scale height are derived for every 90 s limb scan, which is equivalent to 5 ° resolution in latitude. Since ARGOS is in a near Sun-synchronous orbit, these EDPs form a latitude slice through the equatorial anomaly structures at approximately 0230 LT. These data reflect ongoing ionospheric processes, and {{it is necessary to}} assimilate or compare with a model that contains appropriate ionospheric evolution such as the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecast</b> model (IFM). This study addresses the reasonableness of both the reconstructed EDPs and the IFM in describing the equatorial anomalies 2 ̆ 7 diurnal and weather variability. The comparison of the LORASS EDPs with those of IFM for October 2000 show that the EDP reconstruction results compare favorably to the IFM EDPs in peak height and topside scale height. Additionally, the sector-to-sector climatology of the observed and modeled equatorial anomalies is similar to within the resolution of the instrument and model. The variability observed in each pass of the satellite is much larger than the IFM variability.

40|$|The September 1999 Caribbean Ionospheric Campaign (CIC 99), {{spanning}} the period 15 – 17 September 1999, {{was a period}} of repeated moderate geomagnetic storms. Both incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and digisonde F-layer measurements were made in the vicinity of Arecibo, Puerto Rico by the Arecibo ISR and Ramey Digisonde, {{which is one of the}} Digital Ionospheric Sounding System instruments. These data sets showed significant day-to-day F-layer variability, especially in the evening sectors. Local ionospheric data assimilation with the Assimilation Ionospheric Model (AIM 1. 06 L) was able to reproduce this ionospheric day-to-day weather. However, during this time the Arecibo ISR was able to determine that strong latitude density gradients existed in the evening sector. These latitude gradients ranged from 5 % to over 10 % per degree of latitude, increasing equatorward. The climatological <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecast</b> model (IFM) predicts gradients of the correct sign but significantly less than 5 % per degree. Using the observed fact that the strong local vertical plasma drift was produced by an eastward electric field, an enhanced equatorial electric field model was created. This model was used to drive the IFM-E model. The effect of the enhanced electric field is to drive plasma flux tubes to higher latitudes and effectively move the poleward shoulder of the equatorial anomalies to higher latitudes. In this simulation, the simulated Arecibo density gradients range from 10 % to 20 % per degree. In addition, the local densities at Arecibo are now higher than the observed ones in the evening sector. The irony of this study is that the local AIM 1. 06 L assimilation provides the correct local densities in the F region but is based upon the assumption of corotating field lines. When the plasma flux tubes are free to be E×B/B 2 convected, as in the IFM equator model simulations, the local densities are too high. However, gradients in latitude are more realistic although somewhat larger than observed. This latter simulation is based on “better” physics than the AIM 1. 06 L, but because the latitude (apex altitude) distribution of the eastward electric field driver is uncertain, it produces poor assimilation results. This study points to the need for more extended latitude coverage in the CIC campaigns in order to address the issue of a minimum data requirement for the assimilation...|$|E

In-service models of ionospheric parameters often fail to offer much {{of an increase in}} performance over simple persistence or recurrence. In particular, predictions of storm events and disturbances are very poor. This performance shortfall can be attributed to several causes one of which is an inability to adequately model solar-magnetospheric-ionospheric physics. To circumvent this knowledge gap some authors have adopted knowledge independent (time-series) modelling techniques that can utilise typical ionospheric data sets. A number of experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated the importance of non-linear behaviour within the solar-terrestrial environment. Attention has also turned to time series predictive methods derived from studies into artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of neural network (NN) based techniques to geophysical prediction problems.

30|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain better VTEC maps by forecasting {{in the short term}} than those derived from empirical models. Several methods have been developed for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecasting</b> in recent years, such as the autocorrelation method (Muhtarov and Kutiev 1999), the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) method (Krankowski et al. 2005), a method based on neural networks (Tulunay et al. 2006), and an autoregressive model for predicting VTEC values (Karthik et al. 2012). However, many predictions are investigated at a certain location or over a regional area. In terms of global <b>ionospheric</b> VTEC maps <b>forecasting,</b> the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), an IAAC, has provided predicted ionospheric products (one- and two-day-ahead VTEC maps, named C 1 PG and C 2 PG, respectively) for public access since 2008, via the FTP server of the Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS, ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Shortly afterward, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) released their two-day-ahead VTEC maps through the FTP server of CDDIS, as well. Least-squares collocation (LSC) is used by CODE to extrapolate the coefficients of spherical harmonics (SH) for predicting VTEC maps (Schaer 1999). UPC VTEC forecasting is based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT) technique (García-Rigo et al. 2011). Moreover, a linear regression module is used to forecast the DCT coefficients and predict VTEC maps. Unlike the two methods above, the development of adaptive autoregressive modeling (AARM) for the prediction of global ionospheric VTEC maps will be presented in this manuscript. The first section of the manuscript is devoted to a detailed explanation of the AARM for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecasting.</b> The performance of AARM forecasting is investigated through a comparison between VTEC map predictions and IGS final products.

IFERM is based on 13 short term <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecasting</b> empirical local models (IFELM) developed to predict foF 2 at 13 ionospheric observatories scattered around the European area. The forecasting procedures were developed by taking into account, hourly measurements of foF 2, hourly quiet-time reference values of foF 2 (foF 2 QT), and the hourly time-weighted accumulation series derived from the geomagnetic planetary index ap, (ap(τ)), for each observatory. Under the assumption that the ionospheric disturbance index ln(foF 2 /foF 2 QT) is correlated to the integrated geomagnetic disturbance index ap(τ), a set of statistically significant regression coefficients were established for each observatory, over 12 months, over 24 h, and under 3 different ranges of geomagnetic activity. This data was then used as input to compute short-term <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecasting</b> of foF 2 at the 13 local stations under consideration. The empirical storm-time ionospheric correction model (STORM) was used to predict foF 2 in two different ways: scaling both the hourly median prediction provided by IRI (STORM_foF 2 MED,IRI model), and the foF 2 QT values (STORM_foF 2 QT model) from each local station. The comparison between the performance of STORM_foF 2 MED,IRI, STORM_foF 2 QT, IFELM, and the foF 2 QT values, was {{made on the basis of}} root mean square deviation (r. m. s.) for a large number of periods characterized by moderate, disturbed, and very disturbed geomagnetic activity.

STORM_foF 2 MED,IRI performs particularly well in central Europe during the equinoctial months under moderate geomagnetic conditions and during the summer months under very disturbed geomagnetic conditions. The forecasting maps generated by IFERM on the basis of the results provided by the 13 IFELM, show very large areas located at middle-high and high latitudes where the foF 2 predictions quite faithfully match the foF 2 measurements, and consequently IFERM can be used for generating short-term forecasting maps of foF 2 (up to 3 h ahead) over the European area...|$|R

The upgraded implementation plan expands SWIF’s capabilities in the high latitude ionosphere while the extensive validation tests in the two solar cycles 23 and 24 allow the comprehensive analysis of the model’s performance in all terms. Focusing on disturbed conditions, the results demonstrate that SWIF’s alert detection algorithm forecasts the occurrence of ionospheric storm time disturbances with probability of detection up to 98 % under intense geomagnetic storm conditions and up to 63 % when storms of moderate intensity are also considered. The forecasts show relative improvement over climatology of about 30 % in middle-to-low and high latitudes and 40 % in middle-to-high latitudes. This indicates that SWIF is able to capture on average more than one third (35 %) of the storm-associated ionospheric disturbances. Regarding the accuracy, the averaged mean relative error during storm conditions usually ranges around 20 % in middle-to-low and high latitudes and 24 % in the middle-to-high latitudes.

This study focuses on the reliable prediction of f(o) F(2) during geomagnetic storms, which is important for practical applications {{as well as for}} further understanding of the storm dynamics. In this paper, we investigate whether f(o) F(2) during disturbed geomagnetic conditions at a single station can be well predicted one hour ahead by using some inputs to an SVM network, such as the latest f(o) F(2) observations, hourly quiet time f(o) F(2) (f(o) F(2 QT)), time, and the hourly time-weighted accumulation series derived from the geomagnetic index (ap(tau)). The input observation data cover the period of January 1958 to December 2000 at Lanzhou (36. 1 degrees N, 104. 0 degrees E) in China. The f(o) F(2) forecasted by the ELIFMOL are compared with the monthly median values and with those by the STORMMEDIAN model, the persistence model, and the STORMfoF 2 QT model during geomagnetic storms occurring from 2001 to 2006. As for the data sets used in this paper, the results show that the performance of ELIFMOL is better than that of the latter models...|$|R
40|$|The daily {{variability}} of the ionosphere can greatly affect HF or SATCOM communications. HF skywave operators plan frequency schedules months in advance, however, they also require daily {{knowledge of the}} ionospheric conditions in order to modify assignments. SATCOM operators also require daily information about the levels of scintillation, which are variations in phase, amplitude, polarisation and angle of arrival that can cause severe degradation of the received signal. Using a number of ionosonde measurements and geomagnetic and solar values, a Daily <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Forecasting</b> Service (DIFS) has been developed, which provides HF and SATCOM operators with daily <b>forecasts</b> of predicted <b>ionospheric</b> conditions. The system uses in-house algorithms and an externally developed Global Ionospheric Scintillation Model (GISM) to generate HF and SATCOM forecasts. HF forecasts consist of a past summary and a forecast section, primarily displaying observed values and predicted categories for the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), {{as well as an}} Ionospheric Correction factor (ICF) that can be fed into the ionospheric propagation prediction tool, WinHF. SATCOM forecasts give predictions of global scintillation levels, for the polar, mid and equatorial latitude regions.

40|$|Conditions in the {{ionosphere}} {{have become}} increasingly important to forecast, since more and more spaceborne and ground-based technological systems rely on ionospheric weather. Here we explore the feasibility of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecasts</b> with {{the current generation of}} physics-based models. In particular, we focus on total electron content (TEC) predictions using the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM). Simulations are configured in a forecast mode and performed for four typical high-speed-stream events during 2007 – 2012. The simulated TECs are quantified through a metric, which divides the globe into a number of local regions and robustly differentiates between quiet and disturbed periods. Proposed forecast products are hourly global maps color-coded by the TEC disturbance level of each local region. To assess the forecasts, we compare the simulated TEC disturbances with global TEC maps derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite observations. The forecast performance is found to be merely acceptable, with a large number of regions where the observed variations are not captured by the simulations. Examples of model-data agreements and disagreements are investigated in detail, aiming to understand the model behavior and improve future forecasts. For one event, we identify two adjacent regions with similar TEC observations but significant differences in how local chemistry versus plasma transport contribute to electron density changes in the simulation. Suggestions for further analysis are described...|$|R
30|$|An {{operational}} {{model was}} developed for <b>forecasting</b> <b>ionospheric</b> variations and storms at Kokubunji (35 ⊙N, 139 ⊙E), 24 hours in advance, by using a neural network. The ionospheric critical frequency (foF 2) shows periodic variabilities from days to the solar cycle length and also shows sporadic changes known as ionospheric storms caused by geomagnetic storms (of solar disturbance origin). The neural network was trained for the target parameter of foF 2 at each local time and input parameters of solar flux, sunspot number, day of the year, Kindex at Kakioka. The training was conducted using the data obtained for the period from 1960 to 1984. The method was validated for the period from 1985 to 2003. The trained network {{can be used for}} daily <b>forecasting</b> <b>ionospheric</b> variations including storms using prompt daily reports of K-index, sunspot number, and solar flux values available on-line.|$|R

40|$|Ionospheric storms {{can have}} {{important}} effects on radio communications and navigation systems. Storm time ionospheric predictions {{have the potential}} to form part of effective mitigation strategies to these problems. Ionospheric storms are caused by strong forcing from the solar wind. Electron density enhancements are driven by penetration electric fields, as well as by thermosphere-ionosphere behavior including Traveling Atmospheric Disturbances and Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances and changes to the neutral composition. This study assesses the effect on 1 h predictions of specifying initial ionospheric and thermospheric conditions using total electron content (TEC) observations under a fixed set of solar and high-latitude drivers. Prediction performance is assessed against TEC observations, incoherent scatter radar, and in situ electron density observations. Corotated TEC data provide a benchmark of forecast accuracy. The primary case study is the storm of 10 September 2005, while the anomalous storm of 21 January 2005 provides a secondary comparison. The study uses an ensemble Kalman filter constructed with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed and the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. Maps of preprocessed, verticalized GPS TEC are assimilated, while high-latitude specifications from the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics and solar flux observations from the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment are used to drive the model. The filter adjusts ionospheric and thermospheric parameters, making use of time-evolving covariance estimates. The approach is effective in correcting model biases but does not capture all the behavior of the storms. In particular, a ridge-like enhancement over the continental USA is not predicted, indicating the importance of predicting storm time electric field behavior to the problem of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>forecasting...</b>|$|R

Our analysis is focused on choice of X parts of NNARX model in order to capture middle and long term dependencies. Daily distribution of prediction error suggests need for structural changes of the neural network model, as well as adaptation of running average lengths used for determination of X inputs. Generalisation properties of proposed neural predictor are improved by carefully designed pruning procedure with additional regularisation term in criterion function.
