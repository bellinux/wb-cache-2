5|$|Alan Stern <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that {{location}} should not matter {{and that only}} geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite.|$|E
5|$|Connolly <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that they}} were armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly {{because they could not}} have carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time as}} a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|Lanchester, County Durham: Andrew Breeze <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> for Lanchester, {{since the}} Roman fort of Longovicium overlooks {{the point where}} the road known as Dere Street crossed the River Browney.|$|E
50|$|Many {{scholarly}} and popular interpreters <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that a prophecy {{may have a}} dual fulfillment; others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{for the possibility of}} multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies.|$|R
50|$|The detainees'defense <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not be}} used in Kuwaiti courts, because the detainees and interrogators hadn't signed them.Further, they <b>had</b> <b>argued,</b> the allegations the USA had directed at them weren't violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
50|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{that governments}} treated this crisis {{as one of}} {{investor}} confidence rather than deeply indebted institutions unable to lend, delaying the appropriate remedies. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that this crisis represents a reset of economic activity, rather than a recession or cyclical downturn.|$|R
5|$|Mike Huben <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that were}} Assassination Politics {{ever to be}} {{accepted}} then governments would merely operate secretly (critiques of libertarianism). Almost all commentary so far {{has focused on the}} first nine parts of the essay and there is little on part 10.|$|E
5|$|Post-Skilling, some {{courts have}} held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, while others {{have held that}} they may not. Prof. Coffee <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that honest {{services}} fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E
5|$|Rapoport <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that Sorabji's {{reluctance}} to make commercial recordings {{of his music}} stemmed from a fear of losing control over the making of future recordings of it, because of UK copyright laws of the time.|$|E
50|$|The detainees defense <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not be}} used in Kuwaiti courts, because the detainees and interrogators had not signed them. Furthermore, they <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> that the allegations the USA had directed at them were not violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
50|$|Unfair {{dismissal}} is now {{governed by}} the Labour Relations Act. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the Labour Relations Act undermines the flexibility required for the free market to exist. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that a restrictive labour law promotes job security, loyalty and incorporation into companies.|$|R
50|$|Scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{about the}} {{original}} function of this ivory, {{whether it was}} the tip of a scepter, or the grip on the lid of a casket containing a crown. However, recent scholars <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the ivory was in fact a ceremonial comb made probably for the Emperor Leo VI.|$|R
5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the lack}} of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

5|$|Greek mythology {{has changed}} over time to {{accommodate}} the evolution of their culture, of which mythology, both overtly and in its unspoken assumptions, is an index of the changes. In Greek mythology's surviving literary forms, as found mostly {{at the end of}} the progressive changes, it is inherently political, as Gilbert Cuthbertson <b>has</b> <b>argued.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} pandemic, when {{combined}} with {{the increasing number of}} women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating {{that he was one}} of the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The proper arsenic MCL {{continues}} to be debated. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the 10 ppb federal standard is still too high, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits; New Jersey has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> {{that finding}} {{should not be}} a {{province}} for the criminal law system but that any dispute as to ownership be left to resolution via a civil suit. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that the jurisprudence gives rise to legal fictions and strained reasoning which has attracted divergent statutory law reform in different jurisdictions.|$|R

5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that {{religious}} language is often political, {{especially in the}} public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|James Richard Ellis <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the}} incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if {{she and her father}} were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
5|$|Molly Haskell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that nevertheless, {{women are}} mostly {{uncritical}} of the scene, {{and that by}} and large it is consistent with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and insist on having sexual intercourse.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{similarities}} {{in the pattern of}} neurofibrillary tangles in PART, some scientists <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that they represent the same phenomenon. [...] However, others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that sufficient evidence exists to conclude that PART represents a pathological process. [...] Should this be the case, it would have important implications with respect to developing diagnostics and therapeutics.|$|R
50|$|Subiaul {{and colleagues}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> that {{these results are}} {{consistent}} with the hypothesis that imitation learning is domain-specific, not domain-general. A critical caveat my be that the imitation of NOVEL rules and responses is domain-specific while the imitation of FAMILIAR responses is likely to be mediated by domain-general, non-specialized mechanisms, as Heyes and others <b>have</b> <b>argued.</b>|$|R

5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing {{his case}} {{primarily}} on {{an analysis of}} Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about {{the authenticity of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, NMP Paulin Tay Straughan <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that NMPs, being non-partisan, do not replace either PAP or {{opposition}} MPs. During general elections, Singaporeans still continue to elect MPs who best represent their interests, and NMPs do not {{feature in the}} equation. In other words, the NMP scheme has never compromised the democratic process of free elections.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> that the rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would constitute a welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
