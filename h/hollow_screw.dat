40|$|Background: Although {{stimulus}} evoked electromyography (EMG) {{is commonly}} used to confirm the accuracy of pedicle screw placement. There are no studies to differentiate between solid <b>screws</b> and <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> to the electrical resistance of pedicle screws. We speculate that the electrical resistance of the solid and <b>hollow</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> may be different and then a potential source of error with stimulus-evoked EMG may happen. Materials and Methods: Resistance measurements were obtained from 12 pedicle screw varieties (6 screws of each manufacturer) across the screw shank based on known constant current and measured voltage. The voltage was measured 5 times at each site. Results: Resistance of all solid screws ranged from 0. 084 Omega to 0. 151 Omega (mean = 0. 118 +/- 0. 024 Omega) and <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> ranged from 0. 148 Omega to 0. 402 Omega (mean = 0. 285 +/- 0. 081 Omega). There {{was a significant difference}} of resistance between the solid <b>screws</b> and <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> (P < 0. 05). The screw with the largest diameter no matter solid <b>screws</b> or <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> had lower resistance than screws with other diameters. No matter in solid <b>screws</b> group or <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> group, there were significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the 5. 0 mm screws and 6. 0 mm screws, 6. 0 mm screws and 7. 0 mm screws, 5. 0 mm screws and 7. 0 mm screws, 4. 5 mm screws and 5. 5 mm screws, 5. 5 mm screws and 6. 5 mm screws, 4. 5 mm screws and 6. 5 mm screws. The resistance of <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> was much larger than the solid screws in the same diameter group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: <b>Hollow</b> pedicle <b>screws</b> have the potential for high electrical resistance compared to the solid pedicle screws and therefore may affect the EMG response during stimulus-evoked EMG testing in pedicle screw fixation especially in minimally invasive percutaneous pedical screw fixation surgery.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{efficacy of}} open reduction and internal fixation with the miniplate and <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> {{in the treatment}} of Lisfranc injury. Methods: Ten cases of Lisfranc injury treated by open reduction, miniplate and <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. There were 6 males and 4 females with age ranging from 25 to 45 years (mean 32 years). Among them, one case was classified as Type A, six Type B and three Type C. Injury mechanism included road traffic accidents (3 cases), fall from height (5 cases) and hit by heavy object (2 cases). All injuries were closed without cerebral trauma or other complicated injuries. The time interval between injury and operation was 6 e 10 days (average 6. 6 days). Postoperatively, the foot function was assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Scales. Healing time and complications were observed. Results: All patients were followed up for 18 e 24 months (average 20 months). Anatomic reduction was achieved in all patients on images. There was statistical significance between preoperative score (7. 89 ± 0. 34) and score at postoperative 8 weeks (0. 67 ± 0. 13). According to the AOFAS score, 5 cases were defined as excellent, 3 cases as good and 2 cases as fair. During follow-up, there was no wound infection or complications except for osteoarthritis in 2 cases. Healing time ranged from 3 to 6 months with an average of 3. 6 months. Conclusion: Anatomical reduction of Lisfranc injury can be achieved by open reduction and internal fixation with the miniplate and <b>hollow</b> <b>screw.</b> Normal structure of Lisfranc joint is regained to a great extent; injured ligaments were also repaired.

Methods: Case-controlled studies (CCTs) were used to compare the two operative methods in the treatment of femoral neck fractures. Data were retrieved from the Cochrane Library, Pubmed Database, CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Database. Wanfang Data published during the period of January 2005 to December 2014. Methodological quality of the trials was critically assessed, and relevant data were extracted. Statistical Software Revman 5. 0 was used for data-analysis. Results: Eight articles were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that there was statistical significance in the rate of fracture healing [OR =  5. 43, 95 % CI (2. 89, 10. 20), p <  0. 05], the rate of good function of hip joint [OR =  5. 12, 95 % CI (3. 21, 8. 17), p <  0. 05], the rate of femoral head necrosis [OR =  4. 21, 95 % CI (2. 02, 8. 76), p <  0. 05], the time of fracture healing [WMD = − 46. 85, 95 % CI (− 65. 13, − 28. 56), p <  0. 05] between the two groups.

40|$|The {{prosthetic}} {{component of}} dental implant is attached on the abutment which {{is connected to}} the fixture with an abutment screw. The abutment screw fracture is not frequent; however, the retrieval of the fractured screw is not easy, and it poses complications.

30|$|Other {{surgical}} techniques {{sometimes do}} not provide proper healing of the acromion; e.g., when the acromion is so thin that insertion of a <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> is impossible. In this situation, an osteosynthesis plate can be used instead. As with every ORIF approach, the technique of using a patient-customized plate may have the disadvantage of causing hardware irritation (Harris et al., 2011). Another limitation is its higher cost (Martelli et al., 2016). We compared the costs of our technique and of an ORIF using cannulated screws and tension band. The total costs of the DePuy Synthes materials necessary for the hollow-screw fixation were approximately 540 euros, while those for our technique were approximately 900 euros. Our technique is obviously more expensive even when the costs for the digital preparation and in-house 3 D printing were not considered. In Belgium, however, most of these costs for implants are refunded; thus, the extra cost of the LCP plate and screws to the patients was only 105.10 euros. Further investigations are necessary to obtain an accurate estimate of all costs and not just those of the materials.|$|E

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twelve partially edentulous patients were consecutively enrolled in private specialist practice and divided into three groups according to their initial periodontal condition: PHP, moderate PCP and severe PCP. Perio and implant treatment was carried out as needed. Solid <b>screws</b> (S), <b>hollow</b> <b>screws</b> (HS) and <b>hollow</b> cylinders (HC) were installed to support fixed prostheses, after successful completion of initial periodontal therapy (full-mouth plaque score or = 3 mm, was, respectively, 4. 7 % for PHP, 11. 2 % for moderate PCP and 15. 1 % for severe PCP, with a statistically significant difference between PHP and severe PCP (P< 0. 05). Lack of adhesion to SPT was correlated with a higher incidence of bone loss and implant loss. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of periodontitis presented a lower survival rate and a statistically significantly higher number of sites with peri-implant bone loss. Furthermore, PCP, who did not completely adhere to the SPT, were found to present a higher implant failure rate.

40|$|Background: The open {{reduction}} {{with internal}} fixation {{is an effective}} approach for treatment of avulsion fracture of posterior cruciate ligament. The previously used internal fixation materials including <b>hollow</b> <b>screws,</b> absorbable screw, tension bands and sutures have great defects such as insufficient fixation strength, susceptibility to re-fracture, etc. Stellate steel plate is novel material for internal fixation which has unique gear-like structure design. We used stellate steel plate for treatment of displaced avulsion fractures of posterior cruciate ligament in this study. Materials and Methods: 14 patients (9 men, 5 women; aged, 19 - 35 years; mean age, 28 years) with displaced avulsion fractures of the tibial insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament were retrospectively analyzed between June 2009 and June 2011. The mean duration from injury to the operation was 8. 3 days (range 6 - 15 days). All the patients were treated with open reduction and internal fixation of a stellate steel plate (DePuy, Raynham, MA 02767, USA). The Lysholm-Tegner knee function score criteria were used to analyze results. Results: The mean followup was 24. 6 months (range 18 - 32 months). After 6 months, all the fractures healed and knee joint activity was normal, with no knee stiffness or instability. The Lysholm-Tegner scores were 97. 1 ± 1. 7 points at the final followup.

Material and methods: In 89 dental patients treated comprehensively, a total of 112 <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> (HS), 49 hollow cylinder (HC) and 18 angulated hollow cylinder (AHC) implants were installed depending on the available bone volume and according to prosthetic needs. One and 10 years after surgical placement, clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed. The incidences of peri-implantitis according to various thresholds were registered over 10 years of maintenance. Results: Success criteria at 10 years were set at: pocket probing depth (PPD) ≤ 5 mm, bleeding on probing (BoP) -, bone loss < 0. 2 mm annually. The survival rate for HS was 95. 4 %, for HC 85. 7 % and for AHC 91. 7 %. Ninety {{percent of all the}} HS, 71 % of the HC and 88 % of the AHC did not present with an incidence of peri-implantitis over the 10 years, HC having significantly higher incidence of peri-implantitis than HS (P< 0. 004). With the success criteria set above, a success rate for HS of 74 %, for HC of 63 % and for AHC of 61 % was identified at 10 years. However, including a definition of PPD ≤ 6 mm, BoP - and bone loss < 0. 2 mm annually for success, the rates for HS were 78 %, for HC 65 % and for AHC 67 %, respectively. Basing success criteria purely on clinical parameters (without radiographic analysis), such as: PPD ≤ 5 mm and BoP-, the success rates increased to 90 %, 76 % and 89 %, respectively. With PPD ≤ 6 mm and BoP - as success criteria chosen, the respective rates were 94 %, 82 % and 94 % for HS, HC and AHC implants, respectively. Conclusions: A significantly higher survival rate as well as a significantly lower incidence of peri-implantitis was identified for <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> design ITI® Dental Implants after 10 years of service when compared to hollow cylinder design ITI® Dental Implants (95. 4 % vs. 85. 7 %; 10 % vs. 29 %).

5000|$|His [...] "Armstrong screw" [...] breech {{involved}} {{loading the}} shell and gunpowder propellant charge in a cloth bag through the <b>hollow</b> breech <b>screw,</b> lowering a heavy block {{into a slot}} behind the powder chamber and screwing the breech screw tightly against the block to lock it in place. A degree of obturation was achieved via a cup {{on the face of}} the block being forced into a recessed ring on the chamber face. The system was in effect a vertical sliding block such as later used by Krupp in both horizontal and vertical form, with the crucial difference that Armstrong failed to make the progression to loading the powder charge in a metal cartridge, with the result that complete obturation was impossible.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of ultra intense laser technology, MeV ions from the laser foil interaction have been obtained by different mechanisms, such as target normal sheath acceleration, radiation pressure acceleration, collisionless shock acceleration, breakout afterburner, and a combination of different mechanisms. These energetic ion beams can be applied in fast ignition for inertial confinement fusion, medical therapy, and proton imaging. However, these ions are mainly accelerated in the laser propagation direction, and the ion acceleration in an azimuthal orientation is scarcely mentioned. Here, a doughnut Laguerre Gaussian LG laser {{is used for the}} first time to study the laser plasma interaction in the relativistic intensity regime in three dimensional particle in cell simulations. Studies have shown that a novel rotation of the plasma is produced from the <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> like drill of a LG mode laser. The angular momentum of the protons in the longitudinal direction produced by the LG laser is remarkably enhanced compared with that produced by the usual laser pulses, such as linearly and circularly polarized gaussian pulses. Moreover, the particles, including electrons and ions, can be trapped and uniformly compressed in the dark central minimum of the doughnut LG pulse. Such hollow structured LG laser may be used to investigate some difficult problems, such as screw like drilling in the inertial confinement fusion, laser driven particle accelerations, and pulsars in the astrophysical environment.

40|$|Abstract Background Owing to the {{complexity}} and magnitude of functional forces transferred to the bone-implant interface, the mechanical strength of the interface is of great importance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the intraosseous torsional shear strength of an osseointegrated oral implant using 3 -D finite element (FE) stress analysis implemented by in vivo failure torque data of an implant. Methods A Ø 3. 5 mm × 12 mm ITI ® <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> dental implant in a patient was subjected to torque failure test using a custom-made strain-gauged manual torque wrench connected to a data acquisition system. The 3 -D FE model of the implant and peri-implant circumstances was constructed. The in vivo strain data was converted to torque units (N. cm) to involve in loading definition of FE analysis. Upon processing of the FE analysis, the shear stress of peri-implant bone was evaluated to assume torsional shear stress strength of the bone-implant interface. Results The in vivo torque failure test yielded 5952 μstrains at custom-made manual torque wrench level and conversion of the strain data resulted in 750 N. cm. FE revealed that highest shear stress value in the trabecular bone, 121 MPa, was located at the first intimate contact with implant. Trabecular bone in contact with external surface of hollow implant body participated shear stress distribution, but not the bone resting inside of the hollow. Conclusion The torsional strength of hollow-screw implants is basically provided by the marginal bone and the hollow part has negligible effect on interfacial shear strength. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 1988, an implant {{manufacturer}} {{offered a}} new dental implant system, {{with a wide}} choice of hollow cylinder (HC) and <b>hollow</b> <b>screw</b> (HS) implants. The purpose of this retrospective study of HS and HC implants was to evaluate clinical and radiographic parameters of peri-implant tissue and to analyze surgical and prosthetic aftercare. Methods: A total of 89 HS and 26 HC implants in 38 edentulous patients were available for complete evaluation. The patients were treated with overdentures stabilized by two or four implants. The follow-up period was 10 years. Results: The results of the clinical evaluation showed a mean sulcus probing depth of 3. 3 +/- 1. 3 mm (range = 2 to 10 mm). The mean radiographic bone loss was 2. 2 +/- 2. 1 mm (range = 0. 1 to 12. 2 mm). One implant (HS) was removed during the osseointegration period. Three other implants (two HS and one HC) in three patients {{had to be removed}} after 10 years. The survival rate of the HS implant (96. 6 %) was comparable to the HC implant (96. 1 %). The success rate of the HS implant (93. 3 %) was slightly more favorable compared to the HC implant (88. 5 %). The HS and HC implants met the Albrektsson criteria of success. Conclusions: HS and HC implants provide a stable base for long-term support of a mandibular overdenture. Furthermore, it is important to monitor peri-implant bone level by taking annual radiographs and measuring probing depth, especially after prolonged service...|$|E

They can also be {{attached}} by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, <b>hollow</b> machine <b>screw.</b> The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe kick board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick board. This toe kick board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.|$|R
