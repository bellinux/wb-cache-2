50|$|In the 1920s, the Hawthorne Works Western Electric factory {{commissioned}} {{the first of}} what was to become known as the Hawthorne Studies. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, <b>Elton</b> <b>Mayo</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> job performance and the so-called Hawthorne Effect was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content. Following the Hawthorne Studies motivation became a focal point in the OB community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable OB researchers such as: Frederick Herzberg, Abraham Maslow, David McClelland, Victor Vroom, and Douglas McGregor. These theories underline employee motivation, work performance, and job satisfaction.|$|E

5000|$|Mayo, in {{communicating}} to business leaders, advanced {{the idea that}} managers who {{understand the nature of}} informal ties among workers can make decisions for management's benefit. <b>Mayo</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> people's work performance is dependent on both social relationships and job content. He suggested a tension between workers' [...] "logic of sentiment" [...] and managers' [...] "logic of cost and efficiency" [...] which could lead to conflict within organizations.|$|R
5000|$|Fritz J. Roethlisberger, Mayo's {{graduate}} assistant, and William J. Dickson, {{head of the}} Department of Employee Relations at Western Electric, {{conducted the}} bulk of the practical research, with Mayo rarely visiting the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois. Mayo's team carried out a number of [...] "experiments" [...] to look at ways of improving productivity. The research involved manipulating length of rest and lunch periods and piecework payment plans. <b>Mayo</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> productivity partly depended on the informal social patterns of interaction in the work group.|$|R
40|$|Mayo {{also goes}} at length {{to review the}} travails of state {{sponsored}} education, especially its forays in the coordination of adult literacy programmes, community learning, and prison education. Ample space is allocated {{to the role of}} adult education in promoting vocational and workers’ education through the Employment & Training Corporation and MCAST, the input of the University of Malta to adult education, as well as the various church and catholic inspired forms of adult education. <b>Mayo</b> <b>concludes</b> <b>that,</b> despite these interesting developments, adult education still remains the ‘Cinderella’ sector of the Maltese educational system. Although one must read Mayo’s monograph in full to empathise fully with such judgement, it suffices to say that Malta still lacks a public National Strategy for Lifelong Learning. peer-reviewe...|$|R

One passed through great cotton district of Oomravuttee (present day Amravati) and was extended up to Nagpore (present day Nagpur) and then to Raj-nandgaon in Drug district (Present day Durg). The other was extended up to Jubbulpore (present day Jabalpur) {{to connect with the}} Allahabad-Jubbulpore branch line of the East Indian Railway which had been opened in June 1867. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. The Howrah-Allahabad-Mumbai line was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and {{it was part of the}} inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days.
