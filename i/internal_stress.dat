25|$|Even {{though the}} {{reactive}} centrifugal is rarely used in analyses in the physics literature, {{the concept is}} applied within some mechanical engineering concepts. An example {{of this kind of}} engineering concept is an analysis of the stresses within a rapidly rotating turbine blade. The blade can be treated as a stack of layers going from the axis out {{to the edge of the}} blade. Each layer exerts an outward (centrifugal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially inward layer and an inward (centripetal) force on the immediately adjacent, radially outward layer. At the same time the inner layer exerts an elastic centripetal force on the middle layer, while and the outer layer exerts an elastic centrifugal force, which results in an <b>internal</b> <b>stress.</b> It is the stresses in the blade and their causes that mainly interest mechanical engineers in this situation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of plastic strains and correlated <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> on the magnetic properties of a non-oriented 3 %Si-Fe alloy. We first studied the mechanical behaviour of the material and evaluated the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> which occur with the strengthening. The alloy exhibits an isotropic mechanical behaviour and three stages of straining. The <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> are evidenced thanks to tensile / compressive tests : a high initial increase followed by a gradual one is observed. The <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> {{are linked to the}} drop of stress at the first stages of the deformation and to the heterogeneous structures of dislocations at higher plastic strain levels. The effect of the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> on the magnetic properties is then discussed. A suitable magnetic frame has been manufactured. Magnetic characteristics are investigated along either the tensile or cross directions. The magnetic properties strongly decrease {{from the beginning of the}} plastic strain. Crossing experiments indicate an attenuated effect of the plastic strain on the magnetic properties compared to the colinear measurements. This directionnal effect, called "magnetoplastic anisotropy" seems to be directly linked to the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Young’s modulus and damping {{coefficient}} measurements performed on various materials {{by means of}} dynamic resonant method in free bending mode, exhibit transient effects during first heating, {{while there is no}} obvious structural evolution. It has been more particularly observed on sintered and rolled bulk materials as well as coated materials.

The measurement of the resonance frequency shift associated to this release {{and the development of a}} model of beam vibration integrating the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> allow the estimation of the initial level of <b>internal</b> <b>stresses.</b> The mechanical model comes from the application of Hamilton principle minimizing potential and kinetic energies described by the Lagrangian of the vibrating system. Then, the effect of <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> is introduced, based on a model of pre-stressed vibrating beam found in literature.

2500|$|The {{preferred}} form of LSD for drifting is {{the clutch}} type, in [...] "two-way" [...] form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under all conditions (acceleration and deceleration). Some drift cars use a spool [...] "differential", which actually has no differential action at all - the wheels are locked to each other. Budget-minded drifters may use a welded differential, where the side gears are welded {{to give the}} same effect as a spool. This {{makes it easier to}} break rear traction because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an inherent risk involved: due to the tremendous amount of <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the Torsen or Quaife (available on cars in certain stock trims such as S15, FD3S, MX-5, JZA80, UZZ3x) are also adequate.

2500|$|The {{proximal}} stress processes reviewed {{above are}} unique to specific minority groups; for example, internalized homophobia is a proximal stressor unique to LGBT individuals who experience prejudice about their sexual and or/gender orientation/expression, and vigilance against racism is unique to racial minorities who fear future experiences with race-based discrimination. [...] It {{is also possible that}} more general psychological processes act as proximal stressors for minority individuals. For example, exposure to prejudice may lead to rumination, which is a common psychological phenomenon characterized by a maladaptive, repetitive, and obsessive focus on a past event that leads to depressive and anxious symptoms. Several recent studies have shown that distal stressors are associated with such general proximal stress processes among minority individuals. [...] In one longitudinal study, researchers found that gay men who experienced distal stressors related to their sexual orientation had an increased tendency to ruminate, which was associated with increased depressive and anxious symptoms compared to gay men who did not experience distal stressors. In another study, LGBT youth reported higher rates of rumination on days when they experienced distal stressors; rumination in turn was associated with psychological distress. Because minority individuals have been shown to face high rates of distal stressors compared to majority individuals, and because experiencing distal stressors is associated with general psychological stress processes such as rumination and anxiety, these findings highlight the more general ways in which prejudice and discrimination may affect <b>internal</b> <b>stress</b> processes among minority individuals.|$|E

40|$|Before {{going into}} {{acoustic}} harmonic generation, I should bring to your attention {{the definition of}} <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> which was made about 40 years ago. Basically, we have to distinguish between two kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>stresses.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>stresses</b> of the first kind are those which spread out over macroscopic distances {{of the order of}} millimeters. Applying x-rays, one obtains a line shift in the Bragg reflection due to a lattice parameter change. A simple example of <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> of the first kind is shown in Fig. 1, top: in bending a piece of material elastically, a line shift in the Bragg reflection will be found on the upper and lower surface. <b>Internal</b> <b>stresses</b> of the second kind are restricted to much, much smaller dimensions, say of the order of 1 um or below. Bragg reflection does not show a line shift, but merely a line broadeninq. A typical example is shown in Fig. 1, bottom. Assume dislocations are distributed in a material. The· variation of the elastic stress field surrounding the dislocations is assumed to be sinusoidal and of the periodicity of the dislocation arrangement. If another dislocation is pushed against this chain of dislocations, it will see the stress field of the dislocation arrangement. In work hardening theories, this model is used to calculate the work hardening coefficient. The present paper will be concerned mainly with the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> of the second kind...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the shift}} of the Bragg {{reflection}} and its broadening, 1 st and 3 rd order <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> in crystalline materials can be determined respectively by diffraction method. Between these two orders, we can define a mesoscopic scale, where the stresses come from different arrangements of dislocation arrays or grain misorientation in a polycrystal. For all materials, three orders internal stressescan be found simultaneously. The first application presented here is on an eutectoïd steel with 12 % in volume of cementite. The 1 st and 2 nd order <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> have been determined in each phase, especially in cementite phase using a high intensity synchrotron beam. The second example concerns a cold-rolled pure Aluminum where the 2 nd and 3 rd order <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> are present at the same time.

40|$|The {{stresses}} in {{an elastic}} continuum (i. e. a continuum with zero strains after unloading) are classically {{deemed to be}} conservative (i. e. their total work all over the continuum is a single-valued function of only the displacement distribution in the continuum).

Actually, the total work of the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> all over a continuum does not coincide with the strain energy of the continuum, but also includes the work of the internal body forces formed by the stress derivatives, which only con-tributes to the kinetic energy of the continuum. Owing to this inclusion, the total work of the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> cannot be a single-valued function of only the displacement distribution in the continuum, and hence, the <b>internal</b> <b>stresses</b> must be nonconservative, which indicates internal damping inherent in any continuum whether elastic or not.
