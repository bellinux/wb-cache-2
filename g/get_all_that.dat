It was {{one of the hardest things}} I've ever had to do on a shoot. But it went by so quickly. I had a body suit on underneath my clothes, so there's a little fun fact for you. I was trying not to break my focus pretty much the entire shoot, because I was really in that zone – thinking a lot about the position I was in a year ago... thinking about the situation and how much I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> emotion off my chest." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You can't {{find out}} where he <b>gets</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> india-rubber, hey Willems?" [...] Hudig would ask at last, turning away and bending over the papers on his desk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't no next life," [...] Matt answered, pausing {{from the}} steak {{to take his}} first sip of coffee. [...] "Nor heaven nor hell, nor nothin'. You <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>that's</b> comin' {{right here in this}} life." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{have long}} been {{concerns}} about problems with the Electoral College method of selecting the President and Vice President.

(In Maine and Nebraska, the plurality rule applies by congressional district.) ...|$|R
2500|$|There is also {{an ongoing}} debate about the {{influence}} of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business.

They are <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> they need, and it's {{not for you}} to {{interfere}} in my business," [...] went on Snopper Duke, his high-pitched voice rising still higher in anger. [...] "You should be down in your classroom. Give me those things and go downstairs at once. I'll attend to your case later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} {{mean that you}} want a lesson? But if I were to tell you, my words would be thrown away. Men will not labour who have <b>gotten</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> they require without work. Why strive to deserve any woman, when women are plenty who do not care to be deserved? That plan of picking up the fallen apples is so much the easier." ...|$|R

60|$|The King was cordially {{ashamed of}} himself for having <b>gotten</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> fright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he {{need not have}} felt so about it, for {{it was not the}} calf that frightened him, but a dreadful {{non-existent}} something which the calf stood for; and any other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and suffered just as he had done.|$|R

5000|$|The Anti-British tone of {{the novel}} was {{softened}} and the script rewritten by producer Grover Jones, who said [...] "in the main we won't be giving them much {{time to think about}} whether they like the theme of the picture or not. We'll be giving them action and more action. And if we let a little plot to trickle in to let them know why they are <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> fighting, we do it only because the camera needs a new set up now and again." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan {{criticized the}} company's F-35 fighter jet program.

6000|$|... "If we were hankering for danger, truly we are <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is needed," [...] Archie {{whispered to}} me as we stood side by side {{throwing}} up the mound of earth which was to protect our people against the onslaught of the Britishers.

6000|$|Agatha smiled. [...] "There's {{something}} about the discoverer being allowed to appoint a deputy, and perhaps Mr. Thirlwell will look after my interests. But won't you see about <b>getting</b> us <b>all</b> <b>that</b> he thinks needful?" ...|$|R
