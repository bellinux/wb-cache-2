25|$|As {{the game}} begins, Wayne has just shot Karla in the <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had been bitten {{and was about}} to turn into a Shadow. As Ben, Sam and Stella return to the {{warehouse}} in which they are sheltering, the building is attacked by Shadows, drawn by the gunfire. The trio flee through a skylight, but the ladder breaks before Wayne can follow, and he tells them to head to the Safe Point, where he will meet them.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Ere it is," [...] {{said the}} young pilot, pausing {{at the top}} of the staircase, near the {{entrance}} to a very dark passage. [...] "Keep 'er <b>'ead</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes, but I'd recommend you to shorten sail, mind your 'elm, an 'ave the anchor ready to let go." ...|$|R
60|$|Her uncle still {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} her identity, and still talked over her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> did not exist.|$|R
25|$|When the zombies {{invade the}} mall, Asami uses some firecrackers to divert their attention. Shortly after {{breaking}} out of the mall with the group, she attempts to save a frightened student trapped {{on top of a}} truck in the parking lot. She and Shimada distract the zombies long enough for the student to escape, however Asami herself becomes trapped without any more bullets. Asami shouts that she hates Kohta, although Takashi immediately recognizes and tells Kohta that she is just yelling to attract the zombies so that they can escape. She shouts out one final request for Kohta not to allow her to become a zombie, and Kohta sadly aims his rifle at her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> salutes goodbye.|$|E
500|$|Before his Courier-Mail {{newspaper}} {{interview was}} delivered {{to the public and}} in response to Wotton's actions during the riot, police entered Wotton's home at 4:45am Saturday and used a stun gun {{on the back of his}} leg to arrest him, all the time pointing a rifle at his 15-year-old daughter's <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat on a bedroom floor. At the time, Wotton became one of 17 defendants, all males, charged in the Palm Island riots and was alleged to be the riot ringleader. At the Townsville Magistrate Court on 29 November, Wotton was charged with [...] "arson (two counts), serious assault on police (three counts), wilful damage and riot causing damage".|$|E
500|$|Following the pie {{attack on}} the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to {{overturn}} their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis—St. Paul. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant {{and her husband were}} in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face. Bryant was stunned and bowed her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> and Green held hands and prayed for Higgins. She quickly quipped [...] "At least it's a fruit pie." [...] An image of her covered with the pastry appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times the next day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only five," [...] {{said the}} mother, and {{she pointed to}} the alien in her flock. [...] "He's my sister's. She lives just below here." [...] Her {{children}} had grouped themselves about her, and she kept passing her hands caressingly over their little <b>heads</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> talked. [...] "My sister has nine children, but she has the rest at church with her to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But he's as cocky as ever,' said Matilda, {{narrowing}} {{her eyes}} and shaking her <b>head</b> knowingly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> handed the frying-pan.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Belmont's {{eyes were}} far away, and {{she shook her}} <b>head</b> sadly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gently put the girl's hands aside.|$|R
500|$|Sasha Geffen from MTV News noted Gaga's eyes {{rolling back}} in her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> moshes with {{the crowd in the}} clip and [...] "at one point she almost rips the head off of [...] ". Similar {{thoughts}} were echoed in Lara Walsh's review of the clip for InStyle, where she fawned about being a [...] "big fan" [...] of Gaga's [...] "raw appearance" [...] in the video. Writing for the Idolator, Mike Wass noted that the cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from the video, seeing that it [...] "reinvents Gaga as a rockstar" [...] and the [...] "epilepsy induced editing brings the whole thing to life". However he missed the theatricality associated with the singer's previous videos. Caitlyn Callegari from Bustle compared the clip with that of experiencing a Gaga concert from the front row and called it [...] "appealing" [...] since it had the singer's [...] "patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it". Callegari complimented the visuals for bringing out Gaga as both a performer and singer, [...] "and this video invites us to enjoy her in her purest form".|$|E
2500|$|... 15 July: the LVF killed Catholic {{civilian}} Bernadette Martin (18) in Aghalee. She {{was shot}} {{four times in}} the <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> slept in her Protestant boyfriend's home.|$|E
2500|$|So, the 'shrouded in snow' phrase may {{refer to}} the [...] "coldness and frigidity of the {{situation}} in which she is trapped"; to the white flowers that covered her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was being dragged off; to the covering of snow on the ground during Winter prior to the re-appearance of the flowers. The aspiration of whiteness towards 'golden' yellowness is also in play here.|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} <b>head</b> slowly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> leaned lovingly against his shoulder. 'You are not sorry, Hester, {{that you have}} become my wife?' ...|$|R
60|$|Looking round, {{they saw}} the Cetacea’s {{bowsprit}} close above their <b>heads</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lurched toward them {{on the back of}} a smooth sea. Pulling hard, with the hampering rope across her, they got the dory round, and afterward rowed steadily, while their breath came short and the sweat dripped from them. It was exhausting work; but Bethune pointed out the fact that they had not embarked on a pleasure excursion.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Sam Alison {{had arrived}} safely, but rather {{surprised}} {{not to find}} people walking on their <b>heads,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had been told everything was upside down. Her son had so far recovered that he could undertake such employment in writing as {{it was possible to}} procure. The mother and son were very happy together, but Harold winced as if a sore were touched when he spoke of their meeting.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{eventually}} the Mackenzies {{gained control of}} Lewis some islanders still resisted, notably Neil MacLeod and Dòmhnall Cam. Around this time tradition has it that Dòmhnall Cam fortified himself on a [...] high promontory of jagged rock on the sea-coast near Mangursta (or Mangersta, Scottish Gaelic: Mangarstadh). Today the stack still bears his name: Stac Dhòmhnaill Chaim. Tradition has it that Dòmhnall Cam's daughter, Anna Mhòr ("Big Anne") carried water to her father on her <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> needed her hands to climb the cliffs.|$|E
2500|$|After Salome {{inquires}} {{into his}} promise, and he swears to honor it, she prepares for the [...] "Dance of the Seven Veils". This dance, very oriental in orchestration, has her slowly removing her seven veils, until she lies naked at his feet. Salome then demands {{the head of}} the prophet on a silver platter. Her mother cackles in pleasure. Herod tries to dissuade her with offers of jewels, peacocks, and the sacred veil of the Temple. Salome remains firm in her demand for Jochanaan's head, forcing Herod to accede to her demands. After a desperate monologue by Salome, an executioner emerges from the well and delivers the severed <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> requested.|$|E
2500|$|Esther {{is shown}} {{seated at the}} center of the canvas, arms above her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{arranges}} her blond coiffure. Preparing to offer herself for the king's approval, she holds a pose that is [...] "profoundly erotic in its pictorial treatment". She is nude to the waist except for a necklace and bracelets on her arms; her legs are swathed in white- and rose-colored garments. At the left a servant woman dressed in rich blue brings accessories, and at the right Hegai, clad in bright red, offers a jewel box. Esther acknowledges neither of them, staring out of the picture to the left. Behind them is a landscape of trees and sky.|$|E
60|$|I had {{anticipated}} {{that she would}} laugh at me. No! She suddenly raised her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were looking at me intently in the dark.|$|R
60|$|She did not speak, but bent her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were {{intent upon}} some work, and so seated herself that her countenance was almost hid.|$|R
60|$|Linda's black figure {{detached}} itself {{upright on}} {{the light of the}} lantern with her arms raised above her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> were going to throw herself over.|$|R

60|$|My aunt {{smoothed}} {{her dress and}} shook her <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> smoothed defiance {{of the whole world}} out of the one, and shook it out of the other.|$|R
60|$|Not she. She {{had seen}} nothing {{but her father}} until now. She saw Mr Jonas now, though; and blushed, and hung her <b>head</b> down, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gave him welcome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I was forgetting his play," [...] Katharine remarked, {{and turning}} her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> though <b>she</b> saw {{something}} that needed her attention {{in a far}} corner of the room, she left them.|$|R
60|$|Poor Nora hung her <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{asked in}} a low voice if Jim really thought her father was engaged in illegal practices.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, he ain't indeed!' {{said the}} poor woman, shaking her <b>head,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at the}} four {{children}} in succession, and then at him.|$|E
60|$|But Lady Greystoke only {{shook her}} <b>head</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had {{a hundred other}} times when the subject had claimed her {{attention}} in the past.|$|E

6000|$|Carol's <b>head</b> ached <b>as</b> <b>she</b> trailed {{behind the}} unsmiling Calibrees along the block of booths. She chirruped at Kennicott, [...] "Let's be wild! Let's {{ride on the}} merry-go-round and grab a gold ring!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Call {{all hands}} {{to work the}} pumps; and don't let the men know how much water {{there is in the}} hold. Come below, Ned. I want you. Keep her <b>head</b> steady <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes." ...|$|R
