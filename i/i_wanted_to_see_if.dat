[...] She states, [...] "All that information floats around where we are – the images, the opinions, the discussions, the feelings – they all exist, and I felt someone {{had to do something}} about it because I can't live in this world where we pretend nothing really matters." [...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs. Every bit of music out there that’s making it into the mainstream is really about nothing. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I could write songs about something important and make it sound like nothing. And it kind of worked." [...] Censorship on MTV of [...] "Sunshowers" [...] proved controversial and was again criticised following Kala release [...] "Paper Planes". YouTube's block and subsequent age gating/obscuring of the video for [...] "Born Free" [...] from Maya due to its graphic violence/political subtext was criticised by M.I.A. as hypocritical, citing the Internet channel's streaming of real-life killings.

500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} the [...] "Steven Meisel-shot cover... was as key to her reinvention as {{the music of the}} album itself." [...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, Lee {{made the}} {{transition}} from business to politics. He joined the Democratic Liberal Party instead of the Unification National Party, founded by Chung Ju-yung. He was elected {{as a member of}} the 14th Korean National Assembly (for Proportional representation). Upon his election, he stated that he ran for the office because [...] "after watching Mikhail Gorbachev change the world climate, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> there was anything I could do." [...] In 1995, he ran for the city of Seoul's mayoral election, but lost to former prime minister Chung Won-sik during the primary of the Democratic Liberal Party.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I've {{made up my}} mind to do; but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> Hudibras would get up a band to join mine, for I dare not take many away from the town when that scoundrel Addedomar is {{threatening}} to make a raid upon us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{would touch}} {{me if she}} didn't irritate me. That's the effect she has upon me now. I have tried {{everything}} upon her; I really have been quite merciless.

60|$|I did not speak. I did {{not even}} smile. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> Ghak, my {{principal}} lieutenant, would recognize me. For some time he stood there looking me over carefully. His eyes took in my large pith helmet, my khaki jacket, and bandoleers of cartridges, the two revolvers swinging at my hips, the large rifle resting against my body. Still I stood with my hands above my head. He examined my puttees and my strong tan shoes--a little {{the worse for wear}} now. Then he glanced up once more to my face. As his gaze rested there quite steadily for some moments I saw recognition tinged with awe creep across his countenance.|$|E
