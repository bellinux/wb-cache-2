There is no <b>domestic</b> gas <b>mains</b> supply. Water is supplied by Yorkshire Water from Embsay Reservoir. Yorkshire Water is responsible for wastewater disposal, and a small-scale treatment plant is located adjacent to the River Wharfe south of Hebden Beck. Refuse collection is handled by Craven District Council, and North Yorkshire County Council provides a household waste and recycling centre at Skibeden, between Bolton Abbey and Skipton.|$|R
2500|$|For {{applications}} with frequencies {{higher than}} the <b>domestic</b> AC <b>mains</b> supply (e.g. 50Hz or 60Hz), thyristors with lower values of tQ are required. Such fast thyristors {{can be made by}} diffusing heavy metal ions such as gold or platinum which act as charge combination centers into the silicon. Today, fast thyristors are more usually made by electron or proton irradiation of the silicon, or by ion implantation. [...] Irradiation is more versatile than heavy metal doping because it permits the dosage to be adjusted in fine steps, even at quite a late stage in the processing of the silicon.|$|R

50|$|Until the 1950s, {{isolated}} ground <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> supplies {{tended to have}} no Residual-Current Device (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred. This could leave metalwork in the house live. The use of Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or formerly ELCBs with such installs solved this problem. Such installs are called EEBAD (Earthed Equipotential Bonding and Automatic Disconnection).|$|E

40|$|The {{human body}} is very {{sensitive}} to electric currents. Voltage {{can be thought of}} as pressure to force current through the human body and a pressure. If the human body is wet or the skin is freshly cut, the majority of the resistance is lacking. Less voltage may be required and/or more current may be forced through the human body. The majority of people can feel 0. 003 to 0. 004 amperes. Expert Domestic Wiring Simulation was designed as a learning purpose especially for electrical student. Curiosity can be harmful and possibly cause the accident during lab classes. This is because they lack of knowledge about how to do domestic wiring. In a <b>domestic</b> installation, <b>mains</b> circuits fall into three basic types: power outlet circuits, lighting circuits, and single-appliance circuits. Power outlet circuits supply power to electrical appliances via plug-and-socket connections. This expert simulation was covered a few familiar domestic wiring connection, such as main switch circuit, lamp circuits and socket connection circuit. This simulation will be design using Visual Basic Language, and designed step by step by using bottom-up Software Development Life Cycle. There are three main advantages of doing this simulation which are safety, saving cost and reduce preparation time. So, as the final result, users may use this simulation as reference before attend the real wiring, and they may try one by one of the connection without risk any life of component. So, many student would do “try and error” such as making harmful wiring connections. So, this simulation was able to represent the real world on how domestic wiring is done based on computer programming simulation and able to utilize the program simulation about the true usage of the wiring system and therefore could save the cost of electrical devices/equipment and also emphasize on safety feature during lab simulation...|$|R
50|$|Autotransformers are {{frequently}} used in power applications to interconnect systems operating at different voltage classes, for example 132 kV to 66 kV for transmission. Another application in industry is to adapt machinery built (for example) for 480 V supplies {{to operate on}} a 600 V supply. They are also often used for providing conversions between the two common <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> voltage bands in the world (100 V - 130 V and 200 V - 250 V). The links between the UK 400 kV and 275 kV 'Super Grid' networks are normally three phase autotransformers with taps at the common neutral end.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prospective}} {{short circuit}} current (PSCC) or available fault current or short circuit making current is the highest electric current which can exist in a particular electrical system under short-circuit conditions. It {{is determined by the}} voltage and impedance of the supply system. It is of the order of a few thousand amperes for a standard <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> electrical installation, but may be as low as a few milliamperes in a SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage or, occasionally, Separated Extra Low Voltage) system or as high as hundreds of thousands of amps in large industrial power systems.|$|E
50|$|An AC adapter, AC/DC adapter, or AC/DC {{converter}} {{is a type}} {{of external}} power supply, often enclosed in a case similar to an AC plug. Other common names include plug pack, plug-in adapter, adapter block, <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> adapter, line power adapter, wall wart, power brick, and power adapter. Adapters for battery-powered equipment may be described as chargers or rechargers (see also battery charger). AC adapters are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from mains power. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{device is}} the {{vibrator}} power supply, used to power electronic valve radios from low-voltage batteries. Low voltage DC from the battery is chopped by a trembler circuit and this pulsed square wave {{used to drive}} a transformer, providing the 90V or so required by valves. As this application is more frequency sensitive, the vibrators were generally a separate unit, with a more stable frequency tuned reed, apart from the transformer. This transformer had output tappings for the 90V HT and also the 22V grid and 6V heater circuits required by valves. In many cases, the transformer was the same unit used for powering the radio set from <b>domestic</b> <b>mains,</b> using the same secondaries but with an additional primary winding at mains voltage.|$|E
5000|$|In EV mode, the Golf GTE has an all-electric {{range of}} 50 km. The all-electric mode can be {{activated}} at {{the push of}} a button. Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is [...] equivalent. The electric power can also be saved - for example when driving to a zero-emissions zone. The 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery can be charged in around {{three and a half hours}} from a <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> outlet, or two and a half hours from a domestic wallbox. The battery weighs 120 kg, giving the GTE a total kerbweight of 1,520 kg.The Golf GTE uses a six-speed DSG gearbox with a triple-clutch system specially developed for hybrid vehicles. The electric motor is integrated into the gearbox housing, while further hybrid components include power electronics and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor make for energy-efficient braking and air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|The {{name was}} revived in 1946 by an {{organisation}} calling themselves Invicta Cars of Virginia Water Surrey who began making the Black Prince. Meadows engines were again used, {{this time a}} twin overhead camshaft 3-litre six with three carburettors giving 120 bhp. The aluminium-bodied cars - steel supplies were effectively non-existent for new businesses in Britain's new centrally planned economy - were extremely complex and very expensive with a torque converter (Brockhouse Hydro-Kinetic Turbo Transmitter) entirely replacing the gearbox. The torque converter was controlled by a small switch with forward and reverse positions. Suspension was fully independent using torsion bars and there were built-in electric jacks. Other innovative luxury items included a trickle-charger {{to charge the battery}} from the <b>domestic</b> <b>mains,</b> an immersion heater in the engine, interior heating of the body and a built-in radio. About 16 were made, 12 of which have survived. The new company lasted until 1950, when it was bought by Frazer Nash makers, AFN Ltd.|$|E
50|$|Yellow 2P+E, blue P+N+E, yellow 3P+E, red 3P+E, and red 3P+N+E {{are by far}} {{the most}} common arrangements. Blue P+N+E sockets (generally 16 A, {{although}} 32 A is becoming more common) are used as standard by British and Danish campsites and yacht marinas to provide 240 V <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> power to frame-tents, trailer-tents, caravans, and boats; they are also used elsewhere in Europe for the same purpose, though in some countries the local domestic plug is also widely used. Static caravans generally use the similar 32 A version because of the requirement to power electrical cooking and heating appliances. The blue P+N+E 16 A version carrying 240 V is also used in shopping malls and their peripherals to power 'temporary' stalls not incorporated within a lock-up shop, there is also use in domestic gardens within Britain to power garden equipment, barbecues, and temporary lighting. The yellow 2P+E 16 A version carrying 115 V is used extensively on the London Underground railway system to power temporary usage of heavy-duty fans; it is also frequently used by tradesmen within the UK, built into a portable transformer box that is powered from a standard 13 A 240 V mains supply, to run heavy-duty power-tools designed to operate at 115 V.|$|E
40|$|Water {{treatment}} {{plants in the}} United Kingdom at significant risk of cryptosporidiosis and using conventional filtration methods have been required to install 24 -h monitoring systems since April 2000. No major waterborne outbreaks have been described since 2001. Small outbreaks {{have been associated with}} water. This paper describes such an outbreak. Data from a local multi-agency surveillance system was used to describe the outbreak, including mapping cases against water supply zones. A case-control study investigated hypotheses raised. All cases were genotype 1. Early cases were in the supply zone of a surface water-treatment plant that had met treatment standards. Later cases included residents in a different supply zone that temporarily received water from the implicated plant. Cases reported more consumption of <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> water than controls. Descriptive and analytical epidemiology thus supported drinking water as a source of cryptosporidiosis from a plant meeting regulatory requirements. The evidence for setting drinking-water standards needs review...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to identify}} effective techniques for powerline communication using the low voltage (240 V) <b>domestic</b> <b>mains</b> electricity supply in the sub 150 kHz frequency range {{as defined by the}} European CENELEC standard, concentrating on narrowband techniques suitable for low data rate telemetry applications. In order to conduct a comparison of communications techniques a model of the channel is invaluable. However a survey of the existing literature reveals that the presently available Knowledge of the channel characteristics and impairments of the low voltage mains is limited. In particular there is no widely accepted quantitative model of the mains as a narrowband communications link. The study consisted of four main phases. First, a new piece of equipment, the 'Channel Probe', was developed to perform channel soundings of the mains. The second phase was largely experimental; empirical channel sounding results were collected using the Channel Probe. In the third phase a model was defined to fit the empirical results and a quantitative simulation was constructed based on this model. Lastly, communications techniques were studied using this simulation. This document presents the key impairments introduced by the channel, and proposes a novel narrowband channel model. Quantitative values for these phenomena are identified and justified against the measured results. The simulation that was constructed in accordance with this channel model is entirely novel, and is used to study suitable modulation schemes, receiver structures and algorithms. Original performance results from this simulation are presented, and a novel low complexity narrowband communication scheme is presented which has significant advantages over existing commercially available systems...|$|E
