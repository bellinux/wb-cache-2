25|$|The product <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> {{distributed}} with isotretinoin {{states that}} rare psychological side effects may include depression, worsening of pre-existing depression, aggressive tendencies and anxiety. Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide. In {{a total of}} 5577 adverse reactions reported to the UK's MHRA up to 31 March 2017, the majority (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects. There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of completed suicide and 43 of suicide attempts. Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the FDA's top 10 list of drugs associated with depression and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} seats always exceeds the number available. Members {{of the public}} are {{admitted}} to the College through the main gate on King's Parade from 7:30 am (though some start queueing the night before), and each person is given an <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> which must be retained and shown to the duty porter for re-entry {{if he or she}} desires to leave the queue temporarily. People joining the queue before 9:00 am will usually gain admission to the Chapel, but this is not guaranteed. Porters monitor the number of people joining the queue, and once there are as many people as there are seats available, the others are advised that it is unlikely {{they will be able to}} attend the service. Members of Collegium Regale (the Choral Scholars of King's College Choir) usually sing Christmas carols to entertain the people who are queueing.|$|E
30|$|In {{relation}} to the DISCERN instrument, {{the findings of this}} study have highlighted shortcomings in the quality of orthodontic patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets.</b> Overall, the quality of patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> was deemed of moderate quality. However, patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> produced by the British Orthodontic Society were assessed as higher quality, more readable and designed at the appropriate reading age for the UK population. When using orthodontic patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets,</b> clinicians may wish to consider providing additional/supplemental information relating to information on consequences of no treatment, possible treatment options and support for a shared decision process.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a project that}} explores the possibility of assessing the readability level of Arabic medicine <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> using machine learning techniques. There {{are a number of}} popular readability formulas and tools that have been successfully used to assess the readability of health-related information in several languages. However, there is limited work on the readability assessment of health-related information, specifically medicine <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> in Arabic. We describe the design of a tool that uses machine learning to assess the readability of medicine <b>information</b> <b>leaflets.</b> We utilize a corpus comprising 1112 medicine <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> annotated with three difficulty levels. Based on a study of existing literature, we selected a number of features influencing text difficulty. The tool will help specialized organizations in medicine <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> production to produce the leaflets at appropriate level of reading for the majority of leaflets consumers...|$|R

In April 2013, the projected cost of the referendum was £13.3 million; the final administrative cost was £15.85 million.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{benefit from}} {{information}} on pharmaceuticals and most patients {{are willing to}} read patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> for their pharmaceuticals.

To mend insufficiencies of patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets,</b> an alternative approach for provision of information on pharmaceuticals is illustrated.

With a web application supplementary services that cannot as easily be realised with patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> can be offered. An open-source framework with a robust architecture for rapid application development serves as a foundation of the web application.

2500|$|The UK {{government}} stated that, if {{a simple}} majority of the votes cast were in favour of independence, then [...] "Scotland would become an independent country after a process of negotiations". If the majority was against independence, Scotland would continue within the United Kingdom. Further powers would be devolved to the Scottish Parliament {{as a result of}} the Scotland Act 2012. The Electoral Commission prepared an <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> which confirmed that the UK and Scottish governments had reached agreement on these points. David Cameron said in May 2014 that he believed that the referendum would be [...] "'irreversible and binding". In the event of a majority for Yes, the Scottish Government had proposed an independence date of 24 March 2016. It was suggested that, following the conclusion of negotiations, the UK Parliament would legislate for Scottish independence to take place on the date that had been negotiated. A report by a UK House of Lords committee, published in May 2014, said that the UK could opt to delay the independence date.|$|E

Methods: Fourty five leaflets were assessed using the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability test and by examining them for paper type, font size type, use of symbols and pictograms, and bilingual information. Results: The SMOG readability data {{revealed that the}} mean United State reading grade level for malaria medicines <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> available in Nigeria was 13. 69 ± 1. 70. This value is equivalent to a tertiary level of education in Nigeria. The study also revealed that 6. 7 % of the leaflets were glossy; 6. 7 % contained symbols and pictograms; 42. 2 % of the leaflets had a font type size < 8; and only 2. 2 % of the leaflets were produced in both English language {{and one of the}} major local languages of Nigeria.

An assessment {{of the quality of}} commonly used orthodontic patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> is lacking. METHODS A cross-sectional assessment of patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> from two international orthodontic societies was undertaken. The quality of each leaflet was assessed using the DISCERN instrument. The readability of each leaflet was assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease instrument, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) index. Descriptive statistics followed by univariate analysis was conducted. RESULTS Thirty-six patient <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> were identified. Reporting of DISCERN instrument items relating to aims, description of sources, details of additional sources, consequences of no treatment, possible treatment options, and support for a shared decision process was of low quality. The overall quality score for the total sample was 44. The median Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and SMOG index scores were 70 (interquartile range (IQR) 53. 3 - 73. 9), 7. 2 (IQR 6 - 9. 7), and 7. 3 (IQR 6. 7 - 9. 1), respectively.
