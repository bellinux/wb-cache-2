40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of pre-weaning social contacts on social behaviour in a new herd formed three months after weaning, using four groups of twin <b>kids</b> of Tokara goats. During the three months of suckling period, each group formed twin <b>kids</b> and their mother was penned separately, except when the four <b>kids</b> selected from each of the four groups of twins were joined to experience social contacts for two hours once a week during the seven weeks. For another three months after weaning, the four <b>kids</b> experienced social contacts were kept together but isolated from the other group of four <b>kids</b> inexperienced pre-weaning social contacts. Then, all the eight <b>kids</b> were joined to form a new herd to observe the frequencies of butting and mounting between <b>kids</b> on the first two days, and the frequencies of the nearest neighbouring between <b>kids</b> in every thirty minutes on the third, fifth and seventh days. The behavioural data collected from the four <b>kids</b> experienced pre-weaning social contacts (E) were classified into three categories according to the social relationships between <b>kids.</b> They were twin relationship (a), cohabituating relationship during the three months after weaning (b) and unfamiliar relationship (c). The same classification was applied to the other four <b>kids</b> inexperienced pre-weaning social contacts (I). All the collected data were analyzed using χ^ 2 test and dual scaling method. The results obtained were as follows: 1. <b>Kids</b> (E) and <b>kids</b> (I) showed a similar tendency in butting, less frequently against <b>kids</b> (b) but more frequently against <b>kids</b> (c). 2. <b>Kids</b> (E) showed much higher frequencies of mounting than <b>kids</b> (I) and this was due to a difference in mounting <b>kids</b> (c). 3. Both <b>kids</b> (E) and <b>kids</b> (I) showed the nearest neighbouring more frequently to <b>kids</b> (B) but less frequently to <b>kids</b> (a) and <b>kids</b> (c) 4. The analysis of social behaviour using dual scaling method indicated that <b>kids</b> (I) showed much interest to butting <b>kids</b> (c) comparing with <b>kids</b> (E). Both <b>kids</b> (E) and <b>kids</b> (I) regarded <b>kids</b> (b) as more familiar neighbours than <b>kids</b> (a) It was suggested that pre-weaning social contacts tended to promote the social activities. 本研究はトカラヤギを用い, 同一の母畜に晴乳させた双子の離乳前における他の幼畜との社会的接触が, 離乳後の群形成過程における社会行動に及ぼす影響について, 群内における頭突き, 乗駕及び個体間の近接度を指標として追究したものである. まず, トカラヤギ双子 4 組をそれぞれの母畜とともに他の母子と隔離して 3 カ月の哺乳期間舎飼した. その際, 各双子の特定の一方(計 4 頭) を週 1 回 2 時間 1 群とし, 社会的接触を経験させた. 次に, 離乳後各双子を接触経験山羊と未経験山羊とに再編成し, それぞれ別個に 3 カ月間舎飼した. その後, 上記 2 群をまとめ 1 群 8 頭とし, 個体間の社会的接触に及ぼす哺乳期間中の接触経験の有無並びに離乳後の集団飼育の影響を追究した. 得られた結果は次のとおりである. 1. 甫乳期間中, 接触経験をさせた山羊の頭突き回数については, 放牧前同一集団であった山羊との頻度は若干少なく, 初対面山羊との頻度は若干多くなることが認められた. また, 接触未経験山羊では, 放牧前同一集団であった山羊との頻度は著しく少なく, 初対面山羊との頻度は多くなることが認められた. 2. 乗駕回数は接触経験山羊で接触未経験のものより著しく多くなることが認められた. 接触経験山羊が示した乗駕回数については, 兄弟山羊に対する頻度は少なく, 初対面山羊との頻度は多くなることが認められた. しかし, 接触未経験山羊の場合, いずれの場合にも有意差は認められなかった. 3. 最近接回数は接触経験山羊と接触未経験山羊いずれの場合も, 群飼前同一集団であった山羊に対する頻度は著しく多く, 初対面山羊との頻度は著しく少なく, また, 兄弟山羊に対する頻度も少なくなることが認められた. 4. 双対尺度法を用いた分析の結果, 頭突き相手としての認識が強いのは接触未経験山羊の初対面山羊に対する関係, 乗駕相手としては接触経験山羊と初対面山羊, 接触未経験山羊とその兄弟山羊, さらに最近接相手としては接触経験山羊と群飼前向一集団であった山羊, 並びに接触未経験山羊と群飼前向一集団であった山羊との関係であることが認められた. 以上の結果から, 哺乳期の社会的接触経験は離乳後初対面となる山羊あるいは一定期間経過後に再会する山羊との関係を緩和させるものと考えられた...|$|R
