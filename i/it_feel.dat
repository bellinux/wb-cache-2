5|$|A WoodSearch Films short-subject {{documentary}} entitled How does <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> {{to work on}} One World Trade Center? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31, 2010.

However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} that the developers faced was in adding enough elements to Metroid: Zero Mission to make <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> new, while keeping the spirit of the original Metroid. Because both games were made for the Game Boy Advance, Metroid: Zero Mission uses a rebuilt version of the game engine used for Metroid Fusion so that it {{did not need to be}} built from scratch. This marked the first time two Metroid installments have been released for the same video game console. Metroid Fusion had offered connectivity with Metroid Prime on the Nintendo GameCube, but Metroid: Zero Mission did not offer such a feature. Sakamoto explained that the developers wanted to make the game connect to Metroid Prime 2: Echoes on the GameCube, but the fact that both their release dates were far apart and not enough development time to implement connectivity features prevented them from doing so. However, they managed to include the ability for Metroid Fusion to connect with Metroid: Zero Mission.|$|E

5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a pre-built library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Angel Beats! follows {{an interactive}} branching plot line with multiple scenarios. Originally {{meant to be}} a role-playing game, Maeda eventually conceded to making it into a visual novel adventure game. When designing the game, Maeda did not want to include choices for the player that would not have a meaningful effect, so the choices given were focused to {{have an effect on the}} plot and character interactions. A reviewer noted that its game structure makes <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> more like a game compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines. 1st Beat ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more after that.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} on Famitsu.com by Taiga Asaba, Angel Beats! 1st Beat is {{described}} as not merely complementing the anime it is based on, but instead using the characters and setting to produce a wholly new story, which creates a separate charm surrounding the separate versions of the story. Asaba notes that the theme revolving around family already present in the anime is expanded upon in the game {{for each of the}} characters. Regarding the game's mechanics, Asaba found it fairly difficult to go down specific character routes, noting that a small change in how to diverge the plot line results in large changes to the characters. Asaba writes that its game structure makes <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> more like a game compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines.|$|E

25|$|The {{additional}} funding, though significant, {{expanded the}} scope of the game and causes some setbacks, and for some periods, the Greens lived off loans and donations during the development. Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, and turned back to work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized that much of what they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some sense of control, but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of the levers were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope and open up with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the technical capability to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E
