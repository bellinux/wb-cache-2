2500|$|The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh {{initially}} did {{not recognize}} the Tricolor as the National Flag of India. The RSS mouthpiece, the Organiser, in its issue dated 17July 1947, demanded, in an editorial titled [...] "National Flag", that the Bhagwa Dhwaj (Saffron Flag) be adopted as the National Flag of India. After the Tricolor was adopted as the National Flag of India by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22July 1947, the Organiser viciously attacked the Tricolor and the decision to adopt it as the National Flag of India.

In his words, The RSS hoisted the National Flag of India at its headquarters in Nagpur, on 14August 1947 and on 26January 1950, but stopped doing so after that. This issue has always been a source of controversy. In 2001 three activists of Rashtrapremi Yuwa Dal president Baba Mendhe, and members Ramesh Kalambe and Dilip Chattani, along with othersallegedly entered the RSS headquarters in Reshimbagh, Nagpur, on 26January, Republic Day of India, and forcibly hoisted the national flag there amid patriotic slogans. They contended that the RSS had never before or after independence, ever hoisted the tri-colour in their premises, even on Independence Day and Republic Day. Offences under the relevant section of the Bombay Police Act and the IPC were registered by the police against the trio, resulting in their being jailed. They were released after eleven years in 2013. The arrests and the <b>flag-hoisting</b> issue stoked a controversy, which was raised in the Parliament as well.

2500|$|The Australian cruiser reached Emden around 16:00. The Germans' battle ensign {{was still}} flying, {{generally}} {{a sign that}} a ship intends to continue fighting. Sydney signalled [...] "Do you surrender?" [...] in international code by both lights and <b>flag-hoist.</b> The signal was not understood, and Emden responded with [...] "What signal? No signal books". The instruction to surrender was repeated by Sydney in plain morse code, then after there was no reply, the message [...] "Have you received my signal?" [...] was sent. With no response forthcoming, and operating {{under the assumption that}} Emden could still potentially fire, launch torpedoes, or use small arms against any boarding parties, Glossop ordered Sydney to fire two salvoes into the wrecked ship. This attack killed 20 German personnel. The ensign was pulled down and burned, and a white sheet was raised over the quarter-deck as a flag of surrender. During the battle, 130 personnel aboard Emden were killed, and 69 were wounded, four of the latter died of their wounds.|$|R
60|$|The {{difficulty}} of the Germans in both these cases came from the impossibility of landing any efficient force or, indeed, any force at all from the air-fleet. The airships were quite unequal to the transport of any adequate landing parties; their complement of men was just sufficient to manoeuvre and fight them in the air. From above they could inflict immense damage; they could reduce any organised Government to a capitulation in the briefest space, {{but they could not}} disarm, much less could they occupy, the surrendered areas below. They had to trust to the pressure upon the authorities below of a threat to renew the bombardment. It was their sole resource. No doubt, with a highly organised and undamaged Government and a homogeneous and well-disciplined people that would have sufficed to keep the peace. But this was not the American case. Not only was the New York Government a weak one and insufficiently provided with police, but the destruction of the City Hall--and Post-Offide and other central ganglia had hopelessly disorganised the co-operation of part with part. The street cars and railways had ceased; the telephone service was out of gear and only worked intermittently. The Germans had struck at the head, and the head was conquered and stunned--only to release the body from its rule. New York had become a headless monster, no longer capable of collective submission. Everywhere it lifted itself rebelliously; everywhere authorities and officials left to their own imitative were joining in the arming and <b>flag-hoisting</b> and excitement of that afternoon.|$|E
