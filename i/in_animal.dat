40|$|Speciation mostly occur by {{splitting}} an ancestral species {{into two}} daughter species. Alternatively, new species {{may arise by}} hybridization, a phenomenon known as hybrid speciation. This type of speciation is frequent especially in plants, but recently, {{a growing number of}} example has been described also <b>in</b> <b>animals.</b> The aim of this thesis is to summarize the current knowledge about hybrid speciation and describe known examples of hybrid speciation <b>in</b> <b>animals.</b> Hybrid speciation <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> is mostly homoploid, e. g. without the change of number of chromosomes. I found 23 homoploid hybrid species <b>in</b> <b>animals.</b> Most of them belong to insects and fishes, but know examples are also among birds and mammals. Origin of species <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> by hybrid speciation seems to be more commons than was previously thought. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

Moderate pathogenic effects were found to decrease the production level <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> when rainfall level was 100 to 500 mm (corresponding EPG level 200 to 350).

5|$|Early SEGRAs were {{synthetic}} steroids. An {{example is}} RU24858, {{one of the}} first compounds of this type to be published. Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although the similarity to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives. All of these compounds have been shown to exhibit SEGRA properties in cellular or <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> models.|$|E
50|$|Genetics {{are more}} {{variable}} and malleable in plants than <b>in</b> <b>animals,</b> probably reflecting the higher activity level <b>in</b> <b>animals.</b> Hybrids genetics will necessarily be less stable {{than those of}} species evolving through isolation, which explains why hybrid species appear more common in plants than <b>in</b> <b>animals.</b> Many agricultural crops are hybrids with double or even triple chromosome sets. Having multiple sets of chromosomes is called polyploidy (or polyploidity). Polyploidy is usually fatal <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> where extra chromosome sets upset fetal development, but is often found in plants. A form of hybrid speciation that is relatively common in plants, occurs when an infertile hybrid becomes fertile after doubling of the chromosome number.|$|R

5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. <b>In</b> <b>Animal</b> Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus <b>in</b> <b>animal</b> ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E

40|$|Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} to tuberculin was induced in guinea-pigs by vaccination with BCG. The {{effects of}} several {{drugs on the}} responses of peritoneal exudate cells to tuberculin (PPD) and on delayed skin reactions to PPD were investigated. <b>In</b> untreated <b>animals</b> intraperitoneal injections of PPD were followed by the virtually complete loss of macrophages from the exudates (the macrophage disappearance reaction), the partial loss of lymphocytes and a marked {{increase in the number}} of polymorphs in the exudates. The macrophage disappearance reaction was markedly or completely inhibited <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with the anticoagulant drugs heparin or sodium warfarin, very slightly inhibited <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with cortisone acetate or promethazine and not inhibited <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with reserpine. The other peritoneal cellular responses were variably but only slightly affected by these drugs. Delayed skin reactions to PPD were partly inhibited <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with heparin, sodium warfarin or cortisone acetate and more strongly inhibited <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with a combination of sodium warfarin and cortisone acetate. Histological examination of the skin test sites of untreated animals and of animals treated with sodium warfarin and/or cortisone acetate showed that the accumulation of macrophages was more markedly inhibited <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with sodium warfarin than <b>in</b> <b>animals</b> treated with cortisone alone.
