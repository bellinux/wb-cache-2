We have measured angle-resolved transmission of photons that are multiply scattered by this disorder in strongly {{photonic crystal}}s. Peculiar non-Lambertian distributions {{occur as a}} function of frequency: due to internal diffraction, wide angular ranges of strongly reduced <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> coincide with photonic stop bands, while enhancements occur for directions outside stop gaps. We quantitatively explain the experiment with a model incorporating diffusion and band structure on equal footing.

40|$|Near-infrared (NIR) {{spectroscopy}} offers tremendous {{advantages for}} pharmaceutical manufacturing as a fast and non-destructive method of {{quantitative and qualitative}} analysis. Content uniformity (end-product analytics) and process analytics are two important applications of the method. Both modes of analysis, <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> (DT) and diffuse reflection (DR) are sensitive to changes in sample physical parameters. Scaling as well as baseline shifts due to tableting variations would be a potential cause of many outliers and prediction errors, and therefore these effects {{need to be more}} clearly understood. Moreover, there is currently no clear literature information about the sampling span in both modes (horizontal or radial in DT, and vertical or information depth in DR). This information is vital in content prediction using NIR in cases where inhomogeneities in the sample are detrimental (e. g. low-dose API in large samples).

40|$|International audienceNon-destructive {{detection}} of internal quality in watermelon has very important significance for improving watermelon’s production efficiency. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy {{is one of}} the most popular non-destructive detection methods. However, it is challenging to collect spectra exactly due to the multiple scattering and absorbing by the skin and internal tissues. In order to obtain the interactions between light and watermelon tissues, the transportation feature of NIR light in small, thin-skin watermelon was studied in the range of 750 – 900  nm. For this purpose, the <b>diffused</b> <b>transmission</b> spectra were collected with removing the sample slices along the perpendicular bisector of the source-detector line. Based on the spectra in effective wavelength band, the penetration depth curves were fitted by least square method, and the results of different detecting positions (equator and top) were compared. It was shown that, light penetration depth on the equator was 8. 3 – 9. 5  mm, 8. 7 – 17. 8  mm and 18. 9 – 38. 5  mm with source-detector distance of 10  mm, 20  mm and 30  mm, respectively. The penetration depth on the top was less than the equator. And the penetration depth increased with source-detector distance increasing. With deeper penetration depth, more information about internal quality was carried by the <b>diffused</b> <b>transmission</b> spectra. However, the intensity of spectra was weaker. According to these results, a reasonable source-detector distance could be designed for collecting effective information about internal quality. This study is of potential significance for optimizing the handheld probe geometry for large fruit, and offers theoretical bases for non-destructive detection...|$|R

40|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> and diffusing-wave {{spectroscopy}} (DWS) {{can be used}} {{to probe}} the structure and dynamics of opaque materials such as colloids, foams, and sand. A crucial step is to model photon transport as a diffusion process. This approach is acceptable for optically thick samples, far into the limit of strong multiple scattering; however, it becomes increasingly inaccurate for thinner samples for several reasons. Here, we correct for two of these defects. By modeling photon propagation by a telegrapher equation with suitable boundary conditions, we can account for the ballistic transport of photons at finite speed between successive scattering events. By introducing a discontinuity in the photon concentration at the source point, and then averaging over a range of penetration depths, we can account for the fact that photons usually scatter anisotropically into the forward direction, rather than being completely randomized at each event. The accuracy of our approach is tested by comparison both with random walk computer simulations and with experiments on specially designed suspensions of polystyrene spheres. We find that our predictions extend the utility of <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> to slabs of all thicknesses and of DWS to slabs down to about two transport mean free paths...|$|E

40|$|Three {{fundamental}} {{experiments on}} multi-particle interactions in hard-sphere systems {{are presented in}} this thesis. In the first experiment, a mixture of two monodisperse colloids with different particle diameters, but the same particle composition, is studied using diffusing-wave spectroscopy. We find that both the particle structure and the hydrodynamic interactions between large and small balls are well modeled by existing theories. These theories, however, do {{not comment on the}} observed diffusion of particles in complex solutions over distances larger than a particle diameter. Incidental observations during this experiment led to the second experiment, the study of the phase diagram of binary hard-sphere mixtures of colloidal particles. In the process of mapping this phase diagram, driven entirely by entropy, a novel surface phase was discovered. This surface phase is explained geometrically in terms of the entropy of the small particles in the suspension. In the final experiment, the diffuse model of photon transport is extended to create a new technique called <b>Diffuse</b> <b>Transmission</b> Spectroscopy (DTS) for exploiting the wave vector dependent structure of colloidal suspensions. DTS uses the wavelength dependent transmission of a slab of colloid to probe interparticle structure.

It is shown that for small roughness exponents (H< 0. 5) the transmission coefficient increases with decreasing ratio w/ξ. For large roughness exponents (or smoother interfaces at short wavelengths) the transmission coefficient has a maximum at a certain value of the ratio w/ξ. With increasing w/ξ the tunneling current behaves similarly as the transmission coefficient. ...|$|E

Analytical approximations for all local extremal values and their positions have been generated by a numerical procedure.
