40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} there are {{described}} few systems of insulation resistance continuous measurement using an imposed DC test signal delivered by diode rectifiers. Drawbacks {{of this technique}} are pointed out and ways of these shortcomings removal are proposed. Methodology. An improved version of measuring circuit based on a single-phase diode rectifier is presented. Application of logometric measuring devices is suggested. Results. A new insulation resistance continuous measuring system is insensitive to network voltages variation and asymmetry. Modified circuit enables also implementation of a simple device for alarming the monitored network’s insulation deterioration and/or <b>earth-fault</b> <b>protection.</b> Originality. Formulas describing performance of diode rectifiers under asymmetrical supply have not been available so far. Both innovations (i. e. single-phase diode rectifier and logometric meter) have not been applied widely for implementation of continuous insulation monitoring in live AC IT networks. Practical value. Use of both innovations will allow to eliminate unrequired dependence of measurement results on variable network voltages {{as well as their}} possible asymmetry. Exploitation of diode rectifier circuits for earth fault location is also possible...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with distance protection of tapped lines is related to zero sequence infeed from an earthed tap-transformer. For the solution of this problem the distance measuring units algorithms for the tapped lines are developed. The new <b>earth-faults</b> distance <b>protection</b> algorithms {{are based on the}} use of numerical optimization methods and the objective function adaptation of to the network configurations. The estimations of new and classical algorithms operation in different earth fault conditions at the end of first protective zone are obtained. It is shown that the effectiveness of the developed <b>earth-fault</b> distance <b>protection</b> algorithms operation during different fault conditions on the tapped lines are higher then effectiveness of the classic algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|Voltage Symmetrization System (VSS) was {{developed}} especially for electric power networks with great phase voltage unbalance. It is a three-phase system which enables earth-fault current and charging current elimination. Until now, the operation with earth-fault current compensation {{has been very}} complicated for the networks with a great voltage unbalance. In the past, {{it was necessary to}} operate such networks with an isolated neutral, solid grounding or with a significantly untuned arc-suppression coil. VSS can also substitute for an arc-suppression coil or it can complement it parallelly. Moreover, it contributes to a better function of <b>earth-fault</b> <b>protections</b> for high-resistance earth faults by equalizing phase-to-earth capacity unbalance. The VSS was patented.The three-phase VSS has several basic functions: ...|$|R

All the basic types of line protection are included in the terminal: distance protection, differential current <b>protection,</b> overcurrent <b>protection,</b> <b>earth-fault</b> overcurrent <b>protection,</b> breaker failure protection, and automatic reclosing function. Fault location using synchronized measurements from both line ends is implemented. Special attention is paid to the problem of measurement synchronization of differential current protection. The synchronized phasor measurement methods and algorithms are described as applied to the terminal LIDA.

40|$|Despite of {{the careful}} {{building}} {{and maintenance of}} the electricity network, faults like short-circuit and earth-faults take place from time to time. Majority of the faults customers experience in low voltage networks are caused by the faults in the medium voltage networks. Therefore minimizing faults in medium voltage networks contributes {{to the quality of}} delivery. A way of improving the quality of delivery is to sectionalize the protection areas into smaller units with network reclosers. Reclosers include short-circuit and <b>earth-fault</b> <b>protection</b> and auto-reclosing functionalities. The best results are gained by placing the recloser so {{that the majority of the}} faults stay behind the device and the customers on the other side, so that they are not affected by the outage caused by the fault occurring behind the recloser. The quality of delivery indexes are improved by using reclosers. After the great storms in the Nordic countries the network owners started to replace over-head line networks with underground cable. The cable characteristics, however, are very different from the characteristics of an over-head line. Cabling increases the capacitive earth-fault current for it may be considered as a cylindrical capacitor. Due to this, also the reactive power generation is increased in cabled networks. Cable can be represented with a pi-section in which the series impedance consists of reactive and resistive parts. Because an underground cable has a zero sequence series impedance which is non-negligible on contrary to over-head line, cabling long feeders produces a resistive earth-fault current component. This cannot be compensated with the usage of a Petersen coil, which is used to compensate purely capacitive earth-fault current. Increase in earth-fault current may cause hazards for human safety because the earth-fault current can energize network equipment and thereby cause dangerous over-voltages. Therefore the contact voltages have to be limited also in terms of regulations. The studies regarding earth-fault current behavior were carried out with a program namely Power System simulator for Engineering. The studies show that as the cabling increases, the zero sequence resistance becomes more dominating. When using only centralized compensation the zero sequence resistance produces resistive earth-fault current, which may cause dangerous over-voltages and causes voltage drops in zero sequence network. This may lead to difficulties in detecting high impedance earth-faults. The fault detection can be contributed with the usage of distributed compensation. The best results are gained by compensating first 10 - 15 kilometers centrally and the rest locally. The distributed Petersen coil should be dimensioned according to the produced earth-fault current in order to avoid over-compensation which may lead to false relay functions. The cable zero sequence impedance, however, is not an unambiguous matter. Therefore some field tests should be performed in the future in order to achieve even better knowledge regarding these issues. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master´s {{thesis is}} use of {{instrument}} transformers and sensors on field of industry protection. We will compare current and voltage transformers, current sensor – based on Rogowski coil, voltage sensor – based on voltage divider. By this measure devices, we can monitoring values of analog quantities in medium voltage switchgear. It is impossible to compare, measure and analyze without this measure devices. There is protection terminal REF 542 plus, which can compile this values. The REF 542 plus ability are measuring, monitoring, remote control and protection. First, we will discuss about theory of sensors and convential instrument transformers and analysis of analog signal. We will compare analog input channel on sensor´s analog module and transformer´s analog module. There are few differences between type of analog modules. For analog signal analysis are important frequency filters and Analog/ Digital Convertor (sigma-delta). We will describe functions and options of REF 542 plus. In practical part of this project, we will test protection functions of protection terminal. First, protection terminal will be connected to sensors. Second protection terminal will be connected to transformers. For testing we chose <b>Earth-fault</b> directional <b>protection</b> and differential protection. We will make only secondary tests. That´s mean, input analog quantities to REF 542 plus will be simulated by tester. In all we will verify quality of protection. We will focus on lower settings of protection and we will inject protection by low current. Objectives are testing of trip characteristics and measuring of trip time...|$|R
