50|$|Resignation.

The resignation is indicated by bowing and/or saying 'I lost' (負けました makemashita) and/or placing <b>the</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> piece stands. Placing <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> piece stand is a vestige of the older practice of gently dropping one's pieces in <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> board in order to indicate resignation. In western practice, a handshake may be used.|$|R
