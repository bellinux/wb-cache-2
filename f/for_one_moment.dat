25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many. I do not care <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> how that is; it is no matter whether we are to consider Him our God, or whether His Father, or his Grandfather, for in either case we are of one species of one family and Jesus Christ is also of our species.|$|E
25|$|Heine's mode was satirical attack: {{against the}} Kings of Bavaria and Prussia (he never <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> shared {{the belief that}} Frederick William IV might be more liberal); against the {{political}} torpor of the German people; and against the greed and cruelty of the ruling class. The most popular of Heine's political poems was his least typical, Die schlesischen Weber ("The Silesian Weavers"), based on the uprising of weavers in Peterswaldau in 1844.|$|E
25|$|Klaas A. Posthuma {{argues that}} neither Tristan nor Isolde try <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> to ignore their {{feelings}} of {{love for each other}} nor do they try to overcome them. On the contrary, they yield to their feelings with all their hearts – but secretly. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the Schopenhauer doctrine. Another important point in this philosophy is Schopenhauer's opinion about finding happiness with one woman only, which he rejected – his reason for never marrying. But for Tristan there is only one woman, Isolde, with Death as alternative. And this leads to the inevitable conclusion that it was not Schopenhauer and his doctrine that were responsible for the creation of Wagner's sublime music drama but his unfulfilled love for the woman he met and loved during these years, Mathilde Wesendonck.|$|E

25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover and yell. Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> and then told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E
25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E

However, he then {{read the script}} {{and thought it was}} [...] "just brilliant", especially as Davies had added more scenes featuring the male characters. Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby, Brandon's rival for Marianne's affections. Describing his character, Cooper said [...] "The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn't too bad was that he's a 25-year-old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne – he's not just doing it <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> in time."

500|$|No {{longer able}} to keep his silence, Coach escorts Lisa into an office, admits to Lisa that she is too good for someone who treats her badly, like Roy, and openly refuses to let her marry him. Lisa reluctantly admits that she knows {{everything}} about Roy, that her relationship with Roy is a sham, and that Roy is {{the first and only}} man in her life, as she had no other. Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's [...] "beautiful", but Lisa objects and begs him <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her mother was not beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Finally, Lisa feels self-confident and thanks her father for his comments.|$|E
500|$|In November 1921 Joseph {{organised}} the Morley {{forces to}} perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary {{of the church of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields. The text was by Laurence Housman and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her Seven Two-Part Songs were performed at a SWM concert that included works by Ethel Smyth and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, A Hymn for Whitsuntide and A Festival Venite were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, Blackheath, with Holst conducting. After the Venite premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: [...] "Do you suppose <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong". The Venite was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the Spectators critic thought it a [...] "very notable addition to modern British music". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.|$|E
500|$|Several {{records were}} broken at the final. For {{the first time}} at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps did not break the current world record in a final, {{finishing}} eighteen one-hundredths of a second behind team-mate Crocker's 50.40-second world record from 2005; he did though set a new Olympic record. Three continental records were broken in the final, with Fujii setting a new Asian record, Čavić a new European record, and Lauterstein a new Oceanic record. Although he finished last, swimmer Ryan Pini made history as the first swimmer from Papua New Guinea to swim in an Olympic final, and even received a call from the prime minister Michael Somare congratulating him. Most notably though, Phelps won his seventh gold medal at these Games, tying Mark Spitz's record for most gold medals won at a single Olympic Games. For being able to emulate Spitz's record, Speedo, a sponsor of Michael Phelps, awarded him a US$1 million bonus, which had already been offered to him at the 2004 Summer Olympics, under the same conditions. After the final, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) arranged a joint interview with Phelps and Spitz, where Spitz praised Phelps' effort, telling him that [...] "what you did tonight was epic" [...] and even though at one point, Phelps was more than half a second behind Čavić, Spitz [...] "never thought <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> you (Phelps) were out of that race." ...|$|E

Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik {{described it}} as [...] "one of the most serious, frank and compelling discussions of race in any medium" [...] since an episode of NYPD Blue from 1995, in which actor Dennis Franz used the word [...] "nigger". Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press described [...] "Blood Ties" [...] as [...] "explosive (and) riveting", and wrote, [...] "The smart, darkly humorous writing on Homicide is as strong as ever.

David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode had an unpredictability that helped maintain the show's vitality, and said {{of the first two}} episodes, [...] "Except <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment</b> in tonight's opener, I was {{on the edge of my}} seat for the entire two hours; at that moment, a surprise shooting shocked me right onto my feet." [...] Newsday writer Verne Gay described [...] "Blood Ties" [...] as [...] "brilliant drama" [...] and [...] "a superb piece of work (that) appears to be a novel variation on reverse discrimination". Regarding the first of the three episodes, Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark said Seda and Thorne had [...] "solid first impressions" [...] and that the episode arc [...] "has all the makings of another killer story line". Virginia Rohan of The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, called the episode [...] "gripping" [...] and [...] "another strong start for a terrific series".|$|E

2500|$|The Pali Canon {{records that}} the Buddha {{distinguished}} between {{two kinds of}} illness (rogo): physical illness (kāyiko rogo) and mental illness (cetasiko rogo).

From {{the perspective of the}} Buddha, mental illness is a matter of degree, and ultimately, everyone who is not an awakened being is in some sense mentally ill. As the Buddha in the Pali canon states: [...] "those beings are hard to find in the world who can admit freedom from mental disease even <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>moment,</b> save only those in whom the asavas are destroyed." [...] Another set of negative qualities outlined by the Buddha are the five hindrances, which are said to prevent proper mental cultivation, these are: sense desire, hostility, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry and doubt.|$|E
