2500|$|Lewinsky {{confided in}} [...] Linda Tripp about her {{relationship}} with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to <b>dry</b> <b>clean</b> a semen-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{and bring them to}} the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of Newsweek) about the tapes.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in the Jones case. Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to <b>dry</b> <b>clean</b> what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E
60|$|I dashed down, dodged {{under the}} cedars, {{threaded}} {{a maze of}} rocks, to find myself in a ravine with a bare, water-worn floor. In patches of sand showed the fresh tracks of Don and the lion. Running down this <b>dry,</b> <b>clean</b> bed was the easiest going I ever found in the canyon. Every rod the course jumped in a fall from four to ten feet, often more, and these I slid down. How I ever kept Don in hearing was a marvel, but still I did.|$|E

60|$|It always {{hung over}} the twisted, bulbous lead pipes below the {{stationary}} basin in the women's wash-room provided by the Septimus Building for the women on three floors. It was a rag ancient and slate-gray, grotesquely stiff and grotesquely hairy at its frayed edges--a corpse of a scrub-rag in rigor mortis. Una was annoyed with herself for ever observing so unlovely an object, but {{in the moment of}} relaxation when she went to wash her hands she was unduly sensitive to that eternal rag, and to the griminess of the wash-room--the cracked and yellow-stained wash-bowl, the cold water that stung in winter, the roller-towel which she spun round and round in the effort to find a <b>dry,</b> <b>clean,</b> square space, till, in a spasm of revulsion, she would bolt out of the wash-room with her face and hands half dried.|$|E

50|$|Vapor steam {{cleaners}} or steam vapor systems are cleaning appliances or devices that use steam to quickly <b>dry,</b> <b>clean,</b> and sanitize inanimate surfaces. Often {{the process is}} effective enough to disinfect or even sterilize the surfaces. The steam is produced in a boiler that heats tap water to high temperatures (240-310F/115-155C) to produce low-pressure (several atmospheres), low moisture (4 to 6% water) water vapor (steam).|$|E
50|$|Topical Sealers: Topical Sealers {{can provide}} visual {{enhancement}} {{as well as}} topical protection from stains and chemicals. They require a <b>dry,</b> <b>clean</b> surface during application to gain adhesion. Topical sealers may alter the coefficient of friction which can make substrates slick when wet - a condition that can be remedied by adding anti-skid materials. Life span is generally 1-5 years, although high-end epoxy/urethane systems can last significantly longer.|$|E

By the 1970s though, tuberculosis was in decline and the sanatorium eventually closed.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 100 {{million metric}} tons of oxygen are {{produced}} yearly. Oxygen is most commonly produced by fractional distillation, in which air is cooled to a liquid, then warmed, allowing all the components of air except for oxygen to turn to gases and escape. Fractionally distilling air several times can produce 99.5% pure oxygen. Another method with which oxygen is produced is to send a stream of <b>dry,</b> <b>clean</b> air through a bed of molecular sieves made of zeolite, which absorbs the nitrogen in the air, leaving 90 to 93% pure oxygen.|$|E
