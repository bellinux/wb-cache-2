40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the <b>exportation</b> <b>of</b> soy, and other derived products, in Brazil and in ParanÃ¡ state, from 1990 to 2007. The methodological procedures consist of {{identification of the}} most representative products of the chain - the soy in grain, the soy bran and soy oil, {{and analysis of the}} results using the Constant Market-Share (CMS) model. The sources of the growth in exportations were divided into four components: the growth of world-wide commerce, definition <b>of</b> the <b>exportation</b> guideline, destination <b>of</b> the exported products and the competitiveness effects. In the period studied, the soy complex as a whole diversified its commercial partners due to a decrease in the concentration of the Brazilian and paranaense exportations. However, a concentration <b>of</b> the soy <b>exportation</b> market, and the consequent increase in international competition, was verified. The reasons behind the growth of the soy complex in Brazil and in ParanÃ¡ state were competitiveness and the world-wide commerce in the period between 1990 and 1994, due to the opening of commercial barriers after 1990. The competitiveness in the period between 2000 and 2007 was due to investments in P&D. The barriers to the growth <b>of</b> <b>exportations</b> were: infrastructure, protectionism and the lack of interaction policies between the different segments of the soy complex.
