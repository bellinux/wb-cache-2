40|$|The {{predictive}} {{distribution is}} used to find the area under the ROC curve when the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> is discrete. Typically, there are two groups of patients, {{those who have the}} condition and those who do not, and on each patient a diagnostic ordinal response is measured. The true status of the patient is determined by a gold standard, and this information together with the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> allows one to estimate the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1 - specificity), for a given threshold value. Using each possible value of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> as a threshold value, the ROC curve is determined, and the area under the curve can be estimated. The area under the curve gives the overall accuracy of the diagnostic procedure. A novel approach using the Bayesian predictive density to estimate the area is proposed.

As a complement to recent efforts to discover the interrelationships among climate, topography, erosion, and rock deformation under conditions of mass-flux steady state, we explore orogen response to changes in climate and tectonic influx. We derive an analytical model that predicts a powerful climatic control on orogen evolution and distinct, potentially <b>diagnostic,</b> <b>responses</b> to climatic and tectonic perturbations. Due to isostatic compensation, the near-surface rock uplift rate during transients is tightly coupled to climate-modulated erosional efficiency.

40|$|Boundary {{extension}} (BE) is {{a rapidly}} occurring memory error {{in which participants}} incorrectly remember having seen {{beyond the boundaries of}} a view. However, behavioral data has provided no insight into how quickly after the onset of a test picture the effect is detected. To determine the time course of BE from neural responses we conducted a BE experiment while recording EEG. We exploited a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> asymmetry to mismatched views (a closer and wider view of the same scene) in which the same pair of views is rated as more similar when the closer item is shown first than vice versa. On each trial, a closer or wider view was presented for 250  ms followed by a 250 -ms mask and either the identical view or a mismatched view. Boundary ratings replicated the typical asymmetry. We found a similar asymmetry in ERP responses in the 265 - 285  ms interval where the second member of the close-then-wide pairs evoked less negative responses at left parieto-temporal sites compared to the wide-then-close condition. We also found diagnostic ERP effects in the 500 - 560  ms range, where ERPs to wide-then-close pairs were more positive at centro-parietal sites than in the other three conditions, which is thought to be related to participants' confidence in their perceptual decision. The ERP effect in the 265 - 285  ms range suggests the falsely remembered region beyond the view-boundaries of S 1 is rapidly available and impacts assessment of the test picture within the first 265  ms of viewing, suggesting that extrapolated scene structure may be computed rapidly enough {{to play a role in}} the integration of successive views during visual scanning...|$|E

40|$|The devastating affects {{of disease}} on European {{freshwater}} crayfish {{are well known}} as epizootics in wild populations have occurred throughout much of Europe since the mid XVIIIe s. After protracted and rigorous debate, {{the cause of the}} disease named crayfish plague was proved to be the fungus Aphanomyces astaci in 1934. In the last 70 years, much of the research conducted in the field of crayfish pathology has concentrated on fungi, especially improving diagnostic techniques for A. astaci. Similarly, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>responses</b> to epizootics in European crayfish have concentrated almost entirely on fungal isolation and/or identification. On the other hand, viruses have proved {{to be the most important}} pathogens in the growing global crustacean aquaculture and fishery industries. Rickettsia-like organisms (RLO) are also important. Critically, diagnostic techniques necessary to detect the full range of potential pathogens of crayfish are rarely utilized in the field of crayfish pathology in Europe. Histopathological analysis, required for the diagnosis of infections by viruses and RLOs, is absent from most European studies. Epizootics unrelated to A. astaci in European crayfish and epizootics in introduced American crayfish species highlight the inadequate current state of knowledge in the field. Presently, the field is ill-equipped to determine the cause(s) of these epizootics. Moreover, crayfish conservation strategies may be undermined and even detrimental to the longterm goals; eg., stocking programs may spread undetected pathogens.

Even under such conditions, an electrical signal should be within its expected range so that some mitigating actions can be taken based on the signal in the control room. For example, an industrial process control standard requires that the normal signal level for pressure, flow, and resistance temperature detector sensors be {{in the range of}} 4 ~ 20 [*]mA for most instruments. Whereas, in the case that an abnormal signal is expected from an instrument, such a signal should be refined through a signal validation process so that the refined signal could be available in the control room.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Experience with {{a highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza outbreak in the Netherlands (2003) illustrated that the diagnostic demand for respiratory viruses at different biosafety levels (including BSL 3), can increase unexpectedly and dramatically. OBJECTIVES: We describe the measures taken since, aimed at strengthening national laboratory surge capacity and improving preparedness for dealing with diagnostic demand during outbreaks of (emerging) respiratory virus infections, including pandemic influenza virus. STUDY DESIGN: Academic and peripheral medical-microbiological laboratories collaborated to determine minimal laboratory requirements for the identification of viruses {{in the early stages}} of a pandemic or a large outbreak of avian influenza virus. Next, an enhanced collaborative national network of outbreak assistance laboratories (OAL) was set up. An inventory was made of the maximum diagnostic throughput that this network can deliver in a period of intensified demand. For an estimate of the potential magnitude of this surge demand, historical counts were calculated from hospital- and physician-based registries of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: Number of respiratory physician-visits ranged from 140, 000 to 615, 000 per month and hospitalizations ranged from 3000 to 11, 500 per month. The established OAL-network provides rapid <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> with agreed quality requirements and a maximum throughput capacity of 1275 samples/day (38, 000 per month), assuming other routine diagnostic work needs to be maintained. CONCLUSIONS: Thus surge demand for diagnostics for hospitalized cases (if not distinguishable from other respiratory illness) could be handled by the OAL network. Assessing etiology of community acquired acute respiratory infection however, may rapidly exceed the capacity of the network. Therefore algorithms are needed for triaging for laboratory diagnostics; currently this is not addressed in pandemic preparedness plans. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{response}} networks (LRNs) {{have been}} established for security reasons in several countries including the Netherlands, France, and Sweden. LRNs function in these countries as a preparedness measure for a coordinated <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> capability {{in case of a}} bioterrorism incident or other biocrimes. Generally, these LRNs are organized on a national level. The EU project AniBioThreat has identified the need for an integrated European LRN to strengthen preparedness against animal bioterrorism. One task of the AniBioThreat project is to suggest a plan to implement laboratory biorisk management CWA 15793 : 2011 (CWA 15793), a management system built on the principle of continual improvement through the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. The implementation of CWA 15793 can facilitate trust and credibility in a future European LRN and is an assurance that the work done at the laboratories is performed in a structured way with continuous improvements. As a first step, a gap analysis was performed to establish the current compliance status of biosafety and laboratory biosecurity management with CWA 15793 in 5 AniBioThreat partner institutes in France (ANSES), the Netherlands (CVI and RIVM), and Sweden (SMI and SVA). All 5 partners are national and/or international laboratory reference institutes in the field of public or animal health and possess highcontainment laboratories and animal facilities. The gap analysis showed that the participating institutes already have robust biorisk management programs in place, but several gaps were identified that need to be addressed. Despite differences between the participating institutes in their compliance status, these variations are not significant. Biorisk management exercises also have been identified as a useful tool to control compliance status and thereby implementation of CWA 15793. An exercise concerning an insider threat and loss of a biological agent was performed at SVA in the AniBioThreat project to evaluate implementation of the contingency plans and as an activity in the implementation process of CWA 15793. The outcome of the exercise was perceived as very useful, and improvements to enhance biorisk preparedness were identified. Gap analyses and exercises are important, useful activities to facilitate implementation of CWA 15793. The PDCA cycle will enforce a structured way to work, with continual improvements concerning biorisk management activities. Based on the activities in the AniBioThreat project, the following requirements are uggested to promote implementation: support from the top management of the organizations, knowledge about CWA 15793, a compliance audit checklist and gap analysis, training and exercises, networking in LRNs and other networks, and interinstitutional audits. Implementation of CWA 15793 at each institute would strengthen the European animal bioterrorism response capabilities by establishing a well-prepared LRN...|$|E

The {{first part of this}} thesis aimed at gaining a better understanding of {{the relationship between}} eye movements and memory in relation to verbal information. The second part of this thesis investigated what could be learned about the memory processes involved in reasoning and decision-making by studying eye movements to blank spaces. The first study presented in this thesis clarified the role of eye movements for the retrieval of verbal information from memory. More precisely, it questioned if eye movements to nothing are functionally related to memory retrieval for verbal information, i. e. auditorily presented linguistic information. Eye movements were analyzed following correct and incorrect retrievals of previously presented auditory statements concerning artificial places that were probed during a subsequent retrieval phase. Additionally, eye movements were manipulated as the independent variable with the aid of a spatial cue that either guided the eyes towards or away from associated spatial locations. Using verbal materials elicited eye movements to associated but emptied spatial locations, thereby replicating previous findings on eye movements to nothing. This behaviour was more pronounced for correct in comparison to incorrect retrievals. Retrieval performance was higher when the eyes were guided towards in comparison to being guided away from associated spatial locations. In sum, eye movements play a functional role for the retrieval of verbal materials. The second study tested if the looking-at-nothing behaviour can also diminish; for example, does its effect diminish if people gain enough practice in a retrieval task? The same paradigm was employed as in the first study. Participants listened to four different sentences. Each sentence was associated with one of four areas on the screen and was presented 12 times. After every presentation, participants heard a statement probing one sentence, while the computer screen remained blank. More fixations were found to be located in areas associated with the probed sentence than in other locations. Moreover, the more trials participants completed, the less frequently they exhibited the looking-at-nothing behaviour. Looking-at-nothing behaviour can in this way be seen to indeed diminish when knowledge becomes strongly represented in memory. In the third and fourth study eye movements were utilized as a tool to investigate memory search during rule- versus similarity-based decision-making. In both studies participants first memorized multiple pieces of information relating to job candidates (exemplars). In subsequent test trials they judged the suitability of new candidates that varied in their similarity to the previously learned exemplars. Results showed that when using similarity, but not when using a rule, participants fixated longer on the previous location of exemplars that were similar to the new candidates than on the location of dissimilar exemplars. This suggests that people using similarity retrieve previously learned exemplars, whereas people using a rule do not. Eye movements were used yet again as a tool in the fifth study. On this occasion, eye movements were investigated during memory-based diagnostic reasoning. The study tested the effects of symptom order and diversity with symptom sequences that supported two or three contending hypotheses, and which were ambiguous throughout the symptom sequence. Participants first learned information about causes and symptoms presented in spatial frames. Gaze allocation on emptied spatial frames during symptom processing and during the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>response</b> reflected the subjective status of hypotheses held in memory and the preferred interpretation of ambiguous symptoms. Gaze data showed how the diagnostic decision develops and revealed instances of hypothesis change and biases in symptom processing. The results of this thesis demonstrate in very different scenarios the tight interplay between eye movements, memory and thinking. They show that eye movements are not automatically directed to spatial locations. Instead, they reflect the dynamic updating of internal, multimodal memory representations. Eye movements can be used as a direct behavioural correlate of memory processes involved in similarity- versus rule-based decision-making, and they reveal rich time-course information about the process of diagnostic reasoning. The results of this thesis are discussed in light of the current theoretical debates on cognitive processes that guide eye movements, memory and thinking. This thesis concludes by outlining a list of recommendations for using eye movements to investigate thinking processes, an outlook for future research and possible applications for the research findings. Diese Dissertation beschäftigt sich mit der Interaktion von Blickbewegungen, Gedächtnis- und Denkprozessen. In fünf experimentellen Untersuchungen, die auf der Messung von Blickbewegungen beruhen, wurde die menschliche Fähigkeit zum räumlichen Indizieren multimodaler Ereignisse untersucht. Diese Fähigkeit manifestiert sich u. a. im sogenannten „Looking-at-nothing“ Phänomen, das beschreibt, dass Menschen beim Abruf von Informationen aus dem Gedächtnis an Orte zurückblicken, die in einer vorhergehenden Enkodierphase mit den abzurufenden Informationen assoziiert wurden, selbst wenn diese räumlichen Positionen keinerlei erinnerungsrelevante Informationen mehr enthalten. In der ersten Untersuchung wurde der Frage nachgegangen, ob Blickbewegungen an geleerte räumliche Positionen den Abruf von Informationen aus dem Gedächtnis erleichtern. Während ein solches Verhalten für den Abruf zuvor visuell dargebotener Informationen bereits gezeigt werden konnte, ist die Befundlage für die Erinnerungsleistung bei auditiv dargebotenen, linguistischen Informationen unklar. Um diesen Zusammenhang zu untersuchen, wurde das Blickverhalten zunächst als Folge von richtigen und falschen Antworten untersucht. In einem weiteren Schritt wurde das Blickverhalten experimentell manipuliert. Dies geschah mit Hilfe eines räumlichen Hinweisreizes, der die Blicke entweder hin zu der Position leitete, die mit dem abzurufenden Stimulus assoziiert war, oder weg von dieser Position. Die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchung konnten bisherige Befunde zum Looking-at-nothing Verhalten replizieren. Zudem zeigte sich, dass beim korrekten Abruf von Informationen aus dem Gedächtnis vermehrt Looking-at-nothing gezeigt wurde, während das bei fehlerhaften Abrufen nicht der Fall war. Die Blickmanipulation ergab, dass die Gedächtnisleistung besser war, wenn der Hinweisreiz den Blick hin zur assoziierten räumlichen Position leitete. Im Gegensatz dazu war die Erinnerungsleistung schlechter, wenn der Blick von der assoziierten räumlichen Position weggeleitet wurde. Blickbewegungen an geleerte räumliche Positionen scheinen demnach auch den Abruf verbaler Stimuli zu erleichtern. In der zweiten Untersuchung wurde erforscht, ob das Looking-at-nothing Verhalten nachlässt, wenn das experimentelle Material stark gelernt, d. h. stark im Gedächtnis repräsentiert ist. Dazu wurde das gleiche experimentelle Paradigma, wie in der ersten Untersuchung verwendet. Vier verschiedene Sätze wurden während der Enkodierphase mit vier verschiedenen räumlichen Positionen assoziiert. Nach jeder Präsentation aller vier Sätze, wurde einer der Sätze getestet. Diese Prozedur wiederholte sich in zwölf Durchgängen. In den ersten vier Durchgängen sahen die Versuchspersonen beim Abruf häufiger in das Feld, dass mit der getesteten Information assoziiert war, d. h. sie zeigten wie erwartet das Looking-at-nothing Verhalten. Je mehr Durchgänge die Versuchspersonen bearbeiteten, desto seltener blickten sie zu der assoziierten räumlichen Position. Demnach verschwindet das Looking-at-nothing Verhalten, wenn Informationen stark im Gedächtnis repräsentiert sind. In der dritten und vierten Untersuchung wurden Blickbewegungen an geleerte räumliche Positionen als Methode verwendet um Denkprozesse zu untersuchen. In der dritten Untersuchung lernten Versuchsteilnehmer zunächst Informationen über fiktive Bewerber (Exemplare) für eine freie Position in einem Unternehmen. Jedes Exemplar wurde mit seinen Eigenschaften während der Lernphase mit einer distinkten räumlichen Position verknüpft. In einer nachfolgenden Entscheidungsphase beurteilten die Versuchsteilnehmer neue Bewerber. Diese neuen Bewerber variierten in ihrer Ähnlichkeit mit den zuvor gelernten Bewerbern. Versuchsteilnehmer die eine ähnlichkeitsbasierte Entscheidungsstrategie verwendeten, sahen an die geleerten räumlichen Positionen zurück, die in der Lernphase mit den Exemplaren verknüpft wurden. Wendeten sie jedoch eine abstrakte Regel an, um die neuen Bewerber zu beurteilten, so zeigten sie kein Looking-at-nothing Verhalten. Dieses Ergebnis lässt darauf schließen, dass eine ähnlichkeitsbasierte im Gegensatz zu einer regelbasierten Strategie den Abruf zuvor gelernter Exemplare bewirkt. Auch in der fünften Untersuchung wurden Blickbewegungen als Methode eingesetzt, diesmal zur Untersuchung gedächtnisbasierter Schlussfolgerungsprozesse, wie sie beim Finden von Erklärungen für eine Anzahl gegebener Informationen auftreten. Manipuliert wurden die Reihenfolge der präsentierten Informationen und die Diversität der möglichen Erklärungen. Die getesteten Symptomsequenzen unterstützen stets mindestens zwei mögliche Erklärungen. Die Versuchsteilnehmer lernten in einer vorangestellten Lernphase die Symptome und ihre möglichen Erklärungen. Symptome und Erklärungen wurden mit räumlichen Positionen verknüpft. In einer anschließenden Diagnosephase wurden verschiedene Symptomsequenzen getestet. Das Blickverhalten während der Diagnosephase reflektierte die Interpretation der Symptome im Sinne der subjektiv wahrscheinlichsten Erklärung. Die Aufzeichnung und Analyse der Blickbewegungen erlaubte es die Entwicklung dieser Interpretation über die gesamte Sequenz hinweg zu beobachten und Hypothesenwechsel lokalisieren zu können. Insgesamt stützen die Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation die Annahme einer engen funktionalen Verbindung von Blickbewegungen, Gedächtnis- und Denkprozessen. Sie zeigen, dass Blickbewegungen nicht automatisch an alle assoziierten räumlichen Positionen gerichtet werden, sondern dass sie vielmehr den situations- und aufgabenabhängigen Abruf von Informationen aus dem Gedächtnis widerspiegeln. Blickbewegungen können als direktes Verhaltensmaß zur Messung von Gedächtnisprozessen beim ähnlichkeitsbasierten Entscheiden herangezogen werden und liefern wertvolle Prozessdaten über die Integration von Symptominformationen beim diagnostischen Schließen. Die Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation werden im Lichte der aktuellen theoretischen Diskussion über kognitive Prozesse beim Bewegen der Augen, beim Gedächtnisabruf und beim komplexen Denken betrachtet. Abschließend werden Empfehlungen für die Verwendung der Methode der Blickbewegungsmessung als Prozessmaß zur Untersuchung gedächtnisbasierter Denkprozesse gegeben, ein Überblick über zukünftige Forschungsmöglichkeiten präsentiert und Ideen für Anwendungsmöglichkeiten der präsentierten Befunde aufgezeigt...|$|E

40|$|The {{first-line}} {{imaging technique}} for diagnosis inflammation in musculo-skeletal organs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is planar X-ray examination, which was {{for many years}} {{the first and the}} only single tool for RA <b>diagnostics</b> and <b>response</b> evaluation. Today, in the era of more aggressive RA treatment, ultrasound examination (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also frequently used. US is used to detect early signs of inflammation within the soft tissue. MRI allows to assess the soft tissue and bone marrow involvement in case of inflammation and/or infection. MRI is capable of detecting more inflammatory lesions and erosions than US, X-ray, or CT. Standard scintigraphy plays a crucial role, and data from positron emission tomography (PET) are also promising. These functional imaging techniques are used in detection of inflammation and/or infection in case of ambiguous results being obtained by other techniques or at other clinics. In patients with RA, scintigraphy {{plays a key role in}} the differential diagnosis of hip, knee, etc. endoprosthesis disorders, including mechanical or septic loosening...|$|R
