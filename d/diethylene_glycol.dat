5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, drugs that cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E
5|$|More than 5000 {{cases of}} {{poisoning}} {{occur in the}} United States each year. Those affected are often adults and male. Deaths from ethylene glycol have been reported as early as 1930. An outbreak of deaths in 1937 due to a medication mixed in a similar compound, <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> resulted in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 in the United States which mandated evidence of safety before new medications could be sold. Antifreeze products sometimes have a substance to make it bitter added to discourage drinking by children and other animals but {{this has not been}} found to be effective.|$|E

25|$|The {{reaction}} {{with these}} acids competes with the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene oxide; therefore, {{there is always}} a by-product of ethylene glycol with an admixture of <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> For a cleaner product, the reaction is conducted in the gas phase or in an organic solvent.|$|E
25|$|Staple fibers are spun in an {{intrinsic}} viscosity range that lies rather somewhat lower {{and that should}} be between 0.58 and 0.62 dℓ/g. In this case, too, the required viscosity can be adjusted via drying or vacuum adjustment in case of vacuum extrusion. For adjusting the viscosity, however, an addition of chain length modifier like ethylene glycol or <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> can also be used.|$|E
25|$|Other {{alcohols}} {{are substantially}} more poisonous than ethanol, {{partly because they}} take much longer to be metabolized and partly because their metabolism produces substances that are even more toxic. Methanol (wood alcohol), for instance, is oxidized to formaldehyde {{and then to the}} poisonous formic acid in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase and formaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, respectively; accumulation of formic acid can lead to blindness or death. Likewise, poisoning due to other alcohols such as ethylene glycol or <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> are due to their metabolites, which are also produced by alcohol dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} forms of wine fraud is when producers add hazardous materials such as lead(II) acetate ("sugar of lead"), <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> and methanol to wine in order to increase sweetness. Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the European Union and the American Food and Drug Administration, across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, but they make polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols {{are based on}} reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol {{disrupts}} hydrogen bonding when {{dissolved in}} water. Pure ethylene glycol freezes at about 12°C (10.4°F), but when mixed with water, the mixture does not readily crystallize, {{and therefore the}} freezing point of the mixture is depressed. Specifically, a mixture of 60% ethylene glycol and 40% water freezes at 45°C (49°F). <b>Diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> behaves similarly. It {{is used as a}} de-icing fluid for windshields and aircraft. The antifreeze capabilities of ethylene glycol have made it a component of vitrification (anticrystallization) mixtures for low-temperature preservation of biological tissues and organs. Mixture of ethylene glycol and water can also be chemically termed as glycol concentrate/compound/mixture/solution.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{appeared}} to have been added as an adulterant by some Austrian producers of white wines to make them sweeter and upgrade the dry wines to sweet wines; production of sweet wines is expensive and addition of sugar is easy to detect. Fortunately, the amount added was not high enough to be toxic except at impossibly high (for most people) levels of consumption (one would have needed to ingest about 28 bottles per day for approximately two weeks in order to suffer fatal effects). Twenty-three people died in 1986 because a fraudulent winemaker in Italy blended toxic methanol (wood alcohol) into his low-alcohol wine to increase its alcohol content.|$|E
25|$|Such {{copolymers}} are advantageous {{for certain}} molding applications, such as thermoforming, {{which is used}} for example to make tray or blister packaging from co-PET film, or amorphous PET sheet (A-PET/PETA) or PETG sheet. On the other hand, crystallization is important in other applications where mechanical and dimensional stability are important, such as seat belts. For PET bottles, the use of small amounts of isophthalic acid, CHDM, <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (DEG) or other comonomers can be useful: if only small amounts of comonomers are used, crystallization is slowed but not prevented entirely. As a result, bottles are obtainable via stretch blow molding ("SBM"), which are both clear and crystalline enough to be an adequate barrier to aromas and even gases, such as carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages.|$|E
25|$|In {{catalytic}} reforming, {{a mixture}} of hydrocarbons with boiling points between 60–200°C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500–525°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by extraction with any {{one of a number}} of solvents, including <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} a sulfa craze. For several years in the late 1930s, {{hundreds}} of manufacturers produced {{tens of thousands of}} tons of myriad forms of sulfa. This and nonexistent testing requirements led to the elixir sulfanilamide disaster in the fall of 1937, during which at least 100 people were poisoned with <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> This led to the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 in the United States. As the first and only effective antibiotic available in the years before penicillin, sulfa drugs continued to thrive through the early years of World War II. They are credited with saving the lives {{of tens of thousands of}} patients, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. (son of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and Winston Churchill. Sulfa had a central role in preventing wound infections during the war. American soldiers were issued a first-aid kit containing sulfa pills and powder, and were told to sprinkle it on any open wound.|$|E
25|$|Smaragd: The ripest wines {{that must}} contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum {{residual}} sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation {{was first used}} in 1986, right after the <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> scandal and was intended to denote the highest quality level of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5°KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49mm long and branded with vintage year, since 2007 also screwcaps are allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines {{tend to be the}} most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found sunning itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.|$|E

2500|$|This {{reaction}} can be catalyzed {{by either}} acids or bases, or can occur at neutral pH under elevated temperatures. The highest yields of ethylene glycol occur at acidic or neutral pH {{with a large}} excess of water. Under these conditions, ethylene glycol yields of 90% can be achieved. The major byproducts are the oligomers <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> triethylene glycol, and tetraethylene glycol. The separation of these oligomers and water is energy-intensive.

2500|$|In 1937 over 100 {{people died}} after ingesting [...] "Elixir Sulfanilamide" [...] {{manufactured}} by S.E. Massengill Company of Tennessee.

[...] Under the laws extant at that time, prosecution of the manufacturer was possible only under the technicality that the product had been called an [...] "elixir", which literally implied a solution in ethanol. [...] In response to this episode, the U.S. Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, which {{for the first time}} required pre-market demonstration of safety before a drug could be sold, and explicitly prohibited false therapeutic claims.|$|E
2500|$|Austrian {{wines are}} mostly dry white wines (often {{made from the}} Grüner Veltliner grape), though some sweeter white wines (such as dessert wines made around the Neusiedler See) are also produced. About 30% of the wines are red, made from Blaufränkisch (also known as Lemberger, or as Kékfrankos in {{neighbouring}} Hungary), Pinot noir and locally bred varieties such as Zweigelt. Four thousand years of winemaking history counted for little after the [...] "antifreeze scandal" [...] of 1985, when {{it was revealed that}} some wine brokers had been adulterating their wines with <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> The scandal destroyed the market for Austrian wine and compelled Austria to tackle low standards of bulk wine production, and reposition itself as a producer of quality wines. The country is also home to Riedel, makers {{of some of the most}} expensive wine glasses in the world. Some of the best producers of Austria include Weingut F.X. Pichler and Weingut Franz Hirtzberger, Weingut Hutter, Weingut Eigl and Wellanschitz.|$|E
2500|$|From the 14th–16th century, {{viticulture}} in the Wachau hits {{its peak}} {{along with the}} rest of Lower Austria with plantings an estimated 10 times greater across the land than what exist today. Unfortunately, this period saw the development of a surplus wine lake due, in part, to overproduction and competition from neighboring Germany and Hungary. As prices and influence in the important Vienna market was being affected, Wachau producers banded with neighboring Austrian producers to demand protectionist tariffs and eventually an outright ban on any [...] "foreign" [...] wine being imported into Lower Austria. These measures helped stabilize the Wachau wine industry to some degree until the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, followed by the phylloxera epidemic that would reach Austria later that century, would devastate the vineyards of Wachau. Slowly the wine industry would recover and during the 20th century, the Wachau would gain a global reputation for the quality of its dry Riesling and Grüner Veltliner. Then the 1985 <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> wine scandal, caused by producers outside the Wachau, gained international attention and caused a dramatic drop in sales for Austrian wines across the board.|$|E
2500|$|However that {{intensification}} of viticulture sowed {{the seeds of}} its own destruction. [...] During the twentieth century Austrian wine became a high-volume, industrialised business, with much of it being sold in bulk to Germany. A run of favourable years in the early 1980s saw massive yields of wines that were light, dilute and acidic, that nobody wanted. Wine brokers discovered that these wines could be made saleable {{by the addition of}} a little <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> more commonly found in antifreeze, which imparted sweetness and body to the wine. The adulteration was difficult to detect chemically—the 'antifreeze scandal' broke when one of them tried to claim for the cost of the chemical on his tax return. Although the amounts of glycol were less dangerous than the alcohol in the wine, and only a few middlemen were involved, exports collapsed and some countries banned Austrian wine altogether. [...] The antifreeze jokes persist, but in fact the scandal was the saviour of the industry in Austria. [...] Strict new regulations restricted yields among other things, producers moved towards more red wine and a dry style of white wine that was what the 1990s market would demand, and the middlemen went bust forcing producers to sell direct and encouraging the expression of local terroir. Perhaps most importantly, there was a massive change in the culture of wine production in Austria towards an emphasis on quality, as opposed to the low standards that permitted the scandal to happen in the first place.|$|E
