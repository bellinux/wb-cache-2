40|$|Igneous {{intrusions}} {{feature in}} many sedimentary basins where hydrocarbon {{exploration and production}} is continuing. Owing to distinct geophysical property contrasts with siliciclastic host rocks (e. g., higher Vp, density and resistivity than host rocks), intrusions can be easily delineated within data sets including seismic and CSEM profiles, provided <b>igneous</b> <b>bodies</b> are larger than the detection limit of the geophysical methods. On the other hand, <b>igneous</b> <b>bodies</b> affect geophysical imaging in volcanic basins. Recent analyses of 3 D seismic data, supported by field observations and lab-based experiments, have provided valuable insights into the prevailing geometries of intrusions, i. e. (1) layerdiscordant dykes, (2) layer-parallel sills and (3) saucer-shaped intrusions. Where emplaced, intrusive bodies affect all five principal components of a given petroleum system: (1) charge, (2) migration, (3) reservoir, (4) trap and (5) seal. Magmatic activity may positively or adversely affect any of these individual components, for instance by locally enhancing maturation within regionally immature source rocks, typically 30 - 250 % of the intrusion thickness, or by causing compartmentalization of source and reservoir rocks. Site-specific evaluations, including the timing and duration of the magmatic event are needed to evaluate the overall effect of intrusions on a given sedimentary basin’s petroleum system, and these are highlighted by case studies from different volcanic basins...|$|R

50|$|An {{intrusive}} dike is an <b>igneous</b> <b>body</b> with a {{very high}} aspect ratio, which means that its thickness is usually {{much smaller than the}} other two dimensions. Thickness can vary from sub-centimeter scale to many meters, and the lateral dimensions can extend over many kilometres. A dike is an intrusion into an opening cross-cutting fissure, shouldering aside other pre-existing layers or bodies of rock; this implies that a dike is always younger than the rocks that contain it. Dikes are usually high-angle to near-vertical in orientation, but subsequent tectonic deformation may rotate the sequence of strata through which the dike propagates so that the dike becomes horizontal. Near-horizontal, or conformable intrusions, along bedding planes between strata are called intrusive sills.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the cooling of intrusive and extrusive <b>igneous</b> <b>bodies</b> on the temperature history and surface heat flow of the Parana Basin. The Serra Geral igneous event (130 – 135 Ma) covered most of this basin with flood basalts. Associated with this event numerous sills and dykes intruded the sediments and basement, and extensive underplating may have occurred in the lower crust and upper mantle beneath the basin. We develop an analytical model of the conductive cooling of tabular intrusive bodies and use it to calculate temperatures within the sediments as a function of time since emplacement. Depending on the thickness of these <b>igneous</b> <b>bodies</b> and the timing of sequential emplacement, the thermal history of a given locus in the basin can range from a simple extended period of higher temperatures to multiple episodes of peak temperatures separated by cooling intervals. The cooling of surface flood basalts, sills and dykes is capable of maintaining temperatures abovc the normal geothermal gradient temperatures for a few hundred thousand years, while large-scale underplating may influence temperatures for up to 10 million years. We conclude that any residual heat from the cooling of the Serra Geral igneous rocks has long since decayed to insignificant values and that present-day temperatures and heat flow are not affected. However, the burial of the sediments beneath the thick basalt cap caused a permanent temperature increase of up to 50 °C in the underlying sediments {{since the beginning of the}} Cretaceous...|$|R

40|$|The mineralogical {{composition}} of Pohorje igneous rocks {{was determined by}} means of optical microscopy and X-ray poviwder diffraction.
