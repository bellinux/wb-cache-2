5000|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{increase}} the safety of bridges with pin and hanger assemblies by adding some form of redundancy to the assembly. Retrofits that add redundancy to pin and hanger assemblies include adding a [...] "catcher's mitt"a short steel beam attached {{to the bottom of the}} cantilevered girder that extends out beneath the suspended girder to [...] "catch" [...] the suspended girder should the pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> fail. Another redundancy is connecting the cantilevered and suspended girders at the pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> with welded blocks and tie rods. Finally, a bridge may be retrofitted by eliminating the expansion joint, replacing the pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> with a pair of gusset plates on each girder.|$|E
50|$|A {{pipe clamp}} {{can also be}} used to connect a pipe to the {{remainder}} of a pipe <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly.</b> Pipe clamps are recommended for suspension for cold pipe lines that may or may not be insulated.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pipe clamp}} {{is a type}} of clamp often {{employed}} in woodworking, piping or cabinet shops. When referring to woodwork or cabinet shops, pipe clamps are usually composed of commercially manufactured clamp heads or [...] "jaws" [...] and a length of common threaded pipe. The capacity of the clamp is determined by the length of the pipe used. When referring to piping, pipe clamps are used to connect the pipe to the pipe <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies</b> are {{considered}} fracture critical bridge components, {{meaning that the}} assemblies are non-redundant and failure of these systems could cause part {{or all of the}} bridge to collapse. The collapse of the Mianus River Bridge in Connecticut exposed potential flaws with pin and hanger bridges that could lead to catastrophic failures, if left unchecked. Because of this, state departments of transportation incur costly expenses on bridges with pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies,</b> as they require constant inspection and maintenance. As a result of these safety concerns, and advances in bridge design to allow longer spans, pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies</b> are no longer used on new bridges in the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, a $150 million bridge {{replacement}} project began. A new northbound span {{opened in}} January 1989, which allowed the temporary northbound truss {{to be taken}} out of service and demolished. On the former site, a new southbound span was built. The southbound span opened in November 1992, after which the remainder of the original bridge was taken out of service and demolished. The replacement bridge completed in 1992 is a continuous girder and floorbeam design, which eliminated the need for pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies</b> that were implicated in the collapse of the original 1958 span. Related cosmetic work and the restoration of the beachfront underneath the bridge continued to affect the area through early 1993. The new bridge, like the old one, contains six lanes of traffic, but also contains outer shoulders, a feature absent from the older and slightly narrower bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{collapse}} {{was caused}} by the failure of two pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies</b> that held the deck in place on the outer side of the bridge, according to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. Rust formed within the bearing of the pin, exerting a force on the hanger which was beyond design limits for the retaining clamps. It forced the hanger on the inside part of the expansion joint at the southeast corner off the end of the pin that was holding it, and the load was shifted to outside hanger. The extra load on the remaining hanger started a fatigue crack at a sharp corner on the pin. When it failed catastrophically, the deck was supported at just three corners. When two heavy trucks and a car entered the section, the remaining expansion joint failed, and the deck crashed into the river below.|$|R
50|$|Moses Wheeler Bridge carries Interstate 95 (Connecticut Turnpike) {{over the}} Housatonic River between Stratford and the Devon section of Milford. The current bridge is a 14-span {{continuous}} girder and floorbeam structure that carries three (expandable to four) lanes of traffic in each direction, with full {{inside and outside}} shoulders. The current bridge, {{to be completed in}} 2016, replaces a pre-existing structure that was completed as part of the original Connecticut Turnpike in 1958. The original bridge was a 34-span plate girder structure with a concrete deck with three 12-foot travel lanes in each direction and no shoulders. The central span of the original bridge over the river's navigation channel included a pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly,</b> which are no longer used in bridge construction. Construction on the Moses Wheeler Bridge began in 1955 and opened on January 2, 1958.|$|E
50|$|A pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> is used {{to connect}} two plate girders of a bridge. These {{assemblies}} are used to provide an expansion joint in the bridge. One beam (the anchor span) is set on a pier with a short section cantilevered out toward the next pier. The other (the suspended span) begins underneath the anchor span, and has its far end resting on the next pier. The beams have holes directly above each other. The two holes are connected using hangers, a pair of connecting plates sandwiching the bridge girders. A pair of large steel pins through the plates and girder webbing provide the hinges, holding up the suspended span while allowing it to move longitudinally. Large washers are bolted to {{each end of the}} pin to retain the hangers. Exceptionally long spans may have two sets of girders cantilevered from opposite bridge piers with a third set of girders suspended by pin and hanger assemblies from both cantilevers.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} steel beam bridges {{exist in the}} United States that contain pin and hanger {{assemblies}}. Pin and hanger assemblies are fracture critical members whose failure would result in collapse of the bridge or render it unable to perform its expected functions. As these bridges continue to age, many assemblies have deteriorated {{to a point where}} retrofit or replacement has to be considered and performed to maintain intended safety and performance. States have taken various approaches to address the pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> retrofit and replacement options. However, there is no single report that summarizes these approaches. This report documents steel pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> retrofit and replacement options via a literature review and synthesis that explores options that have been studied and implemented in the United States. In conjunction with the literature review, a survey was developed in conjunction with the Bureau of Sociological Research (BOSR) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to assist with identifying implemented strategies and evaluate best practices. Information was solicited from 50 states and was used in conjunction with the literature review to develop flowcharts that would assist NDOR personnel with assessing various options and their consequences when pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> retrofit or replacement options are being considered for bridges in the state...|$|E
40|$|Bridge pins {{were used}} in the <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies</b> for some {{multi-span}} steel bridges built prior to the 1980 's, and are sometimes considered fracture critical elements of a bridge. During a test on a bridge conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), ultrasonic field inspection results indicated that at least two pins contained cracks. Several pins were removed and selected for further examination. This provided an excellent opportunity {{to learn more about the}}se pins and the application of x-ray systems at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), as well as to learn more about the application of different detectors recently obtained by LLNL. Digital radiographs and computed tomography (CT) were used to characterize the bridge pins, using a LINAC x-ray source with a 9 -MV bremsstrahlung spectrum. We will describe the performance of two different digital radiographic detectors. One is a detector system frequently used at LLNL consisting of a scintillator glass optically coupled to a CCD camera. The other detector is a new amorphous silicon detector recently acquired by LLNL...|$|R
50|$|The Telegraph Road Bridge (TRB) is a multi-girder {{composite}} {{steel bridge}} built in 1973 in Monroe, Michigan, {{and designed to}} carry two lanes of northbound traffic on Interstate 275 (I-275). Monroe {{is located in the}} southeastern corner of Michigan and therefore sees heavy truck loads on its roads and bridges due to the large manufacturing industry in the area and its close proximity to the Canada-US border in Detroit. The total length of the TRB is approximately 224 ft and is designed with three main spans. The end spans are each 48 ft long and span from the bridge abutments to support piers with their spans cantilevering 6 ft past the interior piers. The main span of 140 ft suspends from the cantilevered end using pin and <b>hanger</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The bridge has seven steel girders in composite action with an 8 in reinforced concrete deck. The bridge is also skewed with a skew angle of 57 degrees. TRB is owned and managed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) imaging techniques in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) have seen increasing use in {{an array of}} industrial, environmental, military, and medical applications (Goebbels, et al., 1999). A brief overview and three diverse application studies of x-ray CT at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) will be discussed. (1) Bridge pins are fracture critical elements for some multi-span steel bridges. Recently, pins were removed from their <b>hanger</b> pin <b>assemblies.</b> These pins were selected for further examination by laboratory NDE techniques. High-energy x-ray radiography and CT were used to characterize these pins. (2) Cast light metals, aluminum and magnesium, are being used in an ever increasing number of applications to reduce automobile weight for improved gas mileage and lower emissions. After mechanical testing, the damage in notched Al-tensile test specimens was first determined using CT and subsequently by metallography analysis intended to benchmark the CT technique. (3) A computational approach to normal joint kinematics and prosthetic joint analysis offers an opportunity to evaluate and improve prosthetic joint replacements before they are manufactured or surgically implanted. Computed tomography data are combined with computational analysis to reveal regions where the joint design can be improved for better performance and longevity, prior to expensive manufacturing, laboratory tests, and clinical evaluation...|$|R

40|$|The means used {{to prevent}} the {{recurrence}} of tetralin leakage into the SRE sodium systems are discussed. Included is {{a description of the}} redssign of system components to utilize alteraate coolants such as nitrogen, air, and NaK. The use of kerosene to replace tetralin, where double containment is provided, is discussed. The physical properties are compared, and kerosene is shown to be free of the undesirable characteristics of tetralin. The fuelelement cleaning systsm was redesigned for steam washing, followed by a water rinse and vacuum drying. Hydrogen gas evolved during washing is oxidized with copper oxide to eliminate the possibility of a hydrogen-oxygen explosion if air should accidentally enter the vent system. The fuel element was changed from a seven- to a five-rod cluster to provide additional clearance in the channel. Element hardware was modified to provide an orifice location which will permit more precise flow calculations; a redesigned <b>hanger</b> <b>assembly</b> which will minimize sodium holdup; and filter screene at the channel entrance to prevent in-cluster plugging. Diagnostic instrumentation was provided for the reactor to monitor: fission-product activity in the reactor cover gas; rapidly varying reactor parameters during a reactor scram; internnl and aheath fuel temperatures; and fuinctions being performed whioh wiIl indicate the mode of operation.

40|$|Built in 1958, the US- 41 White River Bridge is a two-girder, riveted steel {{structure}} located in Hazelton, IN. The bridge {{is comprised of}} two, sixteen span superstructures sharing a common substructure. Each superstructure also contains four pin and <b>hanger</b> expansion joint <b>assemblies.</b> Over a period from August 2009 to August 2010 a series of nearly one hundred super-heavy loads ranging in weight from 200, 000 lbs to up over 1, 000, 000 lbs crossed the northbound superstructure of the bridge. The loads were moved to support {{the construction of a}} new power plant facility located in Edwardsport, IN. It was unknown what effect this number of super-heavy loading events, over a relatively short period, would have on the long-term performance of the US- 41 White River Bridge. Therefore, long-term remote monitoring was used to quantify any negative effects due to the series of superloads. Five primary tasks were undertaken as part of this study: 1. Perform controlled load testing to gain insight on the typical behavior of the bridge. 2. Monitor the effect of individual superloads on the bridge structure to detect any notable damage. 3. Perform an in-depth fracture evaluation. 4. Evaluate the effects of multiple super-heavy loading events on the bridge. 5. Collect stress range histograms to be used as part of a fatigue life evaluation. The results of this study confirmed the US- 41 White River Bridge is an excellent structure. The series of superloads had negligible long-term effects. Low material toughness was found during the material testing; however, based on the analysis performed, fracture is of little concern. Also, from the stress range histograms produced during the long-term monitoring, sufficient remaining fatigue life was calculated for all critical details. Thus, based on these results, only two actions items were suggested: 1.) Perform an in-depth inspection of the pin and hanger assemblies; and 2.) Lubricate all pin and hanger expansion joints...|$|R
