They are hamster alpha(1 B) -, human alpha(2) -, beta(2) -adrenergic, human D- 2 -dopaminergic, human 5 -HT 1 A-serotoninergic, human ml-muscarinic receptors and bovine rhodopsin. Starting from a rhodopsin-like input structure and a bacteriorhodopsin-like input structure, a similar arrangement of the averaged <b>helix</b> <b>bundles</b> was obtained. This {{may be due to}} the topography of some fundamental polar positions in both the input structures which is substantially the same and dictates, through the establishment of similar H-bonding networks, the helix-helix packing. By comparing the averaged structures and the packing interaction parameters obtained for the GPCRs considered with that of bacteriorhodopsin, we observe that the GPCRs share a similar packing arrangement of their transmembrane <b>helix</b> <b>bundles</b> which differs from that of bacteriorhodopsin.

40|$|Coiled coil <b>helix</b> <b>bundles</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common protein motifs known, playing {{significant}} roles in various mechanobiological processes. The desirable functionalities of -helical coiled coils are dependent upon their thermal and structural stability, which can be lost under extreme environmental conditions such as elevated temperatures, pressures, or pH. Recently, conjugation of -helices with polymers, particularly poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), has been utilized to produce environmentally responsive protein-based block copolymers with improved structural and thermal stability. A fundamental question regarding helix–PEG conjugates is how PEG conjugation affects the secondary structure of helices [1] as well as their tertiary structure, which is the mechanism of self-assembly. In particular, the influence of PEG conjugation site on the assembly of <b>helix</b> <b>bundles</b> remains to be fully characterized. In order to address these questions, we perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a trimeric coiled coil conjugated with PEG [2]. The effect of conjugation location is studied by covalently attaching the PEG chain either to the end or to the side of each helix in the three-helix assembly. First, we utilize annealing simulations to investigate the melting behavior and thermal stability of the coiled coil with no PEG attached, with side-conjugated PEG, and with end-conjugated PEG. Our simulation predictions for the coiled coil melting temperature are in good agreement with experimental data and show an insignificant difference between the melting temperatures of peptide itself and peptide-PEG conjugates. Next, we study the entropy driven self-assembly patterns of coiled coils with and without PEG by considering various peptide concentrations in the simulation box. Our results show that as the concentration increases, the number of assembled clusters decreases while the aggregation number in each cluster increases. Coiled coils without PEG, with end-conjugated PEG, and with side-conjugated PEG have the smallest number of clusters and the largest aggregation number, in order. These observations confirm that the peptide assembly patterns are affected not only by the presence of PEG chain, but also by the location of PEG conjugation. These findings lay the groundwork for the study of mechanisms underpinning the thermomechanical stability and assembly of coiled coils as well as other <b>helix</b> <b>bundles.</b> REFERENCES [1] Hamed, E., Xu, T., Keten, S.

The residues essential for sugar recognition and H+ translocation are located {{at the apex of}} the cavity and are inaccessible from the outside. On the periplasmic side, helices I/II and VII from the N- and C- six <b>helix</b> <b>bundles,</b> respectively, participate in sealing the cavity from the outside.

After cross-linking with homobifunctional reagents less than ≈ 15 Å in length, all three mutants lose the ability to catalyze lactose transport. Strikingly, however, full or partial activity is observed when cross-linking is mediated by flexible reagents greater than ≈ 15 Å in length.

Coiled coils contain a highly {{characteristic}} sequence motif known as a heptad repeat, in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence (amino acid residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the a and d positions) are almost always hydrophobic; the fourth residue is typically leucine this gives rise to the name of the structural motif called a leucine zipper, which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the <b>helix</b> <b>bundle.</b> In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the e and g positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Fibrous proteins such as keratin or the [...] "stalks" [...] of myosin or kinesin often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several dimerizing proteins. A pair of coiled-coils a four-helix bundle is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human growth hormone and several varieties of cytochrome.

The crystal structure of the early endosomal SNARE complex resembles that of the neuronal and late endosomal complexes, but differs in surface side-chain interactions.
