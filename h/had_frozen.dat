5|$|Kroonland was {{launched}} {{on the afternoon}} of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. Rodman Griscom christened the ship, but Kroonland did not budge on the launching way; cold weather <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> the tallow used to grease the timbers. Hydraulic jacks eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the Delaware River.|$|E
5|$|Washington again {{proposed}} to assault Boston in October, but his officers {{thought it best}} {{to wait until the}} harbor <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> over. In February, when the water <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> between Roxbury and Boston Common, Washington thought that in spite of his shortage in powder he would try an assault by rushing across the ice; but his officers again advised against it. Washington's desire to launch an attack on Boston arose from his fear that his army would desert in the winter, and how easily he knew that Howe could break the lines of his army in its present condition. He had not yet learned how completely he could trust in Howe's inactivity; he abandoned an attack across the ice with great reluctance in exchange for a more cautious plan, to fortify Dorchester Heights using cannon arrived from Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|LaRouche lawyers filed {{a series}} of related civil suits against individuals, {{agencies}} and businesses. They sued Weld and former Attorney General William French Smith {{to try to stop}} the FBI investigation of the credit card case. They sued the New Jersey bank that <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> their credit card merchant accounts; and they sued Chemical Bank in a similar suit. Edward Spannaus, a treasurer for LaRouche campaigns, filed complaints with the state bar and the U.S. Justice Department against one of the Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the case.|$|E

5|$|The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party {{remained}} unknown until 1924, when an American vessel {{landed at}} Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established {{that this was}} Anderson's party. No {{cause of death was}} established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> to death. Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.|$|E
5|$|When {{time for}} the Scotland Test did arrive, it was {{discovered}} that as the ground had not been covered for protection from the elements, and <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> over. The SFU wanted to abandon the match, but Gallaher and the tour manager George Dixon contended that the weather would improve enough for the pitch to thaw, and the match was eventually allowed to proceed. The Test was closely contested, with Scotland leading 7–6 at half-time, but the All Blacks scored two late tries to win 12–7; despite the close score-line, the New Zealanders were clearly the better of the two sides.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground <b>had</b> <b>frozen,</b> making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E

5|$|Eve later {{returned}} to town again with her now-grown son Cole, who romanced Victor’s daughter Victoria, unaware he {{was believed to}} be Victor’s son. Victor later left Genoa City and traveled to Kansas, letting Nikki {{and the rest of the}} Newman family believe he had died. He meets Hope Adams (Signy Coleman). They {{returned to}} Genoa City and married. While Victor was in Kansas, Cole and Victoria had eloped, and when Victor revealed their sibling relation, the marriage was annulled. However, when Eve died, it was revealed that Cole was never Victor’s son; Victoria and Cole remarry. Victor and Hope later have a son, Victor Adam Newman Jr. Hope wanted to return to Kansas and Victor was not interested; he divorced her and Victor Jr. was raised without knowing Victor was his father. Nikki had been engaged to Brad, much to Victor’s dismay. On their wedding night, Victor was shot and Nikki returned to him; the mentally unstable Mari Jo Mason (Diana Barton) was revealed as the gunwoman. Victor and Nikki briefly reunite before he returns to Kansas after Hope’s new husband, Cliff Wilson, had died. In 1997, Victor marries Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley), Jack’s ex-girlfriend. Nikki had Victor have a vasectomy, but <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> sperm for a future possibility. Nikki later marries Joshua Landers (Heath Kizzier), and in 1998, she is shot by Joshua’s ex-wife, Veronica Landers (Candice Daly); Victor divorces Diane to marry Nikki on her deathbed, promising to remarry Diane after Nikki’s death. When Nikki survived, their second marriage was invalidated, as Victor and Diane’s divorce was never processed. Victor and Diane begin a bitter divorce over many months, during which Nikki reunites with Brad, and he and Jack take control of Newman Enterprises.|$|E

25|$|An autopsy {{found that}} the man had died of foul play, {{remarking}} something initially puzzling: ice crystals in blood vessels near his heart. His interior organs also had decayed at a rate far slower than his skin. Pathologists concluded that someone <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> his body after death in an attempt to mislead investigators into believing he died at a later time than he actually did. The man was identified as someone on the periphery of Mafia activities in nearby Rockland County, New York.|$|E
25|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Hamilton won {{the gold}} medal in the men's {{individual}} time trial. That medal was placed in doubt on September 20, 2004, after he failed a test for blood doping (receiving blood transfusions to boost performance) at the Olympics. Two days after the announcement of his positive test at Athens, the IOC announced Hamilton would keep his medal because results could not be obtained from the second sample. The Athens lab <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> the backup, which made it impossible to repeat the test. The Russian Olympic Committee appealed to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport to give Hamilton's medal to Russian silver medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov. However, on June 27, 2006, the court rejected the request.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} days of World War II, local {{residents}} planned to use Derrick Cave as an air-raid shelter if the Japanese began bombing the west coast of the United States. While residents of Central Oregon never needed an air raid shelter during World War II, Derrick Cave was designated as a nuclear fallout shelter in 1963. Supplies of food and water for up to 1,200 people were stored at the site. The supplies were stored in a small branch of the cave behind a locked steel door. However, vandals broke into the supply vault on several occasions and plundered the food cache. The vandals left the civil defense water cans, probably because they <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> solid. By 1970, all of the supplies had been stolen by vandals or removed by civil defense authorities.|$|E

25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped off his jacket and shirt and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew to watch what a man could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately rose to his aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E
25|$|The Infrastructure Project for Irrigation Improvement in the West Delta Region aims {{to improve}} {{irrigation}} on 500 thousand feddan, reclamation of 170 thousand feddan and rehabilitation of infrastructure serving 250 thousand feddan. This {{project is a}} public-private partnership designed as a hybrid scheme based largely on the design-build-operate (DBO) model. Under this model a private operator would design and construct the system, and operate it for 30 years, including the associated demand and commercial risks. The public sector would own the assets finances the project. According to the World Bank, the decision process from design to execution involved users from the conception through a water user council. Revenues are supposed to come through a two-part tariff, consisting of a fixed fee based on the land area a volumetric fee based on water use. As of 2012, the new Egyptian government <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> the project.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{were swept}} {{at home for}} the first time in 2017 by the Texas Rangers in interleague play. Closer Glover blew his first save {{opportunity}} of the season on June 10 and admitted after the game that he had injured his back that morning and had not told the team about his condition. Glover was placed on the disabled list the next day and Joe Blanton was reactivated. On June 12, infielder Wilmer Difo — who <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> up on a potential game-winning bunt single in the June 10 game while leading off third base, being tagged out in a rundown before an eventual Nationals 6–3 loss — was optioned to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs. Reliever Trevor Gott was called up, giving the Nationals an eight-man bullpen as they headed into a series against the division rival Atlanta Braves. Gott picked up the win in his first game on June 13, with the Nationals defeating the Braves 10–5, but after a relief appearance the following day in which he was charged with five earned runs over 1⅔ innings, he was optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse and left-hander Matt Grace recalled for a series against the division rival New York Mets beginning June 15. The Nationals took three out of four against the Mets, with Grace appearing in two games.|$|E

25|$|The last {{military}} {{use of the}} Danevirke {{was during}} the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Due especially to the above-mentioned emotive nationalist symbolism, public opinion in Denmark and the Danish military had expected the coming battle to take place here. After centuries of abandonment and decay, the Danevirke fortifications were partially restored, strengthened, and equipped with artillery installations in 1850 and 1861. In the Second War of Schleswig, there was some early skirmishing {{to the south of}} the Danevirke, but ironically no battle took place here, as the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew all soldiers to the trenches at Dybbøl, owing to an unexpected threat of being outflanked. The Schlei and the wetlands between the Danevirke and Husum <b>had</b> <b>frozen</b> solid in a hard winter, and the territory immediately south of the Danevirke had been conquered by the advancing German army. This retreat came as a surprise to the Austro-Prussian army, and almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation. It resulted, however, in the abandonment of important pieces of heavy artillery, and it remains a matter of historical debate why the railway to Flensburg was never properly used for the evacuation. News of the retreat came as a great shock to Danish public opinion which had considered the Danevirke to be impregnable, and General deMeza was promptly relieved of his command. The Danevirke has remained in German possession ever since.|$|E

She was completed on 20 July and departed London on her maiden voyage to Brisbane, Australia on 1 October.|$|E

He continued in his socks, which wore through, forcing him to finish the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. After 23 days since Smith and Bill set off from Piancastagna, they met American troops who took them to a local base camp, from where they were returned to their respective forces. The Americans took Smith to Marseille, from where he was flown to the RAF transit camp at Naples. On arriving in late November 1944, Smith sent a brief telegram home to Selukwe: [...] "Alive and well. Love to you all—Ian." ...|$|E
