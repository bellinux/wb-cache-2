5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, {{studies have}} shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and <b>immunomodulatory</b> effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the <b>immunomodulatory</b> function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
25|$|In a 2014 paper a group first {{demonstrated}} the <b>immunomodulatory</b> potential of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT through the Sigma-1 receptor of human immune cells. This <b>immunomodulatory</b> activity {{may contribute to}} significant anti-inflammatory effects and tissue regeneration.|$|E
25|$|The antiulcer, laxative, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, <b>immunomodulatory,</b> {{antitumour}} and expectorant {{properties of}} liquorice have been investigated.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Immunoprin, among others, is an <b>immunomodulatory</b> drug and the {{prototype}} of the thalidomide class of drugs. Today, thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers (multiple myeloma) and of a complication of leprosy.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{prognosis}} is generally good with prompt diagnosis and aggressive <b>immunomodulatory</b> treatment. Inner ear symptoms usually respond to corticosteroid therapy within weeks to months; hearing usually recovers completely. Chronic eye effects such as cataracts, glaucoma, and optic atrophy can occur. Skin changes usually persist despite therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{life time}} of adult worms varies tremendously from one species to another but is {{generally}} {{in the range}} of 1 to 8 years (see following table). This life time of several years is a result of their ability to manipulate the immune response of their hosts by secreting <b>immunomodulatory</b> products.|$|E
25|$|Leflunomide is an <b>immunomodulatory</b> {{drug that}} {{achieves}} its effects by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which {{plays a key}} role in the de novo synthesis of uridine monophosphate (rUMP), which is required for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Hence, leflunomide inhibits the reproduction of rapidly dividing cells, especially lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{have been}} found between the proteines {{expressed}} by patients and healthy subjects, and between attacks and remissions. Using DNA microarray technology groups of molecular biomarkers can be established. For example, {{it is known that}} Anti-lipid oligoclonal IgM bands (OCMB) distinguish MS patients with early aggressive course and that these patients show a favourable response to <b>immunomodulatory</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{preliminary}} {{evidence that the}} <b>immunomodulatory</b> medication rintatolimod improves exercise capacity, as well as cognitive function and quality of life, based on two trials. The US FDA has repeatedly denied commercial approval, citing numerous deficiencies in both trials, and concluding that the available evidence is insufficient to demonstrate its safety or efficacy in CFS.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>immunomodulatory</b> {{treatments}} {{should be}} avoided due to the potential for additive immunosuppressant effects, {{or in the case}} of immunostimulants like echinacea or astragalus, reduced therapeutic effects. Likewise live vaccines (like haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and yellow fever vaccines) {{should be avoided}} due to the potential for severe infection due to the immunosuppressive nature of the treatment.|$|E
25|$|For example, SSRIs, SNRIs and {{tricyclic}} antidepressants {{acting on}} serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and cannabinoid receptors {{have been shown}} to be <b>immunomodulatory</b> and anti-inflammatory against pro-inflammatory cytokine processes, specifically on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-10, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 through a psychoneuroimmunological process. Antidepressants have also been shown to suppress TH1 upregulation.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as early}} studies showed islet transplantation's promise, {{research}} must now overcome the hurdles {{revealed by the}} recent islet transplant experience. New <b>immunomodulatory</b> agents offer the greatest hope of revolutionizing the field. New drug regimens capable of inducing tolerance to the transplanted islets would allow recipients to maintain their grafts without general immunosuppression and its associated toxicities. While many targets are currently under investigation, none are ready for clinical use.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Ito et al. {{reported}} that Cereblon, a DCAF protein, {{was a major}} target of the teratogenic compound thalidomide. Thalidomide and other derivatives such as pomalidomide and lenalidomide are known as <b>immunomodulatory</b> drugs (or IMiDs) and have been investigated as therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases and several cancers - particularly myelomas. Recent reports show that IMiDs bind to CRL4CRBN and promote the degradation of IKZN1 and IKZN3 transcription factors, which are not normally targeted by CRL4 complexes.|$|E
25|$|Helminths are {{worm-like}} organisms {{living in}} and feeding on living hosts, receiving nourishment and protection while disrupting their hosts' nutrient absorption, causing weakness and disease. Those that live inside {{the digestive tract}} are called intestinal parasites. They can live inside humans and other animals. In their adult form, helminths cannot multiply in humans. Helminths are able to survive in their mammalian hosts for many years due {{to their ability to}} manipulate the immune response by secreting <b>immunomodulatory</b> products. Helminth ova (or eggs) have a strong shell that protects the eggs against a range of environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Fungal <b>immunomodulatory</b> {{proteins}} (FIPs) are bioactive ingredients within genera Ganoderma {{that have}} immune building properties. FIPs stimulate different cells and cellular components that enable immune response. Some of the molecules and cells that FIPs influence include T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and regulation of human monocyte DCs. Improved function of these cells will promote cytokine expression such as IL2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma which will support lymphocyte proliferation, immune cell initiation, and tumor inhibiting factors. Immunostimulation from FIPs could cause increased expression of costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) which help {{to create a}} pathway for immune response to take place.|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of the antiangiogenic and <b>immunomodulatory</b> activities of thalidomide {{has led to the}} study and creation of thalidomide analogs. Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects— except for greater myelosuppression. In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA approved. Additionally, apremilast was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These thalidomide analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Mehra, whose {{research}} has covered {{various aspects of}} histocompatibility and immunogenetics, started {{his work on the}} subjects during his post-doctoral days in Europe, and at John Hansen's laboratory in Seattle, where he used DNA-based technologies of HLA analysis to study the immunogenetic aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. Later, in India, he studied HLA-linked genes and identified that a subtype of HLA-DR2 carried on a unique class II haplotype made humans susceptible to diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis. He also differentiated the Indian rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients from the Western Caucasian patients by demonstrating that the former showed a pattern of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ association and these studies helped in characterizing the Indian population with regard to its genomic diversity. His group demonstrated that HLA genes with specific pockets in the peptide binding region controlled the severity of mycobacterial diseases, which was a first-time discovery. Together with Ajay Kumar Baranwal of AIIMS Delhi and Brian D. Tait of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he carried out a research project, Antibody Repertoire and graft outcome following solid organ transplantation, which assisted in the prediction of graft rejection and had significance in organ and bone marrow transplantation. He also guided a team of scientists in a project based on polymorphic <b>immunomodulatory</b> genes for developing molecular medicine to combat infectious, autoimmune and rheumatological diseases. His {{research has}} been documented by way of several articles; ResearchGate an online repository of scientific articles has listed 287 of them. Besides, he has published a book, The HLA Complex in Biology and Medicine: A Resource Book, and has contributed chapters to books published by other researchers, including Textbook of Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Allied and Molecular Medicine. His researches have been cited by many authors, too.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 review {{found the}} data {{too weak to}} support use of Chinese herbal {{medicine}} (CHM) for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A 2013 review found the research on the benefit and safety of CHM for idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is of poor quality and cannot be relied upon to support their use. A 2013 Cochrane review found inconclusive evidence that CHM reduces the severity of eczema. The traditional medicine ginger, which has shown anti-inflammatory properties in laboratory experiments, {{has been used to}} treat rheumatism, headache and digestive and respiratory issues, though there is no firm evidence supporting these uses. A 2012 Cochrane review found no difference in decreased mortality when Chinese herbs were used alongside Western medicine versus Western medicine exclusively. A 2012 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of TCM for people with adhesive small bowel obstruction. A 2011 review found low quality evidence that suggests CHM improves the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome. A 2010 review found TCM seems to be effective for the treatment of fibromyalgia but the findings were of insufficient methodological rigor. A 2009 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of TCM for the treatment of epilepsy. A 2008 Cochrane review found promising evidence for the use of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving painful menstruation, but the trials assessed were of such low methodological quality that no conclusion could be drawn about the remedies' suitability as a recommendable treatment option. Turmeric has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various conditions. This includes jaundice and hepatic disorders, rheumatism, anorexia, diabetic wounds, and menstrual complications. Most of its effects have been attributed to curcumin. Research that curcumin shows strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have instigated mechanism of action studies on the possibility for cancer and inflammatory diseases prevention and treatment. It also exhibits <b>immunomodulatory</b> effects. A 2005 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for the use of CHM in HIV-infected people and people with AIDS. A 2010 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of Traditional Chinese Herbal Products (THCP) in the treatment of angina. A 2010 Cochrane review found no evidence supporting the use of TCHM for stopping bleeding from haemorrhoids. There was some weak evidence of pain relief.|$|E
500|$|Mushroom polysaccharides from {{a number}} of species have {{attracted}} research interest for their <b>immunomodulatory</b> and antitumor properties. Extracts from A.hygrometricus containing the polysaccharide named AE2 were found to inhibit the growth of several tumor cell lines in laboratory tests, [...] and stimulated the growth of splenocytes, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells from mice. The extract also stimulated mouse cells associated with the immune system; specifically, it enhanced the activity of mouse natural killer cells, stimulated macrophages to produce nitric oxide, and enhanced production of cytokines. The activation of macrophages by AE2 might be mediated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway of signal transduction. AE2 is made of the simple sugars mannose, glucose, and fucose in a 1:2:1 ratio.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles. [...] Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials. [...] Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have <b>immunomodulatory</b> effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. [...] While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{studies have}} {{examined}} the potential health effects of β-glucan. Oat fiber β-glucan at intake levels of at least 3 g per day can decrease the levels of saturated fats in the blood and may reduce the risk of heart disease. Some studies have suggested that cereal-derived β-glucan may also have <b>immunomodulatory</b> properties. Yeast- and medicinal mushroom-derived β-glucans have been investigated for their ability to modulate the immune system. [...] β-glucans are further used in various nutraceutical and cosmetic products, as texturing agents, and as soluble fiber supplements, but can be problematic in the process of brewing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to killing bacteria directly {{they have been}} demonstrated to {{have a number of}} <b>immunomodulatory</b> functions that may be involved in the clearance of infection, including the ability to alter host gene expression, act as chemokines and/or induce chemokine production, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting wound healing, and modulating the responses of dendritic cells and cells of the adaptive immune response. Animal models indicate that host defence peptides are crucial for both prevention and clearance of infection. It appears as though many peptides initially isolated as and termed [...] "antimicrobial peptides" [...] have been shown to have more significant alternative functions in vivo (e.g. hepcidin).|$|E
2500|$|Treatments for {{autoimmune}} disease {{have traditionally been}} immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, or palliative. Managing inflammation is critical in {{autoimmune disease}}s. Non-immunological therapies, such as hormone replacement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat outcomes of the autoaggressive response, thus these are palliative treatments. [...] Dietary manipulation limits the severity of celiac disease. [...] Steroidal or NSAID treatment limits inflammatory symptoms of many diseases. IVIG is used for CIDP and GBS. Specific <b>immunomodulatory</b> therapies, such as the TNFα antagonists (e.g. etanercept), the B cell depleting agent rituximab, the anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab and the costimulation blocker abatacept {{have been shown to}} be useful in treating RA. [...] Some of these immunotherapies may be associated with increased risk of adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection.|$|E
