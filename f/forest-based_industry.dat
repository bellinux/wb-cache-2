Using institutional organisation theory as a background this paper analyses corporate responsibility reporting in the world's ten largest pulp and paper companies, representing 25 % of global production capacity. The studied companies have their headquarters in Japan, the Nordic countries or North America, and have very different geographical and cultural bases and variable company product portfolios ranging from wood-based products and printing papers to packaging boards and consumer goods. Both quantitative and qualitative economic, environmental and social metrics from the annual and social responsibility reports of the companies were analysed regarding institutionalised, culture-specific and company-specific characteristics. The results showed that regulated financial and environmental reporting leaves little flexibility for company-specific diversification in reporting. Only a few regional characteristics were identified, mainly in social responsibility reporting, while the reporting largely reflected a general North American-Nordic type of corporate responsibility and the globalisation trend of the studied companies. Regardless of the many challenges in the assessment of corporate responsibility, the concepts discussed in this paper are potentially useful tools for helping to achieve sustainable development in the pulp and paper industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Sudan is {{endowed with}} a great {{diversity}} of tree species, nevertheless the use of wood resources has traditionally concentrated on a few number of them, Despite the richness of Sudan in most basic factors required to establish forest-based industries, it still almost entirely depends on imports to satisfy its needs of the products of such industries like pulp, paper, fiberboard,…etc. The present study was carried out to investigate some wood properties of Balanites aegyptiaca and to assess its suitability for pulp, paper and flooring industries. The wood materials were collected from the Blue Nile, North Kordofan, South Kordofan and White Nile states. Some anatomical, physical and mechanical properties were investigated, and their results {{were used to determine}} the suitability of the selected tree species for pulp, paper and flooring industries.

40|$|Forest {{industry}} {{has traditionally been}} one of the main drivers of the Finnish economy but its output has been mostly low-value, high-volume products, such as paper and board. The global decrease in paper demand, growing interest in renewable materials to replace fossil-based materials and the increased understanding of wood biomass chemistry have spurred totally new aspirations to utilize cellulose, the main component of plants and the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. This research is written as part of the project Design Driven Value Chains in the World of Cellulose (DWoC), a strategic initiative aiming to make Finland the birthplace of branded, value-added cellulose products and new business concepts built on them. The project is conducted as collaboration of several institutions and funded on large part by The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes). One of the core goals of DWoC is the development, piloting and fostering of appropriate business models and emerging business ecosystem. However, most of the novel utilization areas of cellulose are still quite far from commercialization. Research applies the theory of business ecosystem to examine the possibilities to take novel, value-added, design-driven application areas of cellulose to markets. Business ecosystem is a concept developed in 1990 s to describe the interconnectedness of companies and the resulting dynamics. In the core of the concept is co-evolution, which occurs between companies in business ecosystem in a same way as between organisms in natural ecosystem. Business ecosystem has been used extensively to describe the dynamics of IT industry. This research brings the ecosystem discourse to <b>forest-based</b> <b>industry.</b> Also many other ecosystem concepts have been developed in literature, such as innovation ecosystem, industrial ecosystem and entrepreneurship ecosystem. All these, along with the closely related concept cluster are discussed in the literature review part. Properties, structure and lifecycle of business ecosystem are discussed, as well as the managerial challenges of being a part of business ecosystem. Research was conducted as an exploratory case study. Data collection methods used were in-depth, semi-structured interviews of five professional persons. All these persons had a long background of working with forest-based products and novel utilization areas of cellulose in different roles, either in industry or academic research. Interviews provided rich insight on what would be the outlook of the prospective business ecosystem, in which new applications of cellulose are effectively transferred from research to markets. First, the business ecosystem is an emergent structure by nature and cannot be born with purposeful construction. Second, the prospective business ecosystem would consist mostly of already existing actors, reinforced with some totally new actors. Third, there are many obstacles for the emergence of the ecosystem, such as the risk-aversiveness of traditional forest corporations and lack of scalable business models. Fourth, diffusion of innovation-related information among actors should be couraged in order to enhance the technology transfer...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} local impacts of large investments. This problem has been approached from three directions and, therefore, the study consists of three themes, namely: the changing spatial patterns of corporate activities, the short-term local economic impacts of invest­ments, and the long-term socio-economic impacts of investments on the local municipality. In order to put the impact studies of investments into a broader context the first theme provides {{an analysis of the}} macro-orientated processes that change the spatial pattern of a forest- based industry. The empirical investigation is based on a case-study of a major Swedish forest company (SCA — Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget), analysing its development from the 1950 s to the present (Paper I). The locational changes of production plants, sales units and headquarters have been mapped and, parallel to this study of the company's spatial evolution, the underlying corporate strategies are discussed. The second theme focuses on the short-term local economic impacts of investments which are carried out at production units. The empirical data has been collected from a major investment introducing a new technology (Light Weight Coated paper - LWC) at Ortviken, an SCA-owned paper mill in Sundsvall. The point of departure for the analysis is the identification of contracted suppliers and their location in order to obtain a picture of the investment's diffusion in the local economy. As the choice of supplier {{is an important part of}} the study, criteria on how suppliers are chosen have also been examined (Paper II). Moreover, by using results from a number of similar investment studies, an attempt is made to summarize general experiences within a tentative model for estimating the share of local purchase deriving from major investments: the Local or Non-Local (LNL) model (Paper III). The third theme of the thesis pinpoints long-term local impacts of large investments. The investment generates impacts not only concurrently with the implementation phase, but also during the operation period of the invested item. The investigation of long-term socio-economic impacts has been performed by two studies employing different methodological approaches. The first study (Paper IV) deals with ex ante local impacts of locating a nuclear waste repository in Storuman or Mala, two sparsely populated municipalities in northern Sweden. The model is a traditional macro- formulated cohort model which is combined with a 'basic/non-basic' assumption regarding the intcrdependency within the local trade and business. The second study (Paper V) refers once again to the <b>forest-based</b> <b>industry</b> by emphasising the long-term socio-economic impacts of the investment examined in Paper II. This paper employs a micro-analytical modelling approach, so that, the municipal population is represented individually within the model. A microsimulation model is elaborated in order to analyse the long-term (15 years) local population and labour market dynamics induced by the LWC-investment. Some major findings of the thesis are: * The share of local purchase is connected to the composition of the investment. Analyses have shown that the higher the technological demand and the more technically advanced the goods and services related to the investment, the smaller is the local share of the purchase. *  It has proved possible to trace chain effects on different local labour-markets induced by changes in production at a particular place of work. Through linkages between the partial labour markets the closure of a major place of work will not only affect the occupational groups to which laid-off employees belong, but also give rise to changes in unemployment levels in many other occupations. digitalisering@um...|$|E

The total return from processing wood depends on future prices of final products, which are unknown. Selling prices of final products are related to stochastic price indices for solid wood products and paper products. Risk can be reduced by diversifying among genotype alternatives; in a case study {{the value of a}} portfolio of genotype alternatives is significantly larger than the single 'best' genotype alternative.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{development of}} a Canadian forest-based bioeconomy requires an assessment of both fiber availability and associated marginal supply costs. To a large extent, the bioeconomy is expected to rely on wood fiber made available through primary products, sawnwood, and pulp production processing streams. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the regional wood fiber flows and mill residue availability through various processing streams. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit Forest Fiber Cascade Model (FCM) to estimate regional fiber flows and availability of untapped residue surplus. The FCM was calibrated to 2013 production levels, and we evaluated the wood fiber cascade through existing forest industry in Canada. The results show that, under current conditions, there is limited availability of surplus mill residues in Canada, especially in the Eastern provinces. It is therefore critical to consider the impacts on regional fiber flows and feedstock availability to the secondary industries when designing feedstock supply strategies and policies for the emerging <b>forest-based</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R
30|$|As <b>forest-based</b> <b>industries</b> play a {{vital role}} in the Swedish economy, we focused on two woody raw materials: birch and spruce. Birch is a {{hardwood}} (angiosperm), widespread in the Northern Hemisphere. The lignin content varies between 18 and 25 %, and consists of guaiacyl–syringyl units formed by the co-polymerization of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. Spruce, a softwood (gymnosperm), has a lignin content of more than 25 %, and consists of guaiacyl units with a smaller proportion of unmethoxylated p-hydroxyphenyl units (Campbell and Sederoff 1996). It is well documented that OS pretreatment reduces the crystallinity of cellulose and enriches the cellulose fraction in the biomass through efficient delignification (Zhang et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009; Ju et al. 2014). High methane titers have been obtained by anaerobic digestion of OS-pretreated biomass (Matsakas et al. 2017). The superior quality of OS lignin, i.e. lower molecular weight and increased phenolic OH content (Nitsos et al. 2016), offers valorization through the production of biochemicals or as green phenol substitutes (Benar et al. 1999; Ruiz-Dueñas and Martínez 2009).|$|R
