5|$|From {{the early}} medieval period, New Sleaford {{was in the}} Flaxwell Wapentake and Old Sleaford in the Ashwardhurn Wapentake. Sleaford Poor Law Union, overseen by a Board of Guardians, was {{established}} in 1836. A Local Board of <b>Health</b> <b>was</b> formed in 1851. Public <b>health</b> <b>was</b> reorganised by the Public Health Act 1872, which established Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts (USD or RSD); Sleaford USD covered New and Old Sleaford, Holdingham and Quarrington, while the Sleaford RSD included all other parishes in the Poor Law Union. The Local Government Act 1894 converted the Board of Health and USD into the Sleaford Urban District Council and, in 1899, the town became the administrative base of Kesteven County Council. A rural district formed in 1894 was abolished in 1931. In 1973, Sleaford Urban District merged with the North and East Kesteven districts to form North Kesteven, a district of Lincolnshire; by statutory instrument, Sleaford civil parish became the urban district's successor, thus merging Quarrington, New Sleaford, Old Sleaford and Holdingham civil parishes.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} <b>health</b> <b>was</b> {{a constant}} source of worry to his mother.

The English Parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E
