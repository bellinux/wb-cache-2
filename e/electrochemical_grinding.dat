50|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> {{also has}} a few {{disadvantages}} as well. The system consists of the anode workpiece and the cathode grinding wheel. In order to create those conditions both the workpiece and the grinding wheel must be conductive. This limits the types of workpiece materials that are suitable for <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding.</b> Another disadvantage of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is that it is}} only applicable to surface grinding. It is not possible to apply <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> to workpieces that have cavities, due to the grinding wheels inability to remove the film deposit with in the cavity. One other disadvantage is the electrolytic fluid can cause corrosion at the workpiece and grinding wheel surfaces. Lastly, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> is more complicated than traditional machining methods. This will require more experienced personnel to operate the machinery, which will lead to higher production cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> is {{a process}} that removes {{electrically}} conductive material by grinding with a negatively charged abrasive grinding wheel, an electrolyte fluid, and a positively charged workpiece. Materials removed from the workpiece stay in the electrolyte fluid. <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> is similar to electrochemical machining but uses a wheel instead of a tool shaped like the contour of the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{advantages}} of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> is the minimal wear that the grinding wheel tool experiences. This is {{because the majority of}} the material is removed by the electrochemical reaction that occurs between the cathode and anode. The only time that abrasive grinding actually occurs is in removing the film that develops {{on the surface of the}} workpiece. Another advantage of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> is that it can be used to machine hard materials. Hard materials pose a difficulty to other types of machining due to the tool wear that is associated with machining hard materials. It may come as a bit of a surprise that <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> can remove material from a hard surface and experience minimal wear. Because most material is removed through electrochemical reactions, the workpiece does not experience heat damage like it would in a conventional grinding process.|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of pyrite by copper and lead ions {{is an important}} issue for the selective flotation of base metal sulfide minerals. In this study, the effect of electrochemical potential manipulated by reducing and oxidizing agents during grinding on the {{activation of}} pyrite by copper and lead ions was studied. Zeta potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction as well as copper and lead solution speciation simulations were used to correlate pyrite flotation with the surface properties of copper and lead-activated pyrite. The <b>electrochemical</b> potential during <b>grinding</b> had a significant effect on the activation of pyrite by copper ions, but little effect on the activation of pyrite by lead ions. This phenomenon is explained by different activation mechanisms. The pyrite activation by copper ions is considered to be an electrochemical process involving the formation of new Cu+-sulfide species. The greater concentration of Cu+ species in the solution and the greater proportion of sulfide on the pyrite surface at the more reducing grinding condition favor the copper activation process. In contrast, pyrite activation by lead ions is not dependent on the electrochemical potential and this parameter does not affect the concentration of lead species adsorbed onto the pyrite surface regardless of surface pre-oxidation. Thus, these conclusions provide a guide as to how to control pyrite activation through the manipulation of <b>electrochemical</b> potential during <b>grinding...</b>|$|R

A new finish method uses an {{effective}} electrode connecting with a nonconductive grinding tool {{to execute the}} design of compound processes of <b>electrochemical</b> finishing and <b>grinding</b> following turning is investigated. The submitted processes {{can be used for}} various turning operations. Through simple equipment attachment, <b>electrochemical</b> finishing and <b>grinding</b> can follow to execute the finishing process on the same machine. Among the factors affecting electrochemical finishing the performance of <b>grinding</b> combined with <b>electrochemical</b> finishing is primarily discussed. In the experiment, the electrode is used with continuous and pulsed direct current. The grinding tool moves following the electrode and grinds the workpiece surface. The experimental parameters are electrical current rating, feed rate of electrode and grinding tool, rotational speed of workpiecel, pulsed period, and geometry of finish-tool. The results show that pulsed direct current with longer off-time can slightly improve the finish effect for its dregs discharge mobility. Using an adequate rotational speed of workpiece with high rotational speed is advantageous to the finish effect. A thinner plate-form electrode with a smaller end radius is associated with larger discharge space and produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better finish effect.

Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} predict the finishing results and select the processing parameters in ECABG. In this paper, Back-Propagation (BP) neural network is proposed to solve this problem. The non-linear relationship of machining parameters was established based on the experimental data by applying one-hidden layer BP neural networks. The comparison between the calculated results of the BP neural network and experimental results under the corresponding conditions was carried out, and the results indicates that it is feasible to apply BP neural network in determining the processing parameters and forecasting the surface quality effects in ECABG...|$|R

This paper {{researches}} on {{the theory}} of the crown modification of cylinder-roller bearing raceway using <b>electrochemical</b> abrasive belt <b>grinding</b> (ECABG) technology, and establishes relevant experimental device. The range of processing parameters with a better surface roughness can be obtained through experiments.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate <b>electrochemical</b> properties of <b>grinding</b> environment of the Sarcheshmeh porphyry copper sulphide ore. Influence of pH, solid content, water type, aeration condition and type of steel ball on pulp Eh, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), open circuit potential (OCP) and EDTA extractable iron percentage and subsequently their influence on copper flotation were investigated. The results indicated that the low alloy steel balls had the lower Eh and DO values in relation to the high carbon chromium steel balls. The low alloy steel produces oxidized iron inside mill and reduces copper flotation. Gas changes from nitrogen to air and to oxygen resulted in higher Eh, DO and OCP values and consequently were caused formation of additional amount of oxidized iron species and lowered copper recovery. In addition, an increase in grinding pH and solid content and change of water type from tap water to distilled water decreased Eh and DO values and amount of EDTA extractable iron.

50|$|Some of {{the main}} factors which govern the {{performance}} of an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> process include current supplied, rotation speed of the grinding wheel, the workpiece feed rate, the type of electrolyte used, electrolyte feed rate, and the workpiece's chemical properties. By changing these parameters, one can alter the material removal rate. Increasing the supplied current, rotation speed of the wheel, electrolyte feed rate, or the workpiece feed rate will {{lead to an increase}} in material removal rate (MRR), while decreasing these properties will do the opposite. If the workpiece is more reactive to the electrolyte used, then the material removal rate will increase. The grinding wheel is usually rotated with a surface speed of 1200-2000 m/min and supplied currents are around 1000A.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>grinding</b> process {{combines}} traditional {{electrochemical machining}} and grinding processes to remove material from a workpiece. A grinding wheel {{is used as}} a cutting tool as a cathode and the workpiece is an anode. During the process, electrolytic fluid, typically sodium nitrate, is pumped into the space between the workpiece and the grinding wheel. Other electrolytes used include sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium chlorate. This electrolytic fluid will cause electrochemical reactions to occur at the workpiece surface which oxidize the surface, thereby removing material. As a consequence of the oxidation which occurs, layers of oxide films will form on the workpiece surface, and these need to be removed by the grinding wheel. A couple schematics of the process are provided below.Abrasive materials, either diamond or aluminum oxide, are bonded to the grinding wheel which allows the wheel to remove the oxide layers on the workpiece surface by abrasive action. Appropriate materials used for electrolyte fluid and the grinding wheel abrasives are summarized in the table below.Most material removal is by the electrochemical reactions which occur at the workpiece surface. Five percent or less of the material removal is carried out by the abrasive action of the grinding wheel. The fact that most material is not removed by abrasive action helps increase the life of the grinding wheel, that is, the tool {{will take a long time}} to wear down. The electrolytic fluid serves another useful purpose - it flushes out leftover material in between the grinding wheel and work piece.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} reduction of hematite with various particle sizes by metallic lithium {{has been studied}} by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) Mössbauer and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Previous in situ XRD analysis coupled with electrochemical data showed that lithium can be inserted in the nanosized sample up to 1 Li per Fe 2 O 3 whereas bulk material undergoes an irreversible Li-driven transformation from an hexagonal anionic packing to a close cubic packed framework as soon as 0. 03 Li is inserted in the corundum structure. The present data show that only 0. 6 Li per formula unit are actually inserted {{in the structure of}} small particles. The remaining lithium (0. 4) is engaged in irreversible reduction of surface groups, or capacitive behavior. Beyond the solid solution domains, both samples are multiphase, and consist of Li 2 Fe 2 O 3, Fe 0 clusters (10 - 15 Å) and inserted α-Fe 2 O 3, which proportions are used to calculate the mean iron oxidation state in the electrode as the reaction proceeds. From these data, we found that electrolyte decomposition can occur at very different steps of the reduction depending on the texture of the active materials.
