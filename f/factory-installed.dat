25|$|In 2006 {{the first}} series-production low beam, front {{position}} light and sidemarker function LED headlamps were <b>factory-installed</b> on the Lexus LS 600h / LS 600h L presented in 2007 for 2008 models. The high beam and turn signal functions use filament bulbs. The headlamp is supplied by Koito.|$|E
25|$|The D series {{continued}} {{to be successful in}} the 1960s. The <b>factory-installed</b> turbocharger on the D19 was the first in the industry. It was soon followed by the 190 and the 190 XT, which was a direct competitor for the John Deere Model 4020 with 98 horsepower (factory rating).|$|E
25|$|The 1970 VAM Javelins {{received}} a new front suspension design with dual control arms and ball joints. Units with four-speed manual transmissions incorporated a Hurst linkage as <b>factory-installed</b> equipment, which was previously available {{only with the}} optional Go Pack package and separately in certain dealerships. A mid-year change replaced the imported Borg-Warner T10 manual transmission {{in favor of the}} Querétaro-produced TREMEC 170-F four-speed model to comply with the percentages of both local and imported equipment mandated by law.|$|E
25|$|Haggard {{endorsed}} Fender {{guitars and}} had a Custom Artist signature model Telecaster. The guitar is a modified Telecaster Thinline with laminated top of figured maple, set neck with deep carved heel, birdseye maple fingerboard with 22 jumbo frets, ivoroid pickguard and binding, gold hardware, abalone Tuff Dog Tele peghead inlay, 2-Colour Sunburst finish, {{and a pair of}} Fender Texas Special Tele single-coil pickups with custom-wired 4-way pickup switching. He also played six-string acoustic models. In 2001, C. F. Martin & Company introduced a limited edition Merle Haggard Signature Edition 000-28SMH acoustic guitar available with or without <b>factory-installed</b> electronics.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common <b>factory-installed</b> locking {{differentials}} use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit {{to join the}} shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|E
25|$|The B.VII {{appeared}} in August 1915 and finally provided a machine suitable for service use. These {{were used to}} conduct long-range reconnaissance missions over the Italian Front, as well as occasional bombing raids, carrying 80kg (180lb) of bombs internally. Many B.VIIs in operational service were equipped with machine guns on flexible mounts for the observer, and {{this led to the}} armed C.I version being produced at both the Lohner and Ufag factories. Aside from its <b>factory-installed</b> armament, the C.I also sported a streamlined cowling around the engine, whereas the B-types had their cylinders exposed to the airstream. Notable missions carried out by these aircraft included the raid on the Porta Volta power station in Milan on 14 February 1916 (a 378km/276mi round trip for 12 B.VIIs) and Julius Arigi sinking an Italian steamer at Valona in a B.VII in 1916.|$|E
25|$|Sequential turn {{signals are}} a feature on some cars wherein the turn-signal {{function}} {{is provided by}} multiple lit elements that illuminate sequentially rather than simultaneously: the innermost lamp lights and remains illuminated, the next outermost lamp lights and remains illuminated, followed by the next outermost lamp and so on until the outermost lamp lights briefly, at which point all lamps extinguish together and, after a short pause, the cycle begins again. The visual effect is one of outward motion {{in the direction of}} the intended turn or lane change. Sequential turn signals have been <b>factory-installed</b> only on cars with red combination stop/turn lamps. They were factory fitted to 1965– through 1971-model Ford Thunderbirds, to 1967–1973 Mercury Cougars, to Shelby Mustangs between 1967 and 1970, to 1969 Imperials, to the Japanese-market 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, and to Ford Mustangs since 2010.|$|E
25|$|Applications for car stereos varied widely. Auto {{manufacturers}} in the U.S. typically would fit a cassette slot into their standard large radio faceplates. Europe and Asia would standardize on DIN and double DIN sized faceplates. In the 1980s, a high-end installation {{would have a}} Dolby AM/FM cassette deck, and they rendered the 8-track cartridge obsolete in car installations because of space, performance, and audio quality. In the 1990s and 2000s, {{as the cost of}} building CD players declined, many manufacturers offered a CD player. The CD player eventually supplanted the cassette deck as standard equipment, but some cars, especially those targeted at older drivers, were offered with the option of a cassette player, either by itself or sometimes in combination with a CD slot. Most new cars can still accommodate aftermarket cassette players, and the auxiliary jack advertised for MP3 players can be used also with portable cassette players, but 2011 was the first model year for which no manufacturer offered <b>factory-installed</b> cassette players.|$|E
25|$|Smith's first Macintosh {{board was}} built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64kilobytes (kB) of RAM, used the 8-bit Motorola 6809E microprocessor, and was capable of {{supporting}} a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display. Bud Tribble, {{a member of the}} Mac team, was interested in running the Apple Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's Motorola 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from the Lisa's 5MHz to 8MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete QuickDraw picture language and interpreter in 64KB of ROM– far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8KB of ROM; it had 128kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-kilobit (kb) RAM chips soldered to the logicboard. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512kB by means of soldering sixteen IC sockets to accept 256kb RAM chips in place of the <b>factory-installed</b> chips. The final product's screen was a , 512x342 pixel monochrome display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.|$|E
500|$|Having {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} {{that this was a}} search under the Fourth Amendment, the Court declined to examine whether any exception exists that would render the search [...] "reasonable", because the Government had failed to advance that alternate theory in the lower courts. [...] Also left unanswered was the broader question surrounding the privacy implications of a warrantless use of GPS data absent a physical intrusion – as might occur, for example, with the electronic collection of GPS data from wireless service providers or <b>factory-installed</b> vehicle tracking and navigation services. [...] The Court left this to be decided in some future case, saying, [...] "It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question." ...|$|E

The Concorde also earned additional suspension changes {{designed to provide}} a quieter, smoother ride. Tires grew to 16 inches for the LX, to match those of the LXi. The LXi edition gained standard speed-sensitive, variable-assist steering, as well as an optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer.|$|E
2500|$|All buses {{are also}} all {{equipped}} with a Digital Recorders automated voice annunciator system, which announces the major intersections (or on the Rapid Ride buses, the stops). [...] The system was first introduced in 2001 on the 400 series buses.

2500|$|In September 1998, the Astra was {{replaced}} {{again with a}} German Opel-engineered, Belgium-built version. Known as the TS Astra, it was equipped with either a [...] 1.8- or a 2.2-litre petrol engine and was offered in City, CD, CDXi, SXi and SRi specifications. The SRi was three-door hatchback only, and the standard Astra was only available with a 1.8-litre 16-valve engine. Models with a 5-stud wheel pattern have the ABS option <b>factory-installed.</b> The Astra CD gained 15-inch alloy wheels as standard equipment in circa 1999, replacing the steel wheels with hubcaps previously standard.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft's {{structure}} is mostly aluminum with a fiberglass cowling. [...] Cessna LSA Project head Neal Willford indicated in August 2006 that Cessna was investigating {{the use of}} [...] "match hole drilling" [...] to reduce costs and simplify construction of the design. [...] This technique is widely used in the kit-plane industry and in construction of larger aircraft, but would be Cessna's first use in its single-engine line. On 9 October 2007 Cessna announced that a Ballistic Recovery Systems airframe ballistic parachute system would be a <b>factory-installed</b> option on the Cessna 162.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an era of}} chrome {{and four}} headlamps, the Corvette succumbed to {{the look of the}} day. The 1958 model year and the four that {{followed}} all had the exposed four-headlamp treatment and prominent grills, but a faux-louvered hood and chrome trunk spears were unique to 1958. The interior and instruments were updated, including placing a tachometer {{directly in front of the}} driver. For the 1958 model, an 8000rpm tachometer was used with the [...] and 290 hp engines, rather than the 6000rpm units used in the lower horespower engines. Optional engine choices included two with twin carburetors (including a 270 hp model with Carter 2613S and 2614S WCFB four-barrels) and two with fuel injection. Power output for the highest rated fuel-injected engine was 290 hp. Displacement remained 283 cid. For the first time, seat belts were <b>factory-installed</b> rather than being dealer-installed as on previous models. Rare options were RPO 684 heavy-duty brakes and suspension (144), RPO 579 250hp engine (554), RPO 276 15"×5.5" [...] wheels (404).|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, Oldsmobile {{models were}} {{completely}} redesigned with a rocket motif {{from front to}} rear, as {{the top of the}} front fenders had a chrome rocket, while the body-length fins were shaped as rocket exhausts which culminated in a fin-top taillight (concave on the 98 models while convex on the 88 models). [...] The 1959 models also offered several roof treatments, such as the pillared sedan with a fastback rear window and the Holiday SportSedan, which was a flat-roofed pillarless hardtop with wraparound front and rear glass. [...] The 1959 models were marketed as [...] "the linear look", and also featured a bar-graph speedometer which showed a green indicator through , then changed to orange until , then was red above that until the highest speed read by the speedometer, [...] [...] Power windows were available on the 98 models, as was two-speed electric windshield wipers with electrically powered windshield washers.

2500|$|The G series, or [...] "Gustav", was [...] {{introduced}} in mid-1942. Its initial variants (G-1 through G-4) differed only in minor details from the Bf 109F, {{most notably in}} the more powerful 1475 PS (1,455 HP) DB 605 engine. Odd-numbered variants were built as high-altitude fighters with a pressurized cockpit and GM-1 boost, while even-numbered variants were not pressurized, air superiority fighters, and fighter-bombers. Long-range photo-reconnaissance variants also existed. The later G series (G-5 through G-14) was produced in a multitude of variants, with uprated armament and provision for kits of packaged, generally <b>factory-installed</b> parts known as Umrüst-Bausätze (usually contracted to Umbau) and adding a [...] "/U" [...] suffix to the aircraft designation when installed. Field kits known as Rüstsätze were also available for the G-series, but those did not change the aircraft designation. By early 1944, tactical requirements resulted in the addition of MW-50 water injection boost and high-performance superchargers, boosting engine output to 1,800–2,000 PS (1,775-1,973 HP). From early 1944, some G-2s, G-3s, G-4s, and G-6s were converted to two-seat trainers, known as G-12s. An instructor's cockpit was added behind the original cockpit and both were covered by an elongated, glazed canopy.|$|E
2500|$|The new styling {{did little}} to help declining sales, which were now being hit by sagging buyer {{interest}} in all muscle cars, fueled by the punitive surcharges levied by automobile insurance companies, which sometimes resulted in insurance payments higher than car payments for some drivers. Sales were down to 40,149, of which 3,797 were the Judge. Of those 3,797 Judges built, only 168 were ordered in the convertible form: RA III, RA IV and 455HO. The general consensus is that six of the 168 built were ordered with the 1970-only D-Port 455HO [...] engine, a no-cost option, which explains the conflicting production figures {{over the years as}} to how many were built; 162 vs. 168. The '69/'70 [...] "round-port" [...] RA IV engine, a derivative of the '68½ [...] "round-port" [...] RA II engine, was the most exotic high-performance engine ever offered by PMD and <b>factory-installed</b> in a GTO or Firebird. The 1969 version had a slight advantage as the compression ratio was still at 10:75:1 as opposed to 10.5:1 in 1970. It is widely speculated that PMD was losing $1,000 on every RA IV GTO and Firebird built, and the RA IV engine was highly under-rated at [...] Overall, only 37 RA IV GTO convertibles were built in 1970: 24 four-speeds and 13 automatics. Of the 13 1970 GTO RA IV/auto convertibles built only six received the Judge option. The GTO remained the third best-selling intermediate muscle car, out-sold only by the Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396/454 and Plymouth Road Runner.|$|E
