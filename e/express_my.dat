5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of him without expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} <b>express</b> <b>my</b> regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean fleet was by {{now under}} Sir Edward Pellew, and Eyre {{was sent to}} the Spanish coast to support the Spanish forces {{fighting}} the French. Eyre was particularly active off the coast of Valencia and evacuated the garrison of Oropesa del Mar, earning the thanks of General Joaquín Blake y Joyes. On being ordered back to England in 1811 Pellew also wrote a private letter of thanks, following on from his earlier declaration that 'I have to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> complete approbation of Captain Eyre's methods, and have much satisfaction of employing the services of that most excellent officer in the aid of the Valencia patriots.' Eyre arrived in England in 1812, his health having been affected by his five years on a foreign station, and requested and received permission to go ashore. As a mark of his services in the Adriatic and off Spain he was knighted by King George III. Eyre was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 4 June 1814 and was nominated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath following the expansion of the order on 12 January 1815.|$|E

25|$|Someone {{from whom}} I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot {{understand}} why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what {{seems to me to}} have meaning and be most suitable to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.|$|E
25|$|I wish to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> heartfelt {{horror at}} the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent {{people of the}} United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E

25|$|I {{would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> personal thanks and that of the American people for the services which you have performed over a period of the last six years. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization represents an endeavor on the part of fifteen free nations, the success of which is vital to the security and well-being of the United States. Thus, the position of Commander of one of the major commands of this organization {{is one of the greatest}} responsibility. The leadership and judgment which you have displayed in this capacity have been a source of deep satisfaction to me personally, and I know has won the great admiration not only of the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but of all the Free World.|$|E
25|$|Cruikshank quickly responded, on 10 April 1872, {{and claimed}} {{even more of}} Ainsworth's novels as being his own: I have to beg that you will permit me to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> regret that his memory should be in such a {{defective}} state, {{that he should have}} forgotten the circumstances and facts as to the origins of Oliver Twist, and of The Miser's Daughter; and I regret also this contradiction of his will compel me, in justice to myself, to give in a work I am preparing for the press a full, true, and particular account of all the professional transactions between Mr. Ainsworth and myself, in which I shall prove, beyond all fear of contradiction, that I am also the sole originator of what is called 'Ainsworth's Tower of London,' as well as another work bearing his name, but the ideas and suggestions of what were given to him by, Sir, your obedient servant, George Cruikshank.|$|E
500|$|I must <b>express</b> <b>my</b> {{deep and}} sincere {{gratitude}} to John Cage. The {{reason for this}} is that in my own life, in my own development, for a long period I struggled to avoid being [...] "Japanese", to avoid [...] "Japanese" [...] qualities. It was largely through my contact with John Cage that I came to recognize the value of my own tradition.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1907, 21 further flights were {{undertaken}} between 27June and 7August, including one on 22July 1907 in which the President of the Council (Prime Minister) Georges Clemenceau, and the Minister of War Georges Picquart were passengers. Although a pipe became detached, showering the Premier with hot water, he reacted nonchalantly, saying [...] "I cannot sufficiently <b>express</b> <b>my</b> admiration for this wonderful contrivance".|$|E
500|$|On 8 March 2011, People In Need awarded him the Homo Homini Award [...] "in {{recognition}} of a dedication to the promotion of human rights, democracy and non-violent solutions to political conflicts."

500|$|Chopra {{began writing}} an opinion column, [...] "The Priyanka Chopra Column", for the Hindustan Times in 2009. She wrote {{a total of}} fifty columns for the newspaper. She said after her first year of writing: [...] "I'm a private person and never thought that I could <b>express</b> <b>my</b> feelings. But strangely enough, {{whenever}} I sat down to write this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." [...] In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.|$|E
500|$|I {{had worked}} so hard at serious music, I had loved it so much and been so successful, that it was not without a pang that I gave it all up to sing little songs and choruses that were, after all, child's play to me. ...ften my heart ached when I thought of those days when I lived in an {{atmosphere}} of music of the highest order, and could <b>express</b> <b>my</b> inmost self in it. ...ometimes when I thought things over I felt how far I had fallen from that first austere ideal, and wished that fame and success could have come in a higher sphere.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the fleet}} had {{returned}} to port, controversy erupted concerning Harvey's role in the battle. Although his bravery and skill were not questioned, his prominence in the dispatch sent home by Cuthbert Collingwood was. In the dispatch, Harvey was singled out over the other captains for his bravery, Collingwood writing: [...] "I have not words in which I can sufficiently <b>express</b> <b>my</b> admiration of it". As {{a result of this}} special mention, Harvey was promoted to rear-admiral on 9 November 1805, and given the honour of being one of Nelson's pallbearers at the admiral's funeral despite their short acquaintance. Harvey's new motto and his penchant for [...] "bragging" [...] further alienated him from his fellow officers.|$|E

500|$|Burroughs {{agreed with}} the President's assertions, and urged him to comment {{publicly}} on the subject, although the other man demurred. When Roosevelt published Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter in October 1905, however, he not only dedicated it to the elder naturalist, but he also made his first public foray in what would {{become known as the}} nature fakers controversy: [...] "I wish to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> hearty appreciation of your warfare against the sham nature-writers—those whom you have called 'the yellow journalists of the woods'... You in your own person have illustrated what can be done by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a {{negative}} review for the song, criticizing Madonna's rapping and calling the song [...] "a blurry snarl {{of style and}} composition that's sounds more like a disjointed medley than a song." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was disappointed by the lyrics saying that [...] "what on earth might her extreme point of view involve? That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view {{turns out to be}} that money can't buy you happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be." [...] He also panned the lyric [...] "I like to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> extreme point of view", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a prickle of excitement.|$|E
500|$|His {{resignation}} {{was announced}} amid {{an outpouring of}} appreciation from politicians and naval comrades. Battenberg had written to Churchill on 28 October, [...] "What I shd value above all else is {{to be admitted to}} the Privy Council." [...] The King later swore Louis in as a Privy Councillor in a public show of support. Labour party politician and trade union leader J. H. Thomas wrote to The Times: [...] "I desire to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> extreme regret at the announcement that Prince Louis of Battenberg has, by his resignation, pandered to the most mean and contemptible slander I have ever known ... I was simply astounded to hear the base suggestions and rumours current, and I am afraid that his action will simply be looked upon as a triumph for the mean and miserable section of people, who, at a time of national trial, is ever ready to pass a foul lie from lip to lip without a tittle of evidence." [...] Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Hay thought that the [...] "ingeniously propagated lies" [...] originated from Germany.|$|E
