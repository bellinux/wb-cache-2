40|$|Invisible, {{ubiquitous}} or {{pervasive computing}} has made steady progress {{since it was}} first conceptualized almost two decades ago. While the original vision of pervasive computing itself was very radical and elegant, the reality as it has {{played out in the}} realm of everyday products and services is quite different. There are still multiple perspectives on what truly constitutes a pervasive computing environment, and the delineation between its various facets is one fraught with definitional and operational challenges. This brief paper presents the idea of an emerging value chain comprised of (1) <b>info-structures,</b> (2) devices, (3) interfaces, and (4) smart spaces, which together form the core elements of a pervasive information environment. We believe that a shared understanding of this framework by numerous stakeholders will accelerate the deployment of pervasive information systems in today’s service-oriented organizations, and lead to increased productivity, interactivity and customer satisfaction. What is Pervasiveness? Being pervasive means to be “diffused throughout every part of ” – a system, context, or environment. In technology, pervasiveness refers to a resource so widely available that it is almost invisible to the end user. Businesses can also be pervasive by utilizing the emerging technologies enabling them to offer ubiquitous service experience to their customers. Th...|$|R

40|$|As {{scientific}} {{achievements in}} the area of Healthcare have evolved during the last decade, inevitably there has been an increase of treatment quality. One of the challenges to be confronted is the personalization of treatment since each patient constitutes a unique case. The personalization requires the continuous reconfiguration of the treatment schemes since the clinical status of each patient and circumstances inside a healthcare organization constantly change. In this paper we present a holistic software environment that provides an IT solution concerning the real-time adaptation of healthcare processes. The software comprises a healthcare process execution engine assisted by a semantic <b>info-structure</b> for reconfiguring the pathways. The semantic <b>info-structure</b> utilizes an ontology enclosing the required knowledge and a semantic rule-set. During the execution of clinical pathways, the system reasons over the rules, the knowledge and information, and reconfigures the next steps of the treatment. The results of the rule-set execution may generate knowledge objects to be inserted in the ontology.

40|$|In the {{exchange}} {{between theory and}} practice, art is appropriated as a creative mode of enquiry, a differential form of knowledge and experience in the processes of rationalization. As a differential in knowledge, art is explored as the practice of composition making differences out of established rationales - the discrete disciplines that find stability in economic, pedagogic and scientific discourse. As a differential in experience, art may contain the potential to destabilize social, historical and political constitutions of sense, working as an interference pattern in the production and reproduction of rational subjects. The academic distillation of the artist's know how into the 'art of subjectivity', draws both the subjects and objects of knowledge into this critical space of composition, a dynamic space of contestation in which the artist acquires the capacity to become an agent of cultural change. As a cultural and critical formation, the 'art of subjectivity' reactivates the art historical tradition of institutional critique. Re-evaluated through the critical and philosophical components of the doctoral research, the material rendition of institutional critique is configured {{as a series of}} artistic engagements with the procedural and regulatory codes of practice that comprise the <b>info-structure</b> of instrumental reason. Through a gradual synthesis of process and product, the 'art of subjectivity' begins to merge with the arts (techniques) of rationalization, drawing upon rather than resisting the bureaucratic, informational, scientific-technical and semiotic energies of political economy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The government’s {{aspirations}} of making Malaysia a leading international educational centre in the Asian Region {{has put a}} strong pressure on local universities {{to improve the quality}} of education they offer. One of the major steps that has been identified by the government to achieve this goal is to enhance the performance of local universities through the application and implementation of an excellent knowledge management (KM) system. An effective KM system requires every academician to practice appropriate management of knowledge in his or her teaching and learning activities, which includes, generating, acquiring, storing and disseminating knowledge effectively to users of knowledge, especially students. A study by the Centre for Academic Development (CADe) of Universiti Putra Malaysia in 2005 found that the level of knowledge management practices in Malaysian universities was merely moderate; and to meet the national aspirations, KM practices need to be developed further from various aspects of structure, facilities and culture among the academic players. The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of practice among the academicians and to determine factors contributing to the effectiveness of knowledge management practices at individual, faculty and university level. Eight local universities, both public and private participated in the study. Factor Analysis was used to determine factors affecting the practices of knowledge management while Multiple Regression Analysis was used to analyse and determine the importance of various variables that will add value, thus improve the performance of Malaysian universities.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine the factors influencing in-trip tourists’ adoption of information and communications technology (ICT) tools/applications which support sustainable tourism. While ICT is a source of competitive advantage for businesses, there is limited research on how ICT can be used to support sustainable tourism development. At the same time, there has been greater consumer awareness about sustainable tourism but a challenge in translating this knowledge into action. This thesis therefore sought to explore and integrate these complementary elements. The study adopted a sequential mixed methods approach. Phase 1 employed an e-survey among sixty-six (66) eTourism experts, while Phase 2 of the study involved thirty (30) semi-structured face-to-face interviews with leisure tourists in the city of Edinburgh. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to analyse Phase 1 and thematic analysis for Phase 2. The findings from the survey demonstrated that location based services were identified amongst the main ICT applications to support sustainable tourism. Geo-caching, ambient intelligence and context aware applications were among the new or emerging applications that eTourism experts felt were likely to change the way tourists experience a destination in the future. The interviews demonstrated that social connectedness motivated the use of in-trip ICT with social media being the primary platform. Mobile value elements, personal innovativeness and perceived enjoyment were postulated as influencing use behaviour. The results also illustrated the need for destinations to mix new media with some traditional strategies based on the destination’s <b>info-structure,</b> tourists’ source markets, tourists’ profiles and sources of in-trip information. This thesis has made an original contribution to knowledge by examining the actual use of in-trip ICTs by tourists in relation to sustainable tourism.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} based economic transformation strategy in Malaysia {{is part of}} its broader economy competitiveness strategy developed to achieve the goals set for Vision 2020. However, Malaysia is facing hurdles in knowledge economy transformation such as weak education and training system, institutional support, and <b>info-structure,</b> deficient research and development capacity, unstable science and technology base, unskilled workers, and lack of techno-entrepreneurs. To discover the {{knowledge based}} transformation solution for these problems, a framework has been developed to check the impact of performance determinant variables on economic competitiveness of Malaysia using Quadruple Helix (university, industry, government and public/civil society) research collaboration as mediators. A quantitative, descriptive research design was used in which twenty nine economic performance determinant variables were tested for mediation with university, industry, government and public. Two hundred and eighty two questionnaires were distributed using the convenience sampling method to collect the data. The study validated the Quadruple Helix mediation impact using regression analysis. Mediation was further validated using the Sobel Test. The study confirmed that the performance determinant variables have a strong and positive role in determining economy competitiveness. The results also confirmed that a strong Quadruple Helix mediation is necessary; however, there exists a “weak link” between the key stakeholders in the economy of Malaysia. The results established that the university and government are comparatively strong contributors whilst civil society’s contribution is moderate and the industry is the weakest link in the competitiveness of an economy. It is therefore, concluded that a successful knowledge based transformation depends upon the collaborations between university, industry, government and civil society sector. It is recommended that a strong Quadruple Helix innovation based collaboration should be the focus and the tool for knowledge based economic transformation to strengthen the economic performance and competitiveness of Malaysia...|$|E

The research work within this Thesis aims to contribute to improve employees' selfawareness and auto-regulation; two predominant research areas are also studied and analyzed: Visual Analytics and Gamification. The Visual Analytics enables the specification of personalized dashboard interfaces with alerts and indicators to keep employees aware of their skills and to continuously monitor how to improve their expertise, promoting simultaneously behavioral change and adoption of good-practices. The study of Gamification techniques with Talent Management features enabled the design of new processes to engage, motivate, and retain highly productive employees, and to foster a competitive working environment, where employees are encouraged to be involved in new and rewarding activities, where knowledge and experience are recognized as a relevant asset. The Design Science Research was selected as the research methodology; the creation of new knowledge is therefore based on an iterative cycle addressing concepts such as design, analysis, reflection, and abstraction. By collaborating in an international project (Active@Work), funded by the Active and Assisted Living Programme, the results followed a design thinking approach regarding the specification of the structure and behavior of the Skills Development Module, namely the identification of requirements and the design of an innovative <b>info-structure</b> of metadata to support the user experience. A set of mockups were designed based on the user role and main concerns.
