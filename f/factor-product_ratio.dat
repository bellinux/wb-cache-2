40|$|ABSTRACT: Water and {{fertilizer}} among the production factors are {{the elements that}} most restrict the production of cashew. The precise amount of these factors {{is essential to the}} success of the crop yield. This research aimed to determine the best <b>factor-product</b> <b>ratio</b> and analyze technical and economic indicators, of productivity of the cashew clone BRS 189 (Anacardium occidentale) to production factors water and potassium. The experiment was conducted from May 2009 to December 2009 in an experimental area of 56. 0 m x 112. 0 m in the irrigated Curu- Pentecoste, located in the municipality of Pentecoste, Ceará, Brazil. Production factors water (W) and potassium (K) were the independent variables and productivity (Y), the dependent variable. Ten statistical models that have proven satisfactory for obtaining production function were tested. The marginal rate of substitution was obtained through the ratio of the potassium marginal physical product and the water marginal physical product. The most suited model to the conditions of the experiment was the quadratic polynomial without intercept and interaction. Considering that the price of the water was 0. 10 R $ mm- 1, the price of the potassium 2. 19 R $ kg- 1 and the price of the cashew 0. 60 R $ kg- 1, the amounts of water and K 2 O to obtain the maximum net income were 6, 349. 1 L plant- 1 of water and 128. 7 g plant- 1 year,- 1 respectively.

40|$|Livestock is a {{paramount}} {{component in}} Nepalese Agriculture. It’s economic contribution both to rural households (28. 5 %) and national economy (18 %) is in increasing trend. However, {{the share of}} animal products in dietary energy supply is merely 7. 5 %. Buffalo contributes 69. 4 % and 64. 6 % to the total milk and meat production respectively. Its contribution to the total livestock income is 35. 09 % {{in the case of}} sample households. Besides, manure & draft power are two key inputs to maintain soil fertility & agricultural operations. However, it has not been given top priority. The study was conducted in the mid hills of Nepal. The field data were collected applying multi-stage random sampling technique. The collected data have been analyzed using descriptive statistics, econometric models, and qualitative analysis. Additionally, annual compound growth rate of buffalo population and products, factor productivity, and inputs elasticities have also been analyzed. It seems no point to satisfy with the increasing trend as the per capita availability of animal protein is far below than the requirement specified by the basic need program. The model results reveal high possibility to increase <b>factor-product</b> <b>ratio</b> and total economic contribution of buffalo to the economy of rural households. The empirical findings underpin the buffalo production potentialities in livestock-led subsistence farming system, where producers expect state intervention for its development. Key words: buffalo enterprise, factor-product relationship, household econom...|$|E
