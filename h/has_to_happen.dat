25|$|Sometimes an {{exhibition}} race is held {{after all the}} meaningful races are run with all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match yourself up against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins with the Intermediate winner pulling one out {{every once in a}} while. Novices usually win only when a major, catastrophic pile up occurs on the track and even then the mass smash up <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> quite close to the finish line.|$|E
25|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This {{has proved to be}} of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable tau neutrino.|$|E

[...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E

500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. [...] "I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E

But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat around and they played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E
