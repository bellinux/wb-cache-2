50|$|The {{origins of}} Scoot began in March 1993 when {{businessman}} Nigel Robertson bought the <b>freephone</b> <b>number</b> 0800 192 192 from British Telecommunications {{for an estimated}} value of just £100. Robertson had spotted the potential of acquiring a <b>freephone</b> <b>number</b> similar to BT's own directory enquiries number of 192. BT spent three years trying to recover the number in legal battles but were finally forced to admit defeat in May 1996.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the mid-1980s}} <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> could be {{accessed}} only by ringing the operator on 100 and {{asking to be}} connected, e.g. Freephone 8963 for BT customer service. Later on, the 0800 code came into use for <b>freephone</b> services. These <b>numbers</b> often had only 8 digits, e.g. 0800 1111 for ChildLine.|$|R
50|$|Toll-free {{numbers are}} {{normally}} specific to each country. Canadian numbers are an exception {{as they are}} drawn from the same SMS/800 pool as other North American Numbering Plan countries; the +800 Universal International <b>Freephone</b> <b>Number</b> is an exception as these work from multiple country codes.|$|E
50|$|ACA fixed a November 2000 {{implementation}} {{date for the}} provision of local rate and <b>freephone</b> <b>number</b> portability. The industry established a body, Industry Number Management Services (INMS) Ltd, to allocate individual numbers and administer the centralised reference database of all allocated local rate and freephone numbers.|$|E
5000|$|A manual <b>freephone</b> <b>number</b> (UK) or Zenith number (US, Canada) was {{operator}}-assisted; {{the operator}} located the corresponding geographic point (a dialable number) {{from a list}} and placed the collect call. These were replaced by area code 800 in North America in 1966-67 and by BT's 0800 Linkline services in the UK in 1985. A few Zenith, Commerce, WX or Enterprise numbers remain in service, but no more are being issued.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislation}} {{was brought in}} due to the previous confusion surrounding service call charges, {{with the intention of}} making things simpler for the caller. The system also made <b>Freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> free to call from mobile phones, just as they are from landlines.|$|R
5000|$|Special Charging Arrangements. The use {{of number}} prefixes that are {{distinct}} from standard landline numbers {{allows for a}} variety of different charging arrangements - from <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> that cost the caller nothing to dial to premium rate numbers that generate revenue for the called party.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Oftel {{released}} 10-digit numbers beginning 0808 {{designated as}} freephone services. These calls are free {{only from a}} landline or public payphone.Both BT and Mercury issued only 10-digit <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> to users after 1997. With the market opened up to competition, many other companies also allocated these numbers to users.|$|R
50|$|The <b>freephone</b> <b>number,</b> 0800 1111, {{was one of}} {{the first}} 0800 numbers to be issued in the United Kingdom. Before BT {{allocated}} this number to Childline, 0800 1111 was used as a test line number by technicians. Other early allocated 0800 numbers were 10 digit, including the prefix. Childline's number is one of only a handful of 8 digit 0800 UK numbers to ever have been allocated and the only one still in use.|$|E
5000|$|Apple Booking Company (ABC) {{set up a}} <b>freephone</b> <b>number,</b> {{which was}} a major expense to a {{start-up}} business. Travel agents would call in and express an interest in providing overnight hotel stays for their customer {{at the airport and}} were then sent a booking pack which contained a three copy carbon book and freepost envelopes. Initially the systems employed were manual until software and booking system database were developed by Anthony Williams, who had joined Gerry Pack having previously directed a publishing company called Apple.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 800-code operated {{for over}} thirty years before its 7.8 million possible numbers were depleted, but new toll-free area codes are being depleted at an increasing rate both by more widespread use of the numbers by voice-over-IP, pocket pagers, residential, and small business use, and widespread abuse by RespOrgs and subscribers who stockpile the numbers for use in misdial marketing, response tracking for individual advertisements (each ad from each client gets a different <b>freephone</b> <b>number)</b> or sale, lease or shared use. Brokering numbers for sale is illegal, but renting a number or part of a number circumvents these regulations as FCC enforcement is sporadic to minimal.|$|E
50|$|Major {{mobile phone}} {{operators}} {{went through a}} period of charging callers to dial most <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> from around 2005 onwards - but this practice largely ceased on 1 July 2015 as 0800 and 0808 numbers became universally free to call from mobiles and landlines due to changes in Ofcom legislation.|$|R

In integrated telephone networks, these are mostly implemented as functions in the telephone exchange, but in more open networks such as IP telephony networks based on the SIP protocol, these are often separate computers.|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} {{was first}} shown {{early in the}} morning on Saturday 1 April 2006 (Late Friday night). It typically lasted for anything from 2 hours to 4 hours, depending on ITV scheduling. In order to win money viewers had to either call in at a cost of seventy five pence (previously sixty pence) from a BT landline, text the word 'MINT' to a special number or enter through the ITV website and, if selected, would be issued a <b>freephone</b> <b>number</b> and PIN valid for one entry. If they were successful they would be placed on hold then, if the computer selected them at random, they would be transferred live to The Mint mansion, where they went on to give their answer.|$|E
5000|$|A Universal International <b>Freephone</b> <b>Number</b> (UIFN) is a {{worldwide}} toll-free [...] "800 number" [...] {{issued by the}} ITU. Like the 800 area code issued for the NANP in the U.S. and Canada and 0800 numbers in many other countries, the call is free for the caller, and the receiver pays the charges. UIFN uses ITU country code 800, so that no matter where the caller is, only the international access code (IAC), the UIFN country code (800) and the 8-digit UIFN need to be dialed. A few carriers in about 65 countries participate in the UIFN program; free access to the numbers (as international calls) from mobile and coin telephones is not universal. Registration of a +800 number incurs a 200 swiss franc ITU fee (as of 2013) in addition to any charges levied by the individual carrier. The number must be activated for inbound calls from at least two telephone country codes within 180 days.|$|E
50|$|Rantzen {{suggested}} that after that edition of That's Life!, the BBC should open a helpline for children, in case any young viewers suffering current abuse wished to ring in {{to ask for}} help. The helpline was open for 48 hours, during which it was swamped with calls, mainly from children suffering sexual abuse {{they had never been}} able to disclose to anyone else. This gave Rantzen the idea for a specific helpline for children in distress or danger, to be open 24/7 throughout the year, the first of its kind in the world. The Childwatch team consulted child care professionals, who agreed that children would use such a helpline but that it would be impossible to create. Nevertheless, the team obtained funding from the Department of Health and the Variety Club of Great Britain, both of which donated £25,000. Ian Skipper OBE, a noted philanthropist who had already helped Rantzen set up a special fund in memory of Ben Hardwick, agreed to underwrite the helpline's running costs for the first year. Rantzen and the team went to BT to ask for premises for the charity and for a simple <b>freephone</b> <b>number,</b> both of which were provided.|$|E
50|$|Numbers for {{mobile phones}} and pagers are {{formatted}} as 07AAA BBBBBB {{and most other}} non-geographic numbers are 10 figures in length (excluding trunk digit '0') and formatted as 0AAA BBB BBBB. However, these numbers are sometimes written in other formats. 9 figure <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> are 0500 AAAAAA and 0800 AAAAAA and there is one number of 7 figures length: 0800 1111 (Childline).|$|R
5000|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defines several [...] "capability levels" [...] {{for this}} protocol, {{starting}} with Capability Set 1 (CS-1). A typical application for the IN is a Number Translation service. For example, in the United Kingdom, 0800 <b>numbers</b> are <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> and are translated to a geographic number using an IN platform. The Telephone exchanges decode the 0800 numbers to an IN trigger and the exchange {{connects to the}} IN.|$|R
50|$|Increased {{competition}} and {{a shortage of}} the popular 0800 numbers in the early 1990s saw various strategies employed to increase freephone capacity. Newly issued 0800 numbers were lengthened to include seven digits after the 0800 prefix, and the additional 0808 prefix was introduced during 1997. Also during the 1990s, deregulation allowed companies other than BT to acquire 0800 numbers and issue them to their customers, as well as allowing customers with existing <b>freephone</b> <b>numbers</b> to retain them when changing telecoms supplier.|$|R

Unlike other normal Spanish phone numbers beginning 910 onwards, 901 and 902 numbers are always excluded from inclusive call bundles on Spanish landlines and mobiles. 902 numbers are also extremely expensive to call from Spanish mobiles. 901 and 902 numbers are also premium rated if calling Spain from overseas and low cost international call carriers to Spain normally refuse to connect calls to 901 and 902 numbers.|$|R

A Zenith number in the late 1950s required an operator manually determine the destination number from a printed list; the 1967 Wide Area Telephone Service introduced the first automated toll-free telephone numbers, terminated on special fixed-rate trunks.
