500|$|After a while, Ted {{realizes she}} didn't {{actually}} {{say the word}} 'no', <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> didn't have time, and so decides to take her out on a [...] "two-minute date" [...] - to dinner at a table at the café next door to her practice and [...] "the important parts" [...] of [...] at the electronics store two doors down, with help from Ranjit (Marshall Manesh) and Wendy the Waitress. The date goes well, and Stella promises to call if she ever has time. Finally, Abby sees Ted outside the clinic holding flowers he tried to give to Stella, and chases him down the street. She is then seen at the reception telling Barney about how he toyed with her emotions, after which they go out to have sex.|$|E
500|$|Jenny Gifford (née Blyth) is Pete's wife. She {{spends much}} of the first series raising their baby. In Series 2, she {{develops}} a brief crush on Adam. She throws Pete {{out of the house}} when she finds out about his affair with Amy but they try to repair the marriage after Adam's cancer treatment. When she and Pete separate in Series 3, she asserts her independence in a series of short-lived secretarial jobs, and by dating millionaire Robert Brown. She and Pete briefly consider a divorce but get back together after Robert dumps her. In Series 4, the couple are expecting a second child. Jenny miscarries and re-evaluates her life in Manchester. She is offered a job in New York by the head of the company she works for and decides to divorce Pete and leave for America with their son. She returns for Rachel's funeral in Series 5 and moves back in with Pete. Ripley said of her character, [...] "Jenny's very ballsy and speaks her mind, but she's more sensitive than people give her credit for. She's seen as very hard but I don't think she is—it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> won't show her vulnerability to everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|Capper, {{described}} as [...] "a gentle and easily influenced girl," [...] had been babysitting for Jean Powell {{since she was}} ten years old. In 1990 she had spent time {{in the care of}} the local authority after her mother, Elizabeth Capper, and her stepfather separated, after which Suzanne and her older sister Michelle stayed with their stepfather. Around this time Capper began to truant from Moston Brook High School, and her attendance during the final two years of schooling was {{described as}} [...] "erratic." [...] Capper increasingly spent her time at Powell's house. Powell lived at 97 Langworthy Road, Moston, a small Victorian terraced house, where she also dealt drugs and was involved with the handling of stolen motor vehicles. Michelle Capper had briefly lived with Powell, but moved out in August 1992 because she did not like the [...] "evil new friends" [...] Powell was associating with, particularly Bernadette McNeilly, who had recently moved in three doors away at number 91. McNeilly, who had three children, subsequently moved in with Powell and her three children, where the two shared a bed in the downstairs dining room because the bedrooms were [...] "full of children." [...] Capper continued to stay regularly even though Powell and McNeilly frequently bullied her. Her sister said: [...] "It was not that she was scared of them, it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would do anything for them. She pampered their every whim." ...|$|E

500|$|Cogman noted, {{about the}} Arya storyline {{in the same}} interview, that {{he comes from a}} theater background, and that [...] "being able to comment on the show and the {{reactions}} to the show through the players were so much fun. The show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way – the violence and the bigness of the characters. It's a huge operatic story. We're able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view the show, good and bad, and how a perspective of a story changes. Plus there’s the dramatic deliciousness of Arya watching her own life play out on stage." [...] Weiss also spoke about Arya, saying [...] "We were excited to do the play within the play, and it's a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we've already seen." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Part of Arya's amusement is <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> knows that they're getting so many details wrong, but she always regretted that she didn't have a chance to watch Joffrey die, and now she gets to. It's obviously a comic version of it, but that gives her great pleasure." [...] Weiss also noted, [...] "Arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances, and Lady Crane, the actress that she's charged with killing, this is somebody who like her has taken as her life's work the job of becoming other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, French {{appeared}} in Agatha Christie's Marple (episode: [...] "Sleeping Murder"). She appeared as Caroline Arless in the BBC television drama Lark Rise to Candleford in 2008. Talking about her role, she has stated, [...] "I'm quite a vibrant character. She's quite extreme, {{in that she}} drinks too much, laughs too much and sings too much. But she loves her family very much; it's <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> goes over the top sometimes." [...] In late 2010, French starred in Roger & Val Have Just Got In with actor Alfred Molina.|$|E
2500|$|This embittered letter {{remained}} a closely guarded secret, although a former high {{official of the}} CIA told me about it. Chris Nelson also reported it on April 16 in his widely respected, nonpartisan foreign policy newsletter: [...] "A certain Ms. Riza was even then Wolfowitz's true love. The problem for the CIA wasn't <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a foreign national, although that was and is today an issue for anyone interested in CIA employment. The problem was that Wolfowitz was married to someone else, and that someone was really angry about it, and she {{found a way to}} bring her complaint directly to the President. So when we, with our characteristic innocence, put Wolfowitz on our short-list for CIA, we were instantly told, by a very, very, very senior Republican foreign policy operative, 'I don't think so.' [...] " [...] The Daily Mail of London also reported on his wife's letter when Wolfowitz was appointed president of the World Bank in 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Without the tireless work of Maclean's daughter, Nan Milton, {{the memory}} of her father might have been lost. It was not <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> helped found the John MacLean Society and served as it's Secretary, she made the revival possible. At a time when no one was interested, she copied out all her father's {{writings}} from his own and other publications in the National Library and typed them up. That was how Hugh MacDiarmid read his works and then championed his ideas [...] Her first husband wrote a biography of MacLean and lent the only copy of the manuscript to the West Indian Socialist CLR James, who left it on a London Tube train. Nan painstakingly reconstructed it for her own biography. Her devotion was remarkable because she hardly knew her father. He became separated from his wife and family when she was an infant because he had time for nothing except work.|$|E

6000|$|What is now combated is the {{position}} that secession {{is consistent with the}} Constitution--is lawful and peaceful. It is not contended that there is any express law for it; and nothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences. The nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of these States were formed. Is it just that they shall go off without leave and without refunding? The nation paid very large sums (in the aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions) to relieve Florida of the aboriginal tribes. Is it <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> shall now be off without consent or without making any return? The nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so-called seceding States in common with the rest. Is it just either that creditors shall go unpaid or the remaining States pay the whole? A part of the present national debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas. Is it <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> shall leave and pay no part of this herself? ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} refrain acquainting my governess with what had happened; it was but <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> {{who was so}} really {{concerned}} for me, should have part in my good fortune. Besides, I wanted her assistance to supply me with several necessaries, which before I was shy of letting anybody see me have, {{that it might not}} be public; but now I had a cabin and room to set things in, I ordered abundance of good things for our comfort in the voyage, as brandy, sugar, lemons, etc., to make punch, and treat our benefactor, the captain; and abundance of things for eating and drinking in the voyage; also a larger bed, and bedding proportioned to it; so that, in a word, we resolved to want for nothing in the voyage.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{she would}} not have done it for vengeance' sake alone, or rather she would have paid herself in some other fashion. No, her real reason was that she must {{discharge}} the debt due to Margaret and Peter, and to Castell who had sheltered her for years. She it was who had brought them into all this woe, and it seemed but <b>just</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should bring them out again, even at the cost of her own life and womanly dignity. Or, perchance, all three of these powers drove her on,--love for the man if it still lingered, the desire to be avenged upon him, and the desire to snatch his prey from out his maw. At least she had set the game, and she would play it out to its end, however awful that might be.|$|E
60|$|Billy {{conceived}} {{a suspicion}} that these innocent inquiries {{were designed to}} emphasize a contrast in his social quality. But {{he could not be}} sure.

And in that case ought he to maintain the smooth social surface unbroken by pretending as far as possible to be this kind of person, or ought he to make a sudden gap in it by telling his realities. He evaded the shooting question anyhow. He left it open for Lady Marayne and the venerable butler and Sir Godfrey and every one to suppose he just happened to be the sort of gentleman of leisure who doesn't shoot. He disavowed hunting, he made it appear he travelled when he travelled in directions other than Scotland. But the fourth question brought him to bay. He regarded his questioner with his small rufous eye.|$|E
