Alonso d'Avila was sent overland {{to the east of}} the peninsula, passing through Maní where he was well received by the Xiu Maya. D'Avila continued southeast to Chetumal where he founded the Spanish town of Villa Real just within the borders of modern Belize. The local Maya fiercely resisted the placement of the new Spanish colony and d'Avila and his men were forced to abandon <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> for Honduras in canoes.|$|E
5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it available for other uses, including education. Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people, in 2014, she created a Mauritanian Music Festival.|$|E

Liz reminds Jack that Mother's Day is coming up, prompting Jack to realize he forgot to send his mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) flowers and informs his office assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) to send her flowers, however, Colleen is waiting outside Jack's office door. Colleen's real reason for visiting her son is that she learned from her friend in Florida that Jack is dating Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a recent divorcée, {{and a woman who}} happens to be Jack's high school sweetheart. During dinner, Colleen does not bring Nancy up, but tells Jack she knows about his involvement with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) after an awkward encounter between Avery and Jack in an elevator with Colleen present; because of the encounter, Colleen knows that Avery and Jack are sleeping together. Colleen is appalled that Jack is dating two women at the same time, and demands that he end <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a choice between Nancy and Avery.|$|E

5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including the Plum River raid {{in a letter to}} General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E

It yielded a number of artifacts, including some misshapen apparent cannonballs. Eight years later, in 2008, after having spent $2 million on the project the county was still unsure what to do with the building. It was hoping to use federal stimulus money to finish the work.|$|E
25|$|Still believing {{this could}} be improved, and after {{examining}} more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, wooden and powered by the Merlin, which offered substantial future development. The new design would be faster than foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would slow <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability {{would make it easier}} to evade fighters and ground fire. The lack of turrets simplified production and reduced production time, with a delivery rate far in advance of competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and navigator. Contemporary RAF design philosophy required well-armed heavy bombers more akin to the German schnellbomber. At a meeting in early October 1938 with Geoffrey de Havilland and Charles Walker (de Havilland's chief engineer), the Air Ministry showed little interest, and instead asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stop" [...] was shot on 27 January 1998 in Ireland, and was {{directed}} by James Byrne.

It's like everything we do—complete chaos!

500|$|While {{returning}} from a port visit to Constanța in 1911, Panteleimon ran aground on 2 October.

The ship participated in training and gunnery exercises for the rest of the year; a special watch was kept to ensure that no damaged seams were opened while firing. Permanent repairs, which involved replacing its boiler foundations, plating, and a large number of its hull frames, lasted from 10 January to 25 April 1912. The navy took advantage of these repairs to [...] its engines and boilers.|$|E

I’ve never had a better musical experience on any film." [...] Cyrus noted that most of the songs included on the soundtrack were inspired by the return of Cyrus' character, Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana, to her [...] Nashville roots. She explained, [...] "The soundtrack is all about Nashville, and that's where I'm from, that's my roots. I think that's a lot of the reason I am who I am." [...] Cyrus co-wrote [...] "Don't Walk Away" [...] because it was to be included on her own studio album Breakout (2008). [...] "Hoedown Throwdown", a song in which Cyrus calls dance steps, took much time to write. It became an ongoing collaboration between Chelsom, Cyrus, choreographer Jamal Sims, and the song's writers, Adam Anders and Nikki Hasman.|$|E

[...] He cites another writer: [...] "To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> verses on it." [...] Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of Bizarre Foods, was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.|$|E
500|$|With {{this basic}} concept in mind, the creators had 3 months {{to define a}} visual {{identity}} and a setting for their game, prior to development. The game would be set in a post-apocalyptic science fantasy world, featuring ruins and relics of a fallen civilization and mankind struggling for survival, something typical in anime at that time. Futatsugi was particularly influenced {{by one of his}} childhood readings, The Long Afternoon of Earth, a science-fiction novel by Brian Aldiss, in which one side of the earth became perpetually hot, the other perpetually cold. The first presentation video featured a green dragon, in line with traditional European/medieval depictions, however the team quickly decided to change <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it [...] "more sci-fi". In order for the dragon to be more original, it was made blue and covered in a white, bone-like armor. The dragon was supposed to come from the ancient times, so ruins and ancient flying technology also featured this white, shell-like material.|$|E

500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write by yourself. It's a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness out of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding {{as good as he}} does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Control", is an up-tempo {{electronic}} song. Heavily influenced by techno and trance, {{it contains a}} prominent electric guitar riff. [...] "I told Ben [...] I {{wanted to do a}} song that had elements of rock and roll but with a techno vibe and he ran with it, creating a slamming heavy metal guitar intro on an insanely hyper track." [...] The song is about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart as she sings, [...] "Let me kiss <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it better/After tonight you will forget her". [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] is also an up-tempo techno-trance song with elements of ambient music. It features Spanish guitar and castanets. The lyrics were influenced by and written surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. The third track, [...] "Good-N-Evil", incorporates elements of industrial music. [...] "Fly" [...] is a mid-tempo song built around a trip hop beat. The album's fifth track and the only ballad on the album, [...] "Distant Land", contains elements of ambient music and features mellow guitar melody. Lyrically, the song is a tale of a woman waking up lost and not knowing where she is, searching for light in a distant land.|$|E
