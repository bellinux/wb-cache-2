5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

25|$|The {{plans were}} brought to Robertson, who feeling unwell had dined with Maurice in his room, at around 9pm. In Spears’ famous account Robertson’s face “went the colour of {{mahogany}} … his eyebrows slanted outwards like a forest of bayonets held at the charge – in fact he showed every sign of having a fit” He shouted “Get ‘Aig!”. Haig and Robertson visited Lloyd George – one of Robertson’s objections was that the agreement could not be binding on Dominion troops – who told them {{that he had the}} authority of the War Cabinet and that, although Nivelle’s demands were “excessive”, they must have a scheme agreed by 8am. The next morning, after Nivelle had claimed he had not personally drawn up the scheme and professed astonishment that the British generals had not already been told of it, Robertson “ramped up and down the room, talking about the horrible <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> “the wonderful army” under a Frenchman, swearing he would never serve under one, nor his son either, and that no-one could order him to”. Hankey drew up a compromise rather than see Haig and Robertson resign, with Haig still under Nivelle's orders but with tactical control of British forces and right of appeal to the War Cabinet. Robertson later (3 March) regretted even agreeing to this.|$|E

40|$|The term “suicidal behavior” is a {{relatively}} new one. It was coined in 1947 to define suicide as an act of performance, an act of behavior, as one of the fully developed form with its special motivation (like any other behavioral act). The suicidal behavior is treated as any kind of internal and external form of psychic act, directed by <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> oneself to death. Internal suicidal behavior includes suicidal thoughts, ideas, emotions and suicidal tendencies, among which one can detect plots and intentions. External forms of suicidal behavior include suicidal attempts, suicidal threats and completed suicides. The suicide is introduced in the article as an anthropological phenomenon...|$|R

500|$|The writers {{say that}} {{they did not want to}} force modernity onto the story. There were some {{creative}} challenges, such as the decision to include the sign [...] "221B" [...] on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.|$|E

McLaren or his friend Jamie Reid might drop a word like 'anarchy' or 'vacant' that Rotten seizes upon and turns into a manifesto, but McLaren is not the Svengali to Rotten he'd like to be perceived as. McLaren thought he was working with a tabula rasa, but he soon found out that Rotten has ideas of his own". On the other hand, there is little disagreement about McLaren's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a subcultural phenomenon soon after its debut. Temple adds that [...] "he catalyzed so many people's heads. He had so many just extraordinary ideas". Though, as Jon Savage emphasises, [...] "In fact, it was Steve Jones who first had the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the group, or any group, together with McLaren.

[...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E

[...] State Department officials stressed that Kerry's statement and its one-week deadline were rhetorical in light of the unlikelihood of Syria turning over its chemical weapons. Hours after Kerry's statement, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia had suggested to Syria that it relinquish its chemical weapons, and Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem immediately welcomed the proposal, and U.S.–Russian negotiations led to the 14 September 2013 [...] "Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons," [...] which called for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014. Following the agreement, Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to apply that convention provisionally until its formal entry into force on 14 October 2013.

A philosophy that [...] "fuels" [...] the album is the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> [...] "faith in action"; Hall stated that he wanted believers to become more active in their faith, and to [...] "get out of their pews and get involved in what God is doing".

[...] Former president Dwight Eisenhower had died recently, and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower's portrait on the dollar.

500|$|In {{his final}} University Match, Oxford batted first and Jardine's innings began after {{his team had}} lost two wickets without scoring any runs. He batted for 285 minutes, scoring 140. Before lunch, he played very {{carefully}} but increased his scoring rate afterwards. In total, he hit 21 fours and The Times described his innings as faultless. Wisden noted his strong defence and his powerful leg glance. Critics noted that he frequently hit Stanley Jackson to the leg side, a method of play which was unusual at the time. Players educated at Public School generally considered hitting to leg highly unorthodox and almost unfair. K. S. Ranjitsinhji, {{who was in the}} crowd at Lord's, would develop the leg glance and make it respectable within a few years, but he had not yet made his first-class debut in 1892. It is likely that Jardine {{was one of the first}} players to use this shot. Jackson refused to depart from the orthodox methods of the time, continuing to bowl with seven fielders on the off side and only two on the leg side, making it easier for Jardine to score runs.The Times commented that Cambridge [...] "appeared a little slow to grasp the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> a man on the leg side for [...] ". Jardine also hit 39 in the second innings as Oxford chased down a target to win for the only time in his University career. Jardine's first innings remained his only first-class century.|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{indicates}} {{she had a}} dream involving American actress Gina Gershon. For her mural, Donna {{proposes a}} recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper with Indiana natives {{in place of the}} apostles. Actor Greg Kinnear was chosen to replace Jesus, with the Apostles replaced by John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, David Letterman and a NASCAR race car, among others. Jerry presents for his mural a work of pointillism, a style of painting in which small distinct dots of color create the impression of a wider image. When proposing her somber mural, Leslie claims tragedy often succeeds in awards, and specifically cites the Academy Awards which honor the film industry. As an example, Leslie uses The English Patient, the 1996 Best Picture winner during the 69th Academy Awards. Upon first receiving his painting, Tom says, [...] "It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles", a reference to the multi-colored candies. Leslie, upon the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the best parts of each design into a new mural, says it is like having Michelangelo, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis do one painting. When Mark tries to get out of helping with the mural, he uses the excuse, [...] "I was gonna go to Arby's and watch Frontline", a reference to a fast food restaurant chain and a Public Broadcasting Service public affairs program.

500|$|The {{sequencing}} of the record's track list was done strategically, starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices {{and ending with}} those that explore love, relationships and sexuality. This decision also factored into the album's artwork and marketing, giving it an overt black and white militant imagery. Jam explained that [...] "he <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> 'Rhythm Nation', 'Living in the World' and 'The Knowledge' as the first three songs on the record really set the tone {{as to what the}} record was. Then to have the segue after that where she says, 'Get the point? Good. Let's dance...' and then go into 'Miss You Much', that was purposely done." [...] He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been [...] "a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover" [...] with Escapade as its title, starting the track listing with [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] and [...] "Escapade", and ending it with [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "The Knowledge" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] but noted that despite being the same collection of songs, the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact. Of its lyrical themes, Kate Kelly stated the album [...] "reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education, avoiding drugs, and feeding the homeless. All this might seem a little heavy for dance music or pop radio, but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance-floor." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety described it as [...] "a quasi-concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime, the crack epidemic, racism, homelessness and youth illiteracy — not exactly a recipe for a party. And yet the record was somehow even more successful than Control, generating a then-record seven top 5 singles." ...|$|E

[...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot.
