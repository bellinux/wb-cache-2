40|$|Cows {{previously}} {{trained with}} <b>headlocks</b> {{did not increase}} milk production or feed intake when <b>headlocks</b> were removed. Twoyear- old and older cows {{did not differ in}} response to <b>headlocks</b> and neckrails. Prudent use of <b>headlocks</b> increases labor efficiency of a commercial dairy. Managing a dairy without <b>headlocks</b> is a challenge because cows must be sorted and worked off the milking parlor flow. In the case of large milking parlors, {{it may be necessary to}} process 50 - 200 cows per hour. Depending upon the treatment facilities, this number of cows may create a bottleneck in the dairy. For many routine procedures, <b>headlocks</b> offer the simplest and most cost-effective alternative. It is important to note that <b>headlocks</b> can be mismanaged. This is especially true during summer months. Locking up cows for extended periods without access to water or shade may have adverse effects during summer heat stress. It is important to minimize lock-up time. Consideration should also be given to training heifers to <b>headlocks</b> prior to calving. It is very likely that untrained heifers may be reluctant to be placed in <b>headlocks.</b> If this occurs, intake could be limited during their first exposure to <b>headlocks.</b> If heifers are not trained to <b>headlocks</b> prior to calving, one should determine if they should be locked-up each day during the first week of lactation. <b>Headlocks</b> can be successfully used on a dairy. The critical question is how will they be managed. Successful managers of <b>headlocks</b> minimize restraint time, push-up or feed pens often (6 - 8 times per day), and avoid use of <b>headlocks</b> during late morning and afternoon hours during the summer months...|$|R

5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with Angle and Cena locking up, leading to Angle taking Cena {{down with a}} <b>headlock</b> takeover. Cena countered many attacks by Angle {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena {{attempted}} an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff came down the ramp and cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena.

As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E
