40|$|Piezoresistive {{pressure}} sensors {{have been in}} use for decades and {{are among the most}} successful micromachined sensors. From their introduction in the 1960 s, they have experienced a dramatic improvement on performance and stability, as new microfabrication techniques have been developed. For high-accuracy avionic applications, there is a strong focus on the long-term stability of the sensor output-signal. Higher stability makes increased service-intervals possible and open the doors to new applications areas. This thesis focuses on possible root causes influencing the stability for piezoresistive {{pressure sensors}}. Although the main focus has been on the SP 82 -design from MEMSCAP, the results are relevant also for other sensor designs using similar packaging technologies. It has been found that even small amounts of <b>excess</b> <b>glass</b> frit material in the die lamination process may cause a major influence on the sensor zero point and temperature sensitivity. High residual stress in the <b>excess</b> <b>glass</b> frit volume will also result in increased risk for mechanical stress release in the form of microcrack formation. By optimizing the glass frit distribution, the influence from the die lamination on the sensor output-signal has been reduced and the stability has been improved. Another major finding has been that the use of a thermoset polymer as a die-attach material might result in an unwanted signal drift when the sensors are stored for weeks under ambient environmental conditions. This was found to be caused by diffusion of water into the polymer, leading to spatially localized swelling with resulting mechanical stress changes, combined with physical aging. A new support die design has been designed and tested, reducing this effect to neglectable levels. The sensitivity of a sealed sensor structure to changes in the sensor cap pressure has been modelled and experimentally verified. Examples of resulting influence from various storage conditions on signal drift as well as characteristic over temperature are demonstrated, and resulting hermeticity requirements are discussed. A new metallization pattern for in situ observation of metal properties in a piezoresistive pressure sensor has been developed and initial testing has been performed. By limiting the design change to the metal mask only, this provides a cost effective approach for characterizing of metal properties where the test structure can be combined with functional devices on the same wafer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to propose a preparation method of glass–ceramics derived from heavy metal gypsum and pickling sludge, as well as stabilization of Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Hg, Cr and Ni heavy metals. The process consists of the following two stages: the desulfurization of heavy metal gypsum and the preparation of glass–ceramics. Heavy metal gypsum was desulfurized by <b>excess</b> <b>glass</b> powder at 1, 473 K and formed calcium silicate and silicon dioxide as intermediate products. The intermediate pro-ducts, pickling sludge and small amounts of CaO and MgO were used as major raw materials for preparing parent glass. Glass–ceramics was produced by conventional heating method, which included a nucleation stage (973 K, 2 h) and a crystallization stage (1, 173 K, 1 h). The main crystalline phase of the obtained glass–ceramics is aker-manite (Ca 2 MgSi 2 O 7). A high microhardness of 5. 3 GPa and a bending strength of 206 MPa, as well as a water absorption lower than 0. 13 % were obtained. The leaching of toxic elements in glass–ceramics was much lower tha...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of mechanical surface treatments for <b>excess</b> <b>glass</b> removal on the fracture toughness of a glass infiltrated zirconia toughened alumina "GI-ZTA" disks (In-Ceram® Zirconia). The GI-ZTA disks were submitted to three different mechanical surface treatments after glass infiltration (grinding, sandblasting and grinding/sandblasting/annealing). Fracture toughness was evaluated through indentation fracture (IF) test. Reliability of tests results was accessed through Weibull statistics. Results: Indentation fracture tests (IF) of GI-ZTA disks have shown that grinding was the surface treatment that presented the lowest K Ic and reliability. An annealing treatment after grinding and sandblasting promoted an increase in K Ic, mainly due to monoclinic-tetragonal reverse transformation recovering the tetragonal zirconia lost during the different mechanical surface treatments. The highest K Ic values were observed after sandblasting and grinding/sandblasting/annealing. Significance: The proposed mechanical surface treatments played an important role on the metastability of tetragonal zirconia and strongly influenced the mechanical performance of GI-ZTA. Kruskhall-Wallis test indicated that K Ic values of the three mechanical surface treatments were statistically distinct...|$|E

Optimized doping of NPs and subsequent thorough characterizations for improved absorption and emission {{are the key}} issues for lasing glasses. We inspect the influence of silver (Ag) NPs inclusion on the optical properties of Sm 3 + doped zinc-sodium tellurite glasses having composition 65 TeO 2 - 25 ZnO- 10 Na 2 O- (0. 15 gram) Sm 2 O 3 -(y) AgCl, where y = 0, 0. 03, 0. 075, 0. 12 and 0. 18 gram (in <b>excess).</b> <b>Glass</b> samples are prepared using melt quenching technique and characterized via ultraviolet visible near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The presence of NPs is verified from TEM images and the amorphous nature is confirmed from XRD pattern. The UV-Vis- NIR spectra revealing six absorption peaks centered at 472, 943, 1089, 1237, 1392, and 1491 nm are assigned to 6 H 5 / 2 → 4 I 11 / 2, 6 F 11 / 2, 6 F 9 / 2, 6 F 7 / 2, 6 F 5 / 2, 6 F 3 / 2 transitions, respectively. PL spectra exhibit two emission bands located at 599 nm (4 G 5 / 2 → 6 H 7 / 2) and 643 nm (6 H 9 / 2). The observed enhancement in PL intensity is attributed to the highly localized electric field of Ag NPs positioned {{in the vicinity of}} Sm 3 + ion. The mechanism of enhancement is identified, analyzed, and understood. The admirable features of our results are highly beneficial for solidstate laser and optical device fabrication...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Titania was {{progressively}} {{added in}} the range 3 – 9 wt % into a triaxial porcelain body consisting of clay, quartz and feldspar. The composed bodies were heated at five different temperatures in the range 1200 – 1400 °C and their fired properties as well as phases evolved were studied. The results revealed that beyond 1300 °C, formation of more liquid phases caused bloating in samples which led to generation of pores. This effect is more pronounced in TiO 2 containing samples. In the present system, 1300 °C appeared to b the optimum temperature at which porosity was almost negligible and strength was maximum (45 MPa), particularly in presence of TiO 2. From the results of XRD studies, {{it was revealed that}} quartz content primarily decreased with increase in TiO 2 content due to <b>excess</b> <b>glass</b> formation and its subsequent dissolution. Mullite content increased with increase in TiO 2 content. No significant effect was observed beyond 6 wt % addition. Micro-structure primarily showed the presence of quartz grain and cluster of smaller sized primary mullite crystals in both the samples without and with TiO 2. Very few secondary mullite crystals were also observed. SEM picture of sample containing 9 wt % TiO 2 showed some grain boundary crack due to cooling stress generated in the glassy phase. The drastic reduction of residual strength after 8 cycles of heating at 800 °C and cooling particularly in TiO 2 containing samples suggests controlled heat treatment of the vitrified samples necessary to promote secondary crystallization process for the enhancement of strength. Attempts have also been made to correlate the constitu ional parameters with the properties...|$|E

50|$|The {{stainless}} steel crowns are selected by tooth type, location and size (see image 2). The tooth will be measured {{to identify the}} most suitable size of {{stainless steel}} crown. The clinician will try the stainless steel crown prior to its cementation, {{to ensure that it}} fits correctly, and establish if an alternative size or contouring of the stainless steel crown is required. When placing the stainless steel crown within the mouth, the airways will generally be protected by placing gauze around the site, or the clinician may secure the stainless steel with tape/Elastoplast. Once a correct size/fit is established, the crown may be adhered to the tooth. The stainless steel crown is secured to the tooth by partially filling the stainless steel crown with a self curing glass ionomer cement and then placing over the tooth. The stainless steel crown should “click” securely into place. The patient is required to bite firmly onto a cotton roll or bite stick to secure it in the correct position whilst it sets. The <b>excess</b> of <b>glass</b> ionomer cement will be wiped off or removed with knotted floss from between the interproximal contact, and a sickle probe from the buccal gingival sulcus on the buccal and lingual/palatal surfaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate how mechanical surface treatments performed for removal of <b>excess</b> of molten <b>glass,</b> influence the fracture toughness of a dental zirconia toughened alumina (In-Ceram® Zirconia). Infiltrated ZTA disks were submitted to three different surface treatments (grinding, sandblasting and grinding + sandblasting + annealing). Fracture toughness was accessed through indentation strength test (IS). X ray diffraction was used to investigate the metastability of tetragonal zirconia particles under all treatments proposed. Kruskall-Wallis non-parametrical test and Weibull statistics were used to analyze the results. Grinding (group 1) introduced defects which decreased the fracture toughness and reliability, presenting the lowest K IC. On the other hand, grinding followed by sandblasting and annealing (group 3) presented the highest K IC. Sandblasting (group 2) presented the highest reliability but lower K IC compared to group 3...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{transition}} of cross-linked corn starches {{was characterized by}} using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) {{in the presence of}} excess (67 %, based on total weight) or limited (15 %) water. Normal corn starch (, 24 % amylose) was cross-linked by reacting with a mixture (99 : 1) of sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) in an aqueous alkaline slurry containing sodium sulfate. The amount of the cross-linking agent (STMP/STPP mixture) in the starch slurry (100 g starch, 140 ml water, and 10 g sodium sulfate) was varied (4 – 12 g), and the level of cross-linking was monitored by the level of incorporated phosphorus, swelling volume, and a-amylase resistance. When analyzed with <b>excess</b> water, the <b>glass</b> transition temperature ðTg 0; 25. 6 and 25. 7 8 C) of the cross-linked starches was higher than those of native and control starches (26. 6 and 26. 5 8 C, respectively), and the ice melting enthalpy was also increased by the cross-linking, indicating the increased amount of freezable water. However, in the DSC analysis with limited water, Tg and heat capacity increment ðDCpÞ at Tg decreased by cross-linking. It indicates that the free volume for starch chains was increased by the bulky and ionic phosphate groups. The relaxation enthalpy increased, but the peak temperature of relaxation endotherm decreased as the cross-linking level increased.
