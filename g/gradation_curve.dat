One process that could endanger a dam construction is internal erosion, i. e. particle transportation by groundwater flow with in the dam that {{may result in a}} failure process. This is a known problem in dam construction but is poorly understood for long time perspective. In Sweden, glacial deposits have acted as natural dams for about 20, 000 years. This implies that the composition of these deposits in combination with the present hydraulic gradient has been stable in a long term perspective. In this study such a formation, Lake Hennan, has been studied and compared with general dam design guidelines. The study has included a geotechnical field survey and subsequent laboratory investigations. The aim of the field survey was to explore the stratigraphy of the geological formation, collect samples for laboratory testing and collect ground water level observations. The laboratoryinvestigations targeted on classification of the collected samples mainly by sieving. The final conclusion from this study is that the geological formation at Lake Hennan is a natural dam.

40|$|AbstractThe {{factors of}} suffusion {{progression}} {{due to a}} series of one-dimensional laboratory seepage tests on cohesive soil were investigated. Suffusion is the transportation of finer fractions between larger fractions with seepage force. It has been studied for noncohesive soil because suffusion often takes place in filter zones at dam sites. However, other soil structures containing cohesive soil are also threatened by suffusion, particularly in grounds imposed by a high and concentrated seepage force. Following the seepage tests, a series of laboratory penetration tests was conducted to measure the strength of ground-induced suffusion. We proposed that the potential for the onset of suffusion was governed by the <b>gradation</b> <b>curves</b> of the materials and the pore size of the outlet due to the results of seepage tests and the synthesis of previous studies. Both suffusion and clogging take place at high hydraulic gradients. Suffusion is initiated over the critical pore velocity and depends on the material properties. Namely, if suffusion is allowed in the ground and the soil is allowed to outflow from the outlet, suffusion will be initiated. If either one of these is not allowed, clogging will occur and that will lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity. The penetration resistance decreased in proportion to the progression of suffusion {{despite the fact that the}} absolute amount of suffused soil was subtle. This implies risks of the promotion of vulnerability in practical grounds by continuous and invisible suffusion. In addition, the turbidity of the discharged water proved that by measuring the preferential migration of finer fractions through the soil specimen, it may be possible to monitor the onset of suffusion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSand is an {{accumulation}} of grains of mineral matter derived from the disintegration of rocks. It is distinguished from gravel only {{by the size of}} the grains or particles. Sand deposits of varying gradation are available in different regions of the world. The prime use of sand, as fine aggregate is in the manufacture of concrete. As fine aggregate comprises up to 30 % of the total volume of concrete, consequently gradation and fineness modulus of sand are among principal factors affecting the performance of fresh and hardened concrete. For the purpose of this study, eight sand deposits were selected from various regions of Pakistan. The grain size distribution was compared with the ASTM gradation limits recommended for concrete. It was revealed that only two sands satisfy the ASTM gradation limits while all the others do not comply being on the finer side. For betterment of the construction industry, a sand optimization technique was developed. The optimization phase consisted of sieving the crusher fines and mixing different fractions of crusher fines with the natural sand in different combinations to get desired sand gradation. The optimized <b>gradation</b> <b>curves</b> matched with the ASTM limits and the optimized fineness modulus reached within the ASTM limits. The concrete made with optimized sands showed up to 39 % increase in compressive strength. The composition of mineral constituents was also evaluated through x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence, which indicated that the fine aggregate having higher silica content resulted in concrete with higher strength as compared to the one with higher calcium content.

40|$|A {{bituminous}} mixture {{is composed of}} approximately 95 % by weight, or 80 % by volume, mineral aggregate. Therefore {{it is important to}} see how aggregate gradation affects the performance of bituminous mixes. The present study was taken up with the objectives of evaluating the effect of aggregate gradation on indirect tensile strength, shear strength and rutting behaviour of bituminous mixes and thereby to establish the relationship between some aggregate gradation parameters and tensile strength, shear strength, horizontal tensile strain and rutting values. Three aggregate gradations, two types of binder; VG- 30 and PMB- 40 and two types of mixes, Bituminous Concrete (BC) and Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) are used. The results indicate that the performance of mixes made with PMB- 40 is better than that of the mixes made with VG- 30 for both BC and DBM. In general, the BC mix is better than DBM mix in term of indirect tensile strength (ITS), horizontal tensile strain (HTS), and the compressive strength, while DBM mix is better in terms of shear strength and rut resistance.

40|$|The {{aggregate}} gradation {{of the hot}} mix asphalts (HMA) used {{in southern}} Nevada before 1989 generally fell above the maximum density line (fine graded aggregate mix). Various asphaltic concrete pavements using an aggregate <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> that resides below the maximum density line for any nominal size aggregate {{have been placed in}} the southern Nevada area over the past few years.

This paper presents mix design and performance (rutting) data of four (post- 1990) projects in which the gradations range from continuous coarse graded to skip coarse graded aggregates (gradation curves that dropped sharply from the 3 / 4 in. sieve to the 1 / 2 in. sieve size then continued in a well-graded fashion). Maximum rut depths were measured for all traffic lanes at major intersections, and average rut depths were then calculated for each project. Rutting measurements were made after at least one annual cycle of operation. These measurements show a 50 % rutting reduction when the continuous coarse graded aggregate HMA was used instead of the pre- 1989 fine graded aggregate HMA.

40|$|Repeated train loads produce {{settlements}} in railway tracks, particularly in ballasted trail tracks. When the settlement reaches the allowable limit, a maintenance method {{should be applied}} to bring the railway tracks into the original position. Settlements in railway tracks are hugely influenced by degree of ballast fouling (i. e., a ballast fouling index) in addition to train loads themselves (i. e., from large number of train passes). Sources of ballast fouling vary from ballast layer itself to underneath layers. Fouling materials coming from underneath layers {{is also an important}} source of ballast fouling in addition to particle crushing. Tamping method, stoneblowing and cleaning/replacement are the maintenance methods in practice currently. While replacement method is rarely applied due to huge costs and interruption to regular traffic, tamping method is applied throughout the world. However, tamping application induces particle crushing due to tamping tools in addition to loosening of top ballasts (i. e., thereby reducing original compaction level). Effect of tamping method on settlement characteristics haven’t been studied before. In this research, effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics of fouled ballast were studied conducting scaleddown model tests. Fouled ballast was simulated by gap-graded gradation curves with gravel (i. e., 1 / 5 size of actual ballast) and medium sand (D 50 = 1. 54 mm). In model tests, 100 loading cycles (no. of loading cycles were limited to 100 as this is a manual-controlled process) were applied to simulate cyclic behaviour with the designed vertical stress. After 100 loading cycles were applied, tamping method was simulated as in field conditions using a simple tool. After tamping application, again 100 loading cycles were applied with the same vertical stress. Continuous images were captured during each loading cycle to obtain strain distribution in ballast layer. The results revealed that settlement characteristics are influenced by degree of ballast fouling in addition to tamping application. As anticipated, the results suggested that settlement reduce after tamping application, mainly due to densification of specimen from previous 100 loading cycles. The results further revealed that the largest reduction in settlement occurs at 30 - 50 % of fouling index (FIP,m). Relationship of settlement ? no. of loading cycles was fitted as two processes; initial and residual settlement processes. The results suggested that initial settlement rate (?) becomes smaller after tamping application beyond 15 % of FIP,m. The results also suggested that residual settlement rate increases after taming application beyond 30 % of FIP,m. If results are interpreted in terms of practical application, {{it can be said that}} tamping application is effective only up to 30 % of FIP,m (which is equal to percentage of fouling materials for gadgraded sand-gravel specimens tested in this research). More detailed analysis on effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics were studied using strain distribution evaluated using the images captured during loading cycles in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) software (i. e., Flow-PIV). The PIV results confirmed that tamping application loosens top ballasts, particularly, at the sides of sleeper, where tamping tools are inserted. In next step, void ratio characteristics of sand-gravel specimens (simulating fouled ballasts) were evaluated in YADE (a DEM approach). In YADE, a method was proposed to produce gap-graded gradation curves. Verification of YADE simulations were done by the results of laboratory density tests. The comparison of results showed differences in void ratios (i. e., maximum and minimum void ratios). As laboratory materials consist of irregular particles and DEM simulations were conducted with spheres, the difference in void ratios is assumed to be due to different shapes of particles. Therefore, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced using the results of image analysis (i. e., in ImageJ) on shape characteristics of medium sand and gravel particles. Introduction of clump particles led to have similar results as those of laboratory void ratio characteristics. The results further revealed that variation of void ratios with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics with some accuracy. In next analysis, strength and deformation characteristics of fouled ballast were studied from triaxial compression tests. Triaxial compression tests were conducted in two series; dense and loose specimens simulated by 80 and 50 % of relative density, Dr respectively. The results from laboratory tests suggested that strength properties, represented by peak deviator stress, qf, and failure friction angle, ??f, change with FIP,m with some similarities with variation of ??with FIP,m. In next part, triaxial compression tests were conducted in DEM simulations with spheres. However, as comparison of DEM results with those of laboratory tests is influenced by particle shape, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced in DEM simulations. The results suggested that clump shape can simulate stressstrain behaviours same as laboratory triaxial compression tests. As different gradation curves can be simulated in YADE simulations, the method used can be extended to different type of fouled ballasts through different gradation curves. Also, it is also clear that variation of qf and ?f with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics (particularly, variation of ??) of fouled ballasts with FIP,m with some accuracy. In a simultaneous work, an in-situ method was proposed to evaluate particle size distribution of fouled ballast using image analysis techniques. ImageJ software was used to conduct image analysis. Particles (i. e., both gravel and medium sand) were simulated by different shapes in ImageJ and found the best available shape as ellipse shape to simulate laboratory particles. Gradation curves were evaluated as area-, number of particle- and volume-based gradation curves. Area-based <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> was possible to produce the <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> evaluated by sieve analysis test with some image analysis techniques. However, number of particles-based <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> underestimates that of sieve analysis. However, given both area- and number of particle-based gradation curves are not based on volume of particles (which is the case with sieve analysis test), a method was proposed to evaluate thickness of particles using 2 D images (hence, evaluation of volume of particle is possible). It was also discussed how definition of grain size should be used in image analysis results to compare with those of sieve analysis test. Finally, a simple method was proposed to evaluate volume-based <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> of fouled ballast using 2 D images using a size correction factor on grain size...|$|E

In the case of hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavements, this includes producing a surface that is resistant to the principal HMA distress types: permanent deformation (or rutting) and fatigue damage (or cracking). To protect better against these distress types, there have recently been changes in HMA mixture design practice. These changes have had the positive effect of producing more damage resistant mixtures but have also had the effect of producing mixtures that require more compaction effort to obtain required densities. It is important to understand what properties of an HMA mixture contribute to their compactability. This study presents analysis of the correlation between HMA mixture properties and laboratory compaction parameters for the purpose of predicting compactability. Mixture property data were measured for a variety of mixtures; these mixtures were compacted in the laboratory and compaction parameters were collected. A statistical analysis was implemented to correlate the mixture data to the compaction data for the purpose of predicting compactability. The resulting model performs well at predicting compactability for mixtures that are similar to the ones used to make the model, and it reveals some mixture properties that influence compaction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a better understanding of suffusion characteristics of glacial soils and to present a simple yet reliable assessment procedure for determination of suffusion in the laboratory. Internal erosion by suffusion occurs in the core of an embankment dam when the ability of the soil to resist seepage forces is exceeded and voids are large enough to allow the transport of fine particles through the pores. Soils susceptible to suffusion are described as internally unstable. dams with core of broadly graded glacial moraines (tills) exhibit signs of internal erosion to a larger extent than dams constructed with other types of materials. The Suffusion behavior of glacial soils has been investigated through two different permeameter suffusion test have been employed, small scale permeameter and big scale permeameter. Details of the equipment along with its calibration, testing and sampling procedures are provided. The testing program were performed 9 test with different compaction degree in small scale permeameter and 2 test in big permeameter on internally stable categories of till soil. The categories are defined based on the soil grain size distribution and according to the methods developed by Kenney & Lau and Burenkova. Layers are identified with suffusion if the post-test <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> exhibit changes in distribution compared to the initial condition and also the tests revealed that the effect of grain size distribution and relative degree of compaction on the internal erosion susceptibility of glacial till soils at different hydraulic gradient...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of track foundation material gradually decreases due to insufficient lateral confinement, ballast fouling, {{and loss of}} shear strength of the subsurface soil under cyclic loading. This paper presents characterization of rail track subsurface to identify ballast fouling and subsurface layers shear wave velocity using seismic survey. Seismic surface wave method of multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) {{has been carried out}} in the model track and field track for finding out shear wave velocity of the clean and fouled ballast and track subsurface. The shear wave velocity (SWV) of fouled ballast increases with increase in fouling percentage, and reaches a maximum value and then decreases. This character is similar to typical compaction curve of soil, which is used to define optimum and critical fouling percentage (OFP and CFP). Critical fouling percentage of 15 % is noticed for Coal fouled ballast and 25 % is noticed for clayey sand fouled ballast. Coal fouled ballast reaches the OFP and CFP before clayey sand fouled ballast. Fouling of ballast reduces voids in ballast and there by decreases the drainage. Combined plot of permeability and SWV with percentage of fouling shows that after critical fouling point drainage condition of fouled ballast goes below acceptable limit. Shear wave velocities are measured in the selected location in the Wollongong field track by carrying out similar seismic survey. In-situ samples were collected and degrees of fouling were measured. Field SWV values are more than that of the model track SWV values for the same degree of fouling, which might be due to sleeper’s confinement. This article also highlights the ballast gradation widely followed in different countries and presents the comparison of Indian ballast gradation with international gradation standards. Indian ballast contains a coarser particle size when compared to other countries. The upper limit of Indian <b>gradation</b> <b>curve</b> matches with lower limit of ballast gradation curves of America and Australia. The ballast gradation followed by Indian railways is poorly graded and more favorable for the drainage conditions. Indian ballast engineering needs extensive research to improve presents track conditions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Water {{and soil}} {{retention}} curve {{is one of}} the most important properties of porous media to obtain in a laboratory retention curve and time associated with errors. For this reason, researchers have proposed techniques that help them to more easily acquired characteristic curve. One of these methods is the use of fractal geometry. Determining the relationship between particle size distribution fractal dimension (DPSD) and fractal dimension retention curve (DSWRC) can be useful. However, the full information of many soil data is not available from the grading curve and only three components (clay, silt and sand) are measured. In recent decades, the use of fractal geometry as a useful tool and a bridge between the physical concept models and experimental parameters have been used. Due to the fact that both the solid phase of soil and soil pore space themselves are relatively similar, each of them can express different fractal characteristics of the soil. Materials and Methods: This study aims to determine DPSD using data soon found in the soil and creates a relationship between DPSD and DSWRC. To do this selection, 54 samples from Northern Iran and the six classes loam, clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty loam and sandy loam were classified. To get the fractal dimension (DSWRC) Tyler and Wheatcraft (27) retention curve equation was used. Alsothe fractal dimension particle size distribution (DPSD) using equation Tyler and Wheatcraft (28) is obtained. To determine the grading curve in the range of 1 to 1000 micron particle radius of the percentage amounts of clay, silt and sand soil, the method by Skaggs et al (24) using the following equation was used. DPSD developed using gradation curves (Dm 1) and three points (sand, silt and clay) (Dm 2), respectively. After determining the fractal dimension and fractal dimension retention curve <b>gradation</b> <b>curve,</b> regression relationship between fractal dimension is created. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the fractal dimension of particle size distributions obtained with both methods were not significantly different from each other. DSWRCwas also using the suction-moisture. The results indicate that all three fractal dimensions related to soil texture and clay content of the soil increases. Linear regression relationships between Dm 1 and Dm 2 with DSWRC was created using 48 soil samples in order to determine the coefficient of 0. 902 and 0. 871. Then, based on relationships obtained from the four methods (1 - Dm 1 = DSWRC, 2 -regression equationswere obtained Dm 1, 3 - Dm 2 = DSWRC and 4. The regression equation obtained Dm 2. DSWRC expression was used to express DSWRC. Various models for the determination of soil moisture suction according to statistical indicators normalized root mean square error, mean error, relative error. And mean geometric modeling efficiency was evaluated. The results of all four fractalsare close to each other and in most soils it is consistent with the measured data. Models predict the ability to work well in sandy loam soil fractal models and the predicted measured moisture value is less than the estimated fractal dimension- less than its actual value is the moisture curve. Conclusions: In this study, the work of Skaggs et al. (24) was used and it was amended by Fooladmand and Sepaskhah (8) grading curve using the percentage of developed sand, silt and clay. The fractal dimension of the particle size distribution was obtained. The fractal dimension particle size of the radius of the particle size of sand, silt and clay were used, respectively. In general, the study of fractals to simulate the effectiveness of retention curve proved successful. And soon it was found that the use of data, such as sand, silt and clay retention curve can be estimated with reasonable accuracy...|$|E
