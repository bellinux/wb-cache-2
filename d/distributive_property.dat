Here, {{this method is}} applied to a full three-dimensional population balance model (PBM) describing branching topology evolution driven by chain end to backbone coupling. This process is typical for polymer modification reactions, e. g., in polyethylene, where initially linear polymer chains undergo hydrogen abstraction, and subsequent branching or scission. Topologies are distinguished by chain ends, number of branches, and number of reactive ends. The resulting time dependent trivariate distribution is utilized to extract various <b>distributive</b> <b>properties</b> of the polymer.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple algebraic approach to music description and composition called Haskore. In this framework, musical objects consist of primitive notions such as notes and rests, operations to transform musical objects such as transpose and tempo-scaling, and operations to combine musical objects to form more complex ones, such as concurrent and sequential composition. When these simple notions are embedded into a functional language such as Haskell, rather complex musical relationships can be expressed clearly and succinctly. Exploiting the algebraic properties of Haskore, we have furthermore defined a notion of literal performance (devoid of articulation) through which observationally equivalent musical objects can be determined. With this basis many useful properties can be proved, such as commutative, associative, and <b>distributive</b> <b>properties</b> of various operators.

40|$|Rwanda {{is facing}} a severe {{electricity}} crisis. Higher demand and production cost {{as well as a}} reduction in revenues in real terms have led to large operating losses for the electricity operator Electrogaz. In order to deal with this crisis, a doubling of electricity tariffs was recently approved, from a flat rate of RWF 42 /kwh to a flat rate of RWF 82 /kwh. This flat rate may not be appropriate to protect some of the poorer residential customers of Electrogaz from the necessary increase in the average level of electricity tariffs. For this reason, Electrogaz has recently proposed to implement an Inverted U Block Tariff Structure. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a preliminary assessment of the <b>distributive</b> <b>properties</b> of the new tariff proposal, as well as simulations for the properties of alternative tariff designs using recent household survey data.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{syntactic}} account of interpolation structures in Romance. In the introduction you are presented with a general approach: definition, scope within the Indo-European languages and prosodic aspects of this linguistic phe-nomenon. In section 2, the <b>distributive</b> <b>properties</b> of clitic object pronouns with respect to the verb are examined in detail and they are exemplified with Old Spanish, Old Catalan, Modem Portuguese and Modem Galician data. This section is concluded with a hypothesis that regards interpolation as a kind of stylistic construction related to a syn-tactic projection that occurs between CP and IP (namely, FocusP). The existence of this maximal projection not only allows us to account for the syntactic distribution of cli-tic object pronouns in embedded sentences but also for the prosodic aspects involved. Section 3 is devoted to the analysis of periphrastic perfects and passives and the inter-vention of severa 1 linguistic items between either haber or ser and the past participle, which have generally been considered interpolation structures (cf.

30|$|The {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that during economic downturns, unemployment benefits can strongly reduce poverty. In particular, in the mid- 1990 s unemployment benefit programs contributed substantially to poverty reduction in European transition countries – a somewhat unexpected finding given that reducing poverty {{is not one of}} the stated goals of unemployment benefits. The effects were strongest in Hungary and Poland. In Hungary poverty among the unemployed fell more than 50 percent; in Poland it declined 45 percent (Vodopivec et al. 2005). In Hungary 5.2 percent of the total population was drawn out of poverty by unemployment benefits; in Poland the figure was 3.5 percent. Unemployment benefits reduced poverty among the unemployed in other countries as well, albeit less significantly. Poverty fell 31 percent in the Slovak Republic, 16 percent in Slovenia, 9 percent in Latvia, and 5 percent in Estonia. These strong effects reflect both the favorable <b>distributive</b> <b>properties</b> of unemployment benefit programs and small poverty gap of these countries. Gabe and Whittaker (2012) report similar findings for US during the last recession. They estimate that the UI benefits drew out of poverty over one quarter of unemployed who received benefits.|$|R

" The use of rhetoric in advertisements is universal just because of its strongly persuasive strengths. The use of rhetoric in a monolingual advertising context has been investigated by some researchers (Angela Goddard 1998; Phillips 2002; McQuarrie 1996; Leigh 1994; Lagerwerf 2005) while the contrast of rhetoric use in a bilingual/multilingual context has received relatively less attention (Villalobos 2004), and the comparative analysis {{regarding the use of}} repetition of sound, word and phrase is rarely seen. To probe into this issue with a corpus linguistics approach, based on the data from our ongoing project of a parallel corpus of English and Chinese advertisements in Singapore print media, this paper adopts McQuarrie and Mick's taxonomy (McQuarrie 1996) to investigate how different types of rhetorical figures are used in this corpus of advertisements.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the accounting, {{accountability and}} disciplinary practices {{triggered by the}} Ordinances of 1571 in the feudal State of Abruzzo, whose sovereign was Margaret of Austria, daughter of Emperor Charles V. In a scenario stimulated by the ascent of mercantilist discourse and police schemes, new 'technologies of government' were forged to optimize the State's collection of receipts and to minimize fraud, rendering public officers accountable and their activities visible and controllable 'at a distance'. Using the 'governmentality' framework, this paper analyses the Ordinances that disciplined {{the activities of the}} primary finance/accounting and police officers in Abruzzo. The paper complements and extends the previous literature by illustrating the wide array of accounting- and non-accounting-based disciplinary techniques enforced by the sovereign in order to shape, align and even seduce the behaviour of officers/functionaries working in the State apparatus, and the general population. The analysis goes beyond the existing literature by unveiling the implementation of the hitherto undisclosed disciplinary double system of gratification-punishment advocated by Foucault, that also involved the population in the 'State control of the mechanisms of discipline'. In a related vein, the accounting system applied displays representational, translational and <b>distributive</b> <b>properties,</b> along with novel incentive schemes. ...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Social Science, Environment and Community Program, 2007 The {{following}} is a comparative study of two villages at different points along a continuum of reliance on the subsistence and cash economies. Of specific interest are the cultural implications and distributional effects associated with this profound distinction. Are cash and subsistence economies compatible or mutually exclusive? Principles identified in social sustainability literature provide a foundation from which to examine this question. Primary data collected via a Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) provide insight regarding <b>distributive</b> <b>properties</b> associated with relative dependence on {{and access to the}} cash and subsistence sectors of the economy using simple statistical analysis and content analysis methods. Changing gender ideologies are analyzed using attitudes related to post-marital education (PME) as a proxy. The study found that communities with a greater reliance on the cash economy exhibit a higher degree of economic stratification than communities where the subsistence economy is the predominant method of securing livelihoods. In contrast, the degree of political power among genders in the monetary economy appears to be equalized. In addition, gender ideologies that inform the division of labor appear to be more malleable in communities with a higher reliance on the cash economy...|$|R
