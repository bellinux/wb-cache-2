40|$|Taiwan’s {{manufacturing}} capability {{is always the}} most internationally competitive. However, in recent years, {{because of the high}} labor and land costs in Taiwan, Taiwanese enterprises have been forced to move overseas such as Southeast Asia. When the Taiwanese enterprises invest in Southeast Asia, how to select an appropriate logistics service provider becomes a very important issue. Combining the Delphi method and analytical network process (ANP), a decision-making method was developed in this paper to help the <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> that need to evaluate and select the logistics service provider type. Results of this research showed the best logistics service type for <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> is the international logistics service provider type. In conclusion, this research proposed not only a solution for solving the interdependent logistics service provider selection problem, but also a useful reference in logistics service provider selection for <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> which plan to invest in Southeast Asia...|$|R

40|$|In {{this dynamic}} era, {{to keep up}} with the trends on the market, {{companies}} should be able to make innovations. The word “innovation” among <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> in people 2 ̆ 7 s minds is usually associated with technological aspects of the products. Meanwhile, there is also another aspect of innovation that, over these recent years, has been developed and has also brought significant impacts on the products, which is called Marketing Innovation. In this study, the product is Personal Electronic Products, which include smartphones, tablets, and Laptops that are produced by South Korea and Japan 2 ̆ 7 s <b>electronic</b> <b>companies.</b> The marketing innovation that is implemented by the South Korea and Japan 2 ̆ 7 s <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> is measured using five dimensions, which are: Product Design Innovation, Packaging Design Innovation, Product Price Innovation, Product Placement Innovation, and Product Promotion Innovation. The study tests empirically the instrument for multidimensionality, reliability & validity using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach. The instrument is further found to be reliable, and has convergent and discriminant validity. In order to examine the marketing innovation that is implemented on the personal electronic products of South Korea and Japan 2 ̆ 7 s <b>electronic</b> <b>companies,</b> the study used 250 samples of personal electronic product customers in the area of Bandung City. The result of the study found that the marketing innovation scale is an established measurement to examine the marketing innovation process. From the result, also it can be seen that the customers of South Korea 2 ̆ 7 s personal electronic products are more perceived with the marketing innovation dimensions that implemented by the South Korea 2 ̆ 7 s <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> on its personal electronic products...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The present {{research}} positions in financial terms the Spanish <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> in the European frame in 2011 - 2013 period. The technological progress is nowadays changing the management functioning {{and the performance}} of the <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> is decisive. So, knowing their position in the Spanish market and analysing their economic and financial situation in the last years is going to help us to build a strong vision of how they will confront the future challenges. Design/methodology: The data used in this investigation collects the economic and financial information of a sample composed by high-growth Spanish <b>electronic</b> <b>companies,</b> because the selection criteria is delimited in a minimum 2013 ROA growth of 3 % and a minimum 2011 - 2013 operating revenues growth of 6 %. An economic and financial analysis and a descriptive statistics analysis which includes regression models are the used tools to define conclusions and results. Findings: The study allows us to determine the economic and financial health of the companies that own the 97 % of the total sales in Spain. The research also defines the financial, gender and innovation variables that hardly influence the profitability of this industry and finally, establishes its harmony with the European perspective. Research limitations/implications: It should be convenient to widen the sample to another technological companies and to increase the period of time to the 2014 tax year, even though the information in not available in the used database SABI. Practical implications: The study allows us to evaluate the economic and financial performance of the <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> in the latest years in Spain and after that, to analyse {{if they are going to}} go for the future imminent challenges. Social implications: The results allow us to evaluate the financial and economic modifications that these companies need to practise to overcome the technological development inherent changes and their implications in the management world. Originality/value: It is going to be useful to the Spanish <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> to define their financial and economic model, which they should follow to not lose their competitive advantage because the technological disruption won’t stop in a near time frame of more transparent organizations...|$|R

Nowadays many countries have established environmental laws. Hence, companies {{are being asked to}} provide the eco-profiles of products. In order to assist <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> to execute the life cycle assessment (LCA) and construct the eco-profiles for applying the environmental product declarations (EPDs), this research applies the web service technology and the eco-spold XML data exchange standard to develop a LCA service platform (LCASP) to share the LCI (life cycle inventory) data among the members of the LCASP. For ensuring the consistency of the eco-profiles, the LCASP provides the <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> with the product category rules that explain which the information must be provided in the eco-profiles. In addition, the related domain experts review and verify the correctness of LCI data at the LCASP. In order to reduce the effort of LCI data gathering, the LCASP provides the LCI database and the search engine to let the <b>electronic</b> <b>companies</b> quickly find the LCI data of the specific common parts or components. Through the employing the LCASP, the cost and time of LCA for electronic products can be decreased significantly...|$|R
