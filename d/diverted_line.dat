50|$|In 1867, the MHE {{received}} {{a concession to}} build the Berlin-Lehrte railway (also known as the Lehrter Railway or Lehrter Bahn). A direct line already existed via Magdeburg, but the new route via Stendal was more direct and thus services would be quicker. The railway facilities in Stendal had to be rebuilt {{to make it easy}} for passengers to change trains. The Lehrter Railway runs south of the old town of Wittenberg from east to west, while the old line ran on {{the eastern edge of the}} town. The new Lehrter Railway has a connection with a relocated line from Wittenberge to the west of Stendal. This allowed two routes to share the new Stendal station. The <b>diverted</b> <b>line</b> to Wittenberge passes around the town along the north western boundary and then returns to its old route to the north. In addition to the Lehrter Railway, which opened through Stendal in 1871, the so-called America Line opened in 1873 from Stendal via Uelzen to Bremen.|$|E
40|$|M ls gene products, {{like those}} of the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC), stimulate strong primary mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) responses, and the precursor frequency of T cells reactive to Mls determinants appears to be as high as those to MHC antigens (1 - 3). Unlike MHC determinants, however, M ls determinants do not evoke cytotoxic T cell responses (4, 5) nor lethal graft-vs. -host disease (6, 7), fail to act as transplantation antigens (8, 9), and cannot be detected serologically (10, 11). In the case of the strongly stimulatory Mls a and Mls d gene products, these determinants do not show demonstrable polymorphism in our hands and {{do not appear to be}} recognized in an MHC-restricted fashion (12 - 14) (although others have reported differently [3]). Recently, we reported (14) that uncloned mouse spleen cell populations positively selected for reactivity to Mls determinants by repeated stimulation in bulk MLC cultures also show strong proliferative responses to any of five different MHC haplotypes tested. Further analysis showed that these lines of M Is, pan-H- 2 -reactive T cells could be diverted by subsequent repeated stimulation with cells of a particular H- 2 haplotype; this <b>diverted</b> <b>line</b> would lose its reactivity for other H- 2 haplotypes but would maintain responsiveness to the selecting MHC haplotype and also to stimulating cells bearing the original, priming Mls determinants. These findings suggested the possibility that individual T ceils may be capable of recognizing allogeneic gene products of both the MHC and the Mls locus. The present studies provide direct support for this possibility with the use of cloned lines of Mls- and H- 2 -reactive T cells...|$|E
50|$|Lift lines {{sometimes}} require diversion {{to avoid}} obstacles, support non-linear loads and battens, deal with excessive fleet angles, or be reoriented from the typical transverse path {{across the stage}} (e.g., for tab and light ladder line sets). Mule blocks are single or multi-line blocks able to divert the path of those lines. Mule blocks may be permanently installed as part of counterweight rigging systems, or used for spot rigging, where they are often equipped with swivel-pivots to <b>divert</b> <b>lines</b> across a large range of angles.|$|R

50|$|However, in November 1885 a major gold {{strike was}} {{reported}} at Belmore pastoral station, 145 km east of Normanton {{and by the}} end of 1886 the population of the Croydon field was 2,000, rising to 6,000 in the following year. Transportation was a major problem and access to this field became more important than the link to Cloncurry. It was decided to <b>divert</b> the <b>line</b> to Croydon.|$|R
5000|$|The planned Croxley Rail Link, {{currently}} under construction, will <b>divert</b> the Metropolitan <b>line's</b> [...] branch via the disused [...] branch to terminate at Watford Junction. It {{is expected to}} open to passenger service in 2018.|$|R

50|$|In the Second World War, Engers {{station and}} the related workshops, {{together}} with {{large parts of the}} Rhine line were badly damaged by Allied artillery bombardments in March 1945. The rail service was resumed in August of that year. However, the station increasingly lost its former importance in the postwar period. In 1954 most of the freight and passenger trains on the Right Rhine <b>line</b> <b>diverted</b> over the <b>line</b> to the newly rebuilt Urmitz railway bridge and the freight yard in Engers was abandoned in the 1970s. Finally, the station lost its importance as a junction in 1989 with the closure of the line to the Westerwald.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, the {{junction}} with the East Coast Main Trunk was relocated westward and the <b>line</b> <b>diverted</b> west of Owens Place. The diversion was to allow room for State Highway 2 to be widened and grade separated between Bayfair and Baypark.|$|R
50|$|The last regular {{passenger}} train ran on 10 February 1951. However, {{for eight weeks}} in early 1955 the Tay viaduct at Perth was closed at night for repairs, and night goods trains were <b>diverted</b> over the <b>line</b> during the work.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, {{the line}} is used {{primarily}} by long-distance north-south services, {{as well as some}} freight trains. Most freight trains have been <b>diverted</b> from the <b>line</b> by the opening of the North Doncaster Chord Project which was completed in June 2014.|$|R
50|$|On August 25, Carnival Cruise <b>Lines</b> <b>diverted</b> {{one of its}} {{ships from}} Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Mexico {{in order to avoid}} the storm.

5000|$|The station {{closed for}} {{passengers}} on 15 September 1958 (concurrently with the branch to Leamington Spa) and was demolished soon after. The fast {{lines of the}} West Coast Main Line pass through the site (the slow <b>lines</b> <b>divert</b> via [...] and [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The railway was popular, but faced difficulties. The car was slowed {{considerably}} at high tide, but Volk {{could never}} afford {{to improve the}} motors. In 1900, groynes built near the railway {{were found to have}} led to underwater scouring under the sleepers and the railway was closed for two months while this was repaired. Immediately afterward, the council decided to build a beach protection barrier, which unfortunately required Volk to <b>divert</b> his <b>line</b> around the barrier. Without funds to do so, Volk closed the railway.|$|R
5000|$|The line {{closed to}} regular {{passenger}} trains on 7 December 1953, but retained a healthy goods traffic {{and also the}} summer specials, but the specials ended and the through goods trains had been <b>diverted</b> onto other <b>lines</b> by 1962, {{when most of the}} line was closed.|$|R

During dinner, Aristide asks for the telephone in order to call his wife, but the waiter Pomerol, accustomed to these situations, <b>diverts</b> the <b>line</b> to Madeleine's dining room, {{so that she can}} answer, pretending to be at home. Deeply disappointed, Madeleine decides to succumb to Célestin. While José Pasodoble receives praise from the Savoy Hotel and reveals her true identity, Madeleine announces publicly to have betrayed her husband.|$|R
50|$|The Liverpool to Southport railway line {{provided}} {{a link to}} Liverpool Exchange railway station, serving the business sector of the city. The line was listed in Dr. Beeching's Report for closure in 1962, as requiring extra sets of trains for peak hour use only was costly. Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive recognised {{the needs of the}} line, and supported improvements to the service and stations, including <b>diverting</b> the <b>line</b> under the city centre (and so closing Liverpool Exchange, replaced by Moorfields railway station) and onward to Hunts Cross, and the line has survived.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2013, a {{landslide}} occurred on a spoil tip {{used by the}} colliery. The landslide displaced and blocked the main railway line (Barnsley to Barnetby, or Doncaster to Thorne Line, formerly the South Yorkshire Railway) north-east of Hatfield and Stainforth railway station. The closure affected rail services between Doncaster and Goole (to Hull) and Scunthorpe (to Cleethorpes). [...] The route is also a major freight line, with around 20% of UK rail freight using the section, and freight services had to be <b>diverted</b> over <b>lines</b> via Brigg and Lincoln.|$|R
50|$|The London Borough of Hillingdon {{announced}} in June 2011 {{that it would}} be lobbying Transport for London to have the Central <b>line</b> <b>diverted</b> from West Ruislip station to Uxbridge. Such a project would require a business case approved by TfL and the completion of signal upgrade work on the Metropolitan line.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the intercity service, 13 pairs of trains were <b>diverted</b> to this <b>line</b> from the preexisting Beijing-Shanghai (Jinghu) Railway, including trains from Beijing South to Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Tianjin West. With {{the opening of the}} Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway, these trains have been diverted to the new line.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{consistent}} patterns in U. S. military operations {{since the end of}} World War II has been our growing involvement in contingency operations around the world. Recognition of this significant role for our military forces has been reflected most recently in the establishment of several new commands-First Special Operations Command, USREDCOM, USCENTCOM-which exist in order to improve U. S. capability to respond to worldwide threats on short notice. Concomitantly, there is renewed interest in low-intensity conflict operations, and the Army is pursuing the development of light divisions especially designed for strategic mobility and rapid deployment. This CSI Research Survey by Lt. Col. Gary H. Wade, Rapid Deployment Logistics: Lebanon, 1958, reminds us that strategic power projection must be founded upon a responsive and synchronized logistical base. Indeed, failure to provide the "tail " during short-notice contingency operations will blunt or even doom to failure the sharp bite of the "teeth, " namely, the fighting forces. This detailed, comprehenisve study of the logistical planning and in-country support of the U. S. military intervention in Lebanon in 1958 is of imminent value to the U. S. Army today. Many of the issues faced by the logisticians in Beirut in 1958 are identical to those facing force developers of the light division today, such as the questions of <b>diverting</b> <b>line</b> soldiers to support duties...|$|R

50|$|Over the years, {{passenger}} services were, however, {{more and more}} rationalised. Instead of the long-distance trains, regular-interval regional services had already replaced long-distance services by the mid-1980s. Although long-distance trains have been <b>diverted</b> over the <b>line</b> because of reconstruction projects, this has become rarer {{as a result of}} the rationalisation of infrastructure.|$|R
