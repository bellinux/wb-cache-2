500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was no way I could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alibis by the bushel," [...] Fairfax laughed harshly. [...] "As for me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> show--every {{one knows}} that. I {{was never in}} the place at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|More {{work for}} the Row. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to beat [...] "The Giaour"--no {{difficult}} task for any one but the author. Yours truly, B.|$|R

5000|$|Meet {{all of my}} {{obligations}} to the Fraternity in a timely manner, so as to ensure that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> share and that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a burden to my brothers; ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to skim {{through this}} bright little volume {{when the bell}} rang. I crawled off the sofa and opened the door. A kind of darkish sort of respectful Johnnie stood without.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{business}} {{in my own}} way. And I suppose your present announcement," [...] Strether went on, [...] "isn't merely the result of your sense of what I've expected. Otherwise you wouldn't have put me in relation--" [...] But he paused, pulling up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think that}} I'm given to be afraid,' said Bagwax. 'The ocean, if I know myself, {{would have no}} terrors for me;--not if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty. But I should hear the ship's sides {{cracking}} with every blast if that secret were lodged within my breast.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Patta {{has responded}} to {{criticism}} of her reporting with statements such as [...] "that means <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> job well" [...] and [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> this {{because we have a}} true democracy".|$|R
6000|$|SMITH. I {{accept the}} apology to <b>my</b> cloth. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{duty as a}} priest. How can the Church {{have a right to}} make men fast if she does not allow them to feast? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>my</b> dear, don't you worry {{yourself}} about that. You have been wanting {{me for a}} very long time to give up business and go into the country. How would Fairclose suit you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Maitre Rene of Milan, the Queen-mother's perfume. He {{came with}} some plea of {{bringing}} a pouncet-box from her, but I wager {{it was as}} a spy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to walk him gently off, when the Queen's cry called me, and he must needs come in after me.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{feeling that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged {{me to be}} secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which {{it could not be}} in my power to satisfy." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{continued}} {{walking in}} this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>My</b> heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: ...|$|E
5000|$|Ultimately, her {{publications}} extolled {{the goals}} toward {{which she had}} been working for her entire life: [...] "I am a freethought missionary, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> 'level best' to drive superstition, alias Christianity, from the minds of mankind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious, my dear," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{appearing}} {{at the door}} of his dressing-room, with his face and head enveloped in the rough towel which he was violently using; [...] "how can you say so? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> very best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] John Thorndyke said gravely. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{duty to the}} village, {{and still}} more <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty to an old friend, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not likely ever to feel any regret that I have so acted. Now, Parson, let's be off." ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> {{best with}} the lump of liver, that tasted painfully of vatdoek and was gritty with sand. Indeed, when the vrouw's back was turned I managed {{to throw the}} most of it to Hans behind me, who {{swallowed}} it at a gulp as a dog does, since he did not wish to be caught chewing it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what the sherry said to the man when he was just going to drink it?" [...] inquired Fenn. [...] "It said, 'Nemo me impune lacessit'. That's how I feel. Kay {{went out of his way}} to give me a bad time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to run his house properly, so I don't see that I'm called upon to go out of my way to work for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought much}} of it when he bowed to me. I little fancied--but there was another odd coincidence--wasn't it? In general I never go into the drawing-room to company, because there are three older; but the day they came to speak to papa about the fishing, mamma and all the elder ones {{were out of the}} way, except Matilda. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> Roman history with her, when papa came in and said, we must both come into the drawing-room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, if possible. His {{heart is}} set upon it, {{though he does}} not realize his condition, and I cannot bear to tell him. Only the utmost care can save him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best for him, but my nursing is as left-handed as my writing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your {{daughter}} {{is the best}} girl I ever met,' said Mrs. Brown-Smith. 'The best tempered, the least suspicious, the most loyal. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> worst to make her hate me. Oh, I can't go on!' Here Mrs. Brown-Smith very greatly surprised her hostess by bursting into tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are certain}} evidences," [...] Quest remarked, {{with his eyes}} upon the black box, [...] "which seem to point to a new arrival in the {{criminal}} world of New York. More than that I cannot tell you. I will simply ask {{you to believe that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} I {{must be at}} bottom, what a cheerful Indian critic has dubbed me, 'a faddling hedonist,' for this {{description}} of the brother's motives gave me somewhat of a shock. I should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake, and not for ulterior purposes; and this shows how profoundly I was out of sympathy with these good Trappists, even when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to sympathise. But to the cure the argument seemed decisive.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She has {{not invited}} me!... Mr. Somerset, not {{withstanding}} your erroneous opinions on important matters, I {{speak to you}} as a friend, and I tell you that she has never in her secret heart forgiven that sermon of mine, in which I likened her to the church at Laodicea. I admit the words were harsh, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty, and if the case arose to-morrow I would do it again. Her displeasure is a deep grief to me; but I serve One greater than she.... You, of course, are invited to this dinner?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody saw it. It was {{a matter}} of course," [...] said Lucy, {{destroying}} her ladyship's wisdom at a blow. [...] "Well; I did learn to love him, not meaning to do so; and I do love him with all my heart. It is no use my striving to think that I do not; and I could stand with him at the altar to-morrow and give him my hand, feeling that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty by him, as a woman should do. And now he has told you of his love, and I believe in that as I do in my own--" [...] And then for a moment she paused.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to feel better, {{and hope}} to go out this {{afternoon}} the first for several! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> exceedingly with you all over Philip's transfer to France. We are with each other now as not yet before over everything and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> yours and your wife's more than ever, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your suspicions {{begin to}} annoy me, Rolles," [...] said the older man. [...] "I tell you <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> utmost; a man cannot lay {{his hand on}} {{millions}} in a moment. Have I not taken you up, a mere stranger, out of pure good-will? Are you not living largely on my bounty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is my busy day," [...] {{said the}} giantess to Fiddlecumdoo, [...] "and I fear <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> able to {{entertain}} {{you in a}} proper manner, for I must hasten to the laundry to wash the clothes. However, if you care to accompany me, we may converse together while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] Ughtred answered. [...] "I {{may not be}} a {{model of}} etiquette, but I should never dream of soliciting, of {{welcoming}} an interview from even so old a friend as the Countess of Reist under such circumstances. Well, in the midst of our conversation, which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to curtail, her brother arrived unexpectedly from Solika and found us together. He chose to consider her presence in my room compromising, and demanded that I should marry her. After that--chaos. As I told you, Reist has given up his command and deserted me. I believe that I have promised to fight him after the war is over." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{made some}} desperate schemes to grow {{suddenly}} rich and powerful, and I learnt {{for the first}} time my true economic value. Already my father and I had been discussing my prospects in life and he had been finding me vague and difficult. I was full of large political intentions, but so far I had made no definite plans for a living that would render my political ambitions possible. It was becoming apparent to me that for a poor man in England, the only possible route to political distinction is the bar, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to reconcile myself to the years of waiting and practice that would have to precede my political début.|$|E
60|$|As for me I {{felt that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty, {{and a good}} work. But the {{responsibility}} was heavy, and my road {{was not at all}} clear before me. My principal source of anxiety was in regard to my wife. Should I tell her the truth about my new copyist, or not? In the course of a night I resolved this question and determined to tell her everything. When the man was merely Mr. Corbridge's subject the case was different; but to have daily in my office a clerk who had been drowned one hundred and two years before, and not tell Mrs. Colesworthy of it would be an injustice to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{anything}} else to do. I don't ask you whether you are guilty or not, and I do ask myself whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> duty in giving you any advice calculated to defeat the ends of justice. I simply consider the facts, and tell you what I should <b>do</b> if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in your unfortunate position. I should bolt." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> what maximum <b>I</b> can do here {{to please}} my husband. But {{when my husband}} quarrels with me on some issue, he always says: “It would have <b>been</b> better if <b>I</b> had come here alone. It was my fault that I decided to bring you here.” And when I hear such things from his mouth, I feel very bad and humiliated.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{pleasant}} meal, and the old friends chatted of their schooldays and boyish pastimes, no allusion being made {{to the events of}} the day, save that Herbert said, [...] "I suppose that you know that my father is now a captain in the force of the Commons, and that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>my</b> best to keep his business going during his absence." ...|$|R
