We {{discussed}} Wilber lower bounds for BSTs for a particular access sequence, and developed Tango trees which achieve O(lg lg n) -compatitiveness. This is a very promising result that gives hope for existence of a dynamically optimal tree. In this lecture we discuss dynamic trees that have many applications such as to Network Flow and Dynamic Connectivity problems in addition to them being interesting theoretically. We will discuss one data structure called Link-Cut trees that achieves logarithmic amortized time for all operations. 2 Dynamic Trees The dynamic tree problem we will discuss today is to represent a forest of rooted trees whose each node has an unordered set of children of arbitrary size. The data structure has to support the following operations: • MAKE TREE() – Returns a new vertex in a singleton tree. This operation allows us to add elements and later manipulate them. • CUT(v) – Deletes the edge between vertex v and its parent, parent(v). • JOIN(v,w) – Makes vertex v a new child of vertex w, i. e. adds an edge (v, w). <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>fo...</b>|$|E

Secondly, we present a monadic second order (MSO) logic to minimum graph modification problems, minimum dominating set problem and minimum coloring problem and their variants. As a consequence, it follows that these problems have linear-time algorithms on bounded tree-width graphs. In particular, we show the existance of linear-time algorithms on bounded tree-width graphs for star coloring, cd-coloring, rainbow coloring, equitable coloring, total dominating set, connected dominating set.

Our simulation study show that a noise-like random variation in the key parameter of the unified chaotic system along with a gradual decrease in the commensurate FO is capable of suppressing the chaotic fluctuations much earlier than that with the fixed parameter one. The chaotic time series produced by such random parameter switching in nonlinear dynamical systems have been characterized using the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and Shannon entropy. The effect of choosing different simulation techniques for random parameter FO switched chaotic systems have also been explored through two frequency domain and three time domain methods.

We develop a framework for model generation in this logic, present an algorithm and prove its correctness. As FO(ID) is an integration of classical logic and logic programming, our algorithm integrates techniques from SAT and ASP. We report on a prototype system, called MidL, experimentally validating our approach. 1 Introduction The logic FO(ID), or Inductive Definition Logic (ID-logic) [7], extends classicalfirst <b>order</b> logic (<b>FO)</b> with a language primitive that allows a uniform representation of inductive definitions. In general, inductive definitions cannot berepresented <b>in</b> first <b>order</b> logic (<b>FO).</b> The semantics of this primitive {{is based on the}} well-founded semantics of logic programming [28]; indeed, as argued in [6, 8], it correctly formalizes the semantics of inductive definitions. While definitions are common in mathematics, they are also crucial in declar-ative Knowledge Representation. Not only non-inductive definitions are frequent in common-sense reasoning as argued in the seminal paper [2], also inductive def-initions are. In [10], the situation calculus is given a very natural and general representation as an iterated inductive definition in the well-ordered set of situa-tions and [16] observes that inductive definitions are present in many applications of Answer Set Programming (ASP) [12].

40|$|The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas {{has become}} an impOliant {{aquaculture}} species in New Zealand. As a consequence, increasing use {{has been made of}} sheltered coastal waters for oyster culture. A carrying capacity model is required to quantify how these developments may affect ecosystem processes in a dynamically varying environment, and for the management of the oyster farming industry. An important component of carrying capacity modelling is the development of an energetic model, which is used for quantitative estimates of oyster growth and condition. In this study, a preliminary dynamic energy budget (DEB) model was developed based on published information relating to energy acquisition and expenditure of C. gigas. This model was used to simulate growth and condition of the oyster in response to varying environmental conditions (Chapter 2).

The premature deterioration of the longitudinal joint occurs {{in the form of}} cracking and/or raveling. The distresses are caused by relatively low density and surface irregularity at the joints. A study on longitudinal joints on asphalt airfield pavements, funded by the Airfield Asphalt Pavement Technology Program (AAPTP) is currently underway. The scope of work consists of literature review, survey of users, recommendations of changes in specifications {{and the development of a}} manual on best practice. It is preferable to produce hot longitudinal joints by operating two or more pavers in echelon.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that Martian magmas had wide range of oxygen fugacities (fO 2) and that this {{variation}} is correlated with the variation of La/Yb ratio and isotopic characteristics of the Martian basalts, shergottite meteorites. The origin of this correlation must have important information about mantle sources and Martian evolution. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> to understand this correlation, it is necessary to know accurate value of oxidation state of other Martian meteorite groups. Nakhlites, cumulate clinopyroxenites, are another major group of Martian meteorites and have distinctly different trace element and isotopic characteristics from shergottites. Thus, estimates of oxidation state of nakhlites will give us important insight into the mantle source in general. Several workers have estimated oxidation state of nakhlites by using Fe-Ti oxide equilibrium. However, Fe-Ti oxides may not record the oxidation state of the parent melt of the nakhlite because it is a late-stage mineral. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive study which analyzed all nakhlite samples at the same time. Therefore, in this study (1) we reduced the uncertainty of the estimate using the same electron microprobe and the same standards under the same condition for Fe-Ti oxide in 6 nakhlites and (2) we also performed crystallization experiments to measure partition coefficients of Eu into pyroxene in the nakhlite system <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to estimate <b>fO</b> 2 when the pyroxene core formed (i. e.

40|$|Abstract: In Balearic Catalan, {{first person}} {{singular}} present indicative verb forms {{do not show}} an explicit inflectional morph, as do most dialects of Catalan. Among these forms, we find final consonant clusters that involve {{a violation of the}} sonority constraint according to which the degree of sonority between the segments of a syllable must be decreasing in relation to the nucleus. The same clusters in nominal inflection are resolved by means of a process of vowel epenthesis. The exceptional phonological behavior of these consonant clusters is not circumscribed to sonority factors, but also concerns the regular phonology of the dialect, either because a general process fails to apply, or because a process applies though the con-ditions that make it applicable are not visible. Previous approaches have analyzed these final consonant clusters, not as codas, but as onsets of empty nuclei: this exceptional syllabic status would, according to these proposals, throw some light on this peculiar phonological be-havior. In this paper we investigate the theoretical problems deriving from approaches of this kind and demonstrate that they are better analyzed by considering paradigmatic effects, such as uniformity and contrast between the members of a morphological paradigm. Furthermore, we critically review the different theories developed in Optimality Theory <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to account <b>fo...</b>|$|R

Varying contributions of pressure (i. e., osmotic versus hydraulic) to the overall driving force were realized in forward osmosis (FO), pressure-assisted FO (PFO), and reverse osmosis (RO) experiments, while the same total driving force for water permeation was applied.

40|$|The {{fractional}} calculus is a {{generalization of}} classical integer-order integration and derivation to fractional (non-integer) order operators. Fractional <b>order</b> (<b>FO)</b> models are those models which contain such fractional order operators. A common representation {{of these models}} is in frequency domain, due to its simplicity. The dynamical systems whose model can be approximated in a natural way using FO terms, exhibit specific features, such as viscoelasticity, diffusion and a fractal structure; hence the respiratory system is an ideal application for FO models. Although viscoelastic and diffusive properties were intensively investigated in the respiratory system, the fractal structure was ignored. Probably {{one of the reasons}} is that the respiratory system does not pose a perfect symmetry, hence failing to satisfy one of the conditions for being a typical fractal structure. In the 70 s, the respiratory impedance determined by the ratio of air-pressure and air-flow, has been introduced in a model structure containing a FO term. It has also been shown that the fractional order models outperform integer-order models on input impedance measurements. However, there was a lack of underpinning theory to clarify the appearance of the fractional <b>order</b> <b>in</b> the <b>FO</b> model structure. The thesis describes a physiologically consistent approach to reach twofold objectives: 1. to provide a physiologically-based mathematical explanation for the necessity of fractional order models for the input impedance, and 2. to determine the capability of the best fractional order model to classify between healthy and pathological cases. Rather than dealing with a specific case study, the modelling approach presents a general method which can be used not only in the respiratory system application, but also in other similar systems (e. g. leaves, circulatory system, liver, intestines). Furthermore, we consider also the case when symmetry is not present (e. g. deformations in the thorax - kyphoscoliose) as well as various pathologies.
