500|$|A new costume was {{required}} for Ryan once Seven had the majority of her Borg implants removed. She wore a new silver jumpsuit for the following several episodes. During the filming of the episode [...] "Day of Honor", [...] director Jesús Salvador Treviño criticized the outfit, saying that [...] "almost any camera angle inevitably winds up emphasizing her sexuality." [...] Ryan described the new costume as [...] "a little snug"; she wore a corset-like device which gave her the appearance of mechanical ribs. Treviño praised Ryan's third costume, which replaced the silver jumpsuit, noting how it reduced her sexual characteristics: [...] "It is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then you <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning {{not only to the}} audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about".|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, the Russos {{stated that}} the film would be set [...] "a couple years" [...] after The Winter Soldier, and would {{continue}} to focus on Steve Rogers' relationship with Bucky Barnes as well as the political themes related to Captain America. Anthony stated, [...] "The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> nature." [...] The Russos also said that they would be [...] "bringing some new elements to the table that will give us a twist on Winter Soldier", and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as [...] "ecstatic" [...] with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also {{stated that the}} film's title would be announced [...] "in a month or so at most", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it [...] "for a while". In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another [...] "big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way" [...] similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier. The rest of the film, such as the characters, story, and tone, would be left open to the Russos' and writers' interpretations.|$|E
500|$|Due to the band's lack of {{creative}} {{control on the}} first album, Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of the Cure's second album Seventeen Seconds, which he co-produced with Mike Hedges. The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts. A single from the album, [...] "A Forest", became the band's first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart. The album was {{a departure from the}} Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as [...] "morose, atmospheric, very different to Three Imaginary Boys." [...] In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said, [...] "For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time." [...] At the same time, Smith was pressed concerning the concept of an alleged [...] "anti-image". Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be [...] "elaborately disguising their plainness", stating, [...] "We had to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand." [...] That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don't Cry, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, [...] "I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music—the sort of thing that didn't interest me at all." ...|$|E

50|$|Even {{though it}} would be great to hear many nice words about it but <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that,</b> I thought that I should do {{something}} that I have never done before, and it attracted many people's attention on it... Even then, I think they will say 'What's this?' when they see the photo. Besides cursing over the photo, I am thankful simply that they found and saw the photo.|$|R
60|$|And the Frenchman? D'Arnot? What of him? He {{could get}} along as Tarzan had. Tarzan {{did not want}} to see him more. He wanted to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{everything}} <b>that</b> might remind him of Jane.|$|R
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
2500|$|Coupland {{describes}} his upbringing as producing a [...] "blank slate". [...] "My mother {{comes from a}} sour-faced family of preachers who from the 19th century to well into the 20th scoured the prairies thumping Bibles. Her parents tried to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> but unwittingly transmitted their values to my mother. My father's family weren't that different." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996 the Omaha {{public schools}} ended court-ordered busing. That same year the Omaha World-Herald {{reported}} that, [...] "One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that {{he finds the}} prospect of being incorporated into the city 'increasingly scary.' 'I left Benson because I didn't like the changes,' he said. 'Too much crime, too much racial tension, too much school busing. I went to the suburbs to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that,</b> and now I'm being forced back in.' The man, an insurance company employee, denied that his problems were based on race, but he asked that this part of the interview be anonymous." ...|$|E

2500|$|Treviño {{praised the}} {{subsequent}} changes to her costume {{in order to}} reduce its sexuality, saying that [...] "it is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then you <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning not only to the audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about." [...] The later versions of her costumes still required 20 minutes to get into before filming could start, but Ryan said they were much more forgiving, [...] "In the silver costume, if I got goosebumps, you could see them. The brown costume is a thicker, stronger fabric. It's not quite so clingy, so the waist doesn't have to be cinched in." [...] That version of the costume also removed the vertical bones of the corset, which allowed Ryan to have greater flexibility while wearing it.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, Paar {{worked in}} radio as a fill-in on The Breakfast Club show and {{appeared}} as a panelist on The $64 Question. He got his big break when Jack Benny, who had been impressed by Paar's U.S.O. performances, suggested that Paar serve as his 1947 summer replacement. Paar was enough of a hit on Benny's show that Benny's sponsor, the American Tobacco Company, decided to keep him on the air, moving him to ABC for the fall season. Paar later refused American Tobacco's suggestion that he {{come up with a}} weekly running gag or gimmick, saying he [...] "wanted to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> kind of old-hat comedy," [...] the kind being practiced by Benny and Fred Allen." [...] The show was then terminated, earning Paar the enduring image of [...] "a spoiled kid." [...] A profile of Paar by the Museum of Broadcast Communications suggests that Paar later [...] Benny's mannerisms.|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{the quickest}} dodge for <b>getting</b> him <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> tray," [...] he explained. [...] "My throat was so dry that I didn't know if I could shout loud enough. And {{this was not}} a case for shouting, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{perhaps it}} is preferable. Personally I only liked one of our English seaside resorts once, and that was for a week, when Edward Skinner was up before the magistrate, charged with what {{was known as the}} 'Brighton Outrage.' I don't know if you {{remember}} the memorable day in Brighton, memorable for that elegant town, which deals more in amusements than mysteries, when Mr. Francis Morton, one of its most noted residents, disappeared. Yes! disappeared as completely as any vanishing lady in a music-hall. He was wealthy, had a fine house, servants, a wife and children, and he disappeared.

Hungarians are Hungarians, and Jews are Jews, and there's no <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that.</b> They are different to us, somehow. I can't say how, but they are different. They don't speak as we do, they don't think as we do, their Sunday is Saturday, and their New Year's day is in September. Jewesses can't dance the csárdás and Jews have a contempt for our gipsy music and our songs. They are Jews and we are Hungarians. It is altogether different." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{suggested}} {{during the}} 1923 season that Steger [...] "has even outshone, the great Kipke." [...] An NEA news service profile in late October 1923 praised Steger's diverse talents:"Steger, today, ranks {{as one of}} the best gridders Yost has had in seasons. Captain Harry Kipke not excepted. Fleet of foot, a good forward passer, splendid punter, and an expert field goal kicker, the former Oak Park lad is a triple threat artist de luxe. There is no <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that.</b> He also is as good a bet as the Wolverines boast on the receiving end of a pass, having the uncanny ability to grab 'em out of the air on almost impossible chances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. To begin with, whoever {{else might}} benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp's death, {{her husband would}} benefit the most. There was no <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>that.</b> When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no idea {{as to how the}} crime had been committed, but from what I knew of Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find {{anything}} to connect him with it. When I arrived at the chateau, I realized at once that it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the way, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer." ...|$|R

2500|$|On January 1, 2014, Lovie Smith {{was hired}} as the new {{head coach of the}} Buccaneers, {{replacing}} Greg Schiano.

During his first news conference with the Bucs, Smith talked about restoring the quality of the team from the late 1990s and early 2000s: [...] "There was a certain brand of football you expected from us", Smith said. [...] "You know we would be relentless. There was a brand of football <b>that</b> you got <b>from</b> us each week at Raymond James Stadium. It was hard for opponents to come in and win.
