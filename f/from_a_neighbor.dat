5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E

The messages establish relationships between neighboring devices (called adjacencies) and communicate key parameters about how OSPF is {{to be used in the}} autonomous system or area. During normal operation, routers send hello messages to their neighbors at regular intervals (the hello interval); if a router stops receiving hello messages <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> after a set period (the dead interval) the router will assume the neighbor has gone down.|$|E

25|$|Posing as {{an elderly}} woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby {{retirement}} home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over who is who, and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer {{in order to use}} her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.|$|E
500|$|On October 24, {{during the}} early morning, Farrar {{received}} a phone call at his apartment <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> who shouted that his house—meaning the Farrar–Green family home in Prairie Village—was on fire. Farrar immediately drove there. A 9-1-1 call placed from the house at 12:20a.m. alerted police dispatchers to possible trouble, though the caller did not speak before hanging up. A police cruiser found the house on fire. Fire trucks were dispatched at 12:27 to what was classed as a [...] "two-alarm" [...] fire. The first firefighters on the scene reported that Green and her ten-year-old daughter Kate were safely outside the house by the time they had arrived. Both were in their nightclothes. Kate begged firefighters to help her brother and sister, six-year-old Kelly and thirteen-year-old Timothy, who were still inside. Green stood next to her daughter, and was reported to have been [...] "very calm, very cool". At least two firefighters attempted to search inside the home for the missing children, but the building was so consumed by flames that they could only access {{a small portion of the}} ground level before the structure became unsafe.|$|E

2500|$|Another legend relates {{a miracle}} Hanina was once {{prevented}} from partaking of untithed food. One eve of Sabbath {{he sat down}} to his frugal meal, when suddenly the table receded from him. After thinking a while he recollected that he had borrowed some spices <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> {{and that he had}} not separated the required tithe (see Ḥaber). He thereupon adjusted the matter, and the table returned to him (Yerushalmi Demai, i. 22a). The legend also states that Hanina's donkey would not eat untithed food. Thieves had stolen the animal and confined it in their yard, furnishing it with the necessary provender; but the donkey would neither eat nor drink. As this continued for several days, the thieves concluded to free the animal, lest it starve to death and render their premises noisome. On its release it went straight home, none the worse for its long fast (Avot of Rabbi Natan, viii. 8 cf Yerushalmi Demai, i. 21d; Shabbat, 112b).|$|E
2500|$|Blake's musical {{training}} {{began when}} he was {{four or five years}} old. While out shopping with his mother, he wandered into a music store, climbed on the bench of an organ, and started [...] "foolin’ around". When his mother found him, the store manager said to her, [...] "The child is a genius! It would be criminal to deprive him of the chance to make use of such a sublime, God-given talent." [...] The Blakes purchased a pump organ for US$75.00, making payments of 25 cents a week. When Blake was seven, he received music lessons <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor,</b> Margaret Marshall, an organist for the Methodist church. At age fifteen, without his parents' knowledge, he began playing piano at Aggie Shelton's Baltimore bordello. Blake got his first big break in the music business in 1907, when the world champion boxer Joe Gans hired him to play the piano at Gans's Goldfield Hotel, the first [...] "black and tan club" [...] in Baltimore.|$|E

2500|$|Prince {{was caught}} in February 1991 after he tried to break into a Scripps Ranch house. A woman, whom he had {{followed}} home from the Miramar Road health club, {{was getting ready to}} shower when she heard a noise at the front door. She ran from the house and sought help <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> who came and confronted Prince. Prince claimed he was trying to find a female friend who had entered the woman's home but eventually gave up and scuttled away. The eyewitnesses took down Prince's license plate number and identified Prince from photographs, and he was arrested on [...] {{in the parking lot of}} a health club after police alerted health club workers to be on the lookout for Prince's automobile. After his arrest, he agreed to provide blood and saliva samples, and the DNA results connected him to the murder of Janene Weinhold. That murder connected him to the others by the pattern presented by the murders.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a life of}} {{training}} as a fighting dog, if a dog does not suffer its death while in such service, it is often euthanized. In Richmond, Virginia, when a dog fighter was sentenced in June 2007, it was revealed in court that over a dozen of his dogs had to be euthanized, either because of serious illness, injury or malnutrition, or because their training as fighting dogs made them too dangerous for adoption. Until 2006, the man had kept 16 pit bulls in the backyard of his house, confined with heavy chains used for automobile towing. Experts say chaining the animals is a dogfighting technique for building strength. [...] When an animal control officer arrived {{in response to a}} complaint <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor</b> that one of the dogs had died, he found the dead dog in a trash can. The others had no food, no clean water and no adequate shelter. Jody Jones, program manager of Richmond Animal Care and Control, said in court that the case produced more dogs euthanized than any other case she knows of from her 15-year career in animal control.|$|E
2500|$|Yad Sarah {{started in}} the 1970s as a gemach (free-loan service) {{in the home of}} Rabbi Uri Lupolianski, who later served as mayor of Jerusalem from 2003 to 2008. At that time, Lupolianski was a high school teacher with a young family and one of his {{children}} needed a vaporizer during the winter, so his wife borrowed one <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>neighbor.</b> Upon hearing that such short-term-use items were hard to obtain, Lupolianski decided to start his own gemach by buying a few vaporizers to lend to others. People who heard about his gemach began dropping off other items which are also used for a short time, such as crutches, walkers and wheelchairs. With seed money from his father, Yaakov Lupolianski, and guidance from Kalman Mann, director general of Hadassah Medical Center, Lupolianski incorporated his gemach into a nationwide non-profit in 1976. Lupolianski named the organization Yad Sarah (Hebrew for [...] "Memorial to Sarah") in memory of his grandmother, Sarah, who had died in the Holocaust. Yad Sarah raises 92% of its operating budget from donations. The organization does not receive any government assistance. Yad Sarah has helped establish equipment-lending centers and repair workshops in Angola, Cameroon, El Salvador, Russia, South Africa, and Jordan.|$|E

He could imagine the patient drudgery and careful frugality which had enabled them to buy their shares.|$|E
