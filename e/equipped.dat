40|$|In a {{quasi-experimental}} pre/posttest-treatment {{design the}} effect of the cognitive behavioral program <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions was investigated among high school youth with a mental retardation. Furthermore, it was investigated whether program integrity and IQ moderate {{the effect of}} <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions and which main category of program integrity explains the effect the best. The sample consisted of an experimental group (n = 81) that participated in <b>EQUIP</b> and a control group (n = 35) that did not receive <b>EQUIP.</b> In the first grade, <b>EQUIP</b> was found to {{have an effect on the}} reduction of cognitive distortions (minimizing/mislabeling and assuming the worst).

Program integrity moderated the effect of <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions (blaming others, minimizing/mislabeling and assuming the worst) in the first grade. None of the main categories of program integrity explained the effect of <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions. Finally, IQ did not moderate the effect of <b>EQUIP</b> on cognitive distortions. The positive effect in the first grade may be attributed to the variant that has been offered: ‘EQUIP for Educators’. Follow-up study must concentrate on the difference between the <b>EQUIP</b> variants in the Netherlands and the effect of <b>EQUIP</b> among youth with a low IQ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aims at {{improving}} the construction workshop <b>equipping</b> process and identifies, studies and prioritizes the main experimental and practical parameters that are desired and appropriate for <b>equipping</b> workshop. According to definition, workshop <b>equipping</b> means designing {{and management of}} workshop site and specifying resources which includes machineries and equipment, consuming materials and the used workforce. In this regard, two multiple-criteria decision analysis methods (MCDM) have been used that are analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytical network project ANP for prioritization of effective parameters on <b>equipping</b> the workshop. Thus, using these methods and respecting the regulations on planning, the workshop <b>equipping</b> based on the least time and the least cost with the highest yield will be achieved. According to this study, the main determining factor is to <b>equip</b> the project planning workshop...|$|R
