Western art had been, from the Renaissance up {{to the middle of the}} 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.|$|E

500|$|In mid- to late-19th-century Russia, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and a {{group of}} composers known as The Five had differing {{opinions}} as to whether [...] should be composed following Western or native practices. Tchaikovsky wanted to write professional compositions of such quality that they would stand up to Western scrutiny and thus transcend national barriers, yet remain distinctively Russian in melody, rhythm and other compositional characteristics. The Five, made up of composers Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, sought to produce a specifically Russian <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> music, rather than one that imitated older European music or relied on European-style conservatory training. While Tchaikovsky himself used folk songs in some of his works, for the most part he tried to follow Western practices of composition, especially in terms of tonality and tonal progression. Also, unlike Tchaikovsky, none of The Five were academically trained in composition; in fact, their leader, Balakirev, considered academicism a threat to musical imagination. Along with critic Vladimir Stasov, who supported The Five, Balakirev attacked relentlessly both the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which Tchaikovsky had graduated, and its founder Anton Rubinstein, orally and in print.|$|E

500|$|While Christian theologians {{held that}} the natural world {{was part of an}} unchanging {{designed}} hierarchy, some theologians speculated that the world might have developed through natural processes. Thomas Aquinas went even farther than Augustine of Hippo in arguing that scriptural texts like Genesis should not be interpreted in a literal way that conflicted with or constrained what natural philosophers learned about the workings of the natural world. He saw that the autonomy of nature was a sign of God's goodness, and detected no conflict between a divinely created universe and the idea that the universe had developed over time through natural mechanisms. However, Aquinas disputed the views of those (like the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles) who held that such natural processes showed that the universe could have developed without an underlying purpose. Aquinas rather held that: [...] "Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to {{take the form of a}} ship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589), {{painting}} {{had become an}} art of high sophistication that {{was associated with the}} gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song Dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. They created a new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> based upon the three perfections in which they used their skills in calligraphy (the art of beautiful writing) to make ink paintings. [...] From their time onward, many painters strove to freely express their feelings and to capture the inner spirit of their subject instead of describing its outward appearance. [...] The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.|$|E

And the siege of Uxellodunum in 51 BC. These are all sieges of large Gallic oppida. Of the sites involved in Caesar's civil war, we find the Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, the Battle of Dyrrhachium of 48 BC (modern Albania), the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC (Hellas – Greece), the Battle of Zela of 47 BC (modern Turkey) and the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC in Caesar's African campaign.

2500|$|However, Vertov's two credos, {{often used}} interchangeably, {{are in fact}} distinct, as Yuri Tsivian points out in the {{commentary}} track on the DVD for Man with the Movie Camera: for Vertov, [...] "life as it is" [...] means to record life {{as it would be}} without the camera present. [...] "Life caught unawares" [...] means to record life when surprised, and perhaps provoked, by the presence of a camera. This explanation contradicts the common assumption that for Vertov [...] "life caught unawares" [...] meant [...] "life caught unaware of the camera." [...] All of these shots might conform to Vertov's credo [...] "caught unawares." [...] His slow motion, fast motion, and other camera techniques were a way to dissect the image, Mikhail Kaufman stated in an interview. It was to be the honest truth of perception. For example, in Man with a Movie Camera, two trains are shown almost melting into each other, although we are taught to see trains as not riding that close, Vertov tried to portray the actual sight of two passing trains. Mikhail spoke about Eisenstein's films as being different from his and his brother's in that Eisenstein, [...] "came from the theatre, in the theatre one directs dramas, one strings beads." [...] "We all felt...that through documentary film we could develop a new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> Not only documentary art, or the art of chronicle, but rather an art based on images, the creation of an image-oriented journalism" [...] Mikhail explained. More than even film truth, Man with a Movie Camera, {{was supposed to be a}} way to make those in the Soviet Union more efficient in their actions. He slowed down his actions, such as the decision whether to jump or not, you can see the decision in his face, a psychological dissection for the audience. He wanted a peace between the actions of man and the actions of a machine, for them to be, in a sense, one.|$|E
