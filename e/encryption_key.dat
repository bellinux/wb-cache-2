5|$|The flag {{inspired}} Jeff Thompson, {{assistant professor}} and program director of Visual Art and Technology at the Stevens Institute of Technology, {{to create a}} sound file of the AACS <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> as a melody. After a similar <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> was cracked for the PlayStation 3 gaming system, a new flag was created by a different user {{as a tribute to}} Marcotte's original flag.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after it}} was first published, bloggers publicized the Free Speech Flag across {{multiple}} websites, increasing its popularity and disseminating the forbidden code within the flag. The flag entered popular culture as Internet users chose creative ways to spread knowledge of the HD DVD <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Free Speech Flag is {{a symbol}} of {{personal}} liberty used to promote freedom of speech. Designed by artist John Marcotte, the flag and its colors correspond to a cryptographic key which enabled users to copy HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. It was created on May 1, 2007, during the AACS <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> controversy.|$|E
50|$|Operating system kernel patches such as TRESOR and Loop-Amnesia {{modify the}} {{operating}} system so that CPU registers {{can be used to}} store <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> and avoid holding <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> in RAM. While this approach is not general purpose and does not protect all data in use, it does protect against cold boot attacks. <b>Encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are held inside the CPU rather than in RAM so that data at rest <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are protected against attacks that might compromise <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> in memory.|$|R
30|$|Subsequently, the {{encrypted}} images {{ranked by}} the distances to the query image are {{returned to the}} users for decrypting and other purposes. It should be {{important to note that}} the users may use different <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> to encrypt query image but require the <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> shared by the content owner to decrypt them. Here, assume that the <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are shared through a secure channel.|$|R
50|$|On 16 April 2007, the AACS {{consortium}} {{announced that}} it had expired certain <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> used by PC-based applications. Patches were available for WinDVD and PowerDVD which used new and uncompromised <b>encryption</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because the <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> {{may be used}} as part of {{circumvention}} technology {{forbidden by}} the DMCA, its possession and distribution has been viewed as illegal by the AACS, as well as by some legal professionals. Since it is a 128-bit numerical value, it was dubbed an illegal number. Opponents to the expansion of the scope of copyright criticize the idea of making a particular number illegal.|$|E
5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in another way. They simply zeroize and generate a new random <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the drive back to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|On December 26, 2006, {{a person}} using the alias muslix64 {{published}} a utility named BackupHDDVD and its source code on the DVD decryption forum at the website Doom9. BackupHDDVD {{can be used}} to decrypt AACS protected content once one knows the <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b> muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing HD DVDs using a software player, and that finding them is not difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Identical {{cryptographic}} {{keys are}} used for message authentication and encryption. (In SSL 3.0, MAC secrets may be larger than <b>encryption</b> <b>keys,</b> so messages can remain tamper resistant even if <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are broken.) ...|$|R
50|$|According to Telegram, secret chats have {{supported}} perfect forward secrecy since December 2014. <b>Encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are periodically changed after a key {{has been used}} more than 100 times or has been in use {{for more than a}} week. Old <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are destroyed.|$|R

5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to decrypt files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware decryption tools can help decrypt files encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E
25|$|The server usually then sends {{back its}} {{identification}} {{in the form}} of a digital certificate. The certificate contains the server name, the trusted certificate authority (CA) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate, and the server's public <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
50|$|TRESOR is a {{software}} approach {{that seeks to}} resolve this insecurity by storing and manipulating <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> almost exclusively on the CPU alone, and in registers accessible at ring 0 (the highest privilege level) only—the exception being the brief period of initial calculation {{at the start of}} a session. This ensures that <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> are almost never available via user space or following a cold boot attack. TRESOR is written as a kernel patch that stores <b>encryption</b> <b>keys</b> in the x86 debug registers, and uses on-the-fly round key generation, atomicity, and blocking of usual ptrace access to the debug registers for security.|$|R

25|$|AACS {{has also}} been {{circumvented}} by SlySoft with their program AnyDVD HD, which allows users to watch HD DVD movies on non-HDCP-compliant PC hardware. Slysoft has stated that AnyDVD HD uses several different mechanisms to disable the encryption, and is not dependent {{on the use of}} a single compromised <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before {{a client}} and server {{can begin to}} {{exchange}} information protected by TLS, they must securely exchange or agree upon an <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> and a cipher to use when encrypting data (see Cipher). Among {{the methods used for}} key exchange/agreement are: public and private keys generated with RSA (denoted TLS_RSA in the TLS handshake protocol), Diffie-Hellman (TLS_DH), ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (TLS_DHE), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (TLS_ECDH), ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (TLS_ECDHE), anonymous Diffie-Hellman (TLS_DH_anon), pre-shared key (TLS_PSK) and Secure Remote Password (TLS_SRP).|$|E
25|$|In public-key cryptosystems, {{the public}} key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key {{encryption}} system, the public key {{is used for}} encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E

25|$|Cryptography can {{introduce}} security problems {{when it is}} not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.|$|E
25|$|Keystroke logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E
25|$|With Oracle Solaris, the {{encryption}} capability in ZFS {{is embedded}} into the I/O pipeline. During writes, a block may be compressed, encrypted, checksummed and then deduplicated, in that order. The policy for encryption {{is set at}} the dataset level when datasets (file systems or ZVOLs) are created. The wrapping keys provided by the user/administrator can be changed at any time without taking the file system offline. The default behaviour is for the wrapping key to be inherited by any child data sets. The data encryption keys are randomly generated at dataset creation time. Only descendant datasets (snapshots and clones) share data encryption keys. A command {{to switch to a}} new data <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> for the clone or at any time is provided—this does not re-encrypt already existing data, instead utilising an encrypted master-key mechanism.|$|E

500|$|The Advanced Access Content System (AACS), the {{organization}} which controlled {{access to the}} HD DVD <b>encryption</b> <b>key,</b> sent a cease and desist letter to Digg on May 1, 2007. [...] In its letter, AACS claimed that by publishing news articles on its website that reported on the <b>encryption</b> <b>key,</b> the website itself was engaging in illegal activity. Articles by numerous journalists reporting on the news story were posted to Digg. Jay Adelson, the CEO of Digg, announced that the website would abide by the AACS' requests and self-censor articles reporting on the <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
500|$|On April 30, 2007, a blogger named [...] "Rudd-O" [...] {{published}} the <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> for HD DVDs and asked readers {{to share it}} widely. Knowledge of this numeric key value allowed users to bypass digital rights management (DRM) and copy HD DVDs that previously could not be duplicated. News media reported on this development and Digg, a news aggregator and social media website, provided a way for users to vote on stories they felt were most newsworthy.

500|$|... {{proposed}} using multidimensional reversible cellular automata as an encryption system. In Kari's proposal, {{the cellular}} automaton rule {{would be the}} <b>encryption</b> <b>key.</b> Encryption would be performed by running the rule forward one step, and decryption would be performed by running it backward one step. Kari suggests that a system such as this {{may be used as}} a public-key cryptosystem. In principle, an attacker could not algorithmically determine the decryption key (the reverse rule) from a given <b>encryption</b> <b>key</b> (forward rule) because of the undecidability of testing reversibility, so the forward rule could be made public without compromising the security of the system. However, Kari did not specify which types of reversible cellular automaton should be used for such a system, or show how a cryptosystem using this approach would be able to generate encryption/decryption key pairs.|$|E
