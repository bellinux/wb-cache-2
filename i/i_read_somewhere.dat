[323] <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> (if <b>I</b> do not err, for I cannot {{recollect}} where,) that Dante was {{so great}} a favourite of Michael Angelo's, that he had designed {{the whole of the}} Divina Commedia: but that the volume containing these studies was lost by sea.|$|R

6000|$|... [AM] <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>somewhere,</b> lately, a new {{and very}} ingenious theory about the {{attitude}} of the Apollo Belvedere, proving, to the author's satisfaction, that the received notion about watching the arrow was all a mistake. The paper proved, at all events, one thing--namely, the statement in the text. For an attitude which has been always hitherto taken to mean one thing, and is plausibly asserted now to mean another, must be in itself unintelligible.|$|E
60|$|For about a week, {{perhaps a}} bit more, the {{recollection}} of that quiet little domestic evening bucked him up like a tonic. Elephants, <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>somewhere,</b> are champions at the memory business, but they were fools to Bobbie during that week. But, bless you, the shock wasn't nearly big enough.

60|$|Home! Would we {{ever see}} it again? We tried to urge Felicity on, {{but she only}} {{repeated}} drowsily that she must lie down and rest. Cecily, too, was reeling against me. The Story Girl still stood up staunchly and counselled struggling on, but she was numb with cold and her words were hardly distinguishable. Some wild idea was {{in my mind that}} we must dig a hole in the snow and all creep into it. <b>I</b> had <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that people had thus saved their lives in snowstorms. Suddenly Felix gave a shout.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that the noble lord on the floor, not in a former debate to be sure, (it would be disorderly to refer to it, <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it <b>somewhere,)</b> but the noble lord was pleased to say, {{that he did not}} conceive how it could enter into the head of man to impose such taxes as those of 1767: I mean those taxes which he voted for imposing, and voted for repealing,--as being taxes, contrary to all the principles of commerce, laid on British manufactures.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You do me proud, Captain. But, dear, I {{want to say}} {{one thing}} and then I'm done; for you don't need much advice of mine after my good man has spoken. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that every inch of rope used in the British Navy has a strand of red in it, so that {{wherever}} a bit of it is found it is known. That is the text of my little sermon to you. Virtue, which means honour, honesty, courage, and all that makes character, is the red thread that marks a good man wherever he is. Keep that always and everywhere, so that even if wrecked by misfortune, that sign shall still be found and recognized. Yours is a rough life, and your mates not all we could wish, but you can be a gentleman in the true sense of the word; and no matter what happens to your body, keep your soul clean, your heart true to those who love you, and do your duty to the end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was right," [...] {{she said}} to herself bitterly, [...] "when he said that I had not yet {{discovered}} that I had a heart as well as a head. We are miserable creatures, we women. A man can go straight on his way through life--he can love, he can marry, but it makes no change in his course. I know <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that love is but an incident in a man's life, while it is a woman's all, or something of that sort. I laughed at the idea then as absurd--now that it is too late I see it is true. He loved me, or, at least he liked me so much that he thought it was love. I laughed at him, I told him he was not worthy of a woman's love. He went away. Here was an end of it, {{as far as he was}} concerned. He lost his property and took to work nobly, and when we met he was just the same as he had been before, and treated me as if I had been a cousin, and has no doubt laughed many a time at the thought of that morning in the garden at Newquay, and indeed thought so little of it that he did not mind my seeing all those sketches of that woman in his note-books.|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] said Jones, {{as we sat}} {{round the}} campfire, [...] "I see you're getting in shape. Well, I've worn off the wire edge myself. And I have the hounds coming fine. They mind me now, but they're mystified. For the life of them they can't {{understand}} what I mean. I don't blame them. Wait till, by good luck, we get a cougar in a tree. When Sounder and Don see that, we've lion dogs, boys! we've lion dogs! But Moze is a stubborn brute. In all my years of animal experience, I've never discovered {{any other way to}} make animals obey than by instilling fear and respect into their hearts. I've been fond of buffalo, horses and dogs, but sentiment never ruled me. When animals must obey, they must--that's all, and no mawkishness! But I never trusted a buffalo in my life. If I had I wouldn't be here to-night. You all know how many keepers of tame wild animals get killed. I could tell you dozens of tragedies. And I've often thought, since I got back from New York, of that woman I saw with her troop of African lions. I dream about those lions, and see them leaping over her head. What a grand sight that was! But the public is fooled. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that she trained those lions by love. I don't believe it. I saw her use a whip and a steel spear. Moreover, I saw many things that escaped most observers--how she entered the cage, how she maneuvered among them, how she kept a compelling gaze on them! It was an admirable, a great piece of work. Maybe she loves those huge yellow brutes, but her life was in danger every moment while she was in that cage, and she knew it. Some day, one of her pets likely the King of Beasts she pets the most will rise up and kill her. That is as certain as death." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>somewhere</b> <b>read</b> this remark:--'Omne meritum est voluntarium, aut voluntate originis, aut origine voluntatis'.

6000|$|November 1--noon. [...] A fine day, a {{brilliant}} sun. Warm in the sun, {{cold in the}} shade--an icy breeze blowing out of the south. A solemn long swell rolling up northward. It comes from the South Pole, with nothing in the way to obstruct its march and tone its energy down. <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> that an acute observer among the early explorers--Cook? or Tasman?--accepted this majestic swell as trustworthy circumstantial evidence that no important land lay to the southward, and so did not waste time on a useless quest in that direction, but changed his course and went searching elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> of {{an eastern}} king who put {{a judge to}} death for an iniquitous sentence, and ordered his hide to be stuffed into a cushion, and placed upon the {{tribunal}} for the son to sit on, who was preferred to his father's office. I fancy such a memorial {{might not have been}} unuseful to a son of Sir William Scroggs, and that both he and his successors would often wriggle in their seats as long as the cushion lasted. I wish the relater had told us what number of such cushions there might be in that country.|$|R
6000|$|The agnostics {{have been}} driven back on agnosticism; and are already {{recovering}} from the shock. They {{find themselves in a}} really unknown world under really unknown gods; a world which is more mystical, or at least more mysterious. For in the Victorian age the agnostics were not really agnostics. They might be better described as reverent materialists; or at any rate monists. They had at least at the back of their minds a clear and consistent concept of their rather clockwork cosmos; that is why they could not admit the smallest speck of the supernatural into their clockwork. But to-day it is very hard for a scientific man to say where the supernatural ends or the natural begins, or what name should be given to either. The word agnostic has ceased to be a polite word for atheist. It has become a real word for a very real state of mind, conscious of many possibilities beyond that of the atheist, and not excluding that of the polytheist. It is no longer a question of defining or denying a simple central power, but of balancing the brain in a bewilderment of new powers which seem to overlap and might even conflict. Nature herself has become unnatural. The wind is blowing {{from the other side of}} the desert, not now with noble truism [...] "There is no God but God," [...] but rather with that other motto out of the deeper anarchy of Asia, drawn out by Mr. Kipling, in the shape of a native proverb, in the very story already mentioned; [...] "Your gods and my gods, do you or I know which is the stronger?" [...] There was a mystical story <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>somewhere</b> in my boyhood, of which the only image that remains is that of a rose-bush growing mysteriously in the middle of a room. Taking this image for the sake of argument, we can easily fancy a man half-conscious and convinced that he is delirious, or still partly in a dream, because he sees such a magic bush growing irrationally in the middle of his bedroom. All the walls and furniture are familiar and solid, the table, the clock, the telephone, the looking glass or what not; there is nothing unnatural but this one hovering hallucination or optical delusion of green and red. Now that was very much the view taken of the Rose of Sharon, the mystical rose of the sacred tradition of Palestine, by any educated man about 1850, when the rationalism of the eighteenth century was supposed to have found full support in the science of the nineteenth. He had a sentiment about a rose: he was still glad it had fragrance or atmosphere; though he remembered with a slight discomfort that it had thorns. But what bothered him about it was that it was impossible. And what made him think it impossible was it was inconsistent with everything else. It was one solitary and monstrous exception to the sort of rule that ought to have no exceptions. Science did not convince him that there were few miracles, but that there were no miracles; and why should there be miracles only in Palestine and only for one short period? It was a single and senseless contradiction to an otherwise complete cosmos. For the furniture fitted in bit by bit and better and better; and the bedroom seemed to grow more and more solid. The man recognised the portrait of himself over the mantelpiece or the medicine bottles on the table, like the dying lover in Browning. In other words, science so far had steadily solidified things; Newton had measured the walls and ceiling and made a calculus of their three dimensions. Darwin was already arranging the animals in rank as neatly as a row of chairs, or Faraday the chemical elements as clearly as a row of medicine bottles. From the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth, science was not only making discoveries, but all the discoveries were in one direction. Science is still making discoveries; but they are in the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunology}} professor {{had just}} wrapped up the day's lecture.

He was friendly, with a nice smile that spread from the edges of his mustache to the sparkle in his blue eyes whenever he talked about something that really interested him. He didn't always have traditional views on the subjects he taught and was willing to listen to the students ' views. The lecture had been on vaccines—the history of their development, how they work, a discussion of some of the more common ones. A lively discussion began, with many students raising their hands. "Dr. Jim, how come you make it sound like vaccines are good things? Don't they cause autism {{and a lot of other}} problems? " asked Vicky, a young student in the class.
