25|$|I {{wanted to}} do {{something}} refreshing and different, so I mixed genres and drew inspiration from touring, traveling, watching rock bands, and attending festivals… <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mad scientist, putting lots of different songs together. Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years! I'm old.|$|E
500|$|Three {{members of}} the cast {{had never been in}} a film before: Ed Sanders was cast as Toby, Jayne Wisener as Johanna, and Jamie Campbell Bower, who auditioned, and after four days got the part of Anthony said [...] "I think I weed myself. I was out {{shopping}} at the time and I got this call on my mobile. I was just like, 'OH MY GOD!' Honestly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little girl running around this shop like oh-my-god-oh-my-god-oh-my-god." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the editing}} of Death Proof, Tarantino stated [...] "There is half-an-hour's {{difference}} between my Death Proof {{and what is}} playing in Grindhouse. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down {{almost to the point}} of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked." [...] An extended, 127-minute version of Death Proof was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival. Tarantino is quoted as saying [...] "It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see Death Proof unfiltered. [...] It will be the first time everyone sees Death Proof by itself, including me." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the book}} {{attracted}} negative publicity during McAuliffe's 2013 gubernatorial race. In the book, McAuliffe {{wrote about the}} September 11 attacks and his experiences in the Democratic National Committee office immediately after. He recalled, [...] "I {{was one of our}} party's most visible spokesmen, and I had to keep a low profile after the attacks. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> caged rat. I couldn't travel. I couldn't make political calls. I couldn't make money calls." [...] Despite the negative publicity, McAuliffe has not backed away from it, using What a Party to introduce himself to voters.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{partly on}} this promise, Hall was {{selected}} in the West Indian squad to tour England in 1957. Despite great enthusiasm, Hall struggled in the unfamiliar surroundings, unable to pitch the ball anywhere near the wicket. Hall remarked later [...] "When I hit the softer wickets <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fish out of water." [...] Hall did not play {{in any of the}} Test matches and in first-class matches on the tour as a whole took 27 wickets at an average of 33.55. Hall's lack of success in England saw him overlooked for the entire home Test series against Pakistan in 1957–58.|$|E

2500|$|Due to his {{constant}} visibility next to Method Man, and his tendency to wear Wu-Tang related clothing on stage, some fans have confused Redman for being {{more than just}} an affiliate of the Wu-Tang Clan. Redman raised speculation himself when a quote he gave to XXL made headlines in 2010, [...] "I am the last member of Wu Tang, like Method Man he’s a part of Def Squad. Meth {{has been a part of}} Def Squad before I was a member. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> member. But I was affiliated and I wasn’t signed in, but, I’m definitely—they got my number. Number 11th and I am officially a Wu Tang member right now." [...] When asked to respond, RZA downplayed the notion, stating that although Redman was like family to Wu-Tang, he's more [...] "like a first cousin".|$|E
2500|$|In August 2003, Lopez starred {{opposite}} Affleck in {{the romantic}} comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, {{and is considered}} one of the worst films of all time. The film's poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck's engagement which largely overshadowed the film. Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying [...] " [...] was very tough", [...] "the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> poster child for that moment." [...] In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a [...] "more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede." [...] Lopez's clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.|$|E

60|$|JULIA (earnestly). You {{might have}} made me good if you had chosen to. You had a great power over me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child in your hands; and you knew it.|$|E
