500|$|Bowlby's {{work was}} misinterpreted {{to mean that}} any {{separation}} from the natural mother, any experience of institutional care or a multiplicity of [...] "mothers" [...] necessarily resulted in severe emotional deprivation and sometimes, that all children undergoing such experiences would develop into [...] "affectionless children". As a consequence it was claimed that only 24-hour care by the same person (the mother) was good enough, day care and nurseries were not good enough and mothers should not go out to work. The WHO advised that day nurseries and creches could have a serious and permanent deleterious effect. Such strictures suited the policies of governments concerned about finding employment for returned and returning servicemen after World War II. In fact, although Bowlby was of the view that proper care could not be provided [...] "by roster", he was also of the view that babies should be accustomed to regular periods of care by another and {{that the key to}} alternative care for working mothers was that it should be regular and continuous. He addressed this point in a 1958 publication called Can <b>I</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>My</b> Baby?. Ainsworth in the WHO 1962 publication also attempted to address this misapprehension by pointing out that the requirement for continuity of care did not imply an exclusive mother–child pair relationship.|$|E
500|$|The {{third floor}} {{contains}} the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners {{in the grand}} ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet {{was held at the}} Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf-Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black-tie charitable affair co-chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria-Hungary which celebrated the Enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, [...] "I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack when I get up to speak that <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> dinner jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time". Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Center). It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the [...] "Starlight Roof". Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and many of the suites including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vertès, Louis XVI and Cole Porter, named after the celebrities who stayed in them. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday night card games were played. There is also a re-creation of one of the living rooms of Hoover's Waldorf-Astoria suite in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spring of}} 1954, in New York City, {{just before his}} passing, Pascal had planned a trip to India to see Meher Baba one last time. He {{was having an affair}} and divorcing his wife at the time. One day he impulsively wrote on a piece of hotel {{stationery}} to his mistress, [...] "If I die on my trip to India <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>my</b> entire estate to you." [...] He signed and dated it before two witnesses, a cook and a maid in the hotel who did not speak English but only Chinese. This was an absurd gesture since Pascal was totally in debt. Pascal had told his wife Valerie (Hídvéghy Valéria) that he would leave her millions.|$|E
