5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of psychological warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> for their outlaw countrymen.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions.

A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to {{do most of the}} searching, but the Falcon would act as aid and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E

The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.|$|E
5|$|In Deathmatch, {{all players}} compete {{against each other}} and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must {{retrieve}} the flag from his enemy's base, and bring it to his own team's base. In Sabotage, one team must place a bomb in three different locations, while the opposite team must protect these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found {{at the beginning of the}} team base, and the player who holds the bomb must wait 12 seconds until he may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hunt,</b> players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which he can also shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Leo {{spent three}} years in prison, until {{released}} and restored to his rank in late July 886. Here too Zaoutzes played a major role, as he personally pleaded with the Byzantine emperor to secure Leo's release. By that time, Basil was ailing, and on August 12, 886, he was gravely wounded during a hunt. Zaoutzes's participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> raised suspicions of a conspiracy, but his complicity is generally rejected, as Basil survived for nine days, during {{which he did not}} punish Zaoutzes. Upon Basil's death, Leo was crowned emperor, but Zaoutzes, who was awarded the titles of patrikios and magistros and the office of logothetes tou dromou, effectively assumed control of the government, directing state policy. One tradition, based on the Vita Euthymii (the hagiography of Patriarch Euthymios I), holds that Basil himself appointed Zaoutzes as regent (epitropos), but other sources indicate that his ascent to power was more gradual. It is indicative of his authority that most of Leo's ordinances (novels) are directed to him in person, and in 893, he succeeded in getting his protégé, Antony Kauleas, elected as Patriarch of Constantinople. In the same period (between 886 and 893), Emperor Leo VI himself delivered a homily on a church built on Zaoutzes's orders in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Pregame {{media and}} fan {{interest}} surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's Hunter Cantwell, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, brother of National Football League star Michael Vick. Also {{a concern for}} Louisville was the health of star running back Michael Bush, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team that left the Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, {{there was also the}} hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in the country and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> for the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game.|$|E
5|$|Under Grace's {{leadership}} at Lord's, the Gentlemen batted {{very well and}} totalled 310 {{on the first day}} before reducing the Players to 39–4 at the close. Grace scored 90, his highest score of the season so far, and was well supported by Alfred and Edward Lyttelton. The Players recovered on Tuesday morning, thanks to a seventh wicket century stand by John Selby and Tom Emmett, to reach 231 all out which left the Gentlemen with a first innings lead of 79. Grace took 2–31. In the second innings, Grace was bowled by Shaw for 2 with the score at 6–1 but his opening partner A. P. Lucas steadied the innings with 91 and was well supported by Ridley, Edward Lyttelton and Steel. The Gentlemen finally amassed 326 to leave the Players needing 406 to win. They were never <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> and, although Selby was defiant with another half-century, Grace took 4–55 to lead the Gentlemen to victory.|$|E

5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} {{as head coach}} involved replacing Phil Simms as the starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler, who had led the Giants to a win in the Super Bowl, was named as the team's Opening Day starting quarterback. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the San Francisco 49ers 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to a record of 7-5 after a dramatic 21-14 win at Tampa Bay in week 13 and were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> for a post-season spot, the Giants lost their next three behind Phil Simms who reclaimed his starting position when Hostetler went down with a broken back. Hostetler threw five touchdowns in his 12 starts, while Simms threw eight in his four starts. The excitement that had surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge during the year was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059yards, while also catching 43 passes. The season was also marked by the decline of Lawrence Taylor. Although Taylor still finished with a respectable 7 sacks, 1991 {{marked the first time}} in his career he was not elected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Deinonychus fossils {{have been}} {{uncovered}} {{in small groups}} near {{the remains of the}} herbivore Tenontosaurus, a larger ornithischian dinosaur. This had been interpreted as evidence that these dromaeosaurids hunted in coordinated packs like some modern mammals. However, not all paleontologists found the evidence conclusive, and a subsequent study published in 2007 by Roach and Brinkman suggests that the Deinonychus may have actually displayed a disorganized mobbing behavior. Modern diapsids, including birds and crocodiles (the closest relatives of dromaeosaurids), display minimal long-term cooperative hunting (except the aplomado falcon and Harris's Hawk); instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, join forces time to time to increase hunting success, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where conflict often occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and might attack smaller Komodo dragons that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal dies, it is usually cannibalized. When this information is applied to the sites containing putative pack-hunting behavior in dromaeosaurids, it appears somewhat consistent with a Komodo dragon-like feeding strategy. Deinonychus skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts that may have been eaten by other Deinonychus, which a study by Roach et al. presented as evidence against the idea that the animals cooperated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt.</b>|$|E
