5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Sitting Bull {{was allowed}} to leave the {{reservation}} to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody’s Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He earned about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, {{where he was a}} popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites. The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{development}} of wind power in South Australia {{has led to}} direct economic effects from the construction and operation of wind farms. There has been a total of $2.8 billion in wind power investment up to October 2011 which is estimated to have created 3,000 direct and indirect jobs. Studies into the economic effects of wind farms <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> a 50 MW installation pays host landholders some $250,000 per year, is constructed by workers who spend up to $1.2 million locally and contributes up to $80,000 annually to community projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth of}} V.salvadorii do not {{resemble}} those of other monitor species, which are typically blunt, peglike, and face slightly rearward. Their upper teeth are long and fang-like, standing vertical from the jawbone, designed to hook into fast-moving or feathered prey such as birds, bats, and rodents. Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath. In the wild, V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea, feeding on birds, eggs, small mammals, and carrion. Natives <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> it can take down pigs, deer, and hunting dogs, and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it. Captive specimens {{have been known to}} eat fish, frogs, rodents, chickens, and dog food.|$|E

5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion}} of the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two studies that <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells {{is important for}} negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{his wealth}} {{continued}} to grow. In 1922, his salary was 6,000 francs per year, and in 1938, it {{had risen to}} 24,000 francs per year. Atangana also received 2% of all taxes collected by lower chiefs, pay for his legal role, and stipends for organising road construction. Oral informants <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> as early as 1924, he owned enormous plantations with as much as 1km² of cocoa, 1.1km² of palms, 5km² of food crops, and 500 head of livestock. The amounts may be exaggerated, but Atangana was by all accounts a wealthy man. He owned two lorries and a car by 1926, which he used to haul produce from his plantations. By the 1930s, important chiefs such as Atangana could earn more than 400,000francs per year on tax collecting alone.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} skin and the hair. All parts of the animal are used in traditional Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for the assumed medicinal value of its hair. Traders <b>have</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> they have difficulty keeping pace with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E
