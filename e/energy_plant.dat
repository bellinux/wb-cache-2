Much {{attention has been paid}} to <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> in recent years. As China has fairly limited cultivated land resources, the bioenergy development may mainly rely on the exploitation of marginal land. This study focused on the assessment of marginal land resources and bio-fuel potential in China using newly acquired data and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A multi-factor analysis method was adopted to identify marginal lands for bioenergy development in China, with data of several main types of <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> on the eco-environmental requirements and natural habits employed. A combined planting zonation strategy was proposed, which was targeted for five species of <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> including Helianthus tuberous L., Pistacia chinensis, Jatropha curcas L., Cassava and Vernicia fordii. The results indicated that total area of marginal land exploitable for development of <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> on a large scale was about 43. 75 million ha. If 10 % of this marginal land was fully utilized for growing the <b>energy</b> <b>plants,</b> the production of bio-fuel would be 13. 39 million tons.

After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{targeted}} cultivation possibilities of <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> in Slovakia and to evaluate the appropriateness of targeted cultivation of <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> Populus and <b>energy</b> grass Miscanthus. In Slovakia, is used the classification system of regions according territorial statistical units - NUTS (NUTS III - 8 regions). The highest potential for the cultivation of <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> (soil quality group 5 - 9) is in Prešov (99. 95 %), Žilina (99. 89 %) and Košice (99. 51) region. The research was conducted at the research locality of the <b>energy</b> <b>plants</b> in Kolíňany (Nitra region). We studied four Italian varieties of gray poplar (Populus × canescens) (Monviso, Pegaso, AF- 2 and Sirio) and two genotypes of energy grass Miscanthus (Miscantus × giganteus (Greef et Deuter, 1993) and Miscanthus sinensis (Tatai)). Production of Populus varieties after the first growing cycle (2009 - 2012), exceeding the value of the economic threshold was 67. 42 t ha- 1 (AF- 2) to 87. 16 t ha- 1 (Monviso). Both genotypes of Miscanthus produce an economically interesting production of dry mass for the 4 year period (2010 - 2013) (Miscantus × giganteus (Greef et Deuter) 88. 97 t ha- 1 and Miscanthus sinensis (Tatai) 77. 80 t ha- 1).

Because cultivated land resources are fairly limited, bioenergy development may rely on the exploitation of marginal land.
