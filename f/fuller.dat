5|$|On 20 December 1920, the Labor Party Premier, James Dooley, and {{his cabinet}} {{resigned}} after having lost {{a vote in}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly a week before. The Governor, Sir Walter Davidson, then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Sir George <b>Fuller,</b> as Premier. As <b>Fuller</b> did not have a majority, he initiated attempts to form a coalition with the Progressive Party. The Progressives split over whether to join the <b>Fuller</b> government into an urban wing, led by Leader Walter Wearne and Deputy Leader Thomas Bavin, which agreed to enter Fuller's coalition and a rural wing ("The True Blues"), led by Bruxner and Ernest Buttenshaw who offered <b>Fuller</b> only conditional support. After seven hours in government, still without a workable majority, <b>Fuller</b> requested a double-dissolution from Davidson. Davidson refused, on the basis that Dooley still had a majority in the lower house, and <b>Fuller</b> resigned.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Fuller</b> Houses are two {{historic}} {{homes at}} 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the <b>Fuller</b> family and {{are believed to}} have originally been identical in construction. The -story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the house itself. For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The <b>Fuller</b> Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The <b>Fuller</b> Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimates}} of the number of Japanese troops on Biak were out by a similar margin, resulting in heavy casualties. In the Battle of Biak, stubborn Japanese resistance halted the 41st Infantry Division, and forced its commander, Major General Horace H. <b>Fuller,</b> to appeal to Krueger for reinforcements. In response, Krueger sent the 163rd Regimental Combat Team from Wakde. MacArthur soon grew impatient, as he needed the airstrips on Biak to support Admiral Chester Nimitz's Invasion of Saipan. Nimitz's operation ultimately drew Japanese attention away from Biak. MacArthur put pressure on Krueger for results, and Krueger in turn put pressure on <b>Fuller.</b> Krueger decided that <b>Fuller</b> had too many responsibilities as both task force commander and division commander, and decided to supersede him by sending Eichelberger to take over the task force. <b>Fuller</b> then submitted his resignation. Eichelberger's chief of staff, Brigadier General Clovis Byers, offered to have Decker intercept and destroy the resignation before Krueger saw it, but <b>Fuller</b> decided against this. The battle raged for nearly a month. Afterwards, Krueger demanded an explanation from Eichelberger as to why he had allowed <b>Fuller</b> to quit.|$|E

5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel <b>Fuller</b> be named the film's director as he felt <b>Fuller</b> was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting <b>Fuller</b> and seeing <b>Fuller</b> act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fuller,</b> however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. <b>Fuller</b> also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E

Of her time in India, <b>Fuller</b> wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society...

40|$|International audienceContext: T Tauri stars exhibit {{variability}} on all timescales, whose origin {{is still}} debated. On WTTS the variability is fairly simple and attributed to long-lived, ubiquitous cool spots. Aims: We investigate {{the long term}} variability of WTTS, extending up to 20 years in some cases, characterize it statistically and discuss its implications for our understanding of these stars. Methods: We have obtained a unique, homogeneous database of photometric measurements for WTTS extending up to 20 years. It contains more than 9000 UBVR observations of 48 WTTS. All {{the data were collected}} at Mount Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and they constitute the longest homogeneous record of accurate WTTS photometry ever assembled. Results: Definitive rotation periods for 35 of the 48 stars are obtained. Phased light curves over 5 to 20 seasons are now available for analysis. Light curve shapes, amplitudes and colour variations are obtained for this sample and various behaviors exhibited, discussed and interpreted. Conclusions: Our main conclusion is that most WTTS have very stable long term variability with relatively small changes of amplitude or mean light level. The long term variability seen reflects modulation in the cold spot distributions. Photometric periods are stable over many years, and the phase of minimum light can be stable as well for several years. On the long term, spot properties do change in subtle ways, leading to secular variations in the shape and amplitudes of the light curves.
