5|$|Back at UNITY's headquarters, Cate is congratulated for {{a mission}} well done, and {{everybody}} leaves to grab some rest. Cate {{arrives at a}} graveyard where Bruno was buried to pay her respects. She is then confronted by the supposedly long-dead Tom Goodman, who reveals {{that he is the}} real traitor within UNITY, and a final gun duel ensues. Cate manages to injure Tom and arrest him, but Smith shoots Tom, causing him to fall into a freshly dug grave. Smith then tries to shoot Cate as well, but Jones shoots Smith and reveals that Bruno is still alive. Smith attempts his one last effort to shoot Cate, but Cate kills Smith just in time. With Tom and Smith shot dead, Jones and Bruno decide to tell Cate the truth; Bruno falsified his death so that Cate and the rest of UNITY could find the real traitor. Seven years ago, Smith was taken out of the field by UNITY due to his inadequate <b>fieldwork.</b> <b>In</b> order to sabotage UNITY as a way to avenge himself, Smith joins H.A.R.M. to kill the real Tom Goodman, and replace him with an impostor.

5|$|Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a {{nationwide}} investigation of married women's working conditions. Bondfield {{carried out the}} <b>fieldwork</b> <b>in</b> Yorkshire. The {{relationship between the two}} bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over how it should be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council. In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL's Organising Secretary, and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in Ogmore Vale, Glamorgan, reformed the Manchester branch, and found time to advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales. The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield's workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, led her to resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure. An attempt to re-engage her in 1913 was unsuccessful, and Marion Phillips was appointed to succeed her.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} <b>Fieldwork</b> <b>in</b> Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fieldwork</b> <b>in</b> 1996 {{turned up}} a spectacularly {{complete}} theropod skull preserved in exquisite detail (FMNH PR 2100). On top of this skull was a dome-shaped swelling nearly {{identical to the one}} described by Sues and Taquet as Majungatholus atopus. Majungatholus was redescribed as an abelisaurid rather than a pachycephalosaur in 1998. Although the name Majungasaurus crenatissimus was older than Majungatholus atopus, the authors judged the type dentary of Majungasaurus too fragmentary to confidently assign to the same species as the skull. Further fieldwork over the next decade {{turned up a}} series of less complete skulls, as well as dozens of partial skeletons of individuals ranging from juveniles to adults. Project members also collected hundreds of isolated bones and thousands of shed Majungasaurus teeth. Taken together, these remains represent nearly all the bones of the skeleton, although most of the forelimbs, most of the pelvis and the tip of the tail are still unknown. This fieldwork culminated in a 2007 monograph consisting of seven scientific papers on all aspects of the animal's biology, published in the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoirs. The papers are in English, although each has an abstract written in Malagasy. In this volume, the dentary described by Lavocat was re-evaluated and determined to be diagnostic for this species. Therefore, the name Majungatholus was replaced by the older name Majungasaurus. Although the monograph is comprehensive, the editors noted that it describes only material recovered from 1993 through 2001. A significant quantity of specimens, some very complete, were excavated in 2003 and 2005 and await preparation and description in future publications. The dentary was made the neotype specimen after a 2009 petition to the ICZN.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} current experiences, {{issues and}} concerns <b>in</b> <b>fieldwork</b> education <b>in</b> {{social work in}} Aotearoa/New Zealand {{from the perspectives of}} <b>fieldwork</b> supervisors. <b>In</b> particular the research explores how supervisors conceptualise their role and their needs for support, education and training to fulfil the role of student supervisor. In order to provide a background for an informed analysis and discussion of the research findings, the thesis provides a summary of key events and documents which have influenced developments <b>in</b> <b>fieldwork</b> education <b>in</b> Aotearoa/New Zealand from 1970 to 1997 and a review of other research studies from this country and overseas. Four areas of theorising are examined and applied to an understanding of <b>fieldwork</b> education <b>in</b> social work. These are critical social science, critical pedagogy, adult learning theories and models and a critical reflective conceptualisation of professional education. These theories are influential in the development of an argument for a critical reflective model of the practicum in social work education which connects the nature of the practice with which social workers are engaged to the professional education and training which prepares students for this practice. The thesis is a qualitative study of the nature of teaching and learning <b>in</b> <b>fieldwork</b> education from the perspectives of fieldwork supervisors, and utilises an action research process. The research findings show that the current issues which are of concern to fieldwork supervisors reflect not only their personal journeys and experiences but are also influenced by what is happening at a political and ideological level in both the educational and practice settings <b>in</b> which <b>fieldwork</b> is situated. The recommendations which arise from the research with regard to future directions in policy, practice and research <b>in</b> <b>fieldwork</b> education, are at two levels. Firstly, there are practical suggestions about changes to the current set of arrangements around fieldwork education which could be implemented immediately by agencies and/or education and training institutions. Secondly, the research findings generate discussion about some of the deeper philosophical issues underlying the provision and resourcing of <b>fieldwork</b> education <b>in</b> social work which are unlikely to be resolved without the collaboration of all of the interested parties. In this respect, the fieldwork component of social work education is seen to be situated in a critical space, because placements are {{the point at which the}} worlds of educators, students, agency social workers and managers of social service organisations collide, thus creating the necessity for dialogue between all of the interest groups...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between social work students’ creativity and their fieldwork performance. Systems theory provides a theoretical framework to explain the ambiguity, indeterminacy and uncertainty in social work practice, and account for the need for creativity during the helping process <b>in</b> <b>fieldwork</b> training. <b>In</b> this study, creativity {{was defined as the}} ability in divergent thinking with five dimensions, which are fluency, originality, elaboration, abstractness of titles and resistance to premature closure. The existing literature suggests that social work students’ creativity may have impact on their <b>fieldwork</b> performance <b>in</b> three areas, namely problem solving, application of theories and empathy. 52 social work students from a university in Hong Kong participated in this study and data regarding their creativity and fieldwork performance were collected. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between participants’ competences in different dimensions of creativity and their <b>fieldwork</b> performance <b>in</b> each of the three fieldwork performance areas. Significant relationships were found between competences in two dimensions of creativity and <b>fieldwork</b> performance <b>in</b> those three areas. Both quadratic and linear significant relationships were found, and in some of them, the competences in some dimensions of creativity were found interacting with each other, and affecting each other’s relationship with fieldwork performance. The findings of this study provided detailed information about the possible relationships between social work students’ competences in different dimensions of creativity and their <b>fieldwork</b> performance <b>in</b> the three selected areas, and some tentative suggestions regarding potential use of {{the findings of this study}} for further development of social work curriculum were discussed. Further studies to confirm the findings of this study and to further investigate the possibility of enhancing social works students’ fieldwork performance through improving their competences in certain dimensions of creativity were recommended.
