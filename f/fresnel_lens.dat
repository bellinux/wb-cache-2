5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens,</b> but a fourth-order <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> was {{installed}} in May 1902, just three months into its operation. The light characteristic was a fixed white light with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, the light was automated and the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> was replaced with a modern optic. The light continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 was installed before the current lens, a VRB-25 was installed. The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds. The white and red flashes can be seen for 18 nautical miles and 15 nautical miles, respectably.|$|E
5|$|The lantern {{initially}} {{contained a}} fourth order <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> giving a red light; a short mast {{on the roof}} of the lantern bore a radio beacon antenna. The fog signal was a horn powered by compressed air. The light was activated in 1935.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens.</b> The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens.</b> The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{widespread}} use of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses,</b> for a time, occurred in automobile headlamps, where they can shape the roughly parallel beam from the parabolic reflector to meet requirements for dipped and main-beam patterns, often both in the same headlamp unit (such as the European H4 design). For reasons of cost, weight, and impact resistance, newer cars have dispensed with glass <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses,</b> using multifaceted reflectors with plain polycarbonate <b>lenses.</b> However, <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> continue in wide use in automobile tail, marker, and backup lights.|$|R
50|$|The Lighthouse Board {{moved quickly}} in {{applying}} new technology, particularly in purchasing and installing new <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> and constructing screw-pile lighthouses. The Board also oversaw {{the construction of}} the first lighthouses on the west coast. By the time of the Civil War, all lighthouses had <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are widely}} used in concentrating {{photovoltaic}} (CPV) systems as primary optical elements focusing sunlight onto small solar cells or onto entrance apertures of secondary optical elements attached to the solar cells. Calculations using the Young-Maggi-Rubinowicz theory of diffraction yield analytical expressions {{for the amount of}} light spilling outside these target areas due to diffraction {{at the edges of the}} concentrator <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses.</b> Explicit equations are given for the diffraction loss due to planar <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> with small prisms and due to arbitrarily shaped <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses.</b> Furthermore, the cases of illumination by monochromatic, polychromatic, totally spatially coherent and partially spatially coherent light (e. g. from the solar disc) are treated, resulting in analytical formulae. Examples using realistic values show losses due to diffraction of up to several percent...|$|R
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a <b>fresnel</b> <b>lens,</b> and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens.</b> The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a fog whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are used}} as simple {{hand-held}} magnifiers. They are also used to correct several visual disorders, including ocular-motility disorders such as strabismus. <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> {{have been used to}} increase the visual size of CRT displays in pocket televisions, notably the Sinclair TV80. They are also used in traffic lights.|$|R
50|$|The largest <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are called}} hyperradiant <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses.</b> One such lens {{was on hand}} when {{it was decided to}} build and outfit the Makapuu Point Light in Hawaii. Rather than order a new lens, the huge optic construction, 12 ft tall and with over a {{thousand}} prisms, was used there.|$|R
40|$|The Lamb {{wave and}} V-groove lenses are {{distinguished}} by their high surface wave excitation efficiencies. However, {{due to the}} fixed incidence angle, a particular lens can only be used for materials having surface wave velocities within a limited range. Hence, it is desirable to have lenses with adjustable incidence angle. Conventional spherical <b>lenses</b> implemented in <b>Fresnel</b> planar <b>lens</b> form have been demonstrated earlier. In this work, Lamb wave and V-groove <b>lenses</b> constructed as <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> are presented. We also discuss the feasibility of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> with air as the coupling medium. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to build air coupled <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> with a reasonable conversion efficiency into subsurface waves...|$|R
25|$|French {{physicist}} and engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel developed the multi-part <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> {{for use in}} lighthouses. His design allowed {{for the construction of}} lenses of large aperture and short focal length, without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design. A <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet. A <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> can also capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one, to be visible over greater distances.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Conversion {{of solar}} energy to {{mechanical}} power {{through the use}} of thermostatic bimetals and linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> was found to be both theoretically and experimentally feasible. Using linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> to concentrate sunlight on bimetallic coils caused a simple sun powered motor to produce rotational shaft power. However, continuous rotational motion could not be sustained. Efficient energy transfer through the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> and the ability of the bimetal to absorb and dissipate solar energy were determined to be critical factors limiting motor operation. Several developments were suggested by the experiment which may improve overall energy efficiency of the motor and possibly create continuous rotational motion. Both thermostatic bimetals and linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> appear to have a promising future in the field of solar energy conversion. Further research may reveal many practical applications for the sun powered motor and its component parts...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> of {{different}} focal lengths (one collimator, and one collector) {{are used in}} commercial and DIY projection. The collimator lens has the lower focal length and is placed closer to the light source, and the collector lens, which focuses the light into the triplet lens, is placed after the projection image (an active matrix LCD panel in LCD projectors). <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> are also used as collimators in overhead projectors.|$|R
40|$|At Livermore we`ve {{spent the}} last two years {{examining}} an alternative approach towards very large aperture (VLA) telescopes, one based upon transmissive <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> rather than on mirrors. <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> are attractive for VLA telescopes because they are launchable (lightweight, packagable, and deployable) and because they virtually eliminate the traditional, very tight, surface shape requirements faced by reflecting telescopes. Their (potentially severe) optical drawback, a very narrow spectral bandwidth, can be eliminated by use of a second (much smaller) chromatically-correcting Fresnel element. This enables Fresnel VLA telescopes to provide either single band ({Delta}{lambda}/{lambda} {approximately} 0. 1), multiple band, or continuous spectral coverage. Building and fielding such large <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> will present a significant challenge, but one which appears, with effort, to be solvable...|$|R

25|$|In 1870 a fixed, white, 3rd order <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> was installed. That year, the {{remnants}} of the original stone tower were removed. In 1907, the 3rd order lens was replaced by a 3½-order bi-valve lens. This lens did not last long.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 the {{apparatus}} was {{converted to a}} vaporised kerosene mantle, to lower costs. In 1933 the light returned to use electricity, as the tower was connected to mains electricity. The current first order bivalve <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lens</b> was installed at that time.|$|E

50|$|According to Robert Browning, chief {{historian}} of the United States Coast Guard, {{it is possible that}} Pleasanton continued to rely on Lewis’s lamps instead of adopting <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> {{due to the nature of}} the existing lighthouses. Evidence exists that with the Earth’s curvature, the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> would have proved no better than Lewis's paraboloid lamps due to the low height of the lighthouse towers themselves; because of these factors, lights could only be seen a short distance.|$|R
40|$|One {{promising}} way {{to convert}} solar energy into electrical energy {{is the use}} of point focusing <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> in order to concentrate sun light on solar cells. The <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> typically consist of a transparent polymer sometimes processed on a supporting substrate like glass. Regarding the system's performance the optical efficiency of the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>lenses</b> directly scales the electrical output. To verify computer predicted concentrator performance, to quantify production deviations from the desired lens design and for quality control we have built an appropriate measurement setup meanwhile in the 5 th generation. This Lens Efficiency Tester (LET) evaluates the sample's concentrated light {{with the help of a}} scientific charge couple device (CCD). Therefore, the lens is exposed to a monochromatic, collimated, continuous light with sun-like divergence. This light source and some correctional steps are described in this contribution...|$|R
