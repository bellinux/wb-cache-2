5|$|In {{addition}} to contextual animal ethics and her exploration {{of animals in}} environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities) and companion animals.

5|$|Locomotion {{abilities}} are best studied for Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands were {{partially}} metricated {{when they}} were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00g. Apart from rounding <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French système usuel. (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.|$|E

5|$|Reviews for the 3DS version were positive, with {{a rating}} of 85/100 on Metacritic. The game was praised for its large and diverse {{character}} roster, its improvements to game mechanics, and its variety of multiplayer options. Some criticisms include a lack of single player modes and <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> the 3DS hardware, such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when zoomed out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer. There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively. The 3DS version sold over a million copies in its first weekend on sale in Japan, and had sold more than 3.22 million copies worldwide {{by the end of}} October 2014.|$|E
5|$|The University of Minnesota's Hubert H.

During the proceedings, he pledged that he would abide by the DFL's endorsement, making him the sole candidate to vow so among the five candidates seeking the endorsement at the time. Schiff also participated in the city's first mayoral debate dealing specifically with <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> Minneapolis's Somali population, an event that took place on May 31 and was hosted at a Somali restaurant on Lake Street.

5|$|Young Bosnia's activists {{regarded}} {{literature as}} indispensable to revolution, {{and most of}} them wrote poems, short stories, or critiques. Stojanović wrote poems, and read the works of Petar Kočić, Aleksa Šantić, Vladislav Petković Dis, Sima Pandurović, Milan Rakić, and later the works of Russian authors. In his final years at the gymnasium, he read Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Bakunin, Nietzsche, Jaurès, Le Bon, Ibsen, and Marinetti. National Unity held meetings at which its members presented lectures and discussed current <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All members of the association were Serbs. Generally, Stojanović's lectures were about educating people on practical issues of health and the economy. During the summer break of 1911, Stojanović travelled across Bosanska Krajina lecturing in villages. One of the aims of Young Bosnia was to eliminate the backwardness of their country.|$|E
5|$|Varner's second monograph, Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare, was {{published}} in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner {{had been working on}} questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition was the first, while the second, the forthcoming Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities, in under contract with the publisher. While Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, Sustaining Animals is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition to real-world <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> human-animal relationships. Varner is also co-authoring a textbook under contract with Cambridge University Press entitled Environmental Ethics for Environmentalists with the University of Guelph ecologist Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist.|$|E
5|$|After a hotel {{housing the}} {{remaining}} foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which {{was conducted by}} an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but {{the role of the}} private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent {{the last year of his}} career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.|$|E

5|$|Serious <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> {{safety and}} {{security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E
5|$|With the new consensus, {{the major}} <b>issues</b> <b>concerning</b> Poland and Germany were {{settled in the}} second week of February 1815. Austria gained land in the {{partition}} of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.|$|E
