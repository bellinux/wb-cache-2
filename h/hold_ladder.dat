Weak from his wound, Conagher eventually collapses and passes out, but not before he demands the Ladder Five to clear off of the land. Parnell knows now that he can finish Conagher, as his gang has sworn to do, but instead orders his man to take Conagher to Seaborn Tay. The next day, the Ladder Five gang clears off the land.|$|R

Invariably after completing his [...] "crime" [...] he'd start yelling his joy at the success and implicate the passerby as an accomplice, while departing ("escaping") the scene. One instance saw him shouting from the upstairs window of a house asking a passerby to put a ladder back up for him and hold it while he climbs down (complete with a bag marked [...] "Swag"), upon reaching the bottom he runs away screaming [...] "We burgled the house!

She also walked {{on the wings of}} flying aircraft, parachuting off, or dangling below them, with her knees <b>holding</b> a rope <b>ladder.</b> Once while wing walking, she fell off at 3000 ft; ordinarily, she did not wear a parachute, but this time she did.

60|$|A {{minute later}} the Abbot, {{after a few}} earnest, hurried words with Martin, began to descend the ladder to the boat, that, manned by his own people, was already being drawn slowly through the water. As he did so he glanced back, and, in the {{clinging}} mist of dawn, which was almost as dense as wool, {{caught sight of the}} face {{of a man who had}} been ordered to <b>hold</b> the <b>ladder,</b> and knew it for that of Jeffrey Stokes, who had escaped from the slaying of Sir John--escaped with the damning papers that had cost his master's life. Yes, Jeffrey Stokes, no other. His lips shaped themselves to call out something, but before ever a syllable had passed them an accident happened.|$|R

40|$|I love {{making things}} up. I am a {{fabricator}} of moments: a storyteller who relies on construction rather than incantation. As a child, making was labor, <b>holding</b> <b>ladders,</b> watching, and helping carry heavy equipment. It was a requirement, a rite. Making was also playful - stacking something {{on top of}} something to make something. That something could be anything. There was, I learned, a satisfaction in bringing an object into the world. It was a marker of my existence. “Half True-All Real 2 ̆ 2 is a convergence of my compulsion to make things and my desire to give form to my narrative, which would otherwise be verbal and temporary. It transforms stories into relics, and allows me to relive, recreate and rebuild my past. I am drawn to typical items, to the stuff that fulfilled a strictly utilitarian purpose. Nothing is simple or ordinary; these objects act as narrative beacons, seamlessly dovetailing with my memories. They are symbols embodying a time, place, mood or idea. How can these ordinary things be remade, manipulated and/or contorted {{to the point where}} it still has the implications of its original intended use, but lacks its original objectness? Where is the line when an object becomes a thing? This is important because things and stories are similar. Both are limber, easily changed at the discretion of their creator. They can be pushed, pulled, exaggerated or erased for effect. A good story is honest, but it’s never completely true – and it shouldn’t be. If someone believes something they hear, it could’ve happened, even if it didn’t. Telling a story is like tinkering – both require finding relationships between things that are loosely connected, but can somehow work together. Both are reconstructions; both change with time. I love making things up. Adviser: Mo Nea...|$|R

5000|$|Cinematographer George J. Folsey, ASC thus {{recounted the}} history: While {{shooting}} a scene with {{an actor who}} was wearing a white shirt, he wanted to separate the skin tones on the actor’s face from the hue of the shirt. Folsey told a grip to hold a stepladder {{in front of a}} key light to create a shadow on the actor’s shirt. The closer that the ladder was held to the light, the softer and less defined the shadow became. The grip eventually tired of <b>holding</b> the <b>ladder,</b> so he cut a grill with the same pattern in a sheet of light wood. One day, Folsey visited Hal Rosson, ASC, who was shooting on another set. In the scene, an actress was lying on a bed swathed in white sheets. Rosson used Folsey’s wooden grill to create some shadows, which made the scene more dramatic. Later, while shooting a similar situation, Rosson asked Folsey, “Where’s that kookaloris thing?” Kodak: The Essential Reference Guide for Filmmakers ...|$|R
