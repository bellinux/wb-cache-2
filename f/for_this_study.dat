25|$|A 1985 {{government}} study classified 69.4 {{percent of}} the population as poor on the basis that they were unable to satisfy one or more of their basic needs in housing, sanitary services (water, sewage, and garbage collection), education, and employment. The defining standards <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were very low; housing was considered substandard if it was constructed of discarded materials with dirt floors or if it was occupied by more than four persons per room.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability. The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 {{the city}} of Turku ordered a more {{detailed}} study to be made about the way public transport systems are developed in the City Region of Turku in the future, comparing light rail- and bus-based alternatives. The goal is to present a solution {{for the creation of}} an efficient, attractive and uniform public transport system for Turku and the neighbouring cities. An intermediary report <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was completed in December 2008, which recommended a somewhat different light rail system from the 2002 study. In the 2008 study the line to Naantali was abandoned but a more extensive network within central Turku was proposed, including the recreation of tracks that had been used by the old Turku tram system.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, a {{new study}} for the Metro Manila Rail Network has been {{unveiled}} by DOTC Undersecretary for Public Information Dante Velasco that LRT 1, LRT 2, and MRT 3 will be under one management, the Light Rail Transit Authority. This is due to maintenance cost issues for Line 1's maintenance cost, which is approximately ₱35 million, along with Line 2's ₱25 million and Line 3's ₱54 million maintenance costs. Another reason <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is for the unification of the LRT 1 and the MRT 3 lines. According to DOTC Undersecretary for Rails Glicerio Sicat, the transfer was set {{by the government in}} June 2011. [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} private owners, MRTC, will approve this plan.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{style that}} is {{commonly}} used in elementary schools for students expressing anger outbursts. [...] Researchers who have looked into the reason for young student anger have found that one common reason could be the inability to adjust socially. [...] Students that were selected <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> received a daily one-hour session throughout one week of school. [...] The researchers of the mentalization program educated children through group therapy in positive psychology and tried to do activities that put the child in a happy mood while interacting. [...] At {{the end of the}} week, research showed that there was a negative correlation between anger and social adjustment. [...] This process lowered the overall anger levels of the students involved in social adjustment deficits.|$|E

2500|$|Hess [...] (1964) {{made the}} first {{measurements}} of P-wave azimuthal velocity variations in oceanic basins. [...] This area was chosen <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> because oceanic basins are made of large, relatively uniform homogeneous rocks. [...] Hess observed, from previous seismic velocity experiments with olivine crystals, that if the crystals had even a slight statistical orientation this would be extremely evident in the seismic velocities recorded using seismic refraction. [...] This concept was tested using seismic refraction profiles from the Mendocino Fracture Zone. [...] Hess found that the slow shear waves propagated perpendicular to the plane of slip and the higher velocity component was parallel to it. [...] He inferred that the structure of oceanic basins could be recorded quickly and understood better if these techniques were used.|$|E
