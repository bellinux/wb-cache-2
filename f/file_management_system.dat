40|$|The {{study of}} {{algorithms}} and data structures for low-level <b>file</b> <b>system</b> <b>management</b> is a well-explored research topic. File system data structures must be persistent across reboots. This has constrained {{the research of}} low-level <b>file</b> <b>system</b> <b>management</b> to algorithms which operate on diskbased structures. The advent of low latency, non-volatile memories such as Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) justify revisiting the study of data structures and algorithms for low-level <b>file</b> <b>system</b> <b>management.</b> The Linking <b>File</b> <b>System</b> (LiFS) is a project which has taken advantage of MRAM technology to offer highperformance, enhanced semantic organization of files.

We compare our algorithm’s performance with earlier disk-based and MRAMbased techniques. We discuss the relative benefits and weaknesses of each approach...|$|R
40|$|CEM is {{an email}} <b>management</b> <b>system</b> which stores its email in a concept lattice {{rather than in}} the usual tree structure. By using such a {{conceptual}} multi-hierarchy, the system provides more flexibility in retrieving stored emails. The paper presents the underlying mathematical structures, discusses requirements for their maintenance and presents their implementation. 1 Motivation The way standard email <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> store mails is directly derived from the tree structure of <b>file</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> This has the advantage that trees have a simple structure which can easily be explained to novice users. The disadvantage is that at the moment of storing an email the user already has to foresee the way she is going to retrieve the mail later. The tree structure forces her to decide at that moment which criteria to consider as primary and which as secondary. For instance, when storing an email regarding the organization of a conference, one has to decide whether to organize one' [...] ...|$|R

Furthermore, she said that she would claim that work was influenced by both FLOW-MATIC and COMTRAN only to [...] "keep other people happy they wouldn't try to knock us out".Features from COMTRAN incorporated into COBOL included formulas, the [...] clause, an improved [...] statement, which obviated the need for GO TOs, and a more robust <b>file</b> <b>management</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Applications such as {{electronic}} purses (cash units stored in cards), subscriber identification cards used in cellular telephone or access keys for pay-TV and information highways emerge {{in many places}} with millions of users. More services are required by applications providers and card holders. Mainly, new integrated circuit cards evolve towards non-predefined multi-purpose, open and multi-user applications. Today, operating systems implemented into integrated circuit cards cannot respond to these new trends. They have evolved from simple operating systems defining an hardware abstraction level up to <b>file</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> or database <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> where the card behavior was defined once at the manufacturing level or by the card issuer.
