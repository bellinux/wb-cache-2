5|$|The {{rear guard}} is {{consumed}} by the Angels, and they trap the survivors at the highest point of the cave, right underneath the hull of the Byzantium. The Angels tell their prey they will use their life energy to regenerate. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> they never should have trapped him, tells the others to prepare to jump, and detonates the gravity globe.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy {{manages to}} swerve and drives off while the Viperox chase after them. Helicopters fly over head and fire at flying Viperox. Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him if the Doctor detonates it. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E

The <b>doctor</b> <b>says</b> that Sue is having a girl, but her amniocentesis results show [...] "irregularities".

Sue tells the glee club she will moderate her harsh coaching methods as long as they give her their all.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, believing Amy's {{attraction}} {{to him is}} due to the stress from travel, gatecrashes her fiancé Rory's stag party and invites the two of them on a romantic trip, courtesy of the TARDIS. They land in Venice in 1580 and soon find trouble. The city's patron, Signora Rosanna Calvierri, claims that the Black Plague runs rampant outside of Venice. [...] The <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> this is false and that it appears she is using the plague as an excuse to seal off the city. While investigating they encounter Guido, a boat-builder whose daughter Isabella hasn't contacted him since enrolling in Signora Calvierri's school for girls.|$|E
500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the <b>doctor</b> <b>says</b> something, but the words [...] "I have to lie to you {{to make you feel}} better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting in the waiting room was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with circles under her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springfield {{is held in}} a grip of terror by Bart, who has omnipotent powers. Bart turns whoever is not happy with his rule into another being, and even history is changed to suit Bart's pleasure. When Homer refuses to turn off a {{football}} game so that Bart can watch [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (which has been running for 346 consecutive hours), Bart transports him into the football stadium {{in place of the}} ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps back into the house, trying to surprise Bart with a blow {{to the back of the}} head, Bart transforms him into a jack-in-the-box. Marge suggests that the two see Dr. Marvin Monroe. The <b>doctor</b> <b>says</b> that Bart is desperate for paternal attention from Homer and suggests that the two spend more time together. Despite being a jack-in-the-box, Homer spends quality time with Bart, and they soon become a normal, loving family. Bart turns Homer back into a human and the two share a warm family moment, causing Bart to wake up screaming. Bart and Lisa wake Homer and Marge and beg them to let them sleep in their bed. As the two crawl into bed, Homer laments that he has to go to work in a few hours and dozes off, becoming the last one in the episode to have a nightmare.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{reveals the}} origins to several {{facets of the}} River Song character. Before {{transforming}} into River, Mels states {{that she was the}} young girl seen regenerating at the end of [...] "Day of the Moon", becoming [...] "a toddler" [...] who presumably grew up to become Mels. River's worn TARDIS-coloured diary, which the Doctor and his companions have seen in her relative future, is given to her brand-new by the Doctor. The Doctor introduces her to the concept of [...] "spoilers", seen originally in the 10th Doctor story [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead", and becoming a virtual catchphrase for River. River's aptitude for flying the TARDIS—having been taught how by the machine itself—is demonstrated in [...] "The Time of Angels"; River explains she [...] "had lessons from the very best" [...] (which the Doctor assumes refers to himself) and that the Doctor was [...] "busy that day". The Teselecta crew consider River a wanted, dangerous criminal; River is shown being in prison in her personal future in [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] for killing [...] "the best man I ever knew". In this episode's epilogue, River joins the Luna University to become an archaeologist, in order to find the Doctor. Her previous appearances (events which take place later in River's personal timeline) show that she will/has acquired her degrees. When River wakes up in hospital, the <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Rule One: The Doctor lies". This rule is 'repeated' by River herself in [...] "The Big Bang", a future event in her own personal timeline.|$|E
500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by the Silence and Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to ask him about the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E

[...] The Seventh Doctor celebrated his 1,000th birthday in Set Piece by Kate Orman, and the Eighth Doctor declared his age to be 1,012 in Vampire Science by Orman and Jonathan Blum. The Eighth Doctor spent nearly a century on Earth during a story arc spread over several novels, and around 100 years asleep in The Sleep of Reason by Martin Day. In the Big Finish Productions audio play Orbis, the Eighth <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> that he has spent 600 years living on the planet Orbis since the previous play. He states that he lost count of his true age long ago, and rounds it down, taking into account the varying lengths of a [...] "year" [...] in different locations.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "The Witch's Familiar", the Twelfth Doctor {{offers a}} small amount of {{regenerative}} energy to Dalek creator Davros to sustain him in his dying minutes a bit longer. The <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> that doing so [...] "may cost [...] an arm or a leg down the road". Davros, however, siphons off much more regeneration energy from the Doctor to revitalize himself and transform the Daleks on Skaro into superior hybrid creatures. His plan backfires when decaying Daleks—incapable of dying, and kept in an underground 'sewer' system when their effective 'lives' have expired—are also reenergized and attack the Daleks on the surface. The Doctor reveals that he expected such a plot and knew it would backfire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scenes with}} the Beast and the Doctor were filmed at Clearwell Caves, last {{seen as the}} Sycorax ship in [...] "The Christmas Invasion". The Sanctuary Base 6 {{corridor}} set was recycled to become {{the entrance to the}} set for Totally Doctor Who. According to the DVD commentary, the final scene in the TARDIS where the <b>Doctor</b> <b>says</b> [...] "the stuff of legend" [...] was the last major scene shot for the 2006 series, and the last to feature Billie Piper (whose actual final episode had been filmed weeks earlier).

2500|$|In [...] "The Time of the Doctor", the Eleventh Doctor {{describes}} his new regeneration ability as {{the start of}} a new 'cycle', implying that he's been restored to the customary twelve regenerations.

In [...] "Hell Bent", Rassilon asks the Doctor [...] "How many regenerations did we give you?", and during [...] "The Doctor Falls", two incarnations of the Master express uncertainty about how long it would take them to kill the Doctor, further implying that the Doctor has a finite number of regenerations even as the exact amount remains undetermined.|$|E
