500|$|MK Dons {{initially}} {{maintained that}} any debate was pointless as their club {{was simply a}} renamed Wimbledon F.C.. Winkelman was unequivocal when answering readers' questions in FourFourTwo magazine in November 2004: [...] "MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon share the same heritage, but we're the real child of Wimbledon", he wrote. One reader asked: [...] "Now that you have renamed the team, and changed the badge and colours, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> AFC Wimbledon now carry the true spirit of Wimbledon?"; Winkelman replied that AFC Wimbledon's founders had betrayed their club and [...] "left their team before their team left them". In another answer, he poured scorn on suggestions that he might give Wimbledon F.C.'s trophy replicas to AFC Wimbledon, writing that the fans had [...] "abdicated their right to it when they all walked away." [...] "The fans who have continued to support us from London—they're the ones who've {{had to put up}} with this shit for so long," [...] he concluded.|$|E

40|$|The {{recent visit}} to New Zealand by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has ignited the debate about whether New Zealand should become a {{republic}} or remain governed by the Monarch. During the tour, many opinions were put forth including one by Prime Minister John Key who stated that while New Zealand becoming a republic is probably inevitable, the time frame may be "considerably further out" because {{of the impact of}} the ‘Royal Tour’. Given this, Research New Zealand was interested in determining what, if any, impact the ‘Royal Tour’ had on the general public’s views of New Zealand becoming a republic. As such, a question about this topic was included in our April 2014 monthly omnibus survey. The baseline measure to help evaluate current opinion was established earlier in August 2011, and a further measure was taken in February 2014 just before the visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The following question was asked: 	The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, together with their son Prince George, have just visited New Zealand. The Prime Minister, John Key, was quoted saying they captivated the nation and as a result, the likelihood of New Zealand becoming a republic, while inevitable, may be "further out". 	  	On a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 is strongly disagree and 10 is strongly <b>agree,</b> how much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> or disagree <b>that</b> New Zealand should become a republic?

The object of my journey had been gained; and I {{had no desire to}} be employed as picture-cleaner. Miss Redwood assisted me in arriving at a decision. I was sent for to speak to her again. The success of her prophecy had raised her spirits. She asked, with ironical humility, if I proposed to honor them by still remaining their guest, after the disturbance that I had provoked. I answered that I proposed to leave by the first train the next morning. 'Will it be convenient for you to travel to some place at a good distance from this part of the world?' she asked. I had my own reasons for going to London, and said so. 'Will you mention that to my brother this evening, just before we sit down to dinner?' she continued. 'And will you tell him plainly that you have no intention of returning to the North? I shall make use of Mrs. Rook's arm, as usual, to help me downstairs--and I will take care that she hears what you say. Without venturing on another prophecy, I will only hint to you that I have my own idea of what will happen; and I should like you to see for yourself, sir, whether my anticipations are realized.' Need I tell you that this strange old woman proved to be right once more? Mr. Rook was released; Mrs. Rook made humble apologies, and laid the whole blame on her husband's temper: and Sir Jervis bade me remark that his method had succeeded in bringing the housekeeper to her senses. Such were the results produced by the announcement of my departure for London--purposely made in Mrs. Rook's hearing. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> with me, <b>that</b> my journey to Northumberland has not been taken in vain?" ...|$|R
