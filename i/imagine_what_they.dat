I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were going through. I got so, so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack to Nier {{is largely}} {{composed}} of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer {{for the band}} freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as Etrian Odyssey. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video game projects such as the Etrian Odyssey arrange albums. The Monaca team had met her when considering her for a prior project, and Okabe {{wanted to work with}} her on Nier. She was approached {{a few months after the}} initial meeting in Autumn 2008 to be the vocalist for the soundtrack. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Scottish Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of Scottish Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote [...] "Song of the Ancients" [...] in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she tried to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.|$|E
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are going to do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E

The pen carried by the turtle can also be controlled, by enabling it, setting its color, or setting its width. A student could understand (and predict and reason about) the turtle's motion by <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do {{if they were the}} turtle.

40|$|This is a {{reply to}} Jesse Prinz and Paul Bloom’s {{skepticism}} about the moral importance of empathy. It concedes that empathy is spontaneously biased to individuals who are spatio-temporally close, as well as discriminatory in other ways, and incapable of accommodating large numbers of individuals. But {{it is argued that}} we could partly correct these shortcomings of empathy by a guidance of reason because empathy for others consists in <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel, and, importantly, such acts of imagination can be voluntary – and, thus, under the influence of reflection – as well as automatic. Since empathizing with others motivates concern for their welfare, a reflectively justified empathy will lead to a likewise justified altruistic concern. In addition, we argue that such concern supports another central moral attitude, namely a sense of justice or fairness...|$|R

James had an insane desire to hurt her, to ruffle that self-satisfaction; and he wanted to say something that should wound her to the quick.

I was amazed at them, and frighted, and did not understand them, nor could I <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> intended to do to me. However, stripping me, they were soon satisfied, and Father Antony bade me be easy, for they could all witness that I was no Turk. So I escaped that part of my master's cruelty.|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do in another’s shoes, if <b>they</b> believed <b>what</b> that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|R

She carried his request to her father, and was answered that of course he might take a holiday if he could leave the works with safety; he had better spend a few days in the town when he did come. With this answer she made him happy; and they set off, to the extreme joy of Rosita, who had engrossed much less attention than she had expected, and declared she would never have come into these horrible places if she could have <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were like. Certainly, no one wished to have her company there again.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} as we reimagine nineteenth-century {{periodicals}} and newspapers as digital objects we should {{pay particular attention to}} how we model their forms. As something that is repeated with each issue, form is both a key component of a particular publication’s identity and the mechanism through which it accommodates the events that it reports. Through a reading of John Tyndall’s “Discourse on the Scientific Use of the Imagination,” I argue that form is the means through which scientists <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did not know, substituting system and structure for the unordered abundance of the natural world. Journalism, oriented towards an equally complex and changing world, similarly attempts to represent it as ordered and knowable. The orientation of titles towards particularly newsworthy institutions acts as a filter, identifying certain types of information at the expense of countless others, and the organization of publications into sections allocates space for events to be reported even before they occur. In this way the forms of the press operate in a similar fashion to the scientific imagination, displacing the new with the familiar, the unknown with the yet-to-be-known, and chaos with system...|$|R

60|$|I {{have heard}} that in some debating clubs there is a rule that the members may discuss {{anything}} except religion and politics. I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do discuss; but it is quite evident that they have ruled out the only two subjects which are either important or amusing. The thing {{is a part of}} a certain modern tendency to avoid things because they lead to warmth; whereas, obviously, we ought, even in a social sense, to seek those things specially. The warmth of the discussion {{is as much a part}} of hospitality as the warmth of the fire. And it is singularly suggestive that in English literature the two things have died together. The very people who would blame Dickens for his sentimental hospitality are the very people who would also blame him for his narrow political conviction. The very people who would mock him for his narrow radicalism are those who would mock him for his broad fireside. Real conviction and real charity are much nearer than people suppose. Dickens was capable of loving all men; but he refused to love all opinions. The modern humanitarian can love all opinions, but he cannot love all men; he seems, sometimes, in the ecstasy of his humanitarianism, even to hate them all. He can love all opinions, including the opinion that men are unlovable.|$|E
60|$|That {{statement}} from the cattleman allayed Madeline's pangs of conscience. She understood just what she felt, though {{she could not have}} put it in words. She was hungry for a sight of well-remembered faces; she longed to hear the soft laughter and gay repartee of old friends; she was eager for gossipy first-hand news of her old world. Nevertheless, something in her sister's letter, in messages from the others who were coming, had touched Madeline's pride. In one sense the expected guests were hostile, inasmuch as they were scornful and curious about the West that had claimed her. She <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would expect in a Western ranch. They would surely get the real thing, too, as Stillwell said; and in that certainty was satisfaction for a small grain of something within Madeline which approached resentment. She wistfully wondered, however, if her sister or friends would come to see the West even a little as she saw it. That, perhaps, would he hoping too much. She resolved once for all to do her best to give them the sensation their senses craved, and equally to show them the sweetness and beauty and wholesomeness and strength of life in the Southwest.|$|R

50|$|At {{the height}} of its popularity, the musette (like the hurdy-gurdy) was used not just for chamber-music but also in larger-scale {{compositions}} such as operas, where it was associated with shepherds, peasants and other pastoral elements. After the French Revolution, the musette seems to have fallen rapidly out of favour while simpler forms of bagpipe remained popular as folk-instruments. As a result, musicologists examining French baroque music {{at the end of}} the 19th century found it difficult to <b>imagine</b> that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> took to be the same as a simple folk bagpipe could ever have had a place in highly sophisticated music for the court.|$|R
