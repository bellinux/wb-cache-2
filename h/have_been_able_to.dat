5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today.

However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that {{the atmosphere of the}} young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E

Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> leave her for another woman.
