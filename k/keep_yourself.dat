2500|$|Tackett {{recalled}} that nine {{people tried to}} convince him that they were the Phantom. He said, [...] "But in every case they could not have been for their stories didn't jibe with what we knew were the detailed facts in the case. You don't tell everything you know about a case. When it gets into the paper, the real criminal finds out how much you know and the confessors will fit those facts into their confessions. You <b>keep</b> <b>yourself</b> two or three pertinent facts to protect yourself from crackpots." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boros noted: [...] "When {{they talk}} about toughness, they always talk about arguing bad calls, {{spitting}} in an umpire's eye, kicking dust — all that macho image stuff. ... If the fans saw {{that kind of behavior}} in a football coach, they'd be repelled by it. Isn't it funny that one kind of behavior is expected from a football coach and another from a baseball manager? And they both have essentially the same job. It seems to me it takes a certain amount of mental toughness to keep control of your emotions. You owe it to management, your players and the fans to <b>keep</b> <b>yourself</b> under control at critical moments." ...|$|E

[...] Elena tries to hide her emotions, but Douglas immediately understands where her heart lies. [...] At the same time, Rodrigo offers friendship to Malcolm and introduces Elena as his bride-to-be; but he, too, perceives a connection between Malcolm and Elena. In a quartet accompanied by the chorus of soldiers and women, each expresses his or her conflicting emotions: [...] (Rodrigo: Crudele sospetto, Che me agiti il petto / [...] "Cruel suspicion That sets me shuddering"; then Elena and Malcolm together: Ah cèlati, o affetto, nel misero petto! / [...] "Ah my affection - <b>keep</b> <b>yourself</b> hidden"; then Douglas: Ah l'ira, il dispetto, mi straziano il petto! / [...] "Ah! Anger and resentment Tear my heart apart"; finally Albina and chorus: Crudele sospetto gli serpe nel petto! / [...] "Cruel suspicion twists Like a snake").|$|E

2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to <b>keep</b> <b>yourself</b> amused. However long Peter Pan has been there and for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E
