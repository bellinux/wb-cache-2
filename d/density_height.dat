50|$|After {{discovering}} {{the distribution of}} the species and where it primarily lives, the next step in conserving it is determining the densities of the species, creating protected areas specifically for this animal, and expanding existing ones. To find the density of the C. Oenanthe, a triangulation method is used, where three points are set up and the species is observed within the area created by these points. While density was measured by using this method and also examining the trees by their <b>density,</b> <b>height,</b> and distance from one another, human disturbance is also monitored.

50|$|The TaiWan Ionospheric Model (TWIM) {{developed}} in 2008 is a three-dimensional numerical and phenomenological model of ionospheric electron density (Ne). The TWIM has been constructed from global distributed ionosonde foF2 and foE data and vertical Ne profiles retrieved from FormoSat3/COSMIC GPS radio occultation measurements. The TWIM consists of vertically fitted α-Chapman-type layers, with distinct F2, F1, E, and D layers, {{for which the}} layer parameters such as peak density, peak <b>density</b> <b>height,</b> and scale height are represented by surface spherical harmonics. These results are useful for providing reliable radio propagation predictions and in investigation of near-Earth space and large-scale Ne distribution with diurnal and seasonal variations, along with geographic features such as the equatorial anomaly. This way the continuity of Ne and its derivatives is also maintained for practical schemes for providing reliable radio propagation predictions.|$|E

40|$|Ground-based {{ionosphere}} sounding measurements {{alone are}} incapable of reliably modeling the topside electron density distribution above the F layer peak <b>density</b> <b>height.</b> Such information {{can be derived from}} Global Positioning System (GPS) -based total electron content (TEC) measurements. A novel technique is presented for retrieving the electron <b>density</b> <b>height</b> profile from three types of measurements: ionosonde (foF 2, foE, M 3000 F 2, hmf 2), TEC (GPS-based), and O+-H+ ion transition level. The method employs new formulae based on Chapman, sech-squared, and exponential ionosphere profilers to construct a system of equations, the solution of which system provides the unknown ion scale heights, sufficient to construct a unique electron density profile at the site of measurements. All formulae are based on the assumption of diffusive equilibrium with constant scale height for each ion species. The presented technique is most suitable for middle- and high-geomagnetic latitudes and possible applications include: development, evaluation, and improvement of theoretical and empirical ionospheric models, development of similar reconstruction methods utilizing low-earth-orbiting satellite measurements of TEC, operational reconstruction of the electron density on a real-time basis, etc...|$|E

40|$|Context. In {{transverse}} coronal loop oscillations, two periodicities {{have been}} measured simultaneously and are {{interpreted as the}} fundamental kink mode (with period P 1) and the first harmonic (with period P 2). Deviations of the period ratio P 1 / 2 P 2 from unity provide information {{about the extent of}} longitudinal structuring within the loop. Aims. Here we develop an analytical approximation that describes the shift in P 1 / 2 P 2 in terms of the ratio L/Λc of the length 2 L of a coronal loop and the <b>density</b> scale <b>height</b> Λc. Methods. We study the MHD wave equations in a low β plasma using the thin tube approximation. Disturbances are described by a differential equation which may be solved for various equilibrium density profiles, obtaining dispersion relations in terms of Bessel functions. These dispersion relations may be used to obtain analytical approximations to the periods P 1 and P 2. We also present a variational approach to determining the period ratio and show how the WKB method may be used. Results. Analytical approximations to the period ratio P 1 / 2 P 2 are used to shed light on the magnitude of longitudinal structuring in a loop, leading to a determination of the <b>density</b> scale <b>height.</b> We apply our formula to the observations in Verwichte et al. (2004) and Van Doorsselaere et al. (2007), obtaining the coronal <b>density</b> scale <b>height.</b> Conclusions. Our simple formula and approximate approaches highlight a useful analytical tool for coronal seismology. We demonstrate that P 1 / 2 P 2 is linked to the <b>density</b> scale <b>height,</b> with no need for estimates of other external parameters.

40|$|The F 2 -layer peak <b>density</b> <b>height</b> hmF 2 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} ionospheric parameters characterizing HF propagation conditions. Therefore, the ability to model and predict the spatial and temporal variations of the peak electron <b>density</b> <b>height</b> is of great use for both ionospheric research and radio frequency planning and operation. For global hmF 2 modelling we present a nonlinear model approach with 13 model coefficients and a few empirically fixed parameters. The model approach describes the temporal and spatial dependencies of hmF 2 on global scale. For determining the 13 model coefficients, we apply this model approach to a large quantity of global hmF 2 observational data obtained from GNSS radio occultation measurements onboard CHAMP, GRACE and COSMIC satellites and data from 69 worldwide ionosonde stations. We have found that the model fits to these input data with the same root mean squared (RMS) and standard deviations of 10 %. In comparison with the electron density NeQuick model, the proposed Neustrelitz global hmF 2 model (Neustrelitz Peak Height Model – NPHM) shows percentage RMS deviations of about 13 % and 12 % from the observational data during high and low solar activity conditions, respectively, whereas the corresponding deviations for the NeQuick model are found 18 % and 16 %, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Due to its rapid growth, Sonneratia caseolaris, a {{mangrove}} species {{indigenous to}} Hainan, {{was introduced to}} Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong for afforestation purpose during the early 1990 s. The seedling emergence, early growth and dispersal pattern of S. caseolaris and their responses to environmental factors have not been well studied in the new habitat. In this study, we evaluated the <b>density,</b> <b>height</b> and coverage of S. caseolaris seedlings underneath the canopies of various mangrove forests (including both natural Kandelia candel and Avicennia marina communities and introduced S. caseolaris communities) and on the mudflats without canopy, in Futian Mangroves Natural Reserve of Shenzhen Bay from September 2006 to September 2007. Line intercept and square intercept methods {{were used in the}} survey. Tidal elevation, light intensity, community types and the distance between the sample squares and the nearest adult S. caseolaris were also recorded. The mean densities of S. caseolaris seedlings under the canopies of both the introduced and natural mangrove forests decreased from September 2006 (24. 7 seedlings per m 2 and 19. 7 seedlings per m 2, respectively) to September 2007 (no seedlings survived). No significant differences were found in theseedling <b>density,</b> <b>height</b> or coverage of S. caseolaris among different mangrove communities. However, the <b>density,</b> <b>height</b> and coverage of S. caseolaris seedlings were significantly higher on the mudflats without canopy than under the mangrove canopies, indicating that higher light intensity in on the mudflats without canopy promoted the dispersal and vertical growth of S. caseolaris seedlings. Although the optimal tidal elevation for S. caseolaris seedlings in Shenzhen Bay was between 1. 40 m and 1. 60 m, an area that falls within the mid-to-high intertidal zones, seedling density and tidal elevation were weakly correlated. The seedling density under the native mangrove canopies was negatively related to dispersal distance. However seedling density were positively correlated with light intensity(P< 0. 05), and the correlation coefficients for the introduced S. caseolaris forest increased through time with successive surveys. In contrast, there was no significant correlation founded between seedling density and light intensity under native mangrove canopies. We concluded that distance to mother tree was the most important factor determining S. caseolaris seedling density under native mangrove canopies, whereas the light intensity was the most important environmental factor for controlling seedling dispersal pattern under the canopy of the introduced S. caseolaris forest...|$|E
