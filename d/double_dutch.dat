25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (<b>double</b> <b>dutch),</b> and three person freestyle (<b>double</b> <b>dutch</b> freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age. There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E
25|$|Various {{forms of}} the rose cut have been in use since the mid-16th century. Like the step cuts, they were derived from older types of cuts. The basic rose cut has a flat base - that is, it lacks a {{pavilion}} - and has a crown composed of triangular facets (usually 12 or 24) rising to form a point (there is no table facet) in an arrangement with sixfold rotational symmetry. The so-called double rose cut is a variation that adds six kite facets at {{the margin of the}} base. The classic rose cut is circular in outline; non-circular variations on the rose cut include the briolette (oval), Antwerp rose (hexagonal), and <b>double</b> <b>Dutch</b> rose (resembling two rose cuts united back-to-back). Rose-cut diamonds are seldom seen nowadays, except in antique jewelry. Like the older style brilliants and step cuts, there is a growing demand for the purpose of repairing or reproducing antique pieces.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} &lsquo;stateless income&rsquo; tax strategies pursued by firms publicly {{listed in the}} United States. Stateless income strategies are employed by multinational corporations, American firms in particular, through a <b>Double</b> Irish <b>Dutch</b> Sandwich structure to reduce tax liabilities. By examining 700 listed U.

Additionally, multinational corporations engaged in <b>Double</b> Irish <b>Dutch</b> Sandwich structure are associated with lower effective tax rate compared to their domestic counterparties. Regression analysis demonstrates that a firm&rsquo;s effective tax rates are associated with firm size, firm leverage, capital structure, capital mix and foreign income. We also find the development and investment in intellectual property is an important component in generating &lsquo;stateless income&rsquo; and firms engaged in &lsquo;stateless income&rsquo; strategies hold large amounts of cash outside of the US...|$|R

Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of Bb3 to F5. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] progresses on a lurching and turgid beat. Its instrumentation includes drum patterns, surging horns, and synthesizers. The song also utilizes handclaps and syncopated interlocked clicks, which are interspersed with background chants, vocal exclamations, vocal gymnastics, and Texas twang. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that some notes which begin as [...] "legato exhalations" [...] constrict into shouts.

500|$|B-boys Jamie [...] "Jimmy D" [...] White and Santiago [...] "Jo Jo" [...] Torres founded Rock Steady Crew (RSC) in 1977 in the Bronx. Along with Dynamic Rockers and Afrika Bambaataa's Mighty Zulu Kings, {{they are}} one of the oldest {{continually}} active breaking crews. For others to get into the crew, they had to battle one of the Rock Steady b-boys—that was their audition, so to speak. The crew flourished once it came under the leadership of b-boy Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón. Crazy Legs opened a Manhattan chapter of the crew and made his friends and fellow b-boys Wayne [...] "Frosty Freeze" [...] Frost and Kenneth [...] "Ken Swift" [...] Gabbert co-vice presidents. RSC was instrumental in the spread of breaking's popularity beyond New York City. They appeared in Wild Style and Beat Street—1980s films about hip-hop culture—as well as in the movie Flashdance. They also performed at the Ritz, at the Kennedy Center, and on the Jerry Lewis Telethon. In 1981, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts hosted a breaking battle between Dynamic Rockers and Rock Steady Crew. The Daily News and National Geographic covered this event. In 1982, their manager Ruza [...] "Kool Lady" [...] Blue organized the New York City Rap Tour, which featured Rock Steady Crew, Afrika Bambaataa, Cold Crush Brothers, the <b>Double</b> <b>Dutch</b> Girls, and Fab 5 Freddy. This tour traveled to England and France, which spread hip-hop culture to these countries. In 1983, they performed for Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Performance. The following year, they recorded a song titled [...] "(Hey You) The Rock Steady Crew", which was commercially released. RSC now has satellite crews based in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} divided into four sections: Pimp, Old School, Gypsy and Rave. It began with [...] "The Sweet Machine", a 3D {{animation}} video displaying candy being manufactured and used as a Pinball.

A modernized [...] "Vogue", featuring the hook of [...] "4 Minutes", was the final song for this section. It led to a video interlude for [...] "Die Another Day", featuring Madonna as a boxer on screen, while her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The next section, inspired by the style and culture of early 1980s New York, began with Madonna skipping on stage for [...] "Into the Groove". This performance was a mashup with [...] "Toop Toop" [...] by Cassius and featured the artwork of friend Keith Haring. She then performed a <b>double</b> <b>Dutch</b> dance interlude which led to [...] "Heartbeat". During that song, Madonna's dance movements were controlled by her back-up dancers as if they were puppeteers. She performed [...] "Borderline" [...] in a rock version, on electric guitar. [...] "She's Not Me" [...] followed, where Madonna made fun of her various incarnations and styles, from the music videos of [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Material Girl", [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". The section ended with [...] "Music" [...] which contained elements of [...] "Put Your Hands Up 4 Detroit" [...] and excerpts from [...] "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life".

A remix made by R3hab was included on the album, while the original was reserved for the deluxe version. [...] "Never Will Be Mine" [...] is a hip hop ballad that showcases a sweeter side of the Baltimore rapper, contrasting her bubbly and flamboyant nature.

In such cases, the doubling clitic can double either the entire coordination or just the first conjunct.

Our analysis starts out from the three-way classification of the pronominal system by Déchaine & Wiltschko (2002) into DPs, φPs and NPs. We argue that the doubling clitic is a spell-out of a subpart of the doubled subject and that the two form one syntactic chain. This analysis not only provides new insights into well-known cases of ‘regular’ clitic doubling, it also extends straightforwardly to the coordination data discussed {{at the beginning of}} the paper. status: accepte...|$|R

6000|$|From {{the edge}} of that abrupt steep I saw {{something}} indescribable, which I am now going to describe. When Mr. Joseph Chamberlain delivered his great patriotic speech on the inferiority of England to the Dutch parts of South Africa, he made use of the expression [...] "the illimitable veldt." [...] The word [...] "veldt" [...] is Dutch, and the word [...] "illimitable" [...] is <b>Double</b> <b>Dutch.</b> But the meditative statesman probably meant that the new plains gave him a sense of largeness and dreariness which he had never found in England. Well, if he never found it in England {{it was because he}} never looked for it in England. In England there is an illimitable number of illimitable veldts. I saw six or seven separate eternities in cresting as many different hills. One cannot find anything more infinite than a finite horizon, free and lonely and innocent. The Dutch veldt may be a little more desolate than Birmingham. But I am sure it is not so desolate as that English hill was, almost within a cannon-shot of High Wycombe.|$|E
