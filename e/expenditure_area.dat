40|$|One of the {{consequences}} {{as a result of}} the implementation of regional autonomy is that local governments must have sufficient financial resources to pay their autonomy government. The financial capacity of local governments would determine the ability of local governments to perform the functions of government. Considering Article 5 of Law No. 33, 2004, sources of regional revenue are regional revenues, balance funds/ transfers and financing. When local revenue comes from the transfers, the stimulation of expenditure is different from the stimulation that arises from local revenue (especially local taxes).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rationale for}} a top-down approach to budget preparation and approval, and discusses some factors {{that have to be}} considered when reorienting the budget process along these lines. The paper argues that the sequence in which budgetary decisions are taken matters, and that a strong top-down approach strengthens fiscal discipline and improves policy prioritization and coordination. Top-down budgeting also alters the division of roles and responsibilities between the central budget authority and line ministries, and requires that the process of determining the total expenditure level, sectoral allocations and individual appropriations is clarified. Finally, the paper argues that strong top-down elements in the parliamentary budget voting process can be effective in addressing the risk of excessive and unsustainable amendments during budget approval.

40|$|Conventional {{treatments}} of fungibility, {{such as in}} Assessing Aid, are concerned with evidence that aid recipients do not increase sufficiently (that is, {{by the amount of}} aid) <b>expenditure</b> on specific <b>areas</b> favoured by donors. In other words, fungibility implies that recipients divert aid to <b>expenditure</b> on <b>areas</b> donors do not wish to fund. However, there is evidence that aggregate expenditure, and even spending on donor-supported areas, rises by more than the value of the aid inflow. This contribution, using insights from the public choice research on fiscal illusion, provides a range of theoretical scenarios to explain this outcome. Included are scenarios where, even where all the features of fungibility are present, <b>expenditure</b> on <b>areas</b> favoured by the donor can increase by more than the value of the aid inflow.

An attempt is made to answer the research questions by comparing data from national plans, budgets, and expenditures during a fifteen-year period (1970 - 1984). In Jordan, as in other developing nations, the role of planning and budgeting is highly significant {{to the success of the}} country's hopes for development. This research tries to evaluate the role of planning and budgeting as policy instruments in the process of development in Jordan. The second focus of the dissertation concerns the possibilities and problems of assessing the impact of governmental policies on development.

The following questions are addressed in order to examine the impact of government action on economic development. First, what are the impact and significance of government expenditures, as a combined measure, on the gross national product in Jordan? Second, which governmental <b>expenditure</b> <b>areas</b> provide the greatest contribution to an increase in the Jordanian GNP?

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{summarizes}} {{the literature that}} has concentrated on budget consolidations and their fiscal and economic effects. The issue of fiscal adjustments has again gained importance due to the recent economic crisis and the resulting fiscal imbalances. The existing literature shows {{that there may be}} some factors that influence the fiscal and economic impact depending on the methods used and the underlying assumptions. Referring to the fiscal impact of consolidations, this paper concludes that the composition of the adjustment is the most influential factor in reducing public deficits and debt. This result is in line with other recent literature surveys. Other factors mentioned in the underlying studies include the specialization in certain <b>expenditure</b> <b>areas</b> like public administration and social security, the size of the adjustment, the initial state of public finances and the economy before consolidation, fiscal rules, political and monetary institutions. In contrast to the fiscal effects, the results of the studies concentrating on economic effects vary substantially. Since the early 90 's there has been a lively debate about the possibility of non-Keynesian effects after consolidations. Despite {{the fact that there is}} no consensus about possible expansive effects of consolidations, this paper concludes that a substantial share of the previous work finds that large negative effects do not necessarily have to prevail. Whether these reversed effects are strong enough to turn restrictive effects into expansive ones depends on different factors, which are similar to those mentioned before in the fiscal effects context.
