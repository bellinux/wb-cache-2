5000|$|The {{combination}} {{of being an}} actor and a parent proved to be frustrating at times for von Furstenberg, who believed that the two roles sometimes blended together in daily life and posed special challenges both in and outside the home. In 1972, six years after her divorce from Guy Vincent, she expressed her views on the subject in a personal essay titled [...] "Actors Are Not the Only Ones Who Act", {{which was published in}} The New York Times on September 24, 1972. [...] In one portion of her essay she shares the following: ...I have gotten my way by 'acting' in some very significant moments in my life when perhaps {{in the long run it}} would have been better if I hadn't gotten my way...One of the most frustrating drawbacks of being an actor‐parent is to have your children accuse you of acting when you're being perfectly sincere. Of course, they've seen you being 'perfectly sincere' on stage so for the poor things I guess the better you are the more confusing it is for them (and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> both are real and yet not the same?). Ultimately your actions must bear out the truth of what you say to them. After a prolonged period of being single, von Furstenberg finally married for the second time in 1984, then to New York real-estate broker John J. Reynolds. They remained together until his death in 1994. [...] She lived another twenty-one years. On April 21, 2015, von Furstenberg died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 83 from complications attributed to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
40|$|AbstractConvincing {{people to}} try {{something}} new, strange and expensive is not easy. Convincing them to embrace something that they fear and struggle to understand is almost impossible. Many people seem to fear CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) and remain skeptical that it will evolve into a huge opportunity to control global CO 2 emissions. It needs to be explained in terms normal people understand. Not everyone speaks the same language or starts from the same point of reference. This effort is by a high school junior using common language and images familiar {{to me and my}} friends to visualize basic science relationships related to the storage part of CCS: soccer balls and playing fields. It considers key components of well systems and makes comparisons with the behavior of natural phenomena like ant hills enduring in a light rain storm, and compares that with their fate when attacked by a little brother with a water hose. It asks questions about the dimensions of the systems, and how key components might work. It’s about putting CO 2 underground, but how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> with soccer balls?Instinctively, the big question is will the CO 2 stay underground? What will happen to it with time? Why won’t it just come right back out a well like a straw? What about all those wells anyway? Should people get hyped-up about them? Aren’t they filled with cement? Think, CO 2 in water makes an acid. What will that acid do? Is it about pumping and sucking fluids thru barriers as strong as steel instead of allowing them to flow freely in a hose? Stay tuned and read on. Full disclosure: This paper is not exactly cutting edge science; it offers no new data, and tests no hypothesis although it makes some original calculations. It’s about communication and visualization, so it deliberately dodges some important details about well construction techniques, reaction rates, kinetics and the multiphase behavior of supercritical CO 2, even in the same reservoir. It touches on fundamentals of reservoir porosity and permeability, and even subsurface fluid flow but just barely. Just enough to be cool, stressed, over pressured and dense phased, more or less like the injected gas we care so much about...|$|E

5000|$|By 689, Zhou Xing {{had become}} a {{powerful}} official—as {{he had been in}} charge of many politically charged investigations carried out against officials and nobles under Empress Dowager Wu's direction. He still resented Wei for what he thought was Wei's role in blocking his promotion. Wei had been great friends with fellow chancellor Pei Yan, who was executed in 684 for what Empress Dowager Wu saw as opposition against her (i.e., Pei's advocacy that she return imperial powers to Emperor Ruizong). Zhou, knowing this, falsely accused Wei of having said, [...] "The empress dowager is old. It is better to support the emperor, for he will last longer." [...] This angered Empress Dowager Wu, and she ordered that Wei commit suicide, and she sent the assistant imperial censor Fang Ji (房濟) to monitor his suicide. When Fang got to Wei's mansion, he said to Wei, [...] "Honored old man, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not pretend to be making a secret accusation? That way, the empress dowager will summon you to her presence, and when she <b>does,</b> <b>you</b> can <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> the accusation against you is false." [...] Wei sighed and responded, [...] "What is the difference between being killed by men and being killed by ghosts natural death)? How can I be an accuser?" [...] He later committed suicide.|$|R
6000|$|I willingly gibbet {{myself to}} show how reticent the Arcadia makes us. It happens that I have a {{connection}} with Nottingham, and whenever a man mentions Nottingham to me, with a certain gleam in his eye, I know {{that he wants to}} discuss the lace trade. But it is a curious fact that the aggressive talker constantly mixes up Nottingham and Northampton. [...] "Oh, you know Nottingham," [...] he says, interestedly; [...] "and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> like Labouchere for a member?" [...] <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think I put him right? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> imagine me thirsting to tell that Mr. Labouchere is the Christian member for Northampton? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> suppose me swift to <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Broadhurst is one of the Nottingham members, and that the [...] "Nottingham lambs" [...] are notorious in the history of political elections? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> fancy me <b>explaining</b> <b>that</b> he is quite right in saying that Nottingham has a large market-place? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> see me drawn into half an hour's talk about Robin Hood? That is not my way. I merely reply that we like Mr. Labouchere pretty well. It may be said that I gain nothing by this; that the talker will be as curious about Northampton as he would have been about Nottingham, and that Bradlaugh and Labouchere and boots will serve his turn quite as well as Broadhurst and lace and Robin Hood. But that is not so. Beginning on Northampton in the most confident manner, it suddenly flashes across him that he has mistaken Northampton for Nottingham. [...] "How foolish of me!" [...] he says. I maintain a severe silence. He is annoyed. My experience of talkers tells me that nothing annoys them so much as a blunder of this kind. From the coldly polite way in which I have taken the talker's remarks, he discovers the value I put upon them, and after that, if he has a neighbor on the other side, he leaves me alone.|$|R
