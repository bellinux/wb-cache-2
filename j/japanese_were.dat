5|$|Each day the Papuans killed 12 to 15 Japanese, but {{not until}} 8 February was the Japanese rearguard {{encountered}} at Weber Point and a formal attack made. Five <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed. In all, 53 <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed and four captured that day. Two Australians were wounded. The next day another 61 <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed and 9 captured, this time without any Australian casualties. On 10 February, the 30th Infantry Battalion encountered two American soldiers at Yagomai, thereby linking up with the American force at Saidor.|$|E
5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> finding it {{increasingly}} difficult to resupply their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, refusing to let Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> forced to resupply their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese Army's {{attack on}} the Allied Lunga {{perimeter}} was decisively defeated in this battle, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> {{not yet ready to}} give up the struggle for Guadalcanal. The Japanese Army and navy made immediate plans to move the rest of the 38th Division to the island, along with the 51st Infantry Division, to try a further offensive against Henderson Field in November 1942.|$|E

5|$|At {{a cost of}} one {{destroyer}} sunk {{and three}} damaged, the Japanese evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. 600 of those died during the evacuation, and 3,000 more required extensive hospital care. On 9 February, Allied forces realized that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> gone and declared Guadalcanal secure, ending the six-month campaign {{for control of the}} island.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> {{beginning}} a major offensive {{in the southern}} Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five task forces. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon to bombard an equally large Japanese army. Despite both forces having similar numbers, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> defeated in one day, due to the Ming advantage in firepower. Throughout the Seven Year War in Korea, the Chinese coalition used artillery widely, in both land and naval battles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>is</b> {{a member}} of the Japonic {{languages}} family, which also includes the languages spoken throughout the Ryūkyū Islands.

50|$|A large {{majority}} of head-dependent orderings in <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> head-final.

5|$|In the Australian 5th Division's advance from Sio to Saidor between 20 January {{and the end}} of February, 734 <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed, 1,793 found dead, and 48 Japanese {{prisoners were}} taken. Australian and Papuan {{casualties}} came to 3 killed and 5 wounded. The US 32nd Infantry Division at Saidor killed 119 Japanese and captured 18, while losing 40 killed, 11 wounded, 16 missing.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akanaga, {{called the}} 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments {{back across the}} Puriata, to a {{position}} south-west of the Pain feature. At this point, {{the decision was made}} to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford. The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> about to deliver the main attack.|$|E
5|$|The Allied naval bombardments {{disrupted}} {{industrial production}} in the cities targeted, and convinced many Japanese civilians {{that the war was}} lost. Up to 1,739 <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed in the attacks, and as many as 1,497 were wounded. The only Allied casualties were 32 prisoners of war, who were killed in the bombardments of Kamaishi.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{conduct an}} {{analysis}} of consumption and saving behavior in Japan, looking both at trends over time and comparisons with the other industrialized countries. I find {{that some of the}} conventional wisdoms (that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> asset-rich and hold conservative portfolios) still hold but that others (that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> high savers and shun borrowing) no longer hold and that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> not unique, with the United States and the other Anglo-Saxon countries being the true exceptions in many respects. ...|$|R
50|$|The term mama-san in <b>Japanese</b> <b>is</b> not {{a polite}} {{reference}} to a mother and should never be used as such. Most Japanese children today call their mother mama, but the term does not persist into adulthood. The way to refer to one's mother, in <b>Japanese,</b> <b>is</b> okaa-san.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} for the Paiwan was about 30, and that for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>was</b> 543 (12 <b>Japanese</b> soldiers <b>were</b> killed in battle and 531 by disease).|$|R
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Companies A, B, and F set {{out with}} the {{intention}} of entering the Lunga perimeter near the Matanikau River. Along the way, the Marine column was ambushed by a Japanese machinegun team that killed four raiders. Seven <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed in this skirmish. The patrol encountered no further opposition and entered friendly lines at Lunga Point by mid-afternoon.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> on the verge of breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they {{would have been able to}} isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the terrain}} around the ridge, the Australians had to {{allocate}} {{a significant amount}} of resources to bring in supplies to the forces later stationed around Pearl Ridge. The rate of effort required to bring stores forward was of significant concern to the Australian corps commander, Lieutenant General Stanley Savige, to the extent that his orders to the commander of the 11th Brigade stipulated no further advances in the sector, with the exception of patrolling to prevent the movement of Japanese reinforcements towards the south, and for information gathering purposes. These patrols subsequently went out with native police guides, exploiting quite deep into the jungle over several days over long distances—one was even pushed to the eastern coast around the Numa Numa Plantation—and proved quite successful for the Australians in harassing the Japanese in the area. Over the course of 14 weeks at least 236 <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> killed by these patrols, while the Australians lost four killed and 19 wounded. Four <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> also captured. In mid-April, the 23rd Brigade, under Brigadier Arnold Potts, took control of the central sector and in June a new offensive was opened in the area. This lasted through {{until the end of the}} war in August.|$|E
5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942, Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second {{consecutive}} year and also finished the season as the League's top point-scorer. Lindwall and his brother Jack, who played on the wing, scored all of the team's points in the grand final, Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals. However they were denied by a last-minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury-Bankstown 11–9. All the while, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> inching ever closer to Australia. Malaya had fallen and the northern Australian city of Darwin had been the subject of Japanese air raids.|$|E
