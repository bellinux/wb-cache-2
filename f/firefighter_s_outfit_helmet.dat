50|$|Under the new {{homestead}} law, settlers began {{purchasing the}} “even-numbered” sections {{from the state}} {{for the benefit of}} the Common School Fund in 1883. In conjunction with the introduction of the fence, these settlers began owning land that was previously controlled by the large cattle outfits, and this eventually led to the Fence Cutting Wars. This acreage was sold by the state on a first-come, first-served basis with the county advertising the availability of land, which resulted in extremely long lines at the county clerks' offices and increased the likelihood that the desired acreage would not be available. As a result of Common School Fund process, W.R. McEntire, while in Dallas, sent representatives from Tom Green County to acquire as much land as possible and to keep others out of the line until the desired acreage was obtained.

40|$|Looking back at {{the history}} of Japanese textiles, the {{beginning}} seems to be braiding and/or netting fibers made from tree bark or tall grass (Jomon period - approximately C 13 th - C 10 th BC.). Weaving seems to appear after the mid-Jomon period. Silk was brought into Japan in the late-Jomon to the Yayoi period (600 BC- 200 AD), {{and for a long time}} its use was restricted to the upper class. During the Momoyama period (1573 - 1603) cotton seeds were introduced and cotton grown in Japan. By the mid-Edo period (1603 - 1868) cotton cultivation had spread over the southern part of Japan, and cotton became available to commoners. According to Kunio Yanagida, until cotton became known to the ordinary people in the 17 th century, they wore cloth made form bast fibers, such as hemp, ramie, kaju (paper mulberry), liden, wisteria, etc. Garments made from tree or grass fibre have been used to protect ordinary people for a few thousand years.

40|$|ObjectiveThis article reports new anthropometric {{information}} of U. <b>S.</b> <b>firefighters</b> for fire apparatus design applications (Study 1) and presents a data method {{to assist in}} firefighter anthropometric data usage for research-to-practice propositions (Study 2). BackgroundUp-to-date anthropometric {{information of}} the U. <b>S.</b> <b>firefighter</b> population is needed for updating ergonomic and safety specifications for fire apparatus. MethodA stratified sampling plan of three-age by three-race/ethnicity combinations was used to collect anthropometric data of 863 male and 88 female firefighters across the U. S. regions; 71 anthropometric dimensions were measured (Study 1). Differences among original, weighted, and normality transformed data from Study 1 were compared to allowable observer errors (Study 2). ResultsOn average, male firefighters were 9. 8 kg heavier and female firefighters were 29 mm taller {{than their counterparts in}} the general U. S. population. They also have larger upper-body builds than those of the general U. S. population. The data in weighted, unweighted, and normality transformed modes were compatible among each other with a few exceptions. ConclusionThe data obtained in this study provide the first available U. <b>S.</b> national <b>firefighter</b> anthropometric information for fire apparatus designs. The data represent the demographic characteristics of the current firefighter population and, except for a few dimensions, can be directly employed into fire apparatus design applications without major weighting or nonnormality concerns. ApplicationThe up-to-date firefighter anthropometric data and data method will benefit the design of future fire apparatus and protective equipment, such as seats, body restraints, cabs, gloves, and bunker gear.

30|$|Recently, data {{based on}} direct {{measurements}} of head impact exposure {{in college football}} players demonstrated that running backs and quarterbacks suffer the hardest and most severe blows to the head, while linemen and linebackers suffer more head impacts during a game than players in other positions (Crisco et al. 2011). Nearly 300, 000 head impacts at three institutions were recorded over three seasons. The researchers measured impacts with standard football <b>helmets</b> <b>outfitted</b> with sensors that recorded such data as head acceleration and impact location which allowed them to quantify the severity and frequency of blows to the head by player position. Offensive line and quarterbacks had the highest and lowest frequency, respectively, of front impacts. In contrast, quarterbacks received the greatest magnitude and the most frequent impacts {{to the back of}} the helmet. Data also suggest that top-of-head impacts have a higher risk of concussion than impacts to the front, right, or back of the head (Guskiewicz et al. 2007). Top-of-helmet impacts might result in causing the cerebellum to impact the base of the skull and recoil superiorly into the cerebellar tentorium.|$|R

40|$|My thesis exposes {{users to}} interpretive ballet, using {{many aspects of}} {{computer}} graphics design, including 3 D animation, interaction and graphical user interface design. The interactive work consists of dragging and dropping pre-rendered animated ballet moves to create a sequenced dance performance.

As ballet consists of precise movement, my animation focuses more on interpretive dance movements that imply ballet, rather than mimic the actual precision of ballet moves.

40|$|Marketers {{incorporate}} young, attractive, {{and thin}} models in advertisements to help catch {{the attention of}} the viewer and showcase the product on display. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of dangerously thin models in media images. There is an association between exposure to idealized body images in advertisements and eating disorders (Botta, 1999; Harrison 2 ̆ 6 Cantor, 1997; Stice, Schupak-Neuberg, Shaw, 2 ̆ 6 Stein, 1994; Tiggermann 2 ̆ 6 Pickering, 1996). Even though most women do not develop eating disorders, overexposure to exceptionally thin, attractive models may help young women develop negative body image (Thorton 2 ̆ 6 Moore, 1993). Given the possible negative effects of over-exposure to thin, beautiful models, it is important to explore whether female models who are not so thin are effective or deficient as apparel advertising stimuli. Consumer responses to plus-size versus thin models has not been widely studied. As the United States population continues to become more diverse, marketers and advertisers may want to incorporate models of various sizes to appeal to broader target markets. This study focused on college-aged women 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes and perceptions of both plus-size and thin fashion models in advertisements. Advertising stimuli were developed by digitally manipulating body size of three plus size models copied from an internet retail site and pretested for attractiveness. A thin version of each model was prepared, and a size manipulation check was conducted. Experimental data was collected from a random sample of 228 women at a Midwest university. The college-aged, female participants were contacted via university e-mail. The participants were asked to go to a website to view a full-color photograph of a fashion model that appeared to be {{about the same age as}} the participants. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of the six model stimuli, either thin or plus size, resulting in a 3 (model) x 2 (size) research design. Questionnaire items were answered on the website. The size of the model only affected one research variable, beliefs about the model 2 ̆ 7 s appearance. In contrast to expectations, participants felt that plus-size models were more attractive, appealing, credible, and eye-catching. Participants perceived the same level of similarity to both plus-size and thin models in terms of overall life style and appearance and the shape of specific body parts. Model size had no effect on perceived likeability and fashionability, and no effect on intention to purchase the model 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>outfit.</b> Covariate analysis with participant weight and BMI did not change direction of results. However, when body satisfaction was accounted for through covariance, there was a significant effect of size treatment on perceived similarity to the model 2 ̆ 7 s specific body parts in that participants felt more similar to the plus size model. This exploratory study provides insight into a relatively unexplored area of apparel advertising. Findings from this study provide support for incorporating models of various sizes in apparel advertisements...|$|R
