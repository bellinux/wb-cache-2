There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A.muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa <b>ethnobotanist</b> Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it {{was known as the}} miskwedo.

500|$|In 1911, Greek {{scholar and}} {{archaeologist}} Rufus B. Richardson, {{formerly of the}} American School of Classical Studies at Athens, observed that what was being described as flowers in the relief, looked similar to mushrooms. English classicist Robert Graves and Italian <b>ethnobotanist</b> Giorgio Samorini both have referred to the fragment as evidence for the entheogen hypothesis, speculating that the significant items depicted in the work are a type of psychoactive mushroom {{that was used in}} the Eleusinian Mysteries. Graves even featured the image as the cover of one edition of The Greek Myths, noting that although it might be depicted in artwork, it would remain unnamed in texts because of its sacredness. American classicist Carl A. P. Ruck has made similar arguments. Although the entheogen hypothesis is controversial and generally rejected by mainstream scholarship, in a review of Hampe's Die Stele aus Pharsalos im Louvre (1951), Picard notes that [...] "one may be increasingly reminded that Pharsalos was indeed an Eleusinian center".|$|E

[...] Founded in 1991, it began {{with the work of}} <b>ethnobotanist</b> Paul Alan Cox, who researched tropical plants and their medicinal value in the village of Falealupo in Samoa during the mid-1980s. [...] When the villagers were pressured into selling logging rights to their rainforest in 1988 to build a new school, Cox and his wife offered to help secure funds for the new school in return for an agreement with the villagers to protect their forest. [...] With the help of his friends and family, Cox secured the funds within six months, later earning him and the village chief, Fuiono Senio, the Goldman Environmental Prize for their efforts. [...] Word spread throughout the islands, and with increasing demand for similar projects, Cox, along with Bill Marré and Ken Murdock, decided to form Seacology and expand their work internationally.

[...] He later recorded these events in his book, Nafanua: Saving the Samoan Rain Forest. [...] Cox began his work in Samoa in 1973 during his first Mormon missionary service, at which time he learned from local people about the medicinal properties of the native plants. [...] After working with local communities in other rainforests, Cox returned to Samoa in 1984 with his family. His aim was to find a cure for cancer, which had claimed the life of his mother earlier that year. [...] In return for the help of the local healers (called fofo), Cox offered to share the revenue generated by his research with the local villages. [...] Over time, his research identified five new drugs, including the therapeutic agent prostratin, a potential treatment for HIV. [...] Prostratin was isolated in a concoction made from the bark of the local mamala tree (Homalanthus nutans) and shared with him by a healer named Epenesa Mauigoa, who used it to treat hepatitis. [...] Cox set up royalty agreements to ensure that the Samoans will share in the revenue.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo offers {{evidence}} that P.hispanica was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago. The rock shelter at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals, which [...] previously had been described as [...] "mushrooms", matched the general morphology of P.hispanica: the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom-like objects with convex to conical caps, and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous (wavy). Additionally, the mural shows a bull, which suggests an association with the coprophilic P.hispanica. Although the hallucinogenic species P.semilanceata is also widespread in the area where the mural was found, its differing shape (narrowly conical and acutely papillate) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural. If the interpretation is correct, the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe, and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of neurotropic fungi. The only older example is from Tassili n'Ajjer, in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria. In 1992, the Italian <b>ethnobotanist</b> Giorgio Samorini reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms, later tentatively identified as Psilocybe mairei, a species known from Algeria and Morocco.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{historical}} milestone is {{the discovery}} of DMT in plants frequently used by Amazonian natives as additive to the vine Banisteriopsis caapi to make ayahuasca decoctions. In 1957, American chemists Francis Hochstein and Anita Paradies identified DMT in an [...] "aqueous extract" [...] of leaves of a plant they named Prestonia amazonicum (sic) and described as [...] "commonly mixed" [...] with B. caapi. The lack of a proper botanical identification of Prestonia amazonica in this study led American <b>ethnobotanist</b> Richard Evans Schultes (1915–2001) and other scientists to raise serious doubts about the claimed plant identity. The mistake likely led William Burroughs to regard the DMT he experimented with in Tangier in 1961 as [...] "Prestonia". Better evidence was produced in 1965 by French pharmacologist Jacques Poisson, who isolated DMT as a sole alkaloid from leaves, provided and used by Aguaruna Indians, identified as having come from the vine Diplopterys cabrerana (then known as Banisteriopsis rusbyana). Published in 1970, the first identification of DMT in the plant Psychotria viridis, another common additive of ayahuasca, was made {{by a team of}} American researchers led by pharmacologist Ara der Marderosian.
