25|$|The {{delegation}} {{arrived in}} Pliska {{in the beginning}} of 868. Boris I learned that the Pope had offered him to choose the archbishop of the Bulgarian Church from among the presbyters he had sent. By order Hadrian II, Formosus of Portus and Paul of Populona returned to Rome as early as February in the same year, accompanied by Peter. Boris <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the Pope's answers and decided to end the negotiations with Rome.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|She {{said she}} wasn't {{interested}} in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which {{is a bit of}} a stern statement from someone who has been so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote more {{positively}} about the episode, noting that [...] "Fox's eternal The Simpsons kicks off {{a night of}} all-new animation, welcoming Kiefer Sutherland in a very clever guest role {{as a security guard}} trying without much success to escape his violent past. A nod to Taiwanese animation {{is just one of the}} highlights in this homage to 24-style mayhem." [...] Similarly, Umika Pidaparthy of CNN's The Marquee Blog commented that [...] "there were a lot of light laughs in this episode, like when Wayne walks through the Ukrainian part of Springfield (Tsarbucks, anyone?). Pop culture references like the Taiwanese animation of the robbery were hilarious. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed,</b> though, to see that Marge's daydream about being on Top Chef didn't become a side story." [...] Mike Hughes of the Lansing State Journal commented that the episode was [...] "inconsistent, but [...] great moments", and that it was [...] "much better than Fox's other season-openers" [...] that premiered on the same day.|$|E
500|$|Separate {{awards for}} Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance were {{introduced}} in 1990. Beginning that year, Metallica won three consecutive Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance for the song [...] "One" [...] from ...And Justice for All, their cover of Queen's [...] "Stone Cold Crazy", and their eponymous album in 1992. When Metallica won the Grammy in 1992, drummer Lars Ulrich referenced the previous award by facetiously [...] "thanking" [...] Jethro Tull for not putting out an album that year, though they actually had released the album Catfish Rising in 1991. A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't tell you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed.</b> Human nature is that you'd rather win than lose, but Jethro Tull walking away with it makes a huge mockery of {{the intentions of the}} event." [...] As of 2010, Metallica holds the record for the most wins in the metal category, with a total of six.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed,</b> every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E

500|$|After the match, {{figures from}} each team were {{critical}} of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying [...] "It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: [...] "It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed {{to be concerned with}} keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much – apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and {{it was a case of}} breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish." [...] Meanwhile, Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was {{critical of the}} quality of the Liverpool team: [...] "Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players." ...|$|E
500|$|Manager Al López' {{decision}} not to start Pierce in the 1959 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers was highly controversial. After Cy Young Award winner Early Wynn started for Chicago in Game 1, Lopez chose to start Bob Shaw (18–6 in the regular season) and Dick Donovan (9–10) {{in the next two}} contests, which the White Sox lost by scores of 4–3 and 3–1. Pierce was held back until Game 4, and relieved in each of the final three games of the Series, allowing only two hits and no runs in four innings of work. In Game 4 he entered in the fourth inning with Chicago trailing 4–0, and pitched a hitless three innings before being pulled for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, when the Sox tied the game; the Dodgers went on to win 5–4. In Game 5 he entered in the eighth inning to protect a 1–0 lead, but only issued an intentional walk before Lopez again changed pitchers; the White Sox held on for the 1–0 win. Lopez even chose to start Wynn in Game 6 on two days' rest, but he was ineffective, and Chicago was behind 8–3 by the time Pierce was brought in to start the eighth inning; the Dodgers later added a run in the ninth inning to complete the 9–3 win and capture the Series championship. Being used out of the bullpen was a deep letdown for Pierce, who said in a 1982 interview, [...] "Other guys, Early Wynn and Bob Shaw, had better years than I did that year. And against the left-handed-heavy lineup the Dodgers threw at us, Al wanted his right-handers like Dick Donovan. There was no question <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed,</b> but I understood." [...] However, there have been suggestions that Lopez' decision had other, undisclosed motivations; noting his surprise that Lopez chose to use Pierce out of the bullpen, outfielder Al Smith recalled, [...] "We all knew why Al López didn't pitch him, but we never told anyone and I won't say now. I will say that I thought he should have pitched. He'd been pitching all year, hadn't he?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{movie was}} {{critically}} acclaimed but, in Hill's words, it [...] "didn't make a... nickel anywhere. Foreign domestic, anything... I {{was proud of}} the film... But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> in the lack of response. It was a universal audience failure... Usually you can say they loved it in Japan or something. I don't think anybody loved it anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} {{apprehend}} me. These affairs seldom fall out {{as one would}} wish them, which is, perhaps, now and then fortunate for all concerned. It <b>is</b> Grace <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>disappointed</b> with." ...|$|R
5000|$|In post-match interviews, {{both players}} {{admitted}} to not having played particularly well, with O'Sullivan commenting [...] "Ali and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{not to put}} on a better performance". Carter's performance was described as [...] "jaded".|$|R
6000|$|... "I always find," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "that when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>disappointed</b> of any {{pleasure}}, {{it is best}} {{not to try to}} find any other pleasure in its place, but to turn to duty." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lancashire batted on {{for another}} 49 overs, scoring 195 for 6 declared, and setting Somerset a target of 247 runs in 31 overs. Paul Horton and Loye put on 94 for the first wicket. But all in all, taking 61 overs to score 195 was hardly {{declaration}} batting. Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, [...] "To {{get a couple of}} fifties against a pretty good attack is a good start. It was a pretty difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> to miss out. Getting a century is a psychological thing for a batsman. I don't set myself goals or anything like that, but it's always nice to get a hundred." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goddard {{had already}} {{said that it would}} be his last series. Immediately after the Third Test ended, while the players were celebrating in the {{dressing}} room, one of the selectors told Goddard he had been left out of the team for the final Test now that the series was won, in order that the team should consist only of players who would be touring England later that year. The decision and its timing were widely unpopular. Peter Pollock said [...] "it was no way to say thanks to {{a man who had been}} involved almost from the start in South Africa's rise to cricketing glory". Trevor Chesterfield described it as [...] "cruel and unnecessary; an act which took some of the sparkle out of the 4–0 whitewash". The captain, Ali Bacher, said that despite the team's success, the day was [...] "one of the saddest since I first played Test cricket for South Africa". Goddard himself simply said, [...] "I wouldn't be human if I did not say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed.</b> But that's life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] said Robert. [...] "I'll {{confess that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{at first and}} {{suspected}} Wannop of interfering. As you know, he's lax in his views." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Tut! Let us {{have done}} with that. WE know very well how it was. Why should you and I talk about it, when you and I can't {{disguise}} it? To proceed. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>disappointed</b> and cut a poor figure.' ...|$|R

60|$|On a {{newspaper}} placard, the other day, I saw {{announced a new}} novel by a celebrated author. I bought {{a copy of the}} paper, and turned eagerly to the last page. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> to find that I had missed the first six chapters. The story had commenced the previous Saturday; this was Friday. I say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> and so I was, at first. But my disappointment did not last long. The bright and intelligent sub-editor, according to the custom now in vogue, had provided me with a short synopsis of those first six chapters, so that without the trouble of reading them I knew what they were all about.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} a lack of frankness throughout." [...] Her voice trembled.
