50|$|A {{snowplow}} (also snow plow, snowplough or snow plough) is {{a device}} intended for mounting on a vehicle, used for removing {{snow and ice}} from outdoor surfaces, typically those serving transportation purposes. Although this term {{is often used to}} refer to vehicles mounting such devices, more accurately they are known as winter service vehicles, especially in areas that regularly receive large amounts of snow every year, or in specific environments such as airfields. In other cases, pickup trucks and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> are outfitted with attachments to fulfill this purpose. Some regions that do not frequently see snow may use graders to remove compacted snow and ice off the streets. Snowplows can also be mounted on rail cars or locomotives to clear railway tracks.|$|E
50|$|The Haulpak line {{of mining}} and quarry trucks was the best-performing sector for Wabco {{for the entire}} time they owned it and {{eventually}} the scrapers, wheel dozers, graders and <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> would be discontinued from the Wabco catalogue. In 1968 Wabco had become part of American Standard Company (known for bathroom fittings) {{and then it would}} become part of Dresser Industries in 1984. After a Komatsu Limited-Dresser joint venture (KDC) in 1988 was formed, the Haulpak truck line was again (partly) under new ownership, although by 1994 Komatsu had purchased all remaining shares of KDC, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The Haulpak name was quietly discontinued around 1998 - 1999 and the new trucks were then known as Komatsu machines.|$|E
50|$|Erskine {{continues}} {{as the home}} of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders</b> that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota's manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story.|$|E

40|$|Long term {{storage of}} wet distillers’ grains is {{important}} in order for small beef producers to effectively utilize these feeds due to their short shelf life. Many smaller beef producers {{do not have access}} to mixing equipment to produce mixtures of wet distillers’ grains and forages. This study measured the variation in feed mixtures mixed with a mixer wagon or a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader.</b> Variation was reduced by approximately one half by mixing though a mixer wagon. Using the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> to mix the feeds resulted in variation that would be considered acceptable for many production situations...|$|R
50|$|Miners utilize {{equipment}} {{strong enough}} to break through extremely hard layers of the Earth's crust. This equipment, combined with the closed work space in which underground miners work, can cause hearing loss. For example, a roof bolter (commonly used by mine roof bolter operators) can reach sound power levels of up to 115 dB. Combined with the reverberant effects of underground mines, a miner without proper hearing protection is at a high risk for hearing loss. By age 50, nearly 90% of U.S. coal miners have some hearing loss, compared to only 10% among workers not exposed to loud noises. Roof bolters are among the loudest machines, but auger miners, bulldozers, continuous mining machines, <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> and shuttle cars and trucks are also among those machines most responsible for excessive noise in mine work.|$|E
50|$|The Sarawagi {{group has}} {{altogether}} {{a total of}} 12 mines, 8 of which are functioning.

The company has an inventory of mining machinery which includes: 150 Mercedes Benz dumpers, 40 Komatsu 450 hydraulic excavators, 20 Liugong <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> 22 bulldozers of various capacities, and many Mercedes trucks and lorries.The company has a total resources of the current lease hold area of 5 million Tons and their current monthly production is 10,000 Tons.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Haulpak line began with the {{purchase}} of R. G. LeTourneau's construction machinery business in 1953 by Westinghouse Air Brake Company. Wabco had traditionally been a manufacturer of railway air brake systems, but ventured into construction machinery with the purchase of LeRoi air tools and industrial drills in 1952. The subsequent purchase of R. G. LeTourneau's construction machinery line gave Wabco a comprehensive range of machinery including scrapers, rubber-tyred dozers and other attachments. Wabco subsequently added motor graders to their product line by purchasing J.D. Adams in 1955 and thereafter <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loaders,</b> with the purchase of Scoopmobile. Wabco recognised {{the importance of the}} off-highway Truck market and hired Ralph H. Kress to design a line of haul trucks in-house. Kress incorporated many new design features which were trend setting and eventually Caterpillar was to offer him a position designing their range of haulers.|$|E

50|$|Assembling the HESCO bastion entails {{unfolding}} it {{and filling}} it with sand, soil or gravel, usually using a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader.</b> The placement of the barrier is generally {{very similar to the}} placement of a sandbag barrier or earth berm except that room must generally be allowed for the equipment used to fill the barrier. The main advantage of HESCO barriers, strongly contributing to their popularity with troops and flood fighters, is the quick and easy setup. Previously, people had to fill sandbags, a slow undertaking, with one worker filling about 20 sandbags per hour. Workers using HESCO barriers and a <b>front</b> <b>end</b> <b>loader</b> can do ten times the work of those using sandbags.|$|R
