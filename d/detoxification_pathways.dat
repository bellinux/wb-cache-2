50|$|Metabolism of gambierol is {{not known}} yet, but the {{expectation}} is that gambierol acts almost {{the same as the}} ciguatoxins. Ciguatoxins are polycyclic polyether compounds. Their molecular weight is between 1.023 and 1.159 Dalton. Gambierol is structurally similar to ciguatoxins and it can be synthesized together with them. Excretion of these ciguatoxins is largely via the feces and in smaller amounts via urine. The compounds are very lipophilic and will therefore diffuse to multiple organs and tissues, for example the liver, fat and the brain. The highest concentration was found in the brain, but muscles contained the highest total amount after a few days. Because gambierol is lipophilic, it can easily persist and accumulate in the fish food chain. The <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathways</b> are still unknown, but it is possible to eliminate the gambierol. This will take several months or years.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent the}} toxic effects, AzM can be biotransformed. Although AzM (in figure 2 named guthion) can be bioactivated by a {{cytochrome}} P450 (CYP450)-mediated desulfuration to its phosphate triester or oxon(gutoxon), {{it may also}} be detoxified by CYP itself (reaction 2 in figure 2). CYP450 is namely able to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of the P-S-C bond in AzM to yield DMTP and MMBA.The other pathways of detoxification involves glutathione (GSH)-mediated dealkylation via cleavage of the P-O-CH3 bond, which than forms mono-demethylated AzM and GS-CH3 (reaction 3 in figure 2). This mono-demethylated AzM may be further demethylated to di-demethylated AzM and again GS-CH3 (reaction 4 in figure 2). AzM also may undergo glutathione-catalyzed dearylation which forms DMPDT and glutathione-conjugated mercaptomethyl benzazimide (reaction 5 in figure 2)Gutoxon, the compound that mainly causes AzM to be toxic, can also be detoxified. Gutoxon can again be detoxified with the help of CYP450. CYP450 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of gutoxon, which than yields DMP and MMBA (reaction 6 in figure 2). Other <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathways</b> of gutoxon are via glutathione-mediated dealkylation, which goes via cleavage of the P-O-CH3 bond to form demethylated AzM and GS-CH3 (reaction 7 in figure 2), and via glutathione-catalyzed dearylation to yield DMTP and glutathione-conjugated mercaptomethyl benzazimide (reaction 8 in figure 2).|$|E

Using the sequenced genome of the herbivorous spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a starting point, this work aimed at uncovering which genes and mechanisms underpin spider mite resistance to chemical plant defenses. First, the detoxification of the defensive compound produced by cyanogenic plants in spider mites was investigated. This work successfully identified the gene of which the protein product (B-cyanoalanine synthase) detoxifies plant synthesized cyanide and uncovered that this gene was horizontally transferred from a bacterial species. Second, genome-wide gene-expression responses upon various chemical pressures were further analyzed to explore the spider mite’s xenobiotic metabolism in more detail.

We have investigated whether the dysregulation of ROS production in endometriotic cells correlates with a pro-proliferative phenotype and can explain the spreading of this disease. Stromal and epithelial cells were purified from ovarian endometrioma and eutopic endometrium from 14 patients with endometriosis to produce four primary cell lines from each patient.

40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} tumor suppressor (pRb) regulates {{cell cycle}} entry, progression and exit by controlling {{the activity of}} the E 2 F-family of transcription factors. During cell cycle exit pRb acts as a transcriptional repressor by associating with E 2 F proteins and thereby inhibiting their ability to stimulate the expression of genes required for S phase. Indeed, many tumors harbor mutations in the RB gene and the pRb-E 2 F pathway is compromised in nearly all types of cancers. In this report we show that both pRb and its interacting partners, the transcriptional factors E 2 F 1 - 2 - 3, act as positive modulators of <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathways</b> important for metabolizing and clearing xenobiotics [...] such as toxins and drugs [...] from the body. Using a combination of conventional molecular biology techniques and microarray analysis of specific cell populations, we have analyzed the detoxification pathway in murine samples in {{the presence or absence of}} pRb and/or E 2 F 1 - 2 - 3.

MG readily conjugates with GSH in a non-enzymatic manner.   Two subsequent enzymatic reactions via the glyoxalases complete a cyclic process that recycles GSH and produces the non-toxic compound, D-lactate.   An intermediate compound in the <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathway,</b> S-lactoylglutathione (SLG), activates potassium efflux systems KefB and KefC.   This triggers a second mechanism of protection mediated by cytoplasmic acidification, enhancing chances of survival.   Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand how cells regulate the concentration of this important intermediate compound. A deterministic model was proposed that describes the series of chemical reactions in the MG <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathway,</b> allowing one to predict the flux of all compounds produced during detoxification. Through an iterative process involving model formulation, parameter estimation, data fitting and validation against experimental data, different models were analysed and discriminated in this study.   Mathematical simulations predicted that the glyoxalase pathway is not linear because it involves feedforward mechanisms for the control of SLG, the activator of the potassium efflux systems. The activities of the potassium efflux systems were investigated using deterministic models that describe the interactions between protein and ligand.   From this model, it was possible to quantify the dependence of the possible binding states on the kinetic parameters of the system.   Parameter estimation methods were used for the analysis of experimental data on the gating of the efflux systems, which proved useful for the design of new experimental strategies.

40|$|In Zea mays, (auto) toxification by the {{allelochemical}} benzoxazolinone {{is first}} avoided by glucosylation of BOA- 6 -OH and subsequently by glucoside carbamate and malonylglucoside carbamate synthesis. UGT BX 9 {{is responsible for}} the BOA- 6 -OH glucosylation step, but its function in glucoside carbamate synthesis was unclear. We assumed that BOA is not the direct substrate for glucoside carbamate synthesis and that BX 9 is not directly responsible for the glucosylation step. The maize endophyte Fusarium verticillioides was isolated and incubated with BOA under suboptimal oxygen supply. Under these conditions, the fungus transformed BOA into a BOA-like compound (BC) which is either used for the fungal product oHPMA or for glucoside carbamate synthesis in maize seedlings. BC, putative precursor of the unstable (2 -hydroxyphenyl) carbamic acid, accumulates in the medium under oxygen depletion, but gets highly unstable when exposed to air.

The results present the first evidence on significantly higher frequency of GSTP 1 C 341 T polymorphism (C-T transition) in healthy subjects compared to MS patients, suggesting it may act as a moderating factor in developing MS clinical phenotype. Gender-dependent distribution of the C 341 T polymorphism was found in both MS patients and controls, with higher frequency of C-T transition in females. In addition, preliminary data showed higher proportion of male MS patients with higher median MSSS scores, as well as lower brain atrophy level and lesion load in MS patients carrying the C 341 T mutation. Observed gender difference in distribution of the C 341 T polymorphism in MS patients, as well as in disease progression, suggests that GSTP 1 <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathway</b> occurs in a gender-dependent manner and could therefore add to clinical severity in male MS patients...|$|R

The most sensitive species, T pseudonana, generally exhibited the highest Cd body burden and organelle (org) -Cd concentration. C. autotrophica, the most tolerant species to Cd, had the smallest org-Ccl accumulation, {{as well as a}} much higher percentage of cellular debris-Cd, which may {{play an important role in}} Cd detoxification. The dinoflagellate P. minimum, with a sensitivity between the diatoms and green algae, had a comparable Cd body burden but higher percentage of org-Ccl than C. autotrophica. Although the induction of PCs was dependent on the species, the intracellular (intra) -Cd/PC-SH ratio showed a strong linear log-log relationship with [Cd 2 +], suggesting that this ratio could possibly be a biomarker for environmental [Cd 2 +] stress. With the increases of the intra-Cd/PC-SH ratio, these three species of phytoplankton exhibited clearly different patterns of growth inhibition, implying that the effectiveness of PCs as a <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathway</b> is dependent on the species. The lowest intra-Cd/PC-SH toxicity threshold for T pseudonana implied its low PC-Cd capacity. Furthermore, the sudden slowdown of growth inhibition when the intra-Cd/PC-SH ratio reached 33 implied the launch of other <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathway</b> in C. autotrophica in order to alleviate Cd toxicity. Our study demonstrated that accumulation and subcellular distribution of Cd and PC synthesis can account for the inter-species differences in Cd sensitivity in marine phytoplankton.

40|$|Background Heterocyclic {{aromatic}} amines (HAA) are environmental and food contaminants that are potentially carcinogenic for humans. 2 -Amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) {{is one of}} the most abundant HAA formed in cooked meat. MeIQx is metabolized by cytochrome P 450 1 A 2 in the human liver into detoxificated and bioactivated products. Once bioactivated, MeIQx metabolites can lead to DNA adduct formation responsible for further genome instability. Methods Using a computational approach, we developed a numerical model for MeIQx metabolism in the liver that predicts the MeIQx biotransformation into <b>detoxification</b> or bioactivation <b>pathways</b> according to the concentration of MeIQx. Results Our results demonstrate that (1) the <b>detoxification</b> <b>pathway</b> predominates, (2) the ratio between <b>detoxification</b> and bioactivation <b>pathways</b> is not linear and shows a maximum at 10  µM of MeIQx in hepatocyte cell models, and (3) CYP 1 A 2 is a key enzyme in the system that regulates the balance between bioactivation and detoxification. Our analysis suggests that such a ratio could be considered as an indicator of MeIQx genotoxicity at a low concentration of MeIQx. Conclusions Our model permits the investigation of the balance between bioactivation (i. e., DNA adduct formation pathway through the prediction of potential genotoxic compounds) and detoxification of MeIQx in order to predict the behaviour of this environmental contaminant in the human liver.
