500|$|On {{the story}} side, reviewers agreed the {{professional}} actors, such as Ian Ziering, did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> bringing their respective characters to life. [...] However, criticism {{was placed on}} the lone voice who voiced all the generic male encounters for his monotonous delivery and making all his characters sound alike. [...] The long cutscenes, which cannot be skipped, frustrated game journalist Tom Chick; he wanted to skip the scenes and continue playing instead of being forced to watch a clichéd story. [...] Other reviewers expressed their own frustrations with the story, such as being forced to move to another star system at undesired times, or leaving them without an objective after the campaign abruptly ended.|$|E
500|$|Aitraaz {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its direction, music and performances, particularly Chopra's. It was {{noted for its}} bold subject of sexual harassment. Several critics observed that the premise {{was similar to the}} American film Disclosure (1994). Writing for the BBC, critic Jay Mamtora praised the film's theme, music and performances, and remarked that [...] "Abbas-Mustaan have done a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> 'Indianising' the whole concept". He went on to describe it as [...] "a gripping edge of the seat drama that keeps viewers glued to their seats". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film 3.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a well-crafted thriller" [...] and complimenting the directors' opting for [...] "a theme that has been untouched on the Indian screen so far" [...] and the film's [...] "dramatic moments".|$|E

500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was so happy to work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - did you see it? And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely did a very <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005. Aside from the video's script, Carey channeled Marilyn Monroe, one of her icons growing up. During a pool scene, Carey re-enacts a part from Monroe's film Something's Got to Give (1962). In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the re-enactment: ...|$|E

In terms of portrayal, she said that [...] "keeping a straight face" [...] while showing suppressed emotion was an enjoyable challenge. Regarding her form-fitting one-piece costume, Ryan commented that it was extremely impractical and uncomfortable, but worth the reward of portraying a character like Seven.|$|E
2500|$|..... the {{provision}} of job satisfaction, a sense of identity, self-worth, emotional well-being and dignity ... may indeed be amongst the consequences of having a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> a company run by good management, something to which every employee would aspire. However, emotions such as senses of identity, self-worth and dignity are felt in the breast of the employee, are highly subjective and would, necessarily, be felt to differing extents by different employees within the same working environment. I {{do not believe that}} the common law has come close to making the employer responsible for emotions of this kind, or to giving legal consequences to the fact that they are not generated in a particular situation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} two questions: (1) Do informal <b>job</b> searchers find <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>in</b> Hungary? (2) Do social resources {{theory and}} the theory of employee referrals explain {{the conditions under which}} informal <b>job</b> searchers find <b>good</b> <b>jobs?</b> The questions are examined using a rather unique dataset which was collected among people who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. It is found that the use of informal methods in itself rarely promotes one’s chances of finding a <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> Rather, <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> can be accessed through either high status contacts or employee referrals. These findings are consistent with both social resources {{theory and the}} theory of employee referrals...|$|R

2500|$|Jess Neely, a {{brilliant}} half-back and {{a handsome man}} on the campus, is remembered for his popularity {{among members of the}} opposite sex and for an incident that occurred just prior to a football game with Southern Presbyterian in Clarksville.

He misjudged the extremely low entrance, and his head received the full impact of the strip of wall above the doorway. He was revived shortly before the kickoff, but he never quite knew where he was, frequently huddling and aligning himself with the enemy.|$|E
