25|$|The newer concentric-float <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> {{consists}} of a tower which is encircled by a plastic float assembly. Operation is otherwise {{the same as a}} side-float <b>fill</b> <b>valve,</b> even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, flush valve, and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float <b>fill</b> <b>valve,</b> which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.|$|R
40|$|An {{occlusive}} cuff system comprises {{a pressure}} cuff {{and a source}} of regulated compressed gas feeding the cuff through an electrically operated <b>fill</b> <b>valve.</b> An electrically operated vent valve vents the cuff to the ambient pressure. The <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> is normally closed and the vent valve is normally open. In response to an external start signal, a logic network opens the <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> and closes the vent valve, thereby starting the pressurization cycle and a timer. A pressure transducer continuously monitors the pressure in the cuff.

The emulsified oil then flows into the vacuum separation chamber through the oil-taking control valve and the oil-taking solenoid valve. After the pressure is increased by the oil circulating pump, the emulsified oil is heated by the heater and the temperature gradually increases. After stabilizing temperature using the temperature controller, an oil mist cover is formed because of the positive pressure {{at the top of the}} vacuum chamber by the atomizer. This mist can prevent the rise of oil bubbles in the vacuum separation chamber and can avoid the injection of the vacuum pump of oil during the operation. Thus, antifoaming is automatically prevented. After atomization, the oil reenters the efficient separation tower, in which an oil film is again formed. The developed area of the oil film significantly increases. The water in the oil rapidly transforms from liquid into vapor. When nitrogen is at the bottom of the vacuum separation chamber, the water vapor in oil is removed and expelled from the top. Under the oil drain pump, the pressure of oil after dehydration changes from negative to positive, and the oil {{flows from the}} oil discharge outlet through the check valve and the fine filter. After one or more circulations, clean oil is generated.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> in {{a toilet}} water tank is a liquid level-actuated valve. When a {{high water level}} is reached, a {{mechanism}} shuts the <b>valve</b> which <b>fills</b> the tank.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the water}} level is below both switches, the float switch {{physical}} contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the <b>Fill</b> <b>Valve</b> output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal [...] "Fill Valve" [...] contact latches the circuit so that even when the [...] "Low Level" [...] contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as {{the water level}} remains between the two switch levels.

5000|$|When a toilet's handle is turned, a {{discharge}} {{mechanism is}} activated {{by means of}} a rod or chain. The mechanism may be a flapper valve, which is designed to sink more slowly than the water, which will exit to the toilet bowl below, so that the tank may empty. As the tank water level drops, the float descends and actuates the <b>fill</b> <b>valve.</b> Water is fed to the tank to replenish its supply, and a smaller flow is directed into the overflow tube to refill the bowl. Once the flapper valve closes, the water flow from the <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> continues until the tank level again reaches the fill line.|$|R
25|$|The side-float design uses a {{float on}} the end of a lever to control the <b>fill</b> <b>valve.</b> The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock. The float was originally made from copper sheet, but it is now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the main valve tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the <b>fill</b> <b>valve</b> that blocks the water flow into the toilet tank, and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|R

Modifications included oil squirters to cool the underneath of the pistons; sodium <b>filled</b> <b>valve</b> stems and a stronger crankshaft. Also an uprated chain driven oil pump was fitted as the turbocharger lubrication required higher flow. In 1978, the OM617.950 was mated with the Mercedes-Benz W116 to produce the North American market-only 300SD, the world's first production turbodiesel sedan. Power originally was 111 hp / 82 kW @ 4200 rpm, torque 228 nm @ 2400 rpm. From October 1979 - 121 hp / 89 kW @ 4350 rpm, torque 230 nm @ 2400 rpm.|$|R
25|$|Chevrolet {{engineered}} several modifications for the Z06 to {{best use}} the increased power. Starting {{with the most}} structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 pounds lighter than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel, non-EMT tires, reduced sound proofing, fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM air intake, stiffer valve springs, lighter sodium <b>filled</b> <b>valves</b> and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|R
50|$|Valve burn (overheating) {{is another}} problem. It causes {{excessive}} valve wear and defective sealing, {{as well as}} engine knocking (the hot valve causes the fuel to prematurely ignite). It can be solved by valve cooling systems that use water or oil as a coolant. In high performance or turbo charged engines sometimes sodium <b>filled</b> <b>valve</b> stems are used. These valve stems then act as a heat pipe. A major cause of burnt valves {{is a lack of}} valve clearance at the tappet; the valve cannot completely close. This reduces its ability to conduct heat to the cylinder head via the seat, and may allow hot combustion gases to flow between the valve and its seat. Burnt valves will cause a low compression in the affected cylinder and loss of power.|$|R

50|$|The tanks have {{fittings}} for filling, liquid outlet, emergency {{relief of}} excess pressure, fuel level gauge {{and sometimes a}} vapour outlet. These may be separate valves mounted {{into a series of}} 3 to 5 holes in a plate welded into the tank shell, or may be assembled onto a multi-valve unit which is bolted into one large hole on a boss welded, {{or in the case of}} an aluminium tank, extruded as part of the tank shell.Modern <b>fill</b> <b>valves</b> are usually fitted with an automatic fill limiter (AFL) to prevent overfilling. The AFL has a float arm which restricts the flow significantly but does not shut it off entirely. This is intended to cause the pressure in the line to rise enough to tell the bowser to stop pumping but not cause dangerously high pressures. Before AFLs were introduced, it was common for the filler (with integral check valve) to be screwed directly into the tank, as the operator had to open an ullage valve at the tank while filling, allowing vapour out of the top of the tank and stopping filling when liquid started coming out of the ullage valve to indicate that the tank was full. Modern tanks are not fitted with ullage valves.|$|R
