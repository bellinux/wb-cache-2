5|$|The <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn The {{membership}} and ritual of the <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn were strongly linked to Freemasonry, but membership {{was open to}} non-masons and to women. The grades formed a teaching system for the Kabbalah, and initiates had to pass an exam before being allowed {{to advance to the}} next degree.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist {{point of view of a}} male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen as a starting point for a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and <b>Hermetic</b> Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title <b>Hermetic</b> Definition (1972). The poem <b>Hermetic</b> Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} astrologers to bring <b>Hermetic</b> astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, astrologer to the emperor Tiberius, the first emperor {{to have had a}} court astrologer, though his {{predecessor}} Augustus had used astrology to help legitimise his Imperial rights.|$|E
5|$|Fortune was a {{ceremonial}} magician. The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted {{from the late}} nineteenth century <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science. The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and evocation, in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.|$|E
5|$|In {{establishing}} the Temple, Aquino {{was joined by}} other ex-members of LaVey's Church, and soon Setian groups, or pylons, were established {{in various parts of}} the United States. The structure of the Temple was based largely on those of the ceremonial magical orders of the late nineteenth century, such as the <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death. He had already made a strong case that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were likely to have been imported from some aspects of the Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} London, his editorship of the Freemason ignited an {{interest}} in the study of Masonic history, and led to the establishment of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, dedicated to masonic research. Woodford was the first Immediate Past Master of the lodge, and as such convened the lodge for much of its first two years, during the frequent absences of Charles Warren, the master. Just before his death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn.|$|E
5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his <b>hermetic</b> lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{thought was}} not always cohesive, and was {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, scientific naturalism, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tantra into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.|$|E
5|$|The sixth book, Darke (published in America in June 2011 and England in October 2011), sees Septimus and {{his friends}} battling the Darke which has engulfed the Castle and {{everything}} and everyone in it. The only thing that is standing in between is Merrin Meredith and his gang of Things and his Darke Dragon. Alther Mella has been Banished (together with Tertius Fume) and Septimus wants to release him from the Darke Halls thinking he could help in undoing the Darke. When Marcia Overstrand, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard undoes the Darke spell {{with the help of}} the Paired Codes, all is well. Beetle becomes Chief <b>Hermetic</b> Scribe; Simon is reunited with his family after leaving his past behind and Princess Jenna is happy that the Palace and Castle are back to normal.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between the <b>hermetic</b> and semi-hermetic, is that the <b>hermetic</b> uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the <b>hermetic</b> fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, the <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn {{was open}} to both sexes and treated them as equals. The Order was a {{specifically}} <b>Hermetic</b> society that taught alchemy, kabbalah, and the magic of Hermes, along {{with the principles of}} occult science.|$|E

25|$|Compressors used in {{refrigeration}} {{systems are}} {{often described as}} being either <b>hermetic,</b> open, or semi-hermetic, to describe how the compressor and motor drive are situated {{in relation to the}} gas or vapor being compressed. The industry name for a <b>hermetic</b> is hermetically sealed compressor, while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a semi-hermetic compressor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hermetic</b> magic {{underwent}} a 19th-century revival in Western Europe, {{where it was}} practiced by {{groups such as the}} <b>Hermetic</b> Order of the Golden Dawn, Aurum Solis, and Ragon. It was also practiced by individual persons, such as Eliphas Lévi, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Machen, Frederick Hockley, and Kenneth M. Mackenzie.|$|E

25|$|In 1945, <b>Hermetic</b> texts {{were found}} near the Egyptian town Nag Hammadi. One of these texts had {{the form of}} a {{conversation}} between Hermes and Asclepius. A second text (titled On the Ogdoad and Ennead) told of the <b>Hermetic</b> mystery schools. It was written in the Coptic language, the latest and final form in which the Egyptian language was written.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of <b>hermetic</b> compressors {{is that the}} motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained, and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails. A further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems, thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced. Typically, <b>hermetic</b> compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared {{to the value of}} the device, and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Walter Scott {{placed the}} date of the <b>Hermetic</b> texts shortly after 200AD, but W. Flinders Petrie placed their origin between 200 and 500BC.|$|E

25|$|From the Renaissance onwards Jewish Kabbalah texts entered non-Jewish culture, {{where they}} were studied and {{translated}} by Christian Hebraists and <b>Hermetic</b> occultists. The syncretic traditions of Christian Kabbalah and <b>Hermetic</b> Qabalah developed independently of Jewish Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universal ancient wisdom. Both adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Judaic understanding, to merge with other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations. With the decline of Christian Cabala in the Age of Reason, <b>Hermetic</b> Qabalah continued as a central underground tradition in Western esotericism. Through these non-Jewish associations with magic, alchemy and divination, Kabbalah acquired some popular occult connotations forbidden within Judaism, where Jewish theurgic Practical Kabbalah was a minor, permitted tradition restricted for a few elite. Today, many publications on Kabbalah belong to the non-Jewish New Age and occult traditions of Cabala, rather than giving an accurate picture of Judaic Kabbalah. Instead, academic and traditional publications now translate and study Judaic Kabbalah for wide readership.|$|E
