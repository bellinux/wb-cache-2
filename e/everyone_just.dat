Fleetwood has noted the [...] "tremendous emotional sacrifices" [...] made by <b>everyone</b> <b>just</b> to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section.

500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, <b>everyone</b> <b>just</b> standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
