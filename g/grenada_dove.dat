5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{threat to}} the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> is {{considered}} to be habitat fragmentation (Birdlife International 2000). As early as 1947, Bond indicated that one of the primary causes of rarity and extinction for avifauna in the West Indies was habitat destruction by human activities. [...] Jackson and Associates noted many factors that could affect <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> populations, including land development, livestock grazing, and harvesting of firewood, the underlying cause being lack of land development regulation. Active charcoal pits were discovered adjacent to the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> visitor centre and charcoal damage was noted in all areas of known <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> habitat during 2005 surveys.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> {{are assumed}} to be territorial, and current {{population}} estimates are based on this assumption. <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> in the Mount Hartman area have been observed fighting (Blockstein 1988), and other Leptotila species show varying degrees of territorial behaviour (Goodwin 1983). Herbert Bright maintained captive Leptotila doves in England and documented a breeding pair killing other congeneric doves introduced to the aviary. Bright refers to these birds as Well’s doves, although his physical descriptions of the birds indicate that they may have been L. verrauxi imported from Tobago.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> {{have been}} {{documented}} in south-western Grenada within the Mount Hartman, Clark’s Court Bay, and Richmond Hill watersheds (Blockstein 1988, Blockstein and Hardy 1989). The Mount Hartman watershed has received {{the greatest amount of}} scientific investigation and is considered by other researchers to be the representative habitat for the species (Blockstein 1988, Blockstein and Hardy 1989). Part of this watershed has been designated as a national park and is the only official national park in <b>Grenada.</b> <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> also have been recorded from western Grenada (Blockstein 1988, Blockstein and Hardy 1989).|$|R
5000|$|The Grenada Government [...] - [...] in {{cooperation}} with the World Bank [...] - [...] set up two reserve zones in 1996 to preserve the dove: the Perseverance and adjacent Woodford Estates, which are adjacent to a landfill and abandoned quarry site, in the west of the island and a sanctuary of c.150 acre within the Mount Hartman Estate, a former government cattle farm and sugarcane plantation, in the south. Camera surveys of the Mount Hartman area failed to record the presence of <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> there immediately following Hurricane Ivan in 2005 and only eighteen encounters with <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> occurred during April-December 2005. According to some studies, the Mount Hartman Sanctuary was never considered adequate for the dove’s survival and other understudied populations are located along the western coast in the Beausejour and Black Bay watersheds. Some of these populations have been recognised since the 1980s. Further populations may exist but {{there has never been a}} complete island-wide survey to verify this.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed dove, Leptotila plumbeiceps, of Central America and the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove,</b> L. wellsi, of Grenada were {{formerly}} considered conspecific with grey-fronted dove.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, predation may affect <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> populations. There {{may have been}} two separate introductions of exotic species on Grenada. Of these, the common opossum, Didelphis marsupialis, which was originally introduced to Grenada by Amerindians, is a potential predator of all life stages of the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove,</b> and other manicou species (Marmosa spp.) are potential nest predators. Exotic mammals introduced with European colonisation include Rattus species, Indian mongooses (Hepestes aropunctatus), Mona monkeys (Cercopithicus mona) and feral cats (Felis silvestris).|$|E
5000|$|Hunting {{may have}} {{affected}} {{the population in the}} past, and the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> has previously been regulated as a game bird. [...] Currently, hunting is not considered a major threat.|$|E
50|$|Beard {{considered}} the thorn woodland seasonal formation to {{be a highly}} degraded habitat created by heavy grazing and intensive agricultural practices. Additionally, preliminary surveys and recent census data indicate <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> occur in both highly fragmented semi-urban areas and more rural environments composed sometimes of highly contrasting levels of housing and economic development. Other members of the genus Leptotila are reported to {{use a variety of}} habitats, ranging from areas associated with human disturbance, deciduous woodlands, humid forests, thickets, and semi-arid areas (Goodwin 1993).|$|R
50|$|Rivera Lugo has {{suggested}} that past disturbance may have created new artificial vegetative cover types {{that are difficult to}} classify as natural forest communities. Recent classification of land cover types through satellite imagery found that Grenada’s dry forest might be more appropriately considered as ecological complexes, and that there may be correlations between human influence and vegetative cover. The Rivera Lugo investigations suggest that <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> are using a mixture of three seasonal forest formations: semi-evergreen forest, deciduous seasonal forest, and thorn woodlands. These categories are based on work by Beard and are applied widely throughout the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Some surveys {{imply that}} <b>Grenada</b> <b>doves</b> are {{associated}} with dry forest communities {{in the west and}} southwest parts of the main island (Blockstein 1988, Blockstein and Hardy 1989, Bird Life International 2000). True dry forest ecosystems are remnants of a type of xeric scrub habitat that dominated the West Indies {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene, and most areas classified as dry forest in the Caribbean are mosaics of degraded habitat, and do not represent natural ecosystems (Murphy and Lugo 1986, Vidal and Casado 2000). Beard noted the degraded nature of forested areas in Grenada in 1949.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> is {{a little-known}} species endemic {{to the main}} island of Grenada, West Indies. Historically, it has been {{recorded}} from locations throughout Grenada, including offshore islands, and the type specimen was collected from Fontenoy, on the west coast.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> is characterised {{by a white}} throat; {{face and}} {{forehead}} pale pink shading to dull brown on crown and nape; upperparts olive brown; underwing chestnut; neck and upper breast pink-buff fading to white on lower breast, belly and undertail coverts.|$|E
50|$|The grey-headed dove (Leptotila plumbeiceps) {{is a large}} New World {{tropical}} dove. It is {{a resident}} breeder from eastern Mexico to western Panama. It was formerly considered conspecific with the grey-fronted dove, L. rufaxilla, of South America and the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove,</b> L. wellsi, of Grenada.|$|E
50|$|First {{described}} in 1884 by Lawrence {{as a member}} of the genus Engyptila, it was established as a distinct species using sonographic analysis by Blockstein and Hardy (1988). Now officially known as the <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove,</b> it was designated as the national bird in 1991 and is one of the flagship species for conservation efforts in Grenada.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> [...] (Leptotila wellsi) is a {{medium-sized}} New World tropical dove. It is endemic {{to the island}} of Grenada in the Lesser Antilles. Originally known as the pea dove or Well's dove, it is the National Bird of Grenada. It {{is considered to be}} one of the most critically endangered doves in the world (Bird Life International 2000).|$|E
50|$|<b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> were {{documented}} consuming Carica papaya (Papaya) during diet studies {{associated with}} Grenada Dry Forest Ecosystem Protection Project. Observations {{have been made}} of Grenada doves foraging on the ground (Blockstein 1998). Leptotila in captivity have been documented consuming mealworms. Other Leptotila species have been observed eating fruits, seeds, and agricultural grain. L. verrauxi is known to visit bird feeders (Goodwin 1983), {{and other members of}} the genus have been observed eating fruit from the forest floor (Estrada et al. 1984, Coates-Estrada and Estrada 1986), as well as directly from plants (Goodwin 1983).|$|E
50|$|Only one active <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> nest {{has been}} {{documented}}. This nest was active during January and February {{and was found}} in a palm. Juveniles also have been found on the ground and photographed by Grenada’s Forestry and National Parks Department (FNDP) staff; no nest was documented for this encounter. Additionally, there is a record of a dove flushing from a nest. Bright noted that Leptotila doves in captivity abandoned their nest when disturbed, but by using artificial nesting substrates, he successfully collected eggs and hand-reared young. Bright’s doves produced two buff-coloured eggs per clutch. This is consistent with literature reports from other members of the genus (Goodwin 1983).|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{distribution}} census included {{individuals from the}} Beausejour, Perseverance, Woodford, and Black Bay watersheds. Part of the Perseverance watershed, adjacent to the island’s new sanitary landfill and {{across the street from}} the old landfill, has been established as a <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> sanctuary. This area includes a designated travel corridor to link areas of habitat on the north and south sides of the new landfill. The old landfill is currently on fire and has been burning since February 2004. An emergency landfill, which has been established to accommodate the large volume of debris created by Hurricane Ivan in early September 2004, is encroaching on the Perseverance sanctuary.|$|E
5000|$|Grenada ( [...] ; La Grenade) is {{an island}} country in the southeastern Caribbean Sea {{consisting}} of the island of Grenada and six smaller islands {{at the southern end}} of the Grenadines island chain. It is located northwest of Trinidad and Tobago, northeast of Venezuela and southwest of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Its size is 344 km2, and it had an estimated population of 110,000 in 2012. Its capital is St. George's. Grenada is also known as the [...] "Island of Spice" [...] due to its production of nutmeg and mace crops, of which it is one of the world's largest exporters. The national bird of Grenada is the critically endangered <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove.</b>|$|E
50|$|Results {{from the}} Grenada Dry Forest Biodiversity Conservation Project {{indicate}} that Grenada doves are found {{most often in}} areas composed primarily of degraded mosaics of evergreen forest. The overall uniting factors in <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove</b> habitat issues are the degraded nature of the habitat and close proximity to human habitation. This is readily apparent at the Mount Hartman sanctuary, which is an old government cattle farm with vegetation composed primarily of exotic species such as Leucaena leucocephala and Heamatoxylon. Populations of doves associated with the old golf course below Jean Anglais, in the Richmond Hill Watershed, are under heavy pressure from development for private homes, and are well outside {{the boundaries of the}} Mount Hartman Sanctuary as are most Grenada doves. Mount Hartman could be considered prime cattle habitat and has been developed as such until recent times.|$|E

The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.

5000|$|The {{official}} {{coat of arms}} of Grenada is {{a shield}} divided into four parts by a golden cross. In the centre of this cross is the Santa Maria, Columbus' flagship. A British lion on a red field {{is shown in the}} upper left and lower right sections of the shield, with a golden crescent moon out of which a lily growsin the upper right and lower left sections. Above the shield there is a golden helmet, topped with a garland of bougainvillea branches. Within the garland are seven red roses, which stand for the seven communities of Grenada. Holding the shield on the dexter side is an armadillo which stands before a corn stalk; on the sinister side is a <b>Grenada</b> <b>dove,</b> which stands before a banana plant. The base represents Mount St. Catherine with the Grand Etang Lake at the centre. A ribbon displays the national motto: [...] "Ever conscious of God we aspire, build and advance as one people." ...|$|E
