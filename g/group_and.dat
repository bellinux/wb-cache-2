We {{define a}} {{category}} containing the discrete quantum <b>groups</b> (<b>and</b> hence the discrete <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> the duals of compact <b>groups)</b> <b>and</b> the compact quantum <b>groups</b> (<b>and</b> hence the compact <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> the duals of discrete groups). The dual {{of an object}} can be defined within the same category {{and we have a}} biduality theorem. This theory extends the duality between compact quantum <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> discrete quantum <b>groups</b> (<b>and</b> hence the one between compact abelian <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> discrete abelian <b>groups).</b> The objects in our category are multiplier Hopf algebras, with invertible antipode, ad-mitting invariant functionals (integrals), satisfying some extra condition (to take care of the non-abelianness of the underlying algebras). If we start with a multiplier Hopf ∗-algebra with positive invariant functionals, then also the dual is a multiplier Hopf ∗-algebra with positive invariant functionals. This makes it possible to formulate this duality also within the framework of C∗-algebras. 1. Introduction. Let (A,...|$|R
