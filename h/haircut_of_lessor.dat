This thesis is composed of five chapters and additional sub-chapters.

40|$|The paper {{analyzed}} some of {{the approaches}} whose application is eligible for the recording of lease contracts on the side <b>of</b> <b>lessor</b> so that this recording display {{as closely as possible}} the essence of the lease relationship {{and at the same time}} it would be symmetrical to the way of recording on the side of lessee resulting not from value of transferred physical assets but from the evaluated right to use this asset. Impacts of individual variants of approaches into the income statement and statement of financial position are analyzed. It turns out that apparently it is not possible to apply only one approach (as it is in the case of lessee), without gross distortion of the financial position <b>of</b> the <b>lessor.</b> Some <b>of</b> the options of derecognition approach truly shows the situation, especially in long-term leases and leases where the risks and rewards associated with the lease are transferred to the lessee, for the other leases it is recommended sometimes to use underecognition property from the assets <b>of</b> the <b>lessor</b> during the lease period, but rather report a liability to leave to lessee to use (performance obligations approach). Compared with the current method of recording an operating lease, this approach without taking into account the cost of maintenance leads to another course of reporting profits (rise in the early stages against the growth in the final stages), but also brings a more fundamental problem, and it is overvaluation <b>of</b> <b>lessor’s</b> assets. In addition, it is possible to doubt about the correctness to report such liability as an unconditional liability. The approach is also not consistent with the IASB and the FASB project that is devoted to the recognition of revenues. The possible way, according to author’s opinion, might be regulation of existing model of reporting operating lease or derecognition approach...|$|R

40|$|Bankruptcy Code section 502 (b) (6) {{sets the}} maximum {{allowable}} amount {{of a real}} property lessor 2 ̆ 7 s claim for damages arising for breach of lease in a tenant 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy case. To the extent a lessor 2 ̆ 7 s damages claim under nonbankruptcy law exceeds the maximum amount, it is disallowed. The implicit premise for such disallowance is that real property lessors 2 ̆ 7 damages claims are less worthy of respect in bankruptcy than other claims for damages against the debtor. Real property leases are legally distinct from leases of personal property or other contractual relationships that allocate property rights. But, it does not obviously follow from the distinction that a damages claim for breach of a real property lease is inferior to other claims. This article considers section 502 (b) (6) {{in light of the}} political, economic, and legal forces that shaped it. It explores the history <b>of</b> real property <b>lessors</b> 2 ̆ 7 claims for damages in bankruptcy cases {{from the beginning of the}} twentieth century to the present. It then considers the stated justifications for disallowance <b>of</b> <b>lessors</b> 2 ̆ 7 claims under section 502 (b) (6) and concludes they are unconvincing. Disallowance <b>of</b> part <b>of</b> <b>lessors</b> 2 ̆ 7 damages claims under section 502 (b) (6) reflects and perpetuates irrational bias against such claims. Moreover, such disallowance contradicts both contractual theory and modern bankruptcy policy...|$|R

40|$|Section 51 AC of the TPA {{commenced}} on 1 July 1998 and {{was enacted}} primarily {{to answer the}} serious complaints made to the Reid Committee about the allegedly unconscionable conduct <b>of</b> <b>lessors</b> in their dealings with small traders in retail shopping complexes. Since then New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have enacted derivative provisions in their retail shop leasing legislation allowing retail leasing tribunals to consider instances of unconscionable conduct by lessors.

The article examines the types <b>of</b> <b>lessor</b> conduct retail lessees have claimed is unconscionable and concludes with the finding that the situations in which a lessor’s conduct is likely to be unconscionable under s 51 AC have generally been limited to circumstances where a <b>lessor's</b> manipulation <b>of</b> their position or legal rights to deliberately force the termination of the lease or cessation of the lessee's business is clearly evident. ...|$|R
