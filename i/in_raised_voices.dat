What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking <b>in</b> <b>raised</b> <b>voices.</b> When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
6000|$|The {{school at}} Wimbledon was a large, hushed, faded place {{presided over by}} a lady of hidden motives and great {{exterior}} calm named Miss Beeton Clavier. She was handsome without any improper attractiveness, an Associate in Arts of St. Andrew's University and a cousin of Mr. Blenker of the Old Country Gazette. She was assisted by several resident mistresses and two very carefully married visiting masters for music and Shakespear, and playground and shrubbery and tennis-lawn were all quite effectively hidden from the high-road. The curriculum included Latin Grammar--nobody ever got to the reading of books in that formidable tongue--French by an English lady {{who had been in}} France, Hanoverian German by an irascible native, the more seemly aspects of English history and literature, arithmetic, algebra, political economy and drawing. There was no hockey played within the precincts, science was taught without the clumsy apparatus or objectionable diagrams that are now so common, and stress was laid upon the carriage of the young ladies and the iniquity of speaking <b>in</b> <b>raised</b> <b>voices.</b> Miss Beeton Clavier deprecated the modern [...] "craze for examinations," [...] and released from such pressure her staff did not so much give courses of lessons as circle in a thorough-looking and patient manner about their subjects. This turn-spit quality was reflected in the school idiom; one did not learn algebra or Latin or so-forth, one did algebra, one was put into Latin....|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the extent to which felt job insecurity facilitates or hinders employees from <b>raising</b> <b>voice</b> (i. e. speaking up to their authority). The authors introduce punishment and reward sensitivity, two constructs of reinforcement sensitivity theory, as dispositional factors that might lead employees to appraise felt job insecurity as a hindrance vs challenge stressor. The authors propose employees high on punishment sensitivity to feel more constrained <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> <b>voice</b> because felt job insecurity to them is akin to a threat. Employees high on reward sensitivity should see felt job insecurity as a challenge, making it more likely that they will speak up. Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses were tested using moderated structural equation modeling analysis. The sample consisted of 232 employees confronted with organizational change. Findings - The results are in line with the view of felt job insecurity as a hindrance stressor. Felt job insecurity negatively affected voice among both high and low punishment-sensitive individuals. Similarly, felt job insecurity was negatively related to voice in both low and high reward-sensitive individuals, although in the latter group the relationship was less pronounced. Originality/value - The literatures on felt job insecurity and voice have developed parallel to one another, without much cross-dialogue. Furthermore, the few existing studies that did relate felt job insecurity to employee voice have yielded conflicting results. The present study offers a theoretical account of the existing ambiguities in the literature, and generates new insights into why some employees more than others react to felt job insecurity by self-censoring their ideas and opinions...|$|R

6000|$|A withered, yellow, sodden, dead-alive looking woman,--an opium-eater. A deaf man, {{with a great}} fancy for conversation, so {{that his}} {{interlocutor}} is compelled to halloo and bawl over the rumbling of the coach, amid which he hears best. The sharp tones of a woman's voice appear to pierce his dull organs much better than a masculine voice. The impossibility of saying anything but commonplace matters to a deaf man, of expressing any delicacy of thought <b>in</b> a <b>raised</b> tone, of giving utterance to fine feelings in a bawl. This man's deafness seemed to have made his mind and feelings uncommonly coarse; for, after the opium-eater had renewed an old acquaintance with him, almost the first question he asked, <b>in</b> his <b>raised</b> <b>voice,</b> was, [...] "Do you eat opium now?" ...|$|R

40|$|Development {{assistance}} {{has been}} of benefit to developing countries over the years. It has helped tobuild physical infrastructural, human and institutional capacities and deliver some level of growth in recipient countries. Through civil society organizations, it has been instrumental <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> <b>voices</b> {{on the need for}} good governance, to stem the tide of corruption and promote development effectiveness of both aid and domestic resources. Development assistance has equally had its negative results list. Traditional technical assistance has tended to supplant local capacity, undermine local knowledge and institutions and render recipient countries more vulnerable and dependent on aid. Reasons for these shortcomings are legion. Donor-driven projects are not derived from aid recipients' development priorities and are an expression of an attitude by donors that "they know better', "they lecture and recipients listen", "they give and poor countries receive", "they know and recipient countries learn", "they take care of things, because poor countries cannot" [...] . Hence, as it was once said, when a professional from a donor country moves into a recipient country he/she is seen as an expert, but when a professional from a recipient country moves into a donor country, he/she is seen as an immigrant. These and numerous other factors explain why aid has not succeeded in delivering development results in recipient countries. Trade is very important for poor countries. Yet, aid, because of donors' vested interest and recipients' development weaknesses remains a hugely attractive industry delivering billions of dollars annually to sub-Saharan Africa without tangible results. In spite of this, Africans are not speaking out loud and strong enough on the need for reforms to make aid deliver results. They are also not <b>raising</b> their <b>voices</b> effectively enough to deal with distortions in trade. For instance, disbursement of resources on commitments made by the G 8 at its Summit in Glenn Eagles, Scotland in July 2005 is virtually zero and the European Union Economic Partnership Agreements are questionable...|$|R

40|$|Through {{my thesis}} I wish {{to bring forward}} an {{understanding}} of the mechanisms allowing the present conflict in Israel and the occupied territories to linger, despite of individuals´yearning for peace. My fieldwork was conducted in Jerusalem September 1995 to November 1996, a total of eight months spent in the field. As a consequence of the complexity of the situation, my focus has been solely the Jewish-Israeli side, which is also the "stronger" side. I have concentrated on the complexity of violence itself; approaches and definitions, the aspect of agency, and the establishing of legitimacy. I have further dealt with the effects of the protracted conflict and violence on the Israeli society, the implications for individuals, and the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>raising</b> one´s <b>voice</b> against the practices of oppression. Trying to understand how the individuals deal with the contradiction of being socialised into the tradition of universal human rights on the one hand, and being part of an occupying power on the other, I search for the key orienting forces in the process of legitimating their actions, and see the fluctuating between heroism and victimity as {{an essential part of the}} Israeli ethos as a means of coping with the paradox...|$|R
