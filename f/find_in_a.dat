25|$|Food was {{scarce and}} poor in quality; {{there was no}} sanitation, running water, or plumbing. The camp had poor drainage. The area, due to its {{proximity}} to the Atlantic Ocean, receives {{a great deal of}} rain, which made the clay campgrounds permanently muddy. The inmates made paths with the few stones they could <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vain attempt to keep the mud in check. Pieces of wire that had been stripped of their barbs were placed between the cabins and the toilets and used by the refugees like the railing of a staircase, to maintain balance on the unsteady ground.|$|E
25|$|This ‘staircase’ of flat topped {{terraces}} {{was created}} {{as a result of}} successive periods of deposition and subsequent down cutting by the river, a product of the meltwater and glacially eroded material produced from ice sheets at the end of glacial periods through the Pleistocene epoch between 450,000 and 12,000 years BP. Contained within these terraces is evidence of the mega fauna that once lived along the river, the bones and teeth of animals such as the woolly mammoth, bison and wolves that existed during colder periods have all been identified.

25|$|In 1884 Van and Ada, age 14 and 12, fall passionately in love, {{and their}} affair {{is marked by}} a {{powerful}} sense of romantic eroticism. The book opens with their discovery that they are in fact not cousins but brother and sister. The passage is notoriously difficult, more so as neither of them explicitly states the conclusion they have drawn (treating it as obvious), and it is only referred to in passing later in the text. Although Ada's mother keeps a wedding photo dated August 1871, eleven months before her birth, they <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> box in the attic a newspaper announcement dating the wedding to December 1871; and furthermore that Dan had been abroad since that spring, as proved by his extensive filmreels. Hence he is not Ada's father. Furthermore, they find an annotated flower album kept by Marina in 1869–70 which indicates, very obliquely, that she was pregnant and confined to a sanatorium {{at the same time as}} Aqua; that 99 orchids were delivered to Marina, from Demon, on Van's birthday; and that Aqua had a miscarriage in a skiing accident. It later transpires that Marina gave the child to her sister to replace the one she had lost—so she is in fact Van's mother—and that her affair with Demon continued until Ada's conception. This makes Lucette (Dan and Marina's child) the uterine half-sister of both of them.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of the medieval household was the procuration, storage and preparation of food. This consisted both in feeding the occupants of the residence on a daily basis, and in preparing larger feasts for guests, to maintain the status of the lord. The kitchen was divided into a pantry (for bread, cheese and napery) and a buttery (for wine, ale and beer). These offices were headed by a pantler and a butler respectively. Depending on the size and wealth of the household, these offices would then be subdivided further.

500|$|The Appalachian Plateau {{geologic}} region only {{passes through}} the extreme northwest corner of Georgia. [...] During the middle Ordovician Period (about 440 - 480 million years ago), the tectonic plate carrying this area collided with another plate, leading {{to the creation of}} a new subduction zone and the beginning of the Appalachians As a result of this and later orogenies, alternating beds of hard and soft Paleozoic sedimentary rocks were folded, looking much like the wrinkles one would <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kicked floor rug. [...] In Georgia, the Ridge and Valley includes limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ochre and small amounts of coal. The extent of the Ridge and Valley is bound by the Carters Dam Fault in the east and the Emerson Fault in the south.|$|E
500|$|The final {{appearance}} of Jasmine consequently inspired {{the studio to}} redesign Aladdin accordingly because Katzenberg felt that the main character, who was originally depicted as a younger, [...] "scrawny" [...] underdog, did not resemble a suitable leading man for Jasmine, which they feared would result in unconvincing chemistry between the couple. Thus, they ultimately decided to base Aladdin on actor Tom Cruise instead. Henn's favorite sequence to animate was the scene in which Jasmine discovers Aladdin's true identity and gives him [...] "a look". The filmmakers decided to dress Jasmine in blue to symbolically represent water, which is [...] "the most precious substance one can <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desert". The animators sat the character next to a fountain when she is first introduced in the film to further emphasize this motif and comparison.

500|$|The British scholar Ronald Latham {{has pointed}} out that The Book of Marvels was in fact a {{collaboration}} written in 1298–1299 between Polo and a professional writer of romances, Rustichello of Pisa. Latham also argued that Rustichello may have glamorised Polo's accounts, and added fantastic and romantic elements that made the book a bestseller. The Italian scholar Luigi Foscolo Benedetto had previously demonstrated that the book was written in the same [...] "leisurely, conversational style" [...] that characterised Rustichello's other works, and that some passages in the book were taken verbatim or with minimal modifications from other writings by Rustichello. For example, the opening introduction in The Book of Marvels to [...] "emperors and kings, dukes and marquises" [...] was lifted straight out of an Arthurian romance Rustichello had written several years earlier, and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter's court is almost {{the same as that of}} the arrival of Tristan at the court of King Arthur at Camelot in that same book. Latham believed that many elements of the book, such as legends of the Middle East and mentions of exotic marvels, may have been the work of Rustichello who was giving what medieval European readers expected to <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> travel book.|$|E
500|$|In 1781, the {{astronomer}} William Herschel was searching {{the sky for}} elusive stellar parallaxes, when he observed what he termed a comet in the constellation of Taurus. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased {{in proportion to the}} power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> telescope. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his [...] "comet", his colleague, British Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, wrote to him, saying, [...] "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it." [...] The [...] "comet" [...] was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named Uranus after the father of Saturn.|$|E
500|$|Close to the Edge, the group's second album, was {{released}} in 1992. Certified gold by the RIAA for U.S. shipments of 500,000 copies, the album produced the Top 5 country hits [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Oh Me, Oh My, Sweet Baby", the latter of which was originally recorded by George Strait on his 1989 album Beyond the Blue Neon. The next singles, [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", both failed to reach top 10. Roe considered Close to the Edge a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it; in a 1994 interview with New Country magazine, he stated: [...] "There aren't ten great songs out there for everybody, certainly not that you could <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 30-day period of time." [...] Olander was also critical of the novelty factor of [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet", which he co-wrote, {{saying that it was}} [...] "by far not my favorite Diamond Rio recording – but that's at the time when I'm thinkin', 'Oh, this is easy, let's write this. It's kinda cute." [...] Brian Mansfield of Allmusic was also critical of the song, but described the rest of the album with favor, saying that its [...] "strongest material emphasizes the virtues of God, family and honest living – traditional stuff, no doubt influenced by the members' bluegrass background", while Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune thought that [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", [...] "which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood", were the strongest tracks.|$|E

500|$|While Lavigne denied being angry, her {{interviews}} were still {{passionate about the}} media's {{lack of respect for}} her songwriting. She said [...] "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing [...] "full-structured songs" [...] since she was 14. Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles [...] "Complicated", [...] "Sk8er Boi" [...] and [...] "I'm with You". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that [...] "one of those songs aren't from me". In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism and criticized her songwriting, saying that [...] "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything." [...] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for [...] "clear defamation" [...] against her character. Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that [...] "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her." [...] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" [...] for her song [...] "Girlfriend". Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, [...] "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd <b>find</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos."
