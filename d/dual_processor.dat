40|$|The {{goals of}} the phase I program were to enhance the {{software}} package ''CyberRay'' as follows: (1) Incorporate a particle-in-cell space charge model; (2) Incorporate a model for transition radiation; (3) Develop versions for both Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OS X operating systems; and (4) Incorporate support for <b>dual</b> <b>processors.</b> The program was very successful. The space charge model, transition radiation model, and support for two operating systems were fully implemented resulting in a unique product useful to both the accelerator and laser communities.

50|$|A special {{configuration}} of the G-20, a <b>dual</b> <b>processor</b> G-21, was used to support campus computing at Carnegie Institute of Technology in the 1960s. Usually the two processors ran independently, one CPU handling card-based input, and the other handling jobs submitted through one of 16 AT&T Dataphones connected to telephone lines, usually via Teletype Model 35 KSR, Model 35 ASR and Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinters. The G-21 had 32k words of memory for each processor, but could be reconfigured for 64k mode for large programs, usually as a single processor.
