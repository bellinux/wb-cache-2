In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Their flavor <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's bird {{diversity}} <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by {{its position}} on two major migration routes, with 392 confirmed identified species; 287 of these nesting within the province. These include the great grey owl, the province's official bird, and the endangered peregrine falcon.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{started in}} Whitby during the Georgian period and {{developed}} further on {{the arrival of}} the railway in 1839. Its attraction as a tourist destination <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by its proximity to the high ground of the North York Moors National Park, its Heritage Coastline and by its association with the horror novel Dracula. Jet and alum were mined locally. Whitby Jet, which was mined by the Romans and Victorians, became fashionable during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke {{is served}} by {{regional}} radio stations The Breeze serving North Hampshire and parts of Surrey and Sussex and Heart Berkshire, broadcast from Reading and London also provides regional coverage in the area. BBC Berkshire {{is available in the}} town. The town has coverage from digital radio; the BBC, Independent National and Now Reading multiplexes can be received in the town, and the outskirts can receive London and South Hampshire stations as well. The BBC national stations and DAB coverage <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by a small relay just south of the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} other animals can be transmitted by ticks, the species of tick involved tending to be those with a wide host range. Spread of disease in this way <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by the extended time during which a tick remains attached, during which time the mobile host can be carried long distances, {{or in the case}} of bird hosts, across the sea. The infective agents can be present not only in the adult tick but also in the eggs produced plentifully by the females. Many tick species have extended their ranges as a result of the movements of people, their pets and livestock. With increasing participation in outdoor activities such as wilderness hikes, more people and their dogs may find themselves exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|Cricket is {{more similar}} to {{baseball}} than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by {{the importance of the}} batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.|$|E
50|$|Memory {{processes}} {{have been}} shown to <b>be</b> stabilized and <b>enhanced</b> (sped up and/or integrated) by nocturnal sleep and even daytime naps. Certain sleep stages are noted to improve an individual's memory, although this is task specific. Generally, declarative memories <b>are</b> <b>enhanced</b> by slow-wave sleep, while non-declarative memories <b>are</b> <b>enhanced</b> by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results.|$|R

It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK.|$|E
5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids <b>is</b> <b>enhanced.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E

5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more carbohydrates, {{proteins}} and fats and that 24-hour energy expenditure shows increases between 2.5-11.5%. The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase. In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Spider-Man 3 {{picks up}} {{one year after}} the events of the second film. Peter is still seeing Mary Jane Watson, while Harry Osborn succeeds his father as the new Green Goblin. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who like Peter is a {{photographer}} for the Daily Bugle, sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster later known as Sandman. Peter later learns that Marko is the one that killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow. This vendetta <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume. Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom.|$|E

25|$|Transcription of the reductase gene <b>is</b> <b>enhanced</b> by the sterol {{regulatory}} element binding protein (SREBP). This protein binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), {{located on}} the 5' end of the reductase gene. When SREBP is inactive, it is bound to the ER or nuclear membrane with another protein called SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). When cholesterol levels fall, SREBP is released from the membrane by proteolysis and migrates to the nucleus, where it binds to the SRE and transcription <b>is</b> <b>enhanced.</b> If cholesterol levels rise, proteolytic cleavage of SREBP from the membrane ceases and any proteins in the nucleus are quickly degraded.|$|E
