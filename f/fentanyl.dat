5|$|Midazolam {{is known}} to cause {{respiratory}} depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of midazolam may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with <b>fentanyl,</b> the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2009, he co-hosted the 2009 Kerrang! Awards {{alongside}} Scott Ian of Anthrax. The following year, {{they both}} once again co-hosted The Kerrang Awards, where Corey collected the K! Services to Metal award {{on behalf of}} Paul Gray, who died after an accidental overdose of morphine and <b>fentanyl.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, rectal or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of <b>fentanyl</b> transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Gray was {{planning}} to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he {{was found dead in}} an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, {{the cause of death was}} confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute <b>fentanyl.</b>|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as <b>fentanyl),</b> for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
25|$|Early {{carbon dioxide}} {{retention}} causing cutaneous vasodilatation (releasing more <b>fentanyl),</b> together with acidosis, which reduces protein binding of <b>fentanyl,</b> releasing yet more <b>fentanyl.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, <b>fentanyl</b> was {{introduced}} for palliative {{use with the}} <b>fentanyl</b> patch, followed {{in the next decade}} by the introduction of the <b>fentanyl</b> lollipop, dissolving tablets, and sublingual spray which are absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth. , <b>fentanyl</b> was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. In 2013, 1,700 kilograms (3,750 lbs) were used globally. <b>Fentanyl</b> has a relatively wide therapeutic index (270) which makes it a very safe surgical anaesthetic when monitored carefully; however, its potency requires careful measurements of highly diluted <b>fentanyl</b> in solution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl</b> patches {{are on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most}} {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Fentanyl</b> was first made by Paul Janssen in 1960. Janssen developed <b>fentanyl</b> by testing chemicals similar in structure to pethidine (meperidine) for opioid activity. The widespread use of <b>fentanyl</b> triggered the production of <b>fentanyl</b> citrate (the salt formed by combining <b>fentanyl</b> and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio), which entered medical use as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, <b>fentanyl</b> is {{classified}} as a controlled Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. In the Netherlands, <b>fentanyl</b> is a List I substance of the Opium Law. In the U.S., <b>fentanyl</b> is a Schedule II controlled substance per the Controlled Substance Act.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl</b> analogues may be {{hundreds}} of times more potent than street heroin, and tend to produce significantly more respiratory depression, making it much more dangerous than heroin to users. <b>Fentanyl</b> is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. <b>Fentanyl</b> is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, often leading to overdoses. Many <b>fentanyl</b> overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Estonia has {{the highest rate of}} 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fentanyl</b> {{product has}} been {{approved}} by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breakthrough cancer pain called Onsolis. It uses a drug delivery technology called BEMA (<b>fentanyl</b> buccal soluble film) on a small disc placed in the mouth. Unlike many other <b>fentanyl</b> products, the drug cannot be abused by crushing and inhaling.|$|E
25|$|Several large {{quantities}} of illicitly produced <b>fentanyl</b> have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In June 2006, 945 grams (2.08 lbs) of 83 %-pure <b>fentanyl</b> powder was seized by Border Patrol agents in California from a vehicle that had entered from Mexico. Mexico {{is the source of}} much of the illicit <b>fentanyl</b> for sale in the U.S. However, in April 2006, there was one domestic <b>fentanyl</b> lab discovered by law enforcement in Azusa, California. The lab was a source of counterfeit 80mg OxyContin tablets containing <b>fentanyl</b> instead of oxycodone, as well as bulk <b>fentanyl</b> and other drugs. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered <b>fentanyl</b> in powder form from China.|$|E
25|$|A <b>fentanyl</b> patient-controlled {{transdermal system}} (PCTS) is under development, {{which aims to}} allow {{patients}} to control administration of <b>fentanyl</b> through the skin during the treatment of perioperative pain.|$|E
25|$|Illicit use of {{pharmaceutical}} <b>fentanyl</b> and its analogues {{first appeared in}} the mid-1970s in the medical community and continues in the present. United States authorities classify <b>fentanyl</b> as a narcotic and an opioid. To date, more than 12 different analogues of <b>fentanyl</b> have been produced clandestinely and identified in the U.S. drug traffic. The biological effects of the <b>fentanyl</b> analogues {{are similar to those of}} heroin, with the exception that many users report a noticeably less euphoric high associated with the drug and stronger sedative and analgesic effects.|$|E
25|$|Non-medical use of <b>fentanyl</b> by {{individuals}} without opiate tolerance {{can be very}} dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances {{are at high risk}} for overdoses. Once the <b>fentanyl</b> is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course {{because of the nature of}} absorption. Illicitly synthesized <b>fentanyl</b> powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure <b>fentanyl</b> powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Paul Janssen under {{the label of}} his relatively newly formed Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1959. In the 1960s, <b>fentanyl</b> was introduced as an intravenous anaesthetic under the trade name of Sublimaze. In the mid-1990s, Janssen Pharmaceutica developed and introduced into clinical trials the Duragesic patch, which is a formation of an inert alcohol gel infused with select <b>fentanyl</b> doses, which are worn to provide constant administration of the opioid {{over a period of}} 48 to 72hours. After a set of successful clinical trials, Duragesic <b>fentanyl</b> patches were introduced into medical practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl,</b> {{also known}} as fentanil, is an opioid pain {{medication}} with a rapid onset and short duration of action. It is a potent agonist of Î¼-opioid receptors. <b>Fentanyl</b> is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, but some <b>fentanyl</b> analogues, which are designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug, may {{be as much as}} 10,000 times more potent than morphine.|$|E
25|$|Following the patch, a {{flavoured}} lollipop of <b>fentanyl</b> citrate {{mixed with}} inert fillers was introduced under {{the brand name}} of Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of <b>fentanyl</b> for use with chronic breakthrough pain. <b>Fentanyl</b> has been developed into an effervescent tab for buccal absorption much like the Actiq lollipop, followed by a buccal spray device for fast-acting relief and other delivery methods currently in development.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016 the {{government}} of British Columbia declared a public health emergency due to overdoses on the illicit opioid <b>Fentanyl.</b> As of November 2016, there had been 755 cases of <b>Fentanyl</b> overdose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl</b> is {{sometimes}} {{sold on the}} black market in the form of transdermal <b>fentanyl</b> patches such as Duragesic, diverted from legitimate medical supplies. The gel from inside the patches may be ingested or injected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl</b> {{may produce}} more {{prolonged}} respiratory depression than other opioid analgesics. In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but {{doctors in the}} United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with <b>fentanyl</b> until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more made seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to <b>fentanyl</b> skin patches.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of intranasal <b>fentanyl</b> {{is about}} 70â90%, {{but with some}} imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, intranasal <b>fentanyl</b> is available in doses of 50, 100, and 200 Âµg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of intranasal <b>fentanyl</b> with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900 out-of-hospital patients.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of drug residue {{from the}} {{clothing}} of two British hostages and the urine {{of a third}} British hostage, {{by a team of}} researchers at the British chemical and biological defense laboratories at Porton Down, Wiltshire, England, indicates two <b>fentanyl</b> derivatives were used. Neither of those two were <b>fentanyl</b> or 3-methylfentanyl (the Russian Minister of Health earlier said <b>fentanyl</b> or one of its derivatives had been used, but did not accurately specify which derivatives).|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{issued a}} health {{advisory}} to emergency departments alerting to 14 overdose deaths among intravenous drug users in Rhode Island associated with acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid analog of <b>fentanyl</b> {{that has never}} been licensed for medical use. In a separate study conducted by the CDC, 82% of <b>fentanyl</b> overdose deaths involved illegally manufactured <b>fentanyl,</b> while only 4% were suspected to originate from a prescription.|$|E
25|$|Opioids {{are safe}} and {{effective}} at providing pain control in patients with acute pancreatitis. Adequate pain control {{requires the use of}} intravenous opiates, usually {{in the form of a}} patient-controlled analgesia pump. Hydromorphone or <b>fentanyl</b> (intravenous) may be used for pain relief in acute pancreatitis. <b>Fentanyl</b> is being increasingly used due to its better safety profile, especially in renal impairment. As with other opiates, <b>fentanyl</b> can depress respiratory function. It can be given both as a bolus as well as constant infusion.|$|E
25|$|In February 2004, {{a leading}} <b>fentanyl</b> supplier, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, L.P., {{recalled}} one lot, and then later, additional lots of <b>fentanyl</b> (brand name: Duragesic) patches because of seal breaches {{which might have}} allowed the drug to leak from the patch. A series of Class II recalls was initiated in March 2004, and in February 2008 ALZA Corporation recalled their 25Âµg/h Duragesic patches due to a concern that small cuts in the gel reservoir could result in accidental exposure of patients or health care providers to the <b>fentanyl</b> gel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fentanyl</b> has a {{therapeutic}} index of 270.|$|E
25|$|Some heroin dealers mix <b>fentanyl</b> powder with heroin to {{increase}} potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. In 2006, illegally manufactured, non-pharmaceutical <b>fentanyl</b> often mixed with cocaine or heroin caused {{an outbreak of}} overdose deaths in the United States and Canada, heavily concentrated in the cities of Dayton, Ohio; Chicago; Detroit; and Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fentanyl</b> patch {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of drugs that may be {{especially}} harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if used by someone other than the person for whom the drug was prescribed. Unused <b>fentanyl</b> patches should be kept in a secure location that is out of childrenâs sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Death from <b>fentanyl</b> {{overdose}} {{was declared}} {{a public health}} crisis in Canada in September 2015, {{and it continues to}} be a significant public health issue. In 2016, deaths from fatal <b>fentanyl</b> overdoses in British Columbia, Canada, averaged two persons per day. In 2017 the death rate rose over 100% with 368 overdose related deaths in British Columbia between January and April 2017.|$|E
25|$|On June 19, 2007, a $5.5 million jury {{verdict was}} awarded in a US case against Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries, Alza Corporation and Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, the {{manufacturers}} of the Duragesic <b>fentanyl</b> transdermal pain patch. This case, the first Federal trial involving the Duragesic <b>fentanyl</b> patch, was tried in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida, West Palm Beach Division.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} if <b>fentanyl</b> gives long term pain relief {{to people with}} neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK {{issued a}} {{warning about the}} {{potential}} for life-threatening harm from accidental exposure to transdermal <b>fentanyl</b> patches, particularly in children, and advised that they should be folded, with the adhesive side in, before being discarded. The patches should be kept away from children, who are most at risk from <b>fentanyl</b> overdose.|$|E
25|$|In children, {{intranasal}} <b>fentanyl</b> {{is useful}} {{for the treatment of}} moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated.|$|E
25|$|In the US <b>Fentanyl</b> caused 20,100 {{deaths in}} 2016, {{a rise of}} 540% over the past 3 years.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a {{more potent}} analgesic, <b>fentanyl</b> tends to induce less nausea, {{as well as}} less histamine-mediated itching, than morphine.|$|E
