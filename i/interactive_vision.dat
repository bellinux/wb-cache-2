40|$|This paper {{describes}} a general architecture for an <b>interactive</b> model-based <b>vision</b> system. A human specifies {{a limited amount}} of information which establishes a context for autonomous interpretation of images. Object models are described by constraints specifying necessary geometrical properties and relationships between objects. The use of constraints allows for flexible object instantiation. A user can indicate an object in a scene and this directs perceptual processing routines as well as constraining future object instantiations. This interactive model-based concept has been applied to the domain of vehicle tracking, and this paper concludes with several processing examples from this domain. 1 Introduction Efforts to develop intelligent and autonomous systems for operation in complex, natural domains have been largely unsuccessful to date, in spite of continued advances in the underlying technologies.

40|$|In recent decades, the {{cognitive}} view {{has had a}} considerable impact on the philosophy of science, and two reasons can for this be identified. First, philosophers have increasingly tended towards naturalistic approaches, as opposed to proposals that are more a priori. Second, {{the cognitive}} sciences underwent considerable development {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century. Motivated by the cognitive view in the philosophy of science, and within a naturalistic framework, the aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between two pairs of views. On the one hand, I consider the theoretical and experimental traditions; and on the other, I examine the views of pure and <b>interactive</b> <b>vision.</b> The two pairs belong to two independent debates; one in the philosophy of science (theoretical vs. experimental traditions) and the other in cognitive psychology (pure vs. <b>interactive</b> <b>vision).</b> Theoretical traditions correspond to a conception of science according to which the goal of scientific practice is to formulate theories that represent the world, and in them experiments play only an instrumental role that is always subsidiary to theory. The model of science promoted in the program of logical empiricism is a good example of such a tradition. Experimental traditions, in contrast, challenge that conception of science by attributing a more important role to experimentation, which is said to provide its own path to knowledge...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} {{preliminary}} implementation {{of an interactive system}} that enables a draftsperson using only the standard {{features of a}} commercial CAD package (AutoCAD) to construct a model-based vision program. Some of the information needed by the model-based vision program is computed automatically from the drawing, but the draftsperson can also provides guidance on expected image-feature types by drawing the corresponding parts of the model on named CAD-layers and can indicate the visibility of arbitrary parts, such as expected shadow lines, by connecting them to modelled parts with invisible construction lines. Our system, running on a workstation, converts small drawings to computer vision programs in approximately 5 seconds, though an additional 35 seconds is used on networking, windowing, and software initialisation. We argue that <b>interactive</b> CAD-based <b>vision</b> compilers are more useful than contemporary batch-mode CAD-based vision compilers and conclude that the emergence of the international standard STEP will support the development of more competent CAD-based vision compilers of all kinds. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a new three-dimensional spatiotemporal template, namely the Volumetric Motion History Image (VMHI), {{for the purpose}} of human motion analysis. Irregularities in human actions typically occur either in speed or orientation; they carry information about the balance and the confidence level of the human subject performing the activity. The proposed VMHI template handles successfully shortcomings of existing spatiotemporal templates related to motion self-occlusion and speed. Therefore, VMHI allows for interactive visualization, as well as quantification of motion performance. This study focuses on the analysis of sway and speed-related abnormalities, which are among the most common motion irregularities in the studied set of human actions.

50|$|Inspiration is {{prior to}} {{consciousness}} {{and outside of}} skill (ingenium in Latin). Technique and performance are independent of inspiration, and therefore {{it is possible for}} the non-poet to be inspired and for a poet or painter's skill to be insufficient to the inspiration. In Hebrew poetics, inspiration is similarly a divine matter. In the Book of Amos, 3:8 the prophet speaks of being overwhelmed by God's voice and compelled to speak. However, inspiration is also a matter of revelation for the prophets, and the two concepts are intermixed to some degree. Revelation is a conscious process, where the writer or painter is aware and <b>interactive</b> with the <b>vision,</b> while inspiration is involuntary and received without any complete understanding.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this work}} {{we present a}} new Markov Random Field model for image binary {{segmentation}} that computes the probability that each pixel belongs to a given class. We show that if a real valued field is computed, instead of a binary one as in graph cuts based methods, then the resultant cost function has noticeable computational and performance advantages. The proposed energy function can be efficiently minimized with standard fast linear order algorithms as Conjugate Gradient or multigrid Gauss-Seidel schemes. Moreover, our formulation accepts a good initial guess (starting point) and avoids to construct from scratch the new solution accelerating the computational process. Then we naturally implement computationally efficient multigrid algorithms. For applications with limited computational time, a good partial solution {{can be obtained by}} stopping the iterations even if the global optimum is not yet reached. We performed a meticulous comparison (with state of the art methods: Graph Cut, Random Walker and GMMF) for the interactive image segmentation (based on trimaps). We compare the algorithms using cross–validation procedures and a simplex decent algorithm for learning the parameter set.

40|$|Recent {{computer}} vision approaches {{are aimed at}} richer image interpretations that extend the standard recognition of objects in images (e. g., cars) to also recognize object attributes (e. g., cylindrical, has-stripes, wet). However, the more idiosyncratic and abstract {{the notion of an}} object attribute (e. g., “cool ” car), the more challenging the task of attribute recognition. This paper considers whether end users can help vision algorithms recognize highly idiosyncratic attributes, referred to here as subjective attributes. We empirically investigated how end users recognized three subjective attributes of cars—”cool”, “cute”, and “classic”. Our results suggest the feasibility of vision algorithms recognizing subjective attributes of objects, but an interactive approach beyond standard supervised learning from labeled training examples is needed.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the possibilities for}} interactive policy-making in European water management. In the new European Water Framework Directive, public information and consultation are major elements in the procedure (process) that leads to River Basin Management Plans. In general, decision making in integrated water management should {{not be limited to}} the application of models and desk studies. Important decisions need a high level of participation. In this <b>interactive</b> approach, <b>visions,</b> ideas, patterns of behaviour and solutions to perceived problems of different societal actors can be identified and incorporated into the decision-making process. For example, farmer organisations, environmental groups and associations of house owners, but also individual citizens often have various and differing ideas about measures that change the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of a river basin. Well-organised interaction has two main potential advantages: 1. The quality of the decision will be higher because specific knowledge of people involved and their different views are taken into consideration. 2. The interaction enables exchange of information which can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the ins and outs of the specific situation and in this way contribute to public support. By means of two examples of water related policy issues in Europe, i. e. economic approaches in the Water Framework Directive and Integrated Product Policy, various opportunities for pluralistic as well as corporatist types of participation in modern water management are presented and discussed...|$|R
