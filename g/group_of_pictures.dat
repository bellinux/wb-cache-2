40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an encoder side error {{resilience}} technique, namely the progressive <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> (PGOP), which {{is well suited}} for rate controlled real-time video transmission over wireless channels. The PGOP scheme {{can be seen as}} an alternative approach to the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> (GOP) that uses periodic intra-frames (I-frames) for low bit-rate channels. This is because: (1) the PGOP scheme can completely stop error propagation in a timely manner; (2) the PGOP scheme avoids the bit rate unevenness problem of I-frames by a progressive intra-updating method. We further apply the PGOP scheme in a novel video perceptual quality feedback framework, and design an on-line algorithm both to help shape the bit rate and to explore the maximum recovery capability of PGOP. The performance of our scheme is demonstrated in a wireless LAN channel. It is to be noted that the PGOP can additionally provide the random access functionality and the technique is applicable to all inter frame based video standards, e. g., MPEG- 4. ...|$|R

50|$|The length between I-frames {{is known}} as the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> (GOP) size. MPEG-1 most {{commonly}} uses a GOP size of 15-18. i.e. 1 I-frame for every 14-17 non-I-frames (some combination of P- and B- frames).

30|$|It {{is clear}} that the coding {{performance}} will decrease with the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> frames participated in the pattern formation process of the proposed OCPG algorithm as the generated PC is gradually approximating the shape of the CRMBs. This process imposes restriction on the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> frames size. Thus, we need to refresh the pattern codebook with a regular interval. As shown by experiments, the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>picture</b> (GOP) size would be good candidate to test whether we need to refresh the codebook. The detailed procedure of pattern codebook refreshment and transmission will be described in Section 3.4.|$|R

Three photographs are taken at separate exposure values (capturing the three in immediate succession) to produce a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>pictures</b> for each frame representing the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. The bracketed groups are consolidated into individual frames. Those frames are then sequenced into video.|$|E

The GOP is a collection of successive pictures within a coded video stream. Each coded video stream consists of successive GOPs, from which the visible frames are generated. Encountering a new GOP in a compressed video stream means that the decoder doesn't need any previous frames in order to decode the next ones, and allows fast seeking through the video.|$|E
