50|$|As {{home and}} {{business}} refrigeration became more common, ice houses disappeared. The home ice delivery business declined, and was virtually {{gone by the}} late 1960s. Smaller ice houses, usually {{no more than a}} sawdust pile covered by a makeshift roof or tarpaulin, continued to be maintained to store ice for use in local events such as fairs.

40|$|The {{effects of}} various natural {{antioxidant}} sources on oxidation of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and fish diet during storage was determined. Juvenile fish were distributed among 18 flow-through tanks (40 fish per tank). Six experimental diets were prepared in triplicate: control (CT), antitox (AT), green tea extract (GE), fig extract (FE), Haeroc product (HP) and by-product of green tea (BG). The experimental diets were stored at two temperatures: room temperature (26. 8 C) for 14 days and frozen (- 30 C) for 16 weeks. Thirty fish were sampled from each tank {{at the end}} of the 8 -week feeding trial. Whole bodies of fish were homogenized and stored in a <b>home</b> <b>freezer</b> (- 9. 6 C) for 24 weeks. Acid values (AVs) and peroxide values (POVs) of the diets and frozen fish during storage were monitored. AVs of the experimental diets tended to increase with the storage period except for that of the HP diet at room temperature. POVs from FE, CT, and BG diets peaked at day 7 and then decreased through the remainder of the experiment. AVs of the experimental diets and fish increased with time at- 30 C and- 9. 6 C. Results of this study show that by-products of green tea and Haeroc product seem to have potential as antioxidants in fish feed to inhibit oxidation of both the feed and fish during storage...|$|E

40|$|Viruses are {{becoming}} increasingly recognized as major causes of foodborne diseases. While adequate cooking is a time-tested method of inactivating viral contaminants, the numerous outbreaks of viral foodborne disease indicate that either thorough cooking does not occur or that the foods are contaminated after cooking. These studies investigated other methods of inactivating viral contaminants in ground pork and pork products;Storage conditions {{can be used to}} decrease viral numbers in pork, but the time needed makes this impractical. At refrigerator (4 °C) temperatures, most viruses tested lasted long after the product would be considered spoiled. At <b>home</b> <b>freezer</b> (- 20 °C) temperatures, many viruses were extremely hardy. Hepatitis A virus survived for one year in the freezer with little loss in titer. Even for those that were inactivated by freezer storage, the time needed for total elimination rendered this method impractical;Viral contaminants in foods can be eliminated by irradiation. However, viruses are substantially smaller targets than bacteria, so a correspondingly larger dosage is needed for inactivation. Currently approved dosages will lower viral numbers but will not inactivate all of the viruses present in foods, unless the viral numbers are quite low;Processing has been shown to adequately inactivate even the most durable of viruses. However, if products are contaminated with viruses after processing, this study indicates that the changes that processing induce in the products will not be effective in inactivating the viruses. This becomes an important control point especially for those products which are meant to be eaten with no further cooking or processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{structure}} and function of human gut microbiota is currently inferred from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses. Recovery of intact DNA and RNA is therefore a critical step in these studies. Here, we evaluated how different storage conditions of fecal samples {{affect the quality of}} extracted nucleic acids and the stability of their microbial communities. Results We assessed the quality of genomic DNA and total RNA by microcapillary electrophoresis and analyzed the bacterial community structure by pyrosequencing the 16 S rRNA gene. DNA and RNA started to fragment when samples were kept at room temperature for more than 24 [*]h. The use of RNAse inhibitors diminished RNA degradation but this protection was not consistent among individuals. DNA and RNA degradation also occurred when frozen samples were defrosted for a short period (1 [*]h) before nucleic acid extraction. The same conditions that affected DNA and RNA integrity also altered the relative abundance of most taxa in the bacterial community analysis. In this case, intra-individual variability of microbial diversity was larger than inter-individual one. Conclusions Though this preliminary work explored a very limited number of parameters, the results suggest that storage conditions of fecal samples affect the integrity of DNA and RNA and the composition of their microbial community. For optimal preservation, stool samples should be kept at room temperature and brought at the laboratory within 24 [*]h after collection or be stored immediately at − 20 °C in a <b>home</b> <b>freezer</b> and transported afterwards in a freezer pack to ensure that they do not defrost at any time.

40|$|Making {{your own}} frozen {{prepared}} foods can be economical. You can cook enough for several meals with little extra effort {{when you have}} the time. For best results, remember that freezing maintains, but does not improve, quality. Use only fresh, high-quality food ingredients. Underripe fruits and vegetables lack flavor, and overripe ones are flat and tough, or soft and mushy after freezing. Meat or poultry that is tender before freezing will stay tender after freezing if it is properly prepared, packaged, frozen, and stored. Cleanliness Observe strict cleanliness in preparing food for the <b>home</b> <b>freezer.</b> Freezer temperatures of 0 degrees F or below do not kill bacteria in food; they simply stop bacteria from multiplying. After the frozen food is thawed, bacteria will grow and multiply again. Strict cleanliness keeps the number of bacteria at a minimum before foods are frozen. Foods to Use and Foods to Avoid You may use many of your own favorite recipes for freezing. Prepare the food in the usual way. Cook thoroughly but do not overcook. There may be further cooking when reheated. Foods That Freeze Well • Cooked chicken or turkey in casseroles. • Stews and goulashes made with beef, lamb, pork, or veal. Most vegetables used in these combination dishes, such as peas, carrots, celery, or small quantities of onion also freeze well. However, potatoes may not be satisfactory. • Baked meat loaf. • Cooked dried beans, such as bean soup and baked beans. Because freezing softens beans somewhat, cook until barely tender for best quality. Limit storage time to two weeks if seasoned with ham or bacon. Foods That Do Not Freeze Well The flavor and texture of some foods become poor during freezing. Avoid using these foods. • Cooked egg white toughens. • Mature potatoes which tend to disintegrate, become watery, or darken. New potatoes are better. • Fried foods tend to lose crispness and become soggy. • Avoid freezing cured meats; salt hastens rancidity. • Fresh salad greens, raw tomatoes, raw apples and grapes become soft, soggy, and mushy...|$|E

40|$|As {{instructors}} who teach laboratory courses in biological psychology/behavioral neuroscience, we {{have often been}} {{at a loss to}} find appropriate experiments where students are able to play both the role of experimenter and subject. The difficulty arises because there are few biological parameters representing CNS activity that can ethically be examined in human participants. As a result, the go-to experiments that allow students to act as both experimenter and subject tend to be electrophysiological in nature (e. g., EEG, GSR, etc.). It was our desire to create a laboratory module that would allow students to collect and analyze a biochemical measure of human neural activity. We report here the development of an experiment module that utilizes an easily obtainable enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (nearly identical to the ELISA) to measure human salivary cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone of the adrenal cortex that {{can be used as a}} peripheral indicator of hypothalamic neural activity. Plasma (and salivary) cortisol levels rise due to circadian influences as well as perturbations in the organism’s environment (i. e., stressors) that make it possible to detect rather robust experimental effects. Also, there has been much debate on the role of cortisol and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation in the pathophysiology of depression making for a clinically relevant extension to the lecture portion dealing with the “stress axis” (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or HPA axis). Collection of salivary cortisol is simple, painless, and non-invasive and can be performed at any time the subject desires. Sample storage is convenient as the samples can be kept in a <b>home</b> <b>freezer.</b> Repeated freeze-thaws do not adversely affect the determination of cortisol levels, so the students can just bring them in on the day of the assay without need of in-transport refrigeration or instructor/student coordination. The assay can be performed successfully by anyone with access to a plate reader and a few commonly-used laboratory items. A single plate assay can be completed in two hours (two to three hours by an inexperienced group of students under supervision). With the available cortisol kit, our students have examined both circadian effects and stressor/relaxation effects on salivary cortisol levels in a laboratory class setting. The module has been employed twice and we intend to include it in each semester that the course is taught. One further impact of the module is that studen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since the U. S. Public Health Service began {{recording}} {{statistics on}} trichinellosis in 1947, {{the number of}} cases reported by state health departments has decreased steadily. In the late 1940 s, health departments reported an average of 400 cases and 10 – 15 deaths each year. From 1991 to 1996, the period covered in this report, three deaths in 230 cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (an average of 38 cases per year), including 14 multiple case outbreaks from 31 states and Washington, DC. Information on the suspected food item was available for 134 (58 %) of the 230 reported cases. Pork was implicated in 80 (60 %) cases, bear meat in 31 (23 %), walrus meat in 13 (10 %), and cougar meat in 10 (7 %). Sausage was the most frequently implicated pork product (i. e., 57 of the 64 cases for which the form of the pork product was identified). The proportion of trichinellosis cases attributable to consumption of commercial pork continued to decrease; this decrease was probably due to a combination of factors, including the continued reduction in the prevalence of Trichinella spiralis in domestic swine, the increased use of <b>home</b> <b>freezers,</b> and the practice of thoroughly cooking pork. As a proportion of all cases reported, those associated with wild game meat products has increased; however, the absolute numbers of such cases have remained similar at approximately 9 – 12 per year. The continued multiple case outbreaks and the identification of nonpork sources of infection indicate the need for further education and control measures.

40|$|Finding a worm in fish is {{considered}} a natural occurrence and not a form of contamination. Parasitic worms are described medically as helminths, and divided into 2 broad categories: roundworms (nematodes) and tapeworms (cestodes). Fish parasites – roundworms and tapeworms – can be a health concern to humans if ingested in their live state. The parasitic helminths of concern in BC fish are anasakid roundworms found in marine-water fish (Anisakis simplex, Pseudoterranova decipiens), and fresh-water fish tapeworms (Diphyllobothrium spp.). These worms are very common in BC fish. Diphyllobothrium on trout Thorough cooking and/or freezing will kill these parasites. Photo courtesy of Jeff Burrows, Fish Biologist In BC, the incidence of anasakid and Diphyllobothrium human infections is quite low. A survey between 1997 and 2007 revealed the case rate for Diphyllobothrium infections averaged 0. 8 per population 100, 000 over the 10 -year period. 1 How can fish parasites be killed? There are two reliable techniques that may be followed: • Cook fish to an internal temperature of 63 °C (145 oF); for stuffed fish increase internal temperature to 74 oC (165 oF) and cook for 10 minutes per inch thickness. Fish muscle should turn from translucent to white (e. g. cod) or orange (e. g. salmon), flake at the centre and separate easily from the bone. • Freezing fish or fish products to an internal temperature of- 35 °C for 15 hours,- 20 °C for at least 7 days, or to- 35 °C until frozen, and held at- 20 °C {{for a minimum of}} 24 hours. 2 The critical factor is to ensure that the centre of the fish is solidly frozen. Not all <b>home</b> <b>freezers</b> can freeze to these temperatures. Fish processing plants and Sushi Grade Fish: Fish processing plants have a control program for species likely to contain parasites. Cleaning fish soon after they are caught will reduce larvae from infecting the flesh. Candling tables (lighted tables) are often used to locate and extract any worms found in the flesh. Unfortunately not all worms can be found when they are embedded in thick fillets. Sushi grade fish must be previously frozen as described, or be exempt from freezing if the fish species is unlikely to be contaminated by parasites (i. e., some species of tuna and farmed salmon).

50|$|The {{company began}} as York Manufacturing Company (YMC). YMC had 6 {{original}} investors, Stephen Morgan Smith, Jacob Loucks, Henry H. LaMotte, Oliver J. Bollinger, George Buck, and Robert Shetter. The company made {{a variety of}} products over the decades. Its early-era product line included steam engines, turbines, washing machines, and farm machinery. Its interests grew in commercial ice making plant and commercial refrigeration plant for food processing and commercial cold storage; these eventually developed into its main line of business from the 1890s through the 1920s. For example, it {{did a lot of}} dairy plant business, including ice cream plant, as well as air washing for large buildings (a form of dehumidification that presaged modern air conditioning). Its ice machinery was used in part as a new source of ice (besides ice cut in winter) for the large ice trade. In the late 1920s, York Machinery Company bought seven of its eight independent sales companies and three companies selling collateral equipment. The new, larger York was called the York Ice Machinery Corporation. In the 1920s and subsequently, the commercial business lines evolved with the gradual advent of widespread <b>home</b> refrigerators, <b>freezers,</b> and air conditioners—the consumerization of the refrigeration industry, which had earlier been only commercial and industrial. Thus York became a builder of major appliances and of refrigeration compressors for sale to other OEMs, and it became an important brand in what had now coalesced into the commercial and residential HVAC industry (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning combined into integrated systems). It provided massive air conditioning plant for skyscrapers {{all the way down to}} AC window units for a single room. In 1956, Borg-Warner purchased the company, making it the York Division of Borg-Warner. In 1986, York was spun off as an independent company, York International.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of conducting multiple household food inventories over the course of 30 days to examine weekly food variability. Household food availability influences the foods individuals choose to consume; therefore, by assessing the home food environment a better understanding of what people are eating can be obtained. Methods of measuring home food availability have been developed and tested in recent years; however most of these methods assess food availability on one occasion only. This study aimed to capture "usual" availability by using multiple assessments. After the development and pre-testing of the 171 -item home observation guide to determine the presence and amount of food items in the <b>home</b> (refrigerator, <b>freezer,</b> pantry, elsewhere), two trained researchers recruited a convenience sample of 9 households (44. 4 % minority), administered a baseline questionnaire (personal info, shopping habits, food resources, and food security), and conducted 5 in-home assessments (5 - 7 day interval) over a 30 -day period. Each in-home assessment included shopping and fast food activities since the last assessment and an observational survey of types and amounts of foods present. The final in-home assessment included an audio recorded interview on food habits and beliefs. Complete data were collected from all 9 women (32. 8 y +/- 6. 0; 3 married; 4 +/- 1. 6 adults/children in household; 4 SNAP; 6 food insecure) and their households.

Recently, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. We thus conducted a pilot case control study to explore the association of CD with the exposure to domestic refrigeration in childhood. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a standard questionnaire we interviewed 199 CD cases and 207 age-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as controls. Cases and controls were followed by the same gastroenterologists of tertiary referral clinics in Tehran, Iran. The questionnaire focused on the date of the first acquisition of <b>home</b> refrigerator and <b>freezer.</b> Data were analysed by a multivariate logistic model. The current age was in average 34 years in CD cases and the percentage of females in the case and control groups were respectively 48. 3 % and 63. 7 %.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the availability of foods in the home are important to nutritional health, and may influence the dietary behavior of children, adolescents, and adults. It is therefore important to understand food choices {{in the context of}} the household setting. Considering their importance, the measurement of household food resources becomes critical. Because most studies use a single point of data collection to determine the types of foods that are present in the home, which can miss the change in availability within a month and when resources are not available, the primary objective of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and value of conducting weekly in-home assessments of household food resources over the course of one month among low-income Mexicano families in Texas colonias. Methods We conducted five in-home household food inventories over a thirty-day period in a small convenience sample; determined the frequency that food items were present in the participating households; and compared a one-time measurement with multiple measurements. After the development and pre-testing of the 252 -item culturally and linguistically- appropriate household food inventory instrument that used direct observation to determine the presence and amount of food and beverage items in the <b>home</b> (refrigerator, <b>freezer,</b> pantry, elsewhere), two trained promotoras recruited a convenience sample of 6 households; administered a baseline questionnaire (personal info, shopping habits, and food security); conducted 5 in-home assessments (7 -day interval) over a 30 -day period; and documented grocery shopping and other food-related activities within the previous week of each in-home assessment. All data were collected in Spanish. Descriptive statistics were calculated for mean and frequency of sample characteristics, food-related activities, food security, and the presence of individual food items. Due to the small sample size of the pilot data, the Friedman Test and Kendall's W were used to assess the consistency of household food supplies across multiple observations. Results Complete data were collected from all 6 Mexicano women (33. 2 y ± 3. 3; 6. 5 ± 1. 5 adults/children in household (HH); 5 HH received weekly income; and all were food insecure. All households purchased groceries within a week of at least four of the five assessments. The weekly presence and amounts of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, dairy, meats, breads, cereals, beverages, and oils and fats varied. Further, the results revealed the inadequacy of a one-time measurement of household food resources, compared with multiple measures.
