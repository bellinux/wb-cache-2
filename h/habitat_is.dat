5|$|The American robin's {{breeding}} <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> woodland {{and more}} open farmland and urban areas. It becomes less common as a breeder in the southernmost {{part of the}} Deep South of the United States, and there prefers large shade trees on lawns. Its winter <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> similar but includes more open areas.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{species of}} melampitta is {{believed}} to be threatened with extinction. The greater melampitta is not generally common across New Guinea, but appears to be relatively common in its preferred habitat type when that <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> studied. The lesser melampitta is less restricted in its habitat requirements and is common over a large area. Because of this, and the fact that their <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> not considered to be threatened and their populations are considered to be stable, both species are listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The broadbills are small, brightly {{coloured}} birds, which feed on {{fruit and}} also take insects in flycatcher fashion, snapping their broad bills. Their <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> canopies of wet forests.|$|E
50|$|Marine <b>habitats</b> can <b>be</b> {{divided into}} coastal and open ocean <b>habitats.</b> Coastal <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> {{found in the}} area that extends from the {{shoreline}} {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine <b>habitats</b> can <b>be</b> divided into pelagic and demersal <b>habitats.</b> Pelagic <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> found near the surface or in the open water column, away from the bottom of the ocean and affected by ocean currents, while demersal <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> near or on the bottom. Marine <b>habitats</b> can <b>be</b> modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp and sea grasses, are ecosystem engineers which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.|$|R
50|$|The SEALAB program {{came to a}} halt, and {{although}} the SEALAB III <b>habitat</b> <b>was</b> retrieved, it was eventually scrapped. Aspects of the research continued in classified military programs , but no new <b>habitats</b> <b>were</b> built.|$|R
50|$|Upland <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> cold, clear, rocky, fast-flowing {{rivers in}} mountainous areas; lowland <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> warm, slow-flowing rivers found in {{relatively}} flat lowland areas, with {{water that is}} frequently coloured by sediment and organic matter.|$|R
5|$|The {{complete}} set of viruses in an organism or <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> called the virome; for example, all human viruses constitute the human virome.|$|E
5|$|The winter <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} that used for breeding, except that high ground and other exposed localities are avoided; however, the island {{subspecies}} T. p. hebridensis will frequent the seashore in winter.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} because of habitat destruction. At the Forêt du Day site, 95% of its preferred juniper <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> dead or dying and {{is unable to}} support this bird. While an overarching reason behind this destruction remains unknown, overgrazing by cattle, camels, and goats {{is believed to have}} been a significant contributor, along with rain, climate change, and a fungal disease. Hunting, the gathering of firewood, egg collecting, and general human disturbance are also believed to be threats. At the Mabla Mountains site, the <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> also being degraded by the collection of firewood and overgrazing.|$|E
50|$|Its natural <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> cloud forests {{where it}} occurs in both aquatic and {{terrestrial}} <b>habitats.</b> It <b>is</b> threatened by <b>habitat</b> loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} rare {{surviving}} {{example of}} rough fen and carr. Other <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> dry grassland and scrub, together with ditches and a chalk stream. There are breeding warblers, and the diverse <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> valuable for amphibians and reptiles.|$|R
50|$|Its <b>habitat</b> <b>are</b> dry mountainous forests.|$|R
5|$|A <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|A <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of}} {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic {{factors such as the}} availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. <b>Habitat</b> <b>is</b> also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E
50|$|Its major <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> coastal Fynbos.|$|R
50|$|By 1980 the <b>Habitat</b> <b>was</b> fully {{restored}} and certified {{to be used}} underwater.§ Funds for actually submerging and operating the <b>habitat</b> again <b>were</b> not available.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{challenges}} for Mars <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> maintaining an artificial environment and shielding from intense solar radiation. Humans require a pressurized environment {{at all times}} and protection from the toxic Martian atmosphere. Connecting <b>habitats</b> <b>is</b> useful, as moving between separate structures requires a pressure suit.|$|R
5|$|Sea otter <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> {{preserved}} {{through several}} protected {{areas in the}} United States, Russia and Canada. In marine protected areas, polluting activities such as dumping of waste and oil drilling are typically prohibited. An estimated 1,200 sea otters live within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and more than 500 live within the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|Some species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> called polycalism. Polycalic {{species of}} {{termites}} form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera Apicotermes and Trinervitermes {{are known to}} have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear to be less frequent in mound-building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of Nasutitermes.|$|E
5|$|Starlings and mynas {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine birds with strong feet. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct and most are very gregarious. Their preferred <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. The plumage of several species is dark with a metallic sheen.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of Pupilla alpicola includes the Alps and Carpathians. Pupilla alpicola has a scattered distribution; it is rare. Most of its <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> close to alpine cattle pastures, and this means these <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> now at risk, because traditional land management is decreasing.|$|R
50|$|Its natural <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> {{intermittent}} freshwater marshes.|$|R
50|$|The plant's <b>habitat</b> <b>was</b> {{serpentine}} mountain slopes.|$|R
5|$|Starlings {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine birds with strong feet. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct and most are very gregarious. Their preferred <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> fairly open country and they eat insects and fruit. The plumage of several species is dark with a metallic sheen. One species has been recorded in New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|During {{the more}} than 10 years the <b>Habitat</b> <b>was</b> on display at Ft Mason, many school {{children}} were taken through the Habitat free of charge by volunteers. Unfortunately lack of funds ended the Project and the <b>Habitat</b> <b>was</b> sold and moved to storage along the Oakland Estuary.|$|R
50|$|Its <b>habitat</b> <b>was</b> the {{mountain}} forests on O‘ahu.|$|R
50|$|Its natural <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> {{rivers and}} {{freshwater}} lakes.|$|R

5|$|Starlings are small- to {{medium-sized}} Old World passerine {{birds with}} strong feet. Their flight {{is strong and}} direct and most are gregarious. Their preferred <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. The plumage of several species is dark with a metallic sheen. One species has been introduced into Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a major}} predator {{of smaller}} woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting attacks are successful. It hunts by surprise attack, using hedges, tree-belts, copses, orchards and other cover near woodland areas; its choice of <b>habitat</b> <b>is</b> dictated by these requirements. It also makes use of gardens in built-up areas, {{taking advantage of the}} prey found there.|$|E
50|$|Its natural <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> {{rivers and}} {{intermittent}} rivers.|$|R
50|$|Its natural <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> rocky {{streams in}} rainforests.|$|R
50|$|Its natural <b>habitats</b> <b>are</b> {{swamps and}} arable land.|$|R
