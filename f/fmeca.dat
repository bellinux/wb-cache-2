5000|$|Slight {{differences}} are {{found between the}} various <b>FMECA</b> standards. By RAC CRTA - <b>FMECA,</b> the <b>FMECA</b> analysis procedure typically consists of the following logical steps: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>FMECA</b> was {{originally}} {{developed in the}} 1940s by the U.S military, which published MIL - P - 1629 in 1949. By the early 1960s, contractors for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were using variations of <b>FMECA</b> {{under a variety of}} names. In 1966 NASA released its <b>FMECA</b> procedure for use on the Apollo program. <b>FMECA</b> was subsequently used on other NASA programs including Viking, Voyager, Magellan, and Galileo.Possibly because MIL - P - 1629 was replaced by MIL - STD - 1629 (SHIPS) in 1974, development of <b>FMECA</b> is sometimes incorrectly attributed to NASA.At {{the same time as the}} space program developments, use of FMEA and <b>FMECA</b> was already spreading to civil aviation. In 1967 the Society for Automotive Engineers released the first civil publication to address <b>FMECA.</b> The civil aviation industry now tends to use a combination of FMEA and Fault Tree Analysis in accordance with SAE ARP4761 instead of <b>FMECA,</b> though some helicopter manufacturers continue to use <b>FMECA</b> for civil rotorcraft.|$|E
50|$|<b>FMECA</b> usually feeds {{into both}} Maintainability Analysis and Logistics Support Analysis, which both require {{data from the}} <b>FMECA.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>FMECA</b> may be {{performed}} at the functional or piece part level. Functional <b>FMECA</b> considers the effects of failure at the functional block level, such as a power supply or an amplifier. Piece part <b>FMECA</b> considers the effects of individual component failures, such as resistors, transistors, microcircuits, or valves. A piece part <b>FMECA</b> requires far more effort, but provides the benefit of better estimates of probabilities of occurrence. However, Functional FMEAs can {{be performed}} much earlier, may help to better structure the complete risk assessment and provide other type of insight in mitigation options. The analyses are complementary.|$|E
50|$|A <b>FMECA</b> report {{consists}} of system description, ground rules and assumptions, conclusions and recommendations, corrective actions to be tracked, and the attached <b>FMECA</b> matrix {{which may be}} in spreadsheet, worksheet, or database form.|$|E
50|$|From {{the above}} list, early identifications of SFPS, input to the {{troubleshooting}} procedure and locating of performance monitoring / fault detection devices {{are probably the}} most important benefits of the <b>FMECA.</b> In addition, the <b>FMECA</b> procedures are straightforward and allow orderly evaluation of the design.|$|E
50|$|The <b>FME(C)A</b> is {{a design}} tool used to {{systematically}} analyze postulated component failures {{and identify the}} resultant effects on system operations. The analysis is sometimes characterized as consisting of two sub-analyses, the first being the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and the second, the criticality analysis (CA). Successful development of a FMEA requires that the analyst include all significant failure modes for each contributing element or part in the system. FMEAs can be performed at the system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly or part level. The <b>FMECA</b> should be a living document during development of a hardware design. It should be scheduled and completed concurrently with the design. If completed in a timely manner, the <b>FMECA</b> can help guide design decisions. The usefulness of the <b>FMECA</b> as a design tool and {{in the decision-making process}} is dependent on the effectiveness and timeliness with which design problems are identified. Timeliness is probably the most important consideration. In the extreme case, the <b>FMECA</b> would be of little value to the design decision process if the analysis is performed after the hardware is built. While the <b>FMECA</b> identifies all part failure modes, its primary benefit is the early identification of all critical and catastrophic subsystem or system failure modes so they can be eliminated or minimized through design modification at the earliest point in the development effort; therefore, the <b>FMECA</b> should be performed at the system level as soon as preliminary design information is available and extended to the lower levels as the detail design progresses.|$|E
5000|$|Major {{benefits}} {{derived from}} a properly implemented <b>FMECA</b> effort are as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{the public}} can not examine the {{conclusions}} of <b>FMECA</b> and challenge dubious conclusions.|$|E
5000|$|... {{there is}} no public <b>FMECA</b> data {{which can be used}} to develop better systems.|$|E
5000|$|Failure mode, {{effects and}} {{criticality}} analysis (<b>FMECA)</b> {{is an extension}} of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).|$|E
5000|$|EN 14143 (2009) (Respiratory {{equipment}} - Self-contained re-breathing diving apparatus The European Union Per Directive 89/686/EEC) {{requires that}} manufacturers perform a Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (<b>FMECA),</b> {{but there is}} no requirement to publish the results, consequently most manufacturers keep their <b>FMECA</b> report confidential.EN 14143 also requires compliance with EN 61508. According to the Deep Life report this is not implemented by most rebreather manufacturers, with the following implications: ...|$|E
50|$|Sometimes FMEA is {{extended}} to <b>FMECA</b> (failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) {{to indicate that}} criticality analysis is performed too.|$|E
50|$|Severity {{classification}} {{is assigned}} for each failure mode of each unique item and entered on the <b>FMECA</b> matrix, based upon system level consequences. A small set of classifications, usually having 3 to 10 severity levels, is used. For example, When prepared using MIL - STD - 1629A, failure or mishap severity classification normally follows MIL - STD - 882.Current <b>FMECA</b> severity categories for U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NASA and European Space Agency space applications {{are derived from}} MIL - STD - 882.|$|E
5000|$|For {{each piece}} part or each {{function}} {{covered by the}} analysis, {{a complete list of}} failure modes is developed. For functional <b>FMECA,</b> typical failure modes include: ...|$|E
50|$|For {{piece part}} <b>FMECA,</b> failure mode data may be {{obtained}} from databases such as RAC FMD - 91 or RAC FMD - 97. These databases provide not only the failure modes, but also the failure mode ratios. For example: Each function or piece part is then listed in matrix form with one row for each failure mode. Because <b>FMECA</b> usually involves very large data sets, a unique identifier must be assigned to each item (function or piece part), and to each failure mode of each item.|$|E
50|$|FMEA is a bottom-up, {{inductive}} {{analytical method}} {{which may be}} performed at either the functional or piece-part level. <b>FMECA</b> extends FMEA by including a criticality analysis, {{which is used to}} chart the probability of failure modes against the severity of their consequences. The result highlights failure modes with relatively high probability and severity of consequences, allowing remedial effort to be directed where it will produce the greatest value. <b>FMECA</b> tends to be preferred over FMEA in space and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military applications, while various forms of FMEA predominate in other industries.|$|E
5000|$|Catastrophic {{failures}} may {{be minimized}} through MTBF, stress and derating, and <b>FMECA</b> analyses {{that help to}} ensure that all components are properly derated, as well as that degradation is occurring “gracefully...” ...|$|E
50|$|Procedures for {{conducting}} <b>FMECA</b> were described in US Armed Forces Military Procedures document MIL-P-1629(1949); revised in 1980 as MIL-STD-1629A. By the early 1960s, contractors for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were using variations of <b>FMECA</b> or FMEA under {{a variety of}} names. NASA programs using FMEA variants included Apollo, Viking, Voyager, Magellan, Galileo, and Skylab. The civil aviation industry was an early adopter of FMEA, with the Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE) publishing ARP926 in 1967. After two revisions, ARP926 has been replaced by ARP4761, which is now broadly used in civil aviation.|$|E
5000|$|For each {{component}} and failure mode, {{the ability of}} the system to detect and report the failure in question is analyzed. One of the following will be entered on each row of the <b>FMECA</b> matrix: ...|$|E
5000|$|Failure modes with {{identical}} {{effects can}} be combined and summarized in a Failure Mode Effects Summary. When combined with criticality analysis, FMEA is known as Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis or <b>FMECA,</b> pronounced [...] "fuh-MEE-kuh".|$|E
5000|$|Failure {{effects are}} {{determined}} and entered for each {{row of the}} <b>FMECA</b> matrix, considering the criteria identified in the ground rules. Effects are separately described for the local, next higher, and end (system) levels. System level effects may include: ...|$|E
50|$|After {{performing}} <b>FMECA,</b> {{recommendations are}} made to design to reduce the consequences of critical failures. This may include selecting components with higher reliability, reducing the stress level at which a critical item operates, or adding redundancy or monitoring to the system.|$|E
5000|$|Reliability {{centered}} {{maintenance is}} an engineering framework {{that enables the}} definition of a complete maintenance regimen. It regards maintenance as the means to maintain the functions a user may require of machinery in a defined operating context. As a discipline it enables machinery stakeholders to monitor, assess, predict and generally understand the working of their physical assets. This is embodied in the initial part of the RCM process which is to identify the operating context of the machinery, and write a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (<b>FMECA).</b> The second part of the analysis is to apply the [...] "RCM logic", which helps determine the appropriate maintenance tasks for the identified failure modes in the <b>FMECA.</b> Once the logic is complete for all elements in the <b>FMECA,</b> the resulting list of maintenance is [...] "packaged", so that the periodicities of the tasks are rationalised to be called up in work packages; {{it is important not to}} destroy the applicability of maintenance in this phase. Lastly, RCM is kept live throughout the [...] "in-service" [...] life of machinery, where the effectiveness of the maintenance is kept under constant review and adjusted in light of the experience gained.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{criticality}} {{assessment is}} completed for each failure mode of each item, the <b>FMECA</b> matrix may be sorted by severity and qualitative probability level or quantitative criticality number. This enables the analysis to identify critical items and critical failure modes for which design mitigation is desired.|$|E
5000|$|Sandler founded Analytical Engineering, Inc in 1995. He was the CEO until 2000, when {{it became}} AEi Systems LLC. In his current {{position}} at AEi, Sandler {{is responsible for the}} design, worst case analysis, reliability analysis, and <b>FMECA</b> analysis of satellite and high-reliability power electronic systems.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, MIL - STD - 1629A {{replaced}} both MIL - STD - 1629 and the 1977 aeronautical <b>FMECA</b> standard MIL - STD - 2070. MIL - STD - 1629A {{was canceled}} without replacement in 1998, but nonetheless remains in wide use for military and space applications today.|$|E
5000|$|The {{criticality}} {{numbers are}} computed as [...] and [...]The basic failure rate [...] is usually {{fed into the}} <b>FMECA</b> from a failure rate prediction based on MIL - HDBK - 217, PRISM, RIAC 217Plus, or a similar model.The failure mode ratio may be taken from a database source such as RAC FMD - 97. For functional level <b>FMECA,</b> engineering judgment {{may be required to}} assign failure mode ratio.The conditional probability number [...] represents the conditionalprobability that the failure effect will result in the identified severity classification,given that the failure mode occurs. It represents the analyst's best judgment as to the likelihood that the loss will occur.For graphical analysis, a criticality matrix may be charted using either [...] or [...] on one axis and severity code on the other.|$|E
50|$|Strengths of <b>FMECA</b> include its comprehensiveness, the {{systematic}} establishment {{of relationships between}} failure causes and effects, {{and its ability to}} point out individual failure modes for corrective action in design. Weaknesses include the extensive labor required, the large number of trivial cases considered, and inability to deal with multiple-failure scenarios or unplanned cross-system effects such as sneak circuits.|$|E
50|$|Failure Modes, effects, and Criticality Analysis is an {{excellent}} hazard analysis and risk assessment tool, but it suffers from other limitations. This alternative does not consider combined failures or typically include software and human interaction considerations. It also usually provides an optimistic estimate of reliability. Therefore, <b>FMECA</b> {{should be used in}} conjunction with other analytical tools when developing reliability estimates.|$|E
50|$|Ford Motor Company {{began using}} FMEA in the 1970s after {{problems}} experienced with its Pinto model, {{and by the}} 1980s FMEA was gaining broad use in the automotive industry. In Europe, the International Electrotechnical Commission published IEC 812 (now IEC 60812) in 1985, addressing both FMEA and <b>FMECA</b> for general use. The British Standards Institute published BS 5760 - 5 in 1991 for the same purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Verification {{that the}} system meets the {{assigned}} SIL, ASIL, PL or agPL by determining the {{mean time between failures}} and the safe failure fraction (SFF), along with appropriate tests. The SFF is the probability of the system failing in a safe state: the dangerous (or critical) state states are identified from a failure mode and effects analysis or (failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) of the system (FMEA or <b>FMECA).</b>|$|E
50|$|Worst-case circuit {{analysis}} (WCCA or WCA) is {{a cost-effective}} means of screening a design to ensure {{with a high}} degree of confidence that potential defects and deficiencies are identified and eliminated prior to and during test, production, and delivery.It is a quantitative assessment of the equipment performance, accounting for manufacturing, environmental and aging effects. In addition to a circuit analysis, a WCCA often includes stress and derating analysis, failure modes and effects criticality (<b>FMECA)</b> and reliability prediction (MTBF).|$|E
5000|$|Due to its {{inherent}} flexibility, RAMP is {{now used}} to optimise system design and support critical {{decision making in}} many sectors [...] RAMP provides the capability to model many factors that may affect a system such as changes in specification or procurement contracts, 'what if' studies, sensitivity analysis, equipment redundancy, equipment criticality, delayed failures, as well as allowing the generation of results that can be exported for failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (<b>FMECA)</b> and cost-benefit analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{analysis}} may {{be performed}} at the functional level until the design has matured sufficiently to identify specific hardware that will perform the functions; then the analysis should be extended to the hardware level. When performing the hardware level <b>FMECA,</b> interfacing hardware {{is considered to be}} operating within specification. In addition, each part failure postulated is considered to be the only failure in the system (i.e., it is a single failure analysis). In addition to the FMEAs done on systems to evaluate the impact lower level failures have on system operation, several other FMEAs are done. Special attention is paid to interfaces between systems and in fact at all functional interfaces. The purpose of these FMEAs is to assure that irreversible physical and/or functional damage is not propagated across the interface as a result of failures in one of the interfacing units. These analyses are done to the piece part level for the circuits that directly interface with the other units. The FMEA can be accomplished without a CA, but a CA requires that the FMEA has previously identified system level critical failures. When both steps are done, the total process is called a <b>FMECA.</b>|$|E
50|$|RAC CRTA - <b>FMECA</b> and MIL - HDBK - 338 both {{identify}} Risk Priority Number (RPN) calculation as {{an alternate}} method to criticality analysis. The RPN {{is a result}} of a multiplication of detectability (D) x severity (S) x occurrence (O). With each on a scale from 1 to 10, the highest RPN is 10x10x10 = 1000. This means that this failure is not detectable by inspection, very severe and the occurrence is almost sure. If the occurrence is very sparse, this would be 1 and the RPN would decrease to 100. So, criticality analysis enables to focus on the highest risks.|$|E
