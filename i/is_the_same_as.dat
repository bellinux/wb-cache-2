50|$|In brief, XLA is {{described}} in two steps: (1) give the 16 binary connectives the right geometry, the right shape value anatomy; and (2) add the transformational physiology, namely, apply the algebra of simple symmetry groups to the 16 iconic letter shape symbols. Change comes with a whisper. This whisper presents a triple isomorphism. <b>The</b> mental operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> logical operations. Said the other way around, <b>the</b> logical operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mental operations. Said again in a different order, <b>the</b> logical operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mental operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations.

5|$|The {{family of}} topological orderings of a DAG <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> {{the family of}} linear {{extensions}} of the reachability relation for the DAG, so any two graphs representing the same partial order have {{the same set of}} topological orders.|$|E

5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

The cast for the radio drama was different from the anime adaptations. A CD compilation of the radio drama titled Shakugan no Shana Drama Disc, including an additional audio drama, was eligible for mail orders up to March 31, 2004.

Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E

5|$|Arsenic and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of valence electrons per atom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> that of Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the total amount of enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 {{is the core of}} any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration {{and are able to}} regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
