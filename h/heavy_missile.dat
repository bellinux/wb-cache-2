2500|$|Their morale restored, the Portuguese {{decided to}} proceed with a new assault on the city. Their scaling ladders were now extended, a new siege tower had been built and the two larger {{ordnance}} cannons shipped in from Ceuta was finally doing serious damage on the gates and walls of the city. [...] On October 5, Henry ordered the second assault. Henry led the assault force himself, leaving {{the rest of the}} troops under Ferdinand the Holy, [...] Ferdinand of Arraiolos and Bishop Álvaro of Evora, to defend their flanks and keep the Moroccan relief army at bay. [...] But the second assault failed as badly as the first. [...] The city's defenders rushed to the critical points, and poured on rapid and <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> fire. [...] The Portuguese assaulters were prevented from even reaching the walls (only one ladder managed to be set up – and was promptly destroyed).|$|E
2500|$|The 28/32cm Nebelwerfer 41 rockets were {{introduced}} in 1941, before Operation Barbarossa. They used the same motor, but carried different warheads. The [...] rocket had a HE warhead, while the [...] rockets were incendiary. The maximum range for either rocket was only , a severe tactical drawback. Both could be fired from their wooden packing cases or a special wooden (schweres Wurfgerät 40 - <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> device) or tubular metal (schweres Wurfgerät 41 (sW.G. 41)) frame. Later, a towed launcher was developed that could take six rockets. Both rockets used the same launchers, but special liner rails had {{to be used for}} the [...] rockets. A vehicular launch frame, the schwere Wurfrahmen 40 (sWu.R. 40), was also designed to improve the mobility of the heavy rockets. These were normally mounted on the sides of Sd.Kfz. 251 half-tracks, but they were also adapted for several different captured French tracked vehicles. The sWuR 40 was nicknamed the Stuka-zu-Fuß ("Stuka on Foot"). Over six hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers, excluding the sW.G. and sWu.R. firing frames, were made during the war. In total, 345 launchers were built from 1941.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Hathorn hesitated. The {{shower of}} books had not {{affected}} him, but the <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> in Ned's hand {{was a serious}} weapon. In another moment he sprang forward and brought his cane down with all his force upon Ned's back.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{of opinion}} that Master Sankey, by aiding this {{rebellion}} against his master, has done wrongly, {{and that he}} erred grievously in discharging a <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> at his master; {{at the same time}} we think that the provocation that he received by the tyranny which has been proved to have been exercised by Mr. Hathorn toward the boys under his charge, and especially by their unjust punishment for an offense which the complainant conceived without sufficient warrant, or indeed without any warrant at all, that they had committed, to a great extent justifies and excuses the conduct of Master Sankey. Therefore, with a reprimand as to his behavior, and a caution as to the consequences which might have arisen from his allowing his temper to go beyond bounds, we discharge him.|$|E

60|$|The {{circumstances}} of his return were as singular as those of his departure. So far as Mr. Lidgett's somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from Plattner's hesitating statements, {{it would appear that}} on Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman, having dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately fond. It is a large old-fashioned garden, secured from observation, fortunately, by a high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant, there was a flash in the air and a heavy thud, and before he could look round, some heavy body struck him violently from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing the strawberries he held in his hand, and that so roughly, that his silk hat--Mr. Lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic costume--was driven violently down upon his forehead, and almost over one eye. This <b>heavy</b> <b>missile,</b> which slid over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely dishevelled condition. He was collarless and hatless, his linen was dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr. Lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and with his hat jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct.|$|E

50|$|The {{utility of}} the light {{anti-tank}} weapon was also recognized by {{both sides of the}} Cold War and led to further development of man-portable weapons used by the infantry squad, while <b>heavier</b> <b>missiles</b> were mounted on dedicated missile tank-destroyers, including dedicated anti-tank helicopters, and even <b>heavier</b> guided anti-tank <b>missiles</b> launched from aircraft. Also being developed were new varieties of artillery munitions in the form of top-attack shells, and shells that were used to saturate areas with anti-armor bomblets. Helicopters could be used as well to rapidly deliver scattered anti-tank mines.|$|R

50|$|On 1 March 1959 the 3rd Heavy Artillery Regiment {{activated}} two missile groups {{armed with}} Honest John missile systems. On 1 October 1959 the regiments names {{was changed to}} 3rd <b>Heavy</b> <b>Missile</b> Artillery Regiment and it became the first unit of the newly raised 3rd Missile Brigade in Vicenza. The regiment added a third missile group on 15 November 1960 and a fourth missile group on 15 November 1962. Each group fielded four Honest John launch systems and they were based in Elvas, Oderzo, Codognè and Portogruaro.|$|E
50|$|The 28 and 32 cm rockets {{could also}} be fired from their packing cases (Packkiste) which had short hinged legs to adjust elevation. They {{could also be}} mounted in groups of four on wooden (schwere Wurfgerät 40 - <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> device) or tubular metal (schwere Wurfgerät 41 (sWG 41)) launch frames. The {{external}} dimensions of the packing cases were identical so no adapter was needed for the smaller rockets. The packing cases could also be mounted on schwere Wurfrahmen 40 (sWuR 40) frames attached {{to the sides of}} Sd.Kfz. 251/1 half-track armored personnel carrier or various captured French tracked vehicles. The sWuR 40 was nicknamed the Stuka-zu-Fuß (Stuka on foot).|$|E

50|$|Currently, the Kirov-class <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> cruisers {{are used}} for command purposes, as Pyotr Velikiy is the {{flagship}} of the Northern Fleet. However, their air defense capabilities are still powerful, {{as shown by the}} array of Point defense missiles they carry, from 44 OSA-MA missiles to 196 9K311 Tor missiles. For longer range targets, the S-300 is used. For closer range targets, AK-630 or Kashtan CIWSs are used. Aside from that, Kirovs have 20 P-700 Granit missiles for anti-ship warfare. For target acquisition beyond the radar horizon, three helicopters can be used. Besides a vast array of armament, Kirov-class cruisers are also outfitted with many sensors and communications equipment, allowing them to lead the fleet.|$|E
50|$|The Durand de Le Penne {{class are}} escort and combat class ships, {{able to operate}} in every combat condition, and {{especially}} devised to survive to <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> and aircraft attacks. Its construction is made almost totally with steel; the structure is a continuous deck with a low, large stern, to accommodate the helicopter force. The fore hull is very pointed, with a very pronounced sea-cutter structure. The superstructure consists of two blocks, relatively low and wide, both with a high, antenna mast with a triangular cross-section for all the electronic. The engines exhausts are in two groups, one for each superstructure: the aft has two exhausts flank to flank, slightly inclined. Then there is the Standard missile system and finally the helicopter facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Galactica has {{at least}} ten <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> launch tubes as seen in episode, and most likely many more (A US Trident {{submarine}} carries 24 missiles), perhaps hundreds. These heavy missiles are likely {{very similar to the}} US Navy's Trident D-5 SLBM. Adama makes it clear they have air-to-ground capability as well as ship-to-ship capability as well as he says prior to the assault on the Colony that they will be too close for missiles. Adama states there are five nuclear warheads aboard as of the outbreak of the war. By the time Galactica reaches the algae planet, her stockpile has increased to at least seven nuclear missiles, presumably more as Adama also states Galactica was resupplied by Pegasus when they first discovered each other [...]|$|E
60|$|The time {{required}} to reload the great cannon was considerable, but at regular intervals they hurled their <b>heavy</b> <b>missiles</b> against the wall, the distance being so short that every ball struck it. After some twenty shots had been fired, Caretto, accompanied by Gervaise, went out by a small gate {{on the eastern side}} of the tower, and made their way round by the foot of the wall to see what effect the shots had produced on the solid masonry.|$|R
50|$|The PRC is {{developing}} another improved {{variant of the}} DF-31 called the DF-31AG or DF-31B with an off-road TEL and MIRVs. China has successfully tested it from a mobile launcher. The missile's TEL features an extra pair of elevators near the aft of the missile unlike the TELs of the DF-31 or DF-31A, suggesting a <b>heavier</b> <b>missile</b> second and third stage than earlier variants. On the military parade marking the 90th Anniversary {{of the founding of}} the PLA, DF-31AG ICBM was officially demonstrated for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Many {{challenging}} {{scientific and}} technical problems were solved during development of the missile systems: leak-tightness of propellant system was achieved, missiles could stand by on alert {{for a long time}} in a fueled state, <b>heavy</b> <b>missiles</b> were launched from containers mortar style, anti-ballistic missile defense penetration aids were developed. Silos were superhardened, missile were hardened against nuclear strike; high degree of combat readiness and high missile firing accuracy were achieved. The performance of the rail-mobile system with the SS-24 missile is unparalleled in the world’s rocket production.|$|R
50|$|The agent {{approaches}} Brun {{during her}} first practice escape, and also picks up the teenager from the merchant vessel at Brun's vigorous urging. The flight up is uneventful until the agent is offered more money by the Our Texans and changes his course {{to one of their}} warships while Hazel and Brun slept. When Brun wakes up and realizes his treachery, she kills him and seizes control of the shuttle. But the shuttle has already approached too close to the planet to escape, and she is forced to dock at an abandoned space station under <b>heavy</b> <b>missile</b> fire. The shuttle is sent on a suicide plunge into the atmosphere as a decoy, but this does not fool the Rangers, who dispatch several shuttles to destroy the station once and for all.|$|E
50|$|The US Navy later {{developed}} the AIM-54 Phoenix long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It {{was a large}} 1000 lb, Mach 5 missile designed to counter cruise missiles and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing Douglas F6D Missileer and then the navalized version of the F-111B, it finally saw service with the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, the only fighter capable of carrying such a <b>heavy</b> <b>missile.</b> Phoenix was the first US fire-and-forget, multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as 100 mi away—the only US fighter with such capability.|$|E

Later weapons include multi-directional cannons, lightning guns, beam lasers, <b>heavy</b> <b>missiles,</b> and homing bombs. The player's craft accommodates a front and a rear gun; where front weapons are mostly limited to forward arcs, [...] "rear" [...] weapons often come with wider coverage including side and rear shots. Some rear weapons have two selectable fire modes, focusing either mostly forward or mostly sideways/rearward. Both types of weapons have eleven levels, making them upgradeable 10 times, although higher levels cost exponentially more.|$|R
