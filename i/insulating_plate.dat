A comparison of the performance in terms of electrical characteristics and thrust among a benchmark configuration (no plate) of a gas-fed MPD thruster and five different thruster configurations (plates with different shape and dimensions) is illustrated. Tests have been carried out with argon as propellant and with and without an externally applied magnetic field. Results indicate the plates have no significant or detrimental effects on the performance at low applied magnetic field. On the contrary, some plate configurations have shown to be effective at high applied magnetic field and current, by decreasing the arc voltage drop without significant effect on the thrust, with respect to the benchmark configuration...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} investigations, {{carried out}} at Alta/Centrospazio in collaboration with Consorzio RFX, on magnetic and electrostatic fluctuations in gas-fed MPD thrusters (both self and applied field), have shown that gross magnetohydrodynamic instabilities develop whenever the current rises beyond a threshold value. These instabilities have m/n = 1 / 1 azimuthal and axial periodicity and are interpreted in terms of helical kink modes. The paper deals with experimental observations relating the kink mode amplitude, measured {{by a set of}} magnetic coils, to the main discharge parameters. In particular, it is shown that a significant decrease in the applied voltage driving the discharge with no significant variation of thrust is observed when these instabilities are suppressed. The suppression has been obtained by means of a passive system (patent pending), consisting in an <b>insulating</b> <b>plate,</b> axially inserted into the discharge chamber of the thruster. The plate divides the discharge chamber in two halves and interrupts the helical currents produced by the kink, effectively stabilizing the kink itself...|$|E

We define the temporal (real) and spectral (complex) variations of POD to tackle acoustical and structural degrees of freedom. We apply the method to process the numerical databases of the finite element solutions. It is shown that the steady-state and transient response may be represented by a small number of dominant POD modes. The extracted frequencies and spatial shapes are evaluated and linked to the modal properties of the system.

40|$|Low-frequency {{dielectric}} {{spectra of}} high-resistivity GaSe layered crystals {{have been studied}} on the samples clamped between two <b>insulating</b> parallel <b>plates</b> at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The measurements {{have been carried out}} at different uniaxial stresses up to 2. 4 × 10 ^ 5 Pa applied along the c-axis normal to crystal layer's plane. It is revealed that the dielectric spectra of high-resistivity GaSe layered crystals with <b>insulating</b> <b>plates</b> obey a universal power law ∼ω^n- 1, where ω is the angular frequency and n≈ 0. 8, earlier observed on high-resistivity GaSe crystals with indium-soldered contacts. The same type of spectra on the crystals with different types of contacts (insulating and ohmic) confirms the bulk character of the observed polarization caused by hopping charge carriers. It is shown that the frequency-dependent dielectric constant increases linearly with the uniaxial stress characterized by the coefficient Δϵ/(ϵΔp) = 8 × 10 ^- 7 Pa^- 1. A slight increase of power 1 -n with the stress is observed, that leads to a stronger dielectric dispersion. The strong stress dependence of the low-frequency dielectric constant in high-resistivity GaSe crystals may be referred to the presence of the formations of elementary dipoles, rotations of which correspond to hops of localized charge carriers.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} laws of {{conservation}} of momentum and angular momentum in classical electrodynamics of material media with bound charges, and explore the possibility to describe the properties of such media via a discrete set of point-like charges of zero size (as imposed by special relativity), and via continuous charge/current distributions. This way we put a question: {{do we have to}} recognize the infinite fields at the location of elementary charges as the essential physical requirement, or such infinite fields can be ignored via introduction of continuous charge distribution? In order to answer this question, we consider the interaction of a homogeneously charged <b>insulating</b> <b>plate</b> with a compact magnetic dipole, moving along the plate. We arrive at the apparent violation of the angular momentum conservation law and show that this law is re-covered, when the electric field at the location of each elementary charge of the plate is taken infinite. This result signifies that the description of electromagnetic properties of material media via the continuous charge and current distributions is not a universal approximation, and at the fundamental level, {{we have to deal with}} a system of elementary discrete charges of zero size, at least in the analysis of laws of conservation of momentum and angular momentum.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{turbulent}} free convection in a horizontal fluid layer above a heated surface. Experiments {{have been carried}} out on a heated surface to obtain and analyze the planform structure and the heat transfer under different conditions. Water is the working fluid and the range of flux Rayleigh numbers (Ra) covered is 3 × 10 ^ 7 - 2 × 10 ^ 10 The different conditions correspond to Rayleigh-Benard convection, convection with either the top water surface open to atmosphere or covered with an <b>insulating</b> <b>plate,</b> and with an imposed external flow on the heated boundary. Without the external flow the planform is one of randomly oriented line plumes. At large Rayleigh number Ra and small aspect ratio (AR), these line plumes seem to align along the diagonal, presumably due to a large scale flow. The side views show inclined dyelines, again indicating a large scale flow. When the external flow is imposed, the line plumes clearly align in the direction of external flow. The nondimensional average plume spacing, Ra_λ^ 1 / 3, varies between 40 and 90. The heat transfer rate, for all the experiments conducted, represented as Ra_δ_T^- 1 / 3, where δ_T is the conduction layer thickness, varies only between 0. 1 – 0. 2, showing that in turbulent convection the heat transfer rates are similar under the different conditions...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the main {{results of an}} experimental activity, carried out on a gas fed, applied field MPD thruster. The thruster has operated in a pulsed, quasi-steady mode (pulse length: 5 ms). Magnetic fluctuations in the plasma jet have been measured by means of two non-intrusive sets of magnetic probes. The first set consists of two flux probes, turned around the thruster cylindrical insulator. The probes allow the fluctuations of the magnetic field on {{the entire length of}} the thruster to be detected and the axial periodicity in axial direction of the instabilities (mode n) to be obtained. The second set consists of an array of five biaxial probes, placed inside the cylindrical insulator of the thruster. By measuring the magnetic field fluctuations, the array allows the azimuthal periodicity (mode m) to be obtained. Tests have been carried out on the thruster with and without the insertion of an <b>insulating</b> <b>plate</b> in the discharge chamber for passive instability suppression. Magnetic field fluctuations and current-voltage electrical characteristics have been measured for both the thruster configurations at 100 mg/s of argon, external applied magnetic fields Bext= 0, 50, 100 mT on the axis, overall thruster power ranging from 60 and 700 kW. Data gathered have shown the onset of instabilities beyond critical current values, having spatial property of a m/n= 1 / 1 kink, with frequencies close to 400 Hz. The insertion of the plate has proved to effectively reduce fluctuations and arc voltage drop at Bext= 100 mT. No significant effects have been observed at lower external magnetic field...|$|E

For a heat <b>insulated</b> <b>plate</b> and a small impulsive velocity (low Mach number), only tangential shear stress and velocity and energy (heat) flow parallel to the plate are generated, while the pressure, density, and temperature of the gas remain unchanged. Moreover, no normal velocity, normal stress, or normal energy flow is developed. Near {{the start of the}} motion the flow behaves like a "free-molecule flow", and all physical quantities are analytic functions of the flow parameters and time.

Although such expansions are obtained here, they are poorly convergent and inappropriate to the problem. To replace these unsatisfactory solutions, approximate closed-form solutions valid for all values of the time are developed, which agree with the free-molecule values for small time and the classical Rayleigh solution for large time.
