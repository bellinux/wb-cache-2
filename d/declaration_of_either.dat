60|$|Now, many {{answers are}} {{being given to}} that {{question}} at the present time. We may take as the extremest opposite to the eternal marriage idea the proposal of Mr. Bernard Shaw, that marriage should be terminable at the instance of either party. You would give due and public notice that your marriage was at an end, {{and it would be}} at an end. This is marriage at its minimum, as the eternal indissoluble marriage is marriage at its maximum, and the only conceivable next step would be to have a marriage makeable by the oral declaration of both parties and terminable by the oral <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>either,</b> which would be, indeed, no marriage at all, but an encounter. You might marry a dozen times in that way in a day.... Somewhere between these extremes lies the marriage law of a civilised state. Let us, rather than working down from the eternal marriage of the religious idealists, work up from Mr. Shaw. The former course is, perhaps, inevitable for the legislator, but the latter is much more convenient for our discussion.|$|E

40|$|Participatory {{learning}} or “Participatory Education ” as a formal <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>either</b> ideology or praxis {{has yet to}} be written and I would certainly not attempt to write one in the current educational capacity I now find myself in; however I have found myself in the unique position of actually being first to something and so have decided to enjoin the relatively scant sketches of, as far as the great blade of written history is concerned, cutting edge economic philosophy with the over-personal, absolutely singular experience of a student-teacher in Cleveland, Ohio. The principles of Participatory Education are adapted from the book Participatory Economics by Michael Albert; however Albert is building the case for equitable economies and therefore far outstrips the scope of this small study. I have borrowed from Participatory Economics only the concepts of: affective decision-making or decision making by those affected; which engenders ownership of decision, liberation theories, regarding power—by the deed and the creed—and the use of power in the group, and freedom of movement, which ties in to both power and choice. ...|$|E

50|$|The BBC {{programme}} Nationwide investigated {{this story}} in the 1970s, and found that while Berwick was {{not mentioned in the}} Treaty of Paris, it was not mentioned in the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war <b>either.</b> The question remained as to whether Berwick had ever been at war with Russia in the first place. The true situation is that since the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 had already made it clear that all references to England included Berwick, the town had no special status at either the start or end of the war. The grain of truth in this legend could be that some important documents from the 17th century did mention Berwick separately, but this became unnecessary after 1746.|$|R
2500|$|The {{result was}} that, unlike in Afghanistan, the Reagan Doctrine was rather quickly applied in Angola and Nicaragua, with the United States {{providing}} military {{support to the}} UNITA movement in Angola and the [...] "contras" [...] in Nicaragua, but without a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> war against <b>either</b> country.

You have come to Jamba, and you have taken our message to Congress and the Administration". U.S. aid to UNITA began to flow overtly after Congress repealed the Clark Amendment, a long-standing legislative prohibition on military aid to UNITA.|$|R
40|$|In-house {{control and}} the {{documentation}} of it, {{is the basis for}} the assurance of compliance with the legislation, both in the food area and in the area of FCM. This report is a check list to guide on <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> compliance, and the target group for the project is industry, trade and private consultants as well as the public food inspection, both in the Nordic countries and in the EU. The Nordic food authorities have elaborated these check lists with the minimum requirements to the documentation needed for compliance with the legal requirements in the in-house documentation in industry and trade. The documentation should be the basis for <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> compliance. A <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> compliance can <b>either</b> be identical with the documentation or an extract. The check lists parameters cover minimum requirements for the development of sufficient in-house documentation, in general, in all links of the value chain. They are drafted in order to give a starting point for industry and trade when developing their in-house documentation and <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> compliance. It can be used in present and future work on improving or constructing in-house control in order to ensure compliance with the requirements in the legislation, especially the EU regulation no. 1935 / 2004, but also the specific measures in the area...|$|R
