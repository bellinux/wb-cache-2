5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System.

5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to fuse helium itself. All elements other than {{hydrogen and helium}} today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E

Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is lower than {{approximately}} half a solar mass, it will never become <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to fuse helium in its core. It is thought that, over a lifespan that considerably exceeds {{the age of the}} Universe (c. 13.8 billion years), such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium-4 nuclei. Due to the very long time this process takes, it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs. Rather, they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion.|$|E

Green explains that a serial arsonist is targeting the British aristocracy, burning his victims alive while leaving {{no trace of}} evidence. The only links between the crimes are the suspect's love letters to the victims' wives. His latest target is Sir Malcolm Marsden, who is visiting Cape Cod for protection after escaping an attack by the killer. Mulder and Scully visit a pyrotechnics expert who says that only rocket fuel can burn <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to destroy evidence of its origins.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting overlying glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to melt a vertical pipe right through the overlying glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E

5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the gravitational influence of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting–Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.|$|E

5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> {{to transfer the}} heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E

5|$|The initial {{collapse}} of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000years. Every nebula begins {{with a certain amount}} of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class0 protostars is high— a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet <b>hot</b> <b>enough</b> to begin nuclear fusion.|$|E
25|$|Like Pytheas, Posidonius {{believed}} {{the tide is}} caused by the moon. Posidonius was, however, wrong about the cause.

25|$|It is {{very hard}} to come up with another process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion.
