50|$|The {{main reason}} of ‘drain brain’ {{phenomenon}} and involvement of knowledge companies into it, {{is a great}} gap between educational infrastructure in the origin countries that IT professionals can get (but it {{is not limited to}} this profession), and low wages that they can be proposed in the origin country. The problem is that educational infrastructure in the transition countries (Central and Eastern Europe) does not actually have to catch-up with the counterparts in <b>knowledge-based</b> <b>economies,</b> like the United States. However salaries of the knowledge workers in both groups of countries differ very much. Knowledge-intensive companies from <b>knowledge-based</b> <b>economies</b> may propose much better incentives to have them move and work for them. This is the reason why human resources from transition countries are drained to those countries, that are characterized by the salary competitive advantage.|$|R

25|$|Initially, {{vocational}} education in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was {{looked down upon}} as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as {{vocational education}} was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and vocational educational was regarded low quality and typically {{out of step with}} the changing needs of employers. The perception of technical and vocational education in Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting to realize that there are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values vocational and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country’s economic development. Vocational education has been an important part of Singapore’s unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of vocational education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils. Vocational schools such as the Institute of Technical Education were intended to revolutionize vocational education and portray the institution as a world-class example of the importance of vocational skills being translated to a 21st-century <b>knowledge-based</b> <b>economy.</b> Since 1995, enrollment in vocational schools has doubled, now making up 65% of the cohort who go on to post-secondary education (ages 16–18), with 25% accepted into the ITE and another 40% attending polytechnic universities.|$|E

In order to do so, we build on new empirical data, gathered between October 2005 and January 2006. It concerns four biotechnology cases of basic research units at two research universities in the Netherlands and two in the United Kingdom.

Specifically we ask, {{what is the role of}} government in helping shape the knowledge society of the future? We argue that knowledge policy regimes must go beyond the modes of policy analysis currently used in innovation, information and technology policy because they are based in an industrial rather than post-industrial analytical framework. We also argue that if we are to develop <b>knowledge-based</b> <b>economies,</b> more encompassing images of the future than currently obtain in policy discourse are required. We therefore seek to stimulate and provoke an array of lines of thought about government and policy for such economies. Our objective is to focus on ideas more than argument and persuasion. ...|$|R

40|$|Research and {{education}} ecosystems, foundational components of <b>knowledge-based</b> <b>economies,</b> are relatively underdeveloped in Latin America. The entire ecosystem {{of a research}} university — including resources, corporate partnerships, and research — must capitalize on a symbiosis between the research, education and commercialization missions. A university cannot transform unilaterally nor can universities sustain the required transformation without government and industry participation. Initiatives to accelerate the development of research university ecosystems are critical for the realization of <b>knowledge-based</b> <b>economies</b> and resilient civil societies. To accelerate the development of research {{and education}} ecosystems across the Americas, the authors propose to establish “Networks of Excellence” in key focus areas. Each Network of Excellence will be multi-institutional, multi-sector (university, corporate, government, NGO) and multi-national. These multi-faceted networks will allow participants to define and share programs, policies, and content, significantly leverage the resources provided for related programs, and identify opportunities to leapfrog existing programs.
