60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. Thoroughly {{sensible}} woman, your mother, Gerald. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come {{round in}} the end.|$|E
60|$|O 't is old Dame Jeannette {{that kept}} the hall, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> die at the autumn fall.|$|E
60|$|Guta. I {{warned you}} of it; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not stay An hour, thus {{treated like a}} slave--an idiot.|$|E
6000|$|Her interlocutress had, in the cage, sounded depths, {{but there}} was a {{suggestion}} here somehow of an abyss quite measureless. [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never let him alone." ...|$|R
60|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh, {{something}} she did. I am {{sure she had}} never done it before; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never have done it again, she was so truly contrite and nice about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{want to go}} to her {{merely because}} she is good-natured enough to receive a person <b>she</b> dislikes. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is very good. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{sacrifice}} herself for anything she thought right. But, mamma, she is such a bore!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sent her}} to Mrs. Larpent's. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> receive her and keep her till she could write to her friends. Bellairs took her, but I could hardly speak to her--" ...|$|E
60|$|So {{after he}} had been a little while with Ada, I went in and found my darling (as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be) {{prepared}} to consider him thoroughly right in whatever he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told her}} what I had seen, and while I spoke {{she put on her}} bonnet, and I exulted, thinking--and then she took off her bonnet, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not go away with me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{believe you}} are right, you kind Robin,' said Honor. 'The journey might be a great danger for Lucy, and if <b>I</b> went, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not stay behind. But I still think she will insist on seeing him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What word can I {{carry to}} her from you? I'm {{going to go and}} see her. If I could take a word from you, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come back to the table. Shall I tell her you feel to blame?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Mrs. Kennedy, dear Mrs. Jean," [...] entreated Cicely, [...] "hinder me not. If I {{wait till}} I can ask her, I may lose my sole hope of {{speaking}} with him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be displeased, and it imports, indeed it imports." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{blame him}} not," [...] she cried, passionately. [...] "It is the wicked, wicked Gladys who has stolen his love. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> coax him from {{me when she}} sent so often her {{beautiful}} face to his mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{take it in}} that way," [...] said Mrs. Curtis. [...] "And so you {{understand}} us, my dear, we {{could not bear to}} ask you to do anything so distressing except for your own sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} {{you to know}} it; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tell you. But I don't excuse that, either. It {{was acting}} a lie to come back. All I {{can say is that}} I had to see her again for one last time." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl hesitated. [...] "I don't think I {{ought to}} tell you all she said and did. It was really a private {{interview}} between us two, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not {{want me to say}} much about it. And I don't think you would want to hear everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do good to me;--but I suppose I'm nobody. I wish I {{could tell}} {{what to do}} about this house. Dear, good old woman! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have wished that I should keep it in my own hands, with some idea of living here at some future time;--but of course I never shall live here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But when I am {{comparatively}} free I cannot live alone. I shall want Helena; I shall {{remember the}} children. If I have the one, I shall be damned {{by the thought}} of the other. This bruise on my mind will never get better. Helena says <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never come to me; but <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> out of pity for me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'A pert crooked little chit, Mr Headstone! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{put herself}} in the way, if she could, and would be sure to strike in with {{something}} impertinent. It was on that account that I proposed our going to the City to-night and meeting my sister.' ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not feel}} {{justified}} in giving a wife of Mrs. Micawber's experience any other recommendation, than that she should try to reclaim Mr. Micawber by patience and kindness (as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> in any case); but the letter set me thinking about him very much.|$|E
60|$|OLIVER. I knew it wasn't ended. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{come back}} and tell us she'd come. But she's done her bit--now she'll go again. My God, what a fool of a world!--You go on, Gerald--I'll just go after her and see it out. (Calls.) One moment, Anabel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{would be}} proud indeed to see me now, eh Hugh?' said Barnaby. 'Wouldn't it make her glad to see me {{at the head of}} this large show? She'd cry for joy, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> Where CAN <b>she</b> be? She never sees me at my best, and what do I care to be gay and fine if SHE'S not by?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Benson--yes it's {{really very}} stupid of me. But I can never {{remember}} names. I {{must make a}} note on my cuff." [...] She clicked a little silver pencil and wrote the name down. [...] "If I could write to my friend. I believe <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{be able to help}} me to an independent life. I could write to her--or telegraph. Write, I think. I could scarcely explain in a telegram. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> help me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Majesty pardon me. She {{called me}} to her closet {{yesterday}} and pledged me to secrecy before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A good shot, Hewett, a good shot!" [...] said old Johnston {{to a young}} bowman, {{who stood}} with his bow in his left hand, gazing with parted lips after his flying shaft. [...] "You see, she finds the ring, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> from the moment that your string twanged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did care,--many straws. But I {{think she}} always loved Oswald. She refused {{him again and}} again, because she thought it wrong to run a great risk, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never marry any one else. How little Lady Baldock {{understood}} her. Fancy your meeting Lady Baldock at Oswald's house!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was simply}} crude," [...] she said earnestly. [...] "I was feeling {{reckless}} and I wrote recklessly. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> disapprove and I wrote foolishly. It was {{the echo of}} her own stupid talk. I said that I did not love her brother but that I had no scruples whatever in marrying him." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{heard her}} {{close the door}} of her mother's room, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> first pray before the shrine of the little Virgin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't do that, my dear Mrs. Baker. I am too far {{committed}} to Fan to do that. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make a terrible scene. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> follow me. And besides, I am fond of her, you <b>know.</b> <b>She's</b> very beautiful, now--and she does love me, poor beggar! I wonder at it, but she does." [...] Then he brightened up. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>she</b> has the carriage of a duchess. Really, {{if she were}} trained a little <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be quite presentable anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A gentleman often {{encourages}} {{that sort}} of child, but condemns her the more. She will be a by-word in that family! <b>I</b> always <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be our disgrace!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I asked her, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not come. She {{is in one}} of her hatreds now. She {{said she}} would have come, only she had half-promised to give a ball to the tenants at Merrington about that time, and she did not like to {{disappoint}} them. Quite touching, was it not?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ah me! I thought {{those were}} high and great emotions. But I never {{thought there was}} {{anything}} low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me! soon dried.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has grown}} much prettier than I ever {{thought she would}} do," [...] Dick said. [...] "Of course, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have grown into a woman, but somehow I never {{realised}} it, until I saw her, and I believe I have always thought of her as being still the girl I carried off from Seringapatam." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{beforehand}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> say so; I {{was quite}} prepared for it; I only answered, {{it was not}} for me to contradict my Mistress; I must go.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what <b>I</b> doan't <b>know,</b> lad, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be. <b>I</b> {{suppose it}} comes {{of her being}} a lass, but it beats me altogether. Why shouldn't she take it? other lasses take {{presents}} from their lads, why shouldn't Nell take one from her friend? But she wouldn't, I'd bet my life she wouldn't, and she wouldn't say, 'No, and thank you,' but she'd treat it as if I'd insulted her. No, it can't be done, lad; but it's a pity, for I should ha' liked to see her look nice for once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He says this," [...] began Betty, {{not liking}} to obey, but afraid poor Polly would be hurt {{if she did}} not: [...] "'Now here's a new pet for her Highness to torment. Nice, pretty little girl! Pity she came, to be made much of {{for a day or}} two and then thrown away or knocked about like an old doll. She thinks it all very fine here, poor thing! But if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> run away and never come back; for a crosser, more spoilt child than her Highness never lived.'" ...|$|R
