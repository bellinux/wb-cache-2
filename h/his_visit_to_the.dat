5|$|Coleridge {{began work}} on The Eolian Harp in August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker.

5|$|In 1603 James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England, uniting the two thrones, and Etal Castle lost its military value and soon passed into private ownership.

5|$|On 18 September 2010, Hyde Park was {{the setting}} for a prayer vigil with Pope Benedict XVI as part of <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, {{attended}} by around 80,000 people. A large crowd assembled along the Mall to see the Pope arrive for his address. An attempt to assassinate the Pope had been foiled after five street cleaners were spotted {{within a mile of}} Hyde Park, and arrested along with sixth suspect.|$|E
5|$|Saint Francis of Assisi is {{credited}} with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ. He himself had recently been inspired by <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land, where he'd been shown Jesus's traditional birthplace. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.|$|E

5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing {{that it would be a}} test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during the trip. He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met. Hogg also recounted <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece during <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands {{and seems}} to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which}} the figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of the {{political}} danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943, when they discovered the Polish victims of the 1940 Soviet Katyn massacre near occupied Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial, clearly attesting to the Soviet mass murder. Subsequently, the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at Treblinka and burn them came directly from the Nazi leadership, possibly from Himmler, who was very concerned about covering up Nazi crimes. The cremations began shortly after <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp in late February or early March 1943.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{coverage}} is erratic, {{a direct result}} of the sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley's 1786 Observations on Livestock and the antique John Caius's 1576 On English Dogs. Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. They liked the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew.|$|E
5|$|Yegor Gaidar : The sudden {{illness of}} Yegor Gaidar in Ireland on 24 November 2006, {{the day of}} Litvinenko's death, {{has been linked to}} <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{restaurant}} where polonium was present and is being investigated as part of the overall investigation in the UK and Ireland., Other observers noted he was probably poisoned after drinking a strange-tasting cup of tea. Gaidar was taken to hospital; doctors said his condition was not life-threatening and that he would recover. This incident was similar to the poisoning of Anna Politkovskaya on a flight to Beslan. Afterwards, Gaidar claimed that it was enemies of the Kremlin who had tried to poison him.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E

5|$|In February 1959 Agagianian visited Taiwan {{to oversee}} missionary {{work in the}} island. He later {{entrusted}} Paul Yü Pin, Archbishop of Nanking, to reestablish the Fu Jen Catholic University. He arrived in Japan for a two week long visit in May 1959, which included a meeting with Emperor Hirohito. On December 10, 1959 he presided over the First Far East Conference of Bishops at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines with attendance of 100 prelates, 10 papal representatives, 16 archbishops, 79 bishops from almost {{every country in the}} Far East. <b>His</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Ireland in June 1961 was the highlight of the Patrician Year. Agagianian received a great popular welcome there. Conservative President of Ireland Éamon de Valera was famously pictured kissing Agagianian's ring. In September 1963 he visited South Vietnam and met with Madame Nhu, the Catholic first lady. On October 18, 1964 when the Uganda Martyrs where canonized by Pope Paul VI, Agagianian presided over the Holy Mass at Namugongo. In November 1964 he traveled to Bombay, India to open the 38th Eucharistic Congress.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{inspired}} by <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish court in 1623, Charles became a passionate and knowledgeable art collector, amassing {{one of the}} finest art collections ever assembled. In Spain, he sat for a sketch by Velázquez, and acquired works by Titian and Correggio, among others. In England, his commissions included the ceiling of the Banqueting House, Whitehall, by Rubens and paintings by other artists from the Low Countries such as van Honthorst, Mytens, and van Dyck. His close associates, including the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Arundel, shared his interest and have been dubbed the Whitehall Group. In 1627 and 1628, Charles purchased the entire collection of the Duke of Mantua, which included work by Titian, Correggio, Raphael, Caravaggio, del Sarto and Mantegna. His collection grew further to encompass Bernini, Bruegel, da Vinci, Holbein, Hollar, Tintoretto and Veronese, and self-portraits by both Dürer and Rembrandt. By Charles's death, there were an estimated 1760 paintings, most of which were sold and dispersed by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Sultanate of Mogadishu later {{developed}} with the immigration of Emozeidi Arabs, a community whose earliest presence {{dates back to}} the 9th or 10th century. According to the 16th century explorer Leo Africanus, the Mogadishu Sultanate (Magadazo) was the principal city-state within the larger Adea Kingdom, located south of the Adal Sultanate and east of the Abyssinian Empire. It was ruled by an Islamic aristocracy, which paid tribute to the Christian king of Abyssinia. The native inhabitants of the polity were of the same origins as the denizens of the northern Adal Sultanate. This Mogadishu Sultanate evolved into the Muzaffar dynasty, a joint Somali-Arab federation of rulers, and Mogadishu became closely linked with the powerful Ajuran Sultanate. Following <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, the 12th century Syrian historian Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote that it was inhabited by swarthy Berbers, ancestors of Somalis in the area.|$|E

5|$|Tsakalotos {{went on to}} read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at The Queen's College, Oxford. Whilst at the Queen's College, Tsakalotos was {{an admirer}} of both Gerald Cohen and Andrew Glyn, a Marxist {{political}} philosopher and Marxian economist respectively, who both taught at the university. He also took part in student protests against Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government. During his time at university, he became a supporter of Irish republicanism, a view he expressed in <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sinn Féin ardfheis in March 2015. One of his university friends at this time, Yannis Stournaras, later became a Greek finance minister and served as Governor of the Bank of Greece. Following graduation, he completed a master's degree (MPhil) at the Institute of Development Studies, attached to the University of Sussex. He then returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate (DPhil) in economics, studying at Mansfield College. He completed this doctorate in 1989 {{under the supervision of}} Włodzimierz Brus, with his thesis, , later being published as a book.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} or four years after <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> papacy, {{agreements}} were made with the various institutions who were drawing income from Clement's diocese – namely Coupar Angus Abbey, Lindores Abbey, Cambuskenneth Abbey, Arbroath Abbey, the nunnery of North Berwick and the Hospital of Brackley, Northamptonshire. These agreements did not constitute complete success. Clement was able to recover some revenue, but in fixed payments liable to real decline by way of inflation. Moreover, he had to concede permanent canonries to several of the abbots, concessions which would give them a role in the election of his successors. Another partial set-back took place. Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, had decided to found a monastery in his earldom and take up the income of Menteith's churches to do it; the whole of Menteith constituted nearly half of the diocese. Despite the Pope's previously helpful behaviour towards Clement's cause, he granted the earl permission to found the new monastery. The earl established Inchmahome Priory in the Lake of Menteith in 1238. Walter and Clement came to conflict over the new priory's rights, but in the same year an agreement was drawn up in a meeting of churchmen at Perth. The agreement placed most of Menteith's churches {{under the control of the}} earl; however, Clement obtained several concessions, including the right to receive episcopal dues from the new priory. Overall, Clement's successes were considerable considering the opposition which he faced, but even after his death, only 12 of the 26 parish churches in the diocese were under the bishop's direct control.|$|E
5|$|The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps {{began with}} the death of PhilipII, but it was his son Alexander the Great who {{unambiguously}} claimed to be a living god. Following <b>his</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> oracle of Didyma in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon — the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Amun-Ra — at the Siwa Oasis of the Libyan Desert in 332BC to confirm his divine status. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian priesthoods and deities, strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world, while beliefs in the Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.|$|E
