Striped cloths {{appear as}} painting supports from the 16 th to the 20 th century {{in and outside}} Europe. These are mostly flax matress ticking, woven into varieties of twill (<b>diagonal</b> <b>weave)</b> and especially reverse twill (herringbone). Only few historical mattresses have been preserved, e. g. those in royal palace interiors {{such as the one}} in Hampton Court in London. Dark blue striped pattern appeared on mattresses as early as the Antiquity, and the terminology for the twill fabrics used (also) for mattress making originated in this period in the regions ruled by the Roman Empire. Reasons for the use of various types of fabrics, including the mattress ticking as painting supports, are not investigated enough, but it does appear that their availability and economic reasons were often the only selection criteria. Although it is impossible to make general conclusions, some documents and examples indicate that the twill fabrics were used for exceptionally large paintings. In the context of painting, mattress ticking is mentioned in Flemish, English and French documents and painter’s manuals published from the 17 th to the 19 th century. In Ita ly, Istria, Dalmatia and Spain, the historical terms for the twill fabrics used for making mattresses and work clothes (traliccio, terlise, trliš, terliz etc.) is of Latin origin (trilix) and initially did not denote the fabric’s designation but {{had to do with the}} type of weave. Variants of these terms are mentioned in the trading documents and archives of textile manufacturers in north Italy, and in connection with the painting commissions in 16 th- and 17 th-century Italy and Spain. The studies of painting supports in Flemish and Dutch art of the 17 th and 18 th century provide the most details about paintings on mattress ticking, with detailed accounts of canvases by Maarten de Vos, Pieter Pieters, Nicolas de Liemaker and Pieter Johannes van Reysschoot. The weave is described as a warp-faced reverse twill (chevron) 3 / 1. The earliest example of a painting on a mattress ticking from blue-striped reverse twill that is known to the author is The Battle of the Spurs by an unknown artist, made in England around 1540 (Hampton Court Palace, London). Also in England, Anthony van Dyck painted several extraordinarily large pieces, and there are known works by other artists on this type of canvas from the 17 th, 18 th and 19 th century. In France, artists had from the 17 th to the 20 th century sometimes painted on a similar support, among them Philippe de Champaigne and François Boucher. The author is aware of only two examples of paintings on canvas with blue stripes in Italy. The paper also touches upon the issue of research of painting canvases. The technology of making a painting, the natural processes of deterioration and historical alterations and treatments make analyses of the structure, colour and finishing difficult, and by that also make it hard to determine the original characteristics and designation of the fabric the painter had used. With still few specialist studies which would have differing approaches to canvas research, the analytical parameters are sometimes hard to compare or apply. Although their number is in continual decline, in Dalmatia there are still paintings that haven 2 ̆ 7 t been restored i. e. lined. Given that indirect methods of analysis of the original canvases for lined paintings still have limitations, amid their many possibilities, each unlined painting represents a precious possibility to study the history of painting supports but also of historical textiles. The differentiation between the warp and the weft is a precondition for a comparison of the parameters of painting canvases; however, selvedges of the fabric are relatively rarely preserved. According to a study by van der Wetering, the differences in the quality of threads that can be seen with some types of handwoven canvases are for the time being the most reliable criterion for differentiating between the warp and weft. The second criterion, that is applicable to canvases without the visible difference in the quality of threads, is the difference in the number of threads. The comparative analysis of several 17 th- and 18 th-century canvases from Dalmatia included these parameters: dimensions of the canvas support, width of the fabric, direction of the warp, description of the characteristics of threads in both directions, number of threads of the warp and weft by centimetre, type and unit of the weave, description of the striped pattern. Parameters for painting canvases are difficult to compare according to the place and time of their origin. They vary considerably within the same period and region, even within a single artist’s body of work. Depending on their original designation, they differ in the quality of the material and making, as well as in the type of weave and treatment. Among Dalmatian examples of 17 th- and 18 th-century paintings on the canvas for mattresses, the one from Šibenik is the oldest. Compared to examples from abroad, it is also among the earliest ones. Out of forty paintings on striped canvas from the 16 th – 18 th century in England, Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, the most were authored by 17 th-century Flemish artists (twenty eight). Judging by the information and examples collected in the research, striped cloths for mattresses with twill pattern from abroad that were described in the paper are much finer than those from Dalmatia (have more threads per cm) and the fabrics are much wider, but they are mostly large-size paintings. With a little over a half of the cases, the warp was set in the length direction of the painting. From the photographs of the canvases of several foreign examples it is evident that the paintings were done on the face of the fabric where the herringbone pattern is more pronounced, as well as the blue stripes. Although this could lead to a conclusion that the choice of the fabric face was a conscious one, owing to its texture, the reasons need to be examined more closely. All Dalmatian paintings featured here were also painted on the fabric face – except the one from Brač that was composed of several assorted pieces of cloth – and with the warp facing opposite directions and the fabric face on opposing sides. Also, there can be observed a rather different relation toward the texture of the canvas – some artists leave it visible, others cover it in a thick painted layer. For now it appears that this research too leads to the conclusions of earlier studies of painting canvases – the reason for choosing striped mattress ticking as painting support may well have been its availability in a certain size, at a particular moment in history...|$|E

Yet no such type of <b>diagonal</b> <b>weaving</b> is known elsewhere in the world, let alone in France. It seems that Native Americans were quick to improve their techniques upon the discovery of brightly coloured yarns {{that they did not have}} access to previous to contact, and often took apart fabrics to reuse the yarn for sashes, and a photo of an example is shown in Burnham's book.

40|$|Honeycomb {{woven fabric}} {{is a single}} layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial plain weave. In a fabric weave repeat, the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed <b>diagonal</b> <b>woven</b> lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for honeycomb weaves experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and elastic yarns were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties. The measurements by the Kawabata Evaluation System and Instron machine show that the honeycomb woven fabric has enhanced air permeability and water absorption, as well as lower thermal conductivity {{compared to that of}} the plain woven fabric. Higher bending rigidity, compressional energy and Young’s modulus are also observed for honeycomb fabrics. The mechanical properties are found to be affected significantly by applying the elastic yarns to the honeycomb woven fabrics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include broadcloth, with double the number of warp to weft threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; twill, where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a <b>diagonal</b> pattern, a <b>weave</b> used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including voile and batiste, which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|R

The sound reduction may occur {{depending on the type of}} material absorption. Several previous studies have examined the multiple alternative materials soundproof walls that have characteristics similar to the dried banana stems, as examples of which are: coconut husks, rice husks and waste wood saws. Porous sound absorbing element has a characteristic absorption more efficient. Wall thickness and spacing layer also specifies the optimization level of damping of the sound. 	This study examined the waste banana stalk as soundproof partition walls. Banana type used in this research is the plantain milk is considered cheaper and more widely available around the home environment. The method used to determine the value of sound reduction and absorption coefficient is making some kind of woven from banana stems and dried. Twisted banana stems, dried and made of webbing. Matting is then given a finishing plywood sheeting, to be used as a partition wall. This research material absorbency test performed in the laboratory of acoustic and performed tensile test to determine the tensile strength of the material. Data analysis using Realtime Software Analyzer (RTA). 	Material acoustic panel has the ability to absorb sound well at a frequency of 1000 Hz.
