40|$|An often-overlooked {{aspect of}} neural {{plasticity}} is the plasticity of neuronal composition, {{in which the}} numbers of neurons of particular classes are altered in response to environment and experience. The Drosophila brain features several well-characterized lineages in which a single neuroblast gives rise to multiple neuronal classes in a stereotyped sequence during development. We find that in the intrinsic mushroom body neuron lineage, the numbers for each class are highly plastic, depending on the timing of temporal fate transitions {{and the rate of}} neuroblast proliferation. For example, mushroom body neuroblast cycling can continue under starvation conditions, uncoupled from temporal fate transitions that depend on extrinsic cues reflecting organismal growth and development. In contrast, the proliferation rates of antennal lobe lineages are closely associated with organismal development, and their temporal fate changes appear to be cell cycle-dependent, such that the same numbers and types of uniglomerular projection neurons innervate the antennal lobe following various perturbations.

Detailed comparison of the nigericin biosynthetic genes with their counterparts in the biosynthetic clusters for other polyketides has prompted a significant revision of theÂ proposed common pathway for polyether biosynthesis. In particular, we present evidence that in nigericin, nanchangmycin, and monensin, an unusual ketosynthase-like protein, KSX, transfers the initially formed linear polyketide chain to a <b>discrete</b> acyl <b>carrier</b> protein, ACPX, for oxidative cyclization.

40|$|Investigations {{were made}} into how squared {{envelope}} analysis and Self Adaptive Noise Cancellation (SANC) {{can be used}} to improve the reliability of bearing diagnostics in gearboxes. Present models of bearing fault signals were improved by incorporating slight random fluctuations into the spacings between bearing fault impulses. This allowed simulated signals to be used for the investigation of squared envelope analysis and the optimisation of SANC. The values for the three variables which affect the adaptation process of S Lá¹C are optimised for removing discrete frequency noise from bearing fault components; this was done by using simulated bearing fault and gear signals. The recommended values were then applied to enhance the bearing fault signals recorded from an actual helicopter gearbox. Analysis of the squared envelope can give an improvement in bearing diagnostics if the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than unity. The MSR (Mean Squared Ratio) of signal to noise in the demodulation band and the percentage fluctuation of the bearing fault impulses were found to influence this factor and their values determined for a SNR of unity. Phase demodulation around a bearing frequency component in the envelope spectrum {{can be used to}} obtain a value for the percentage fluctuation in spacing of bearing fault impulses. Signals measured from a helical gear rig, spur gear rig, planetary gear rig arid helicopter gearboxes were used to test the performance of SANC. From the analyses, the combinations of modulations and carrier components can be categorised into four types. Bearing fault components from additive impulse responses (the classic model) appear in the spectrum as random frequency components and remain after SANC. Bearing fault components which modulate <b>discrete</b> frequency <b>carriers</b> appear in the spectrum as discrete frequency components, and thus are removed by SANC.

For example, in December 1997, in response to the first recommendation of Bringing Them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, the Commonwealth Government announced that the National Library would be funded to develop and manage a new oral history project. At that time the National Library's well developed sound preservation strategy was at an interim stage between digital and analogue. It involved the production of analogue reel, CD and cassette duplicates of the original DAT tape using high end digital audio workstations (DAW) designed for post production of audio materials. By the time the project had reached its completion date in 2002, reel tapes had become more difficult to purchase, CD-R stock was much cheaper and of generally lower quality, DAWs specifically for audio preservation were available, and the Library had refocused its digital preservation strategy so that it relied on the Digital Object Storage System (DOSS), an in-house digital mass storage system (DMSS). The development of DMSSs brings closer the vision of a persistent and replicable archive to which sound archivists have aspired, however it also raises many issues that were not envisaged under the earlier strategies. These include the incorporation and transfer of existing digital and analogue to the storage system, the management of adequate descriptive and preservation metadata, the management of that data, the choice of carrier from which to transfer, (preservation CD or original carrier?) and many other new dilemmas with which to wrestle. These issues, coupled with the disappearance of adequate replay equipment from the market, render critical the timing and planning of what will clearly be the last transfer from a <b>discrete</b> <b>carrier</b> to an integrated system.

40|$|A {{very precise}} and fast {{wireless}} indoor positioning system becomes necessary for multiple {{applications such as}} industrial automation, robot navigation and inventory tracking. The precision of an RF based positioning system can be improved by increasing the bandwidth and the carrier frequency of the signal, as proven by the theoretical studies on estimation precision. However, on the practical side, not only the theoretical concerns but also the hardware design constraints and signal propagation related limitations {{should be taken into}} account, which exactly suffer from high bandwidth and carrier frequency. This work enhances the precision of an RF based indoor positioning system, while keeping both theoretical performance and practical limitations into account. To this end, a range estimation scheme, consisting of both an efficient hardware implementation of a novel phase-based range estimation algorithm and a hardware friendly ranging signal, is proposed. The phase-based range estimation algorithm is designed to exploit the advantages of a wideband signal, while keeping the complexity of the necessary receiver components low. Towards an efficiently implementable estimator, the range estimation algorithm is broken into 3 computational steps. The step-wise approach provides benefits for FPGA implementation as well as flexibility on choosing between transmitted signal energy, computational cost and precision of the ranging algorithm. The proposed ranging algorithm also enables sub-Nyquist sampling which helps to reduce the power consumption of the preceding ADC. The <b>discrete</b> <b>carrier</b> ranging signal, the second component of the ranging scheme, is designed to relax the design constraints of the transmitter and comply with the sub-Nyquist sampling. By carefully designing the ranging signal, also the baseband signal generation is simplified allowing efficiently generating a wideband signal. Moreover, the power amplifier efficiency is increased by reducing the peak-to-average power ratio of the signal. Designed to cope with the hardware and environmental imperfections, the ranging scheme is tested together with a custom designed transmitter and receiver. The tests report a mm-level precision performance of the ranging scheme under real-world conditions. Moreover, they prove the validity and benefits of the sub-Nyquist sampling and baseband signal generation concepts. The ranging scheme, the transmitter and the receiver are finally integrated to obtain a complete indoor positioning system. Besides this custom made positioning system, an alternative ranging framework compatible with the communication standard IEEE 802. 11 ad is proposed. The phase-based range estimation algorithm is therefore adapted to process the communication packet, and further enhanced against multipath fading by utilizing the channel estimation field provided by the package. This thesis proposes two ranging systems, highly focusing on the first one, which is optimized for very high precision and used together with custom designed analog and RF components towards a complete positioning system. Developing the core of the first ranging system, a standard-compliant ranging system is also obtained.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 47) This graduate project {{emphasizes the}} design and performance issues of spectrum-slicing, for implementing wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in optical fiber systems. Wavelength Division Multiplexing is the teclmique that allows several different signals to be carried along a single fiber at the same time. It achieves this by using different wavelengths for each transmission and can be employed on single mode or multimode fibers. Conventional WDM systems employ laser diodes operating at <b>discrete</b> wavelengths as <b>carriers</b> for the different data channels {{that are to be}} multiplexed. Spectrum-slicing provides an attractive low-cost alternative to the use of multiple coherent lasers for such WDM applications by utilizing spectral slices of a broadband noise source for the different data channels. In this project five performance parameters are used to evaluate the spectrum-sliced WDM system. The results are taken from the studies on the effect of set design parameters, the distance, bit rate, input power, output power and channel spacing. The results demonstrate the performance of spectral slicing in WDM system. OptiSystem software has been used to accomplish this work. Steps needed to improve the performance of spectrum-sliced WDM system are also discussed.

40|$|Summary. Let X be a {{topological space}} and let D be {{a subset of}} X. D {{is said to be}} {{discrete}} provided for every subset A of X such that A â D there is an open subset G of X such that A = D â© G (comp. e. g., [9]). A discrete subset M of X is said to be maximal discrete provided for every discrete subset D of X if M â D then M = D. A subspace of X is discrete (maximal <b>discrete)</b> iff its <b>carrier</b> is <b>discrete</b> (maximal discrete) in X. Our purpose is to list a number of properties of discrete and maximal discrete sets in Mizar formalism. In particular, we show here that if D is dense and discrete then D is maximal discrete; moreover, if D is open and maximal discrete then D is dense. We discuss also the problem of the existence of maximal discrete subsets in a topological space. To present the main results we first recall a definition of a class of topological spaces considered herein. A topological space X is called almost discrete if every open subset of X is closed; equivalently, if every closed subset of X is open. Such spaces were investigated in Mizar formalism in [6] and [7]. We show here that every almost discrete space contains a maximal discrete subspace and every such subspace is a retract of the enveloping space. Moreover, if X 0 is a maximal discrete subspace of an almost discrete space X and r: X â X 0 is a continuous retraction, then r â 1 (x) = {x} for every point x of X belonging to X 0. This fact is a specialization, in the case of almost discrete spaces, of the theorem of M. H. Stone that every topological space can be made into a T 0 -space by suitable identification of points (see [11]) ...|$|R
40|$|Airline {{passenger}} segmentation {{is traditionally}} classified into {{the categories of}} Business, Leisure and VFR (visiting friends and relatives). Most academic studies to date have only focused on the differences between business and leisure passengers without further exploring potential segments among business passengers. Hence, this research aims to enhance {{our understanding of the}} flight choice behaviour of business passengers, and in particular, exploring the potential differences between those who work in small and medium enterprises (SMEs, with 200 or less staff) and those in non-SMEs (more than 200 staff). Descriptive analysis from revealed preference (RP) data and discrete choice models from stated preference (SP) choice surveys are used to ascertain attributes that are significant to choice behaviour. Descriptive analyses show that more business passengers work in the SME category. However, SME passengers tend to fly less, are more price-sensitive, and derive less satisfaction in flying with full-service carriers if they have previously flown with low-cost <b>carriers.</b> <b>Discrete</b> choice model results show that fewer flight service attributes are significant on flights between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane due to shorter flight duration. However, more attributes related to ticket flexibility are found significant for one-day trips. On flights between Perth and the east coast, willingness to pay calculates a range of $ 25 to $ 62 for one piece of checked baggage, and $ 30 to $ 46 for an extra legroom seat. Attributes related to flight comfort have a larger significance on inbound flights (i. e., return flights from Perth to the east coast). Self-funded passengers are more price-sensitive when purchasing flights. Furthermore, we observed in choice experiment that attribute non-attendance (ANA) is above 55 % for all tested attributes, with the exception of fare; not all attributes are perceived equally by business passengers. Flight product attributes are considered separately from ticket flexibility attributes by business passengers. Therefore, airlines may consider unbundling its products for them. New SP surveys can be deployed to test future flight products. The traditional segmentation method of passengers based on Business, Leisure and VFR trip purposes should be thoroughly reviewed, with the categorisation of business passengers expanded based on the findings of this research...|$|R
