The seal assembly was designed so that it would be essentially a drop-in conversion from a mechanical standpoint. Rotordynamic studies indicated that the conversion would result in a "better" machine. Unfortunately, sustained operations were not possible, due to excessive vibration levels at startup with the new seals. The shaft vibration exceeded 0. 007 in, peak-to-peak, at a subsynchronous frequency of 4900 rpm (the machine rated speed is in excess of 10, 000 rpm). These levels were sufficiently high to cause extensive damage to all internal labyrinths. The midspan labyrinths were wiped open in excess of 0. 060 in, radial. Analysis of tape recorded data indicated that the vibration was due to a rotor/bearing system dynamic instability. Additional computer simulations of the compressor rotordynamics revealed that the oil seals had provided sufficient damping to the system to bound the instability.

The gas performance of the <b>dry</b> <b>gas</b> <b>seal</b> is generally regarded as an ideal gas when the gas seal is investigated, designed, and operated. However some real gases performance may be {{quite different from the}} ideal gas when the gas pressure is high. In this paper, the carbon dioxide (CO 2) was taken as an example in some T-groove <b>dry</b> <b>gas</b> <b>seal,</b> and the virial equation of state, which expresses the effect of real gas, was used, and the finite difference method (FDM) was adopted to solve the Reynolds equation of gas lubrication. The effects of real gas on the opening force (Fo) and radial leakage (Q) of the T-groove gas seal had been obtained. The results show that the seal performance (Fo, Q) will be underestimated when the real carbon dioxide is considered as an ideal gas. In calculation conditions, Fo and Q were maximum underestimated 4. 16 % and 19. 25 % respectively when Po was 5 MPa and ns was variable and the real carbon dioxide was considered as an ideal gas; Fo and Q were maximum underestimated 7. 48 %, and 29. 25 % respectively, when ns was 3000 r/min and Po was variable and the real carbon dioxide was considered as an ideal gas...|$|E
