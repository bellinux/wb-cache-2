5|$|William Shatner as James T. Kirk. Shatner practiced {{aerobics}} {{and strength}} training daily {{to prepare for}} the role. The physical activity and directing duties meant he woke at 4a.m. every day during filming, no matter what time <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
25|$|And {{when each}} man {{was done with}} his turn <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|After a brief {{stint as}} {{assistant}} manager to Andy King at Swindon Town, Coppell {{took over as}} manager at Brighton. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> during his initial job interview, but after a poor start to the season by a Brighton side managed by Martin Hinshelwood, Coppell was given a second chance and took it. Brighton were struggling in Division One and on a 10 match losing streak.|$|E

25|$|Jean died {{of cancer}} in 1975. He {{resigned}} from his position at the University of Natal in 1977 and took up lay preaching and missionary work. He conducted many missions in secondary schools. In 1978 he married a widow, Lesley. In December 1985, while driving alone near Graaff-Reinet, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel and his car left the road and crashed; he sustained multiple injuries and spent weeks in hospital, but eventually recovered fully.|$|E
25|$|Maezumi died on May 15, 1995 {{while visiting}} {{his family in}} Japan. He had been out drinking; {{returning}} home, he took a bath, where <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> and drowned. Not long before dying, he had given inka (dharma transmission) to Tetsugen Bernard Glassman. He did this to emphasize the Sanbo Kyodan connection of his past into the Dharma transmission of White Plum Asanga, naming Glassman President of the organization in his will.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after noon}} on August 25, 2014, Freeh was headed south on Vermont 12, in his 2010 GMC Yukon, {{when he drove}} off {{the east side of}} the road. The vehicle struck a mailbox at 2762 Vermont 12, Barnard, Vermont, and a row of shrubs, before {{stopping}} against a tree, police said. Freeh told police <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel. The Wilmington, Delaware, resident was flown from Barnard to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, under armed guard.|$|E

25|$|Gorshin's slender {{athletic}} build, wide mouth, {{and pale}} eyes under strong brows were ideal characteristics for screen henchmen. In 1957, <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> {{at the wheel}} of his car after driving from Pittsburgh for thirty-nine hours without sleep and subsequently, the vehicle crashed. He {{was on his way to}} a Hollywood screen test for the role of Petty Officer Ruby in Run Silent, Run Deep. He sustained a fractured skull and spent four days in a coma; a Los Angeles newspaper incorrectly reported that he had been killed. The role went to Don Rickles.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversion}} of heavier bombers to the Balkans {{meant that the}} crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of KG 30 was flying on his 50th mission. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the controls of his Ju 88 and woke up to discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and Dextro-Energen tablets, then completed the mission.|$|E
25|$|The book Coleridge {{was reading}} before <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> was Purchas, his Pilgrimes, or Relations of the World and Religions Observed in All Ages and Places Discovered, from the Creation to the Present, by the English clergyman and {{geographer}} Samuel Purchas, published in 1613. The book contained {{a brief description}} of Xanadu, the summer capital of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan. The text about Xanadu in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, which Coleridge admitted he did not remember exactly, was: In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place.|$|E

60|$|He {{lay down}} on the bench, and, tired as he was, <b>he</b> soon <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> The bench was a narrow one, and as he slept his arm fell down and hung by the side of it.|$|R
25|$|A State {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by a}} chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The ground controller was found directly responsible, as <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> on the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing, he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the approach controller to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years. All three appealed their sentences, to no avail. Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. <b>He</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E
500|$|Woods overcame {{difficulties}} with stuttering as a boy. This {{was not known}} until {{he wrote a letter}} to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, [...] "I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my dog and he would sit there and listen until <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{performing}} with Memphis Slim on 26 March 1976, Bennett was driving {{home in a}} Ford Transit van in Warwickshire when <b>he</b> apparently <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel. The van collided with a truck and Bennett was killed.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1979, Jankovich was {{involved}} in a fatal highway collision north of Pullman on a Sunday afternoon. <b>He</b> apparently <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel and crossed the center line, but did not face criminal charges.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose that's true," [...] said Jasper Grinder, with a {{thoughtful}} look. His experience had humbled him greatly. He was so exhausted that <b>he</b> soon <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> breathing heavily. The boys and John Barrow {{gazed at him}} curiously.|$|R
500|$|During the trial, Lhermitte {{testified that}} {{her role as}} wife and mother was {{disrupted}} by having the middle-aged Belgian doctor, Michel Schaar, {{living in the same}} house as part of the family. According to Lhermitte, Scharr accompanied her and Moqadem on their honeymoon and stayed in their room. Lhermitte stated, [...] "We [...] had to wait until <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> before we could make love. I found that weird but Bouchaib said he regarded him as his stepfather. I think the doctor loved my husband in a platonic way." ...|$|E
500|$|After George’s recovery, his popularity, {{and that}} of Pitt, {{continued}} to increase {{at the expense of}} Fox and the Prince of Wales. His humane and understanding treatment of two insane assailants, Margaret Nicholson in 1786 and John Frith in 1790, contributed to his popularity. James Hadfield's failed attempt to shoot the King [...] in the Drury Lane Theatre on 15 May 1800 was not political in origin but motivated by the apocalyptic delusions of Hadfield and Bannister Truelock. George seemed unperturbed by the incident, so much so that <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> in the interval.|$|E
500|$|On the {{sea journey}} to Elephant Island, McNish {{was in the}} James Caird with Shackleton and Frank Wild. As they {{approached}} the island, Wild, who {{had been at the}} tiller for 24 hours straight, was close to collapse, so Shackleton ordered McNish to relieve him. McNish was not in a much better state himself and, despite the terrible conditions, [...] <b>he</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> after half an hour. The boat swung around and a huge wave drenched him. This was enough to wake him, but Shackleton, seeing McNish too was exhausted, ordered him to be relieved.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> almost <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> {{waiting there}} with his back against a fence-post. The dawn came, and then the rosy sunrise. And he discovered, not half a mile away, a good-sized town, where he {{believed}} he surely could hire an automobile.|$|R
60|$|Thus he sat {{for nearly}} an hour with an uncomfortable {{sensation}} that danger of some sort lurked near him, until <b>he</b> almost <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> Then, rousing himself he proceeded to breakfast on the bones and scraps of the previous night's supper.|$|R
60|$|The {{natural result}} of this indulgence was that <b>he</b> soon <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> and even the {{rumbling}} of the trains as they passed failed to awaken him, until after some time, when {{he became aware of}} a tugging and pulling at his coat.|$|R
