5|$|His {{youthful}} {{love for}} the fairy-tale element <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare</b> prefigured his later expressions of Catholic liturgy. Messiaen {{was not interested in}} depicting aspects of theology such as sin; rather he concentrated on the theology of joy, divine love and redemption.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} success of the Troilus, the love story was popular as a free {{standing}} tale to be retold by English-language writers throughout the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century. The theme was treated either seriously or in burlesque. For many authors, true Troilus, false Cresseid and pandering Pandarus became ideal types eventually {{to be referred to}} together as such <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare.</b> As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare,</b> in Gielgud's view.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{has been}} noted that, while women {{dressing}} as men (i.e., a boy actor acting a female character who dresses as a man) are common <b>in</b> <b>Shakespeare,</b> the reverse (i.e., a male adult actor dressing as a woman) is all but non-existent, leaving aside Antony's debated case.|$|E
