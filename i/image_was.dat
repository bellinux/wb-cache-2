5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The <b>image</b> <b>was</b> in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay <b>image</b> <b>was</b> smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E

Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's <b>image</b> <b>was</b> immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise {{the influence of the}} press (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified <b>image</b> <b>was</b> presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how different parts of the media would cover stories.

40|$|Color <b>image</b> {{segmentation}} <b>is</b> {{useful for}} fast retrieval in large image database. For that purpose, new image segmentation technique {{based on the}} probability of pixel distribution in the <b>image</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Color <b>image</b> <b>is</b> first divided into R, G, and B channel images. Then, pixel distribution from each of channel <b>image</b> <b>is</b> extracted to select {{to which it is}} similar among the well known probabilistic distribution function- Weibull, Exponential, Beta, Gamma, Normal, and Uniform. We use sum of least square error to measure of the quality how well an <b>image</b> <b>is</b> fitted to distribution. That P. d. f has minimum score in relation to sum of square error is chosen. Next, each <b>image</b> <b>is</b> quantized into 4 gray levels by applying thresholds to the c. d. f of the selected distribution of each channel. Finally, three quantized <b>images</b> <b>are</b> combined into one color image to obtain final segmentation result.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{national}} media began to report the extreme wealth of some Texans in magazines such as Life and Fortune. A stereotype emerged of the nouveau-riche Texas oil millionaire, popularized by the media. The popular <b>image</b> <b>was</b> often characterized by a rough and combative personality, heavy drinking, and extravagant spending. In 1956, the motion picture Giant helped to crystallize the image of Texans in the popular imagination as comical, eccentric figures. Glenn McCarthy was {{the inspiration for the}} character of Jett Rink in the film. Other films such as Boom Town and War of the Wildcats, and books such as The Lusty Texans of Dallas and Houston: Land of the Big Rich, also contributed to public perceptions of oil's influence in Texas and surrounding states.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time.

The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality.
