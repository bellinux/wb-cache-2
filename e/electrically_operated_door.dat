25|$|The RMC was a coach {{version for}} Green Line routes. RMCs had {{modified}} suspension and interiors {{to allow a}} longer range and more comfortable running, an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>door</b> instead of an open platform, and a semi-automatic gearbox with higher gear ratios. The RCL was a long version of the RMC with a larger engine and similar coach-style features. Seating was provided for 57 on RMCs and 65 on RCLs.|$|E
25|$|The RMF and RMA {{class were}} {{production}} {{versions of the}} front entrance Routemaster, primarily for non-London and airline use. Like the RMC/RCL they had an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>door,</b> but {{at the front of}} the bus, along with the staircase. After being exhibited and demonstrated to other operators, the RMF attracted little interest, apart from an order from Northern General Transport Company (RMF) and, in a short version, from British European Airways (RMA).|$|E
50|$|The Trendline grade {{has over}} the base version <b>{{electric}}ally</b> <b>operated</b> <b>door</b> locking, electric windows and wing mirror adjustment {{as well as}} a radio with a CD player, climate control (Climatic), multi-functional display, cruise control, front fog lights, 17-inch aluminium wheels.Also painted in the body colour are the front bumper, door handles and wing mirrors.|$|E
50|$|Of the Cyclone's stylistic features, {{the bubble}} top canopy {{was the most}} prominent. Silver coated for UV protection, the canopy {{automatically}} opened along with the sliding <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors.</b> The canopy could also be stowed in the rear compartment, where it rested on a special air-bag base.|$|R
5000|$|After the RAAF retired its flying {{boats in}} 1952 RAAF Base Rathmines {{was used as}} a ground-training base for, among others, officers, senior non-commissioned officers, {{physical}} training instructors, national servicemen and recruits until being closed in 1960/61. When the base closed a large hangar, complete with <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors</b> and used for servicing seaplanes, was pulled down and half of the very high building shipped to RAAF Base Richmond to house the RAAF's then-new C-130 Hercules aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the opening}} of the Bloor–Danforth line and the {{additional}} services that were required, a new set of trains were purchased from the Hawker Siddeley group. These trains, which were a part of the H-series, were similar to the M-1 series trains with newer features such as <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors.</b> With the introduction of the T-1 series subway trains, the H-1 and H-2 subway trains were retired from service, while the remaining H-4 trains (along with some earlier T-1 series trains) were shifted to the Bloor–Danforth line.|$|R

50|$|A {{pressure}} sensitive mat provides a contact signal when {{force is applied}} anywhere within {{the area of the}} mat. Some mats provide a single signal, while others can resolve the position of the applied force within the mat. Pressure sensitive mats can be used to <b>operate</b> <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors,</b> or as part of an interlock system to ensure machine operators are clear of dangerous areas of a process before it operates. Pressure sensitive mats can be used to detect persons walking over a particular point, as part of a security alarm system or to count attendance, or for other purposes.|$|R
50|$|The 150 people {{travelling}} in {{the carriage}} {{were unable to}} open the <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>doors.</b> The connecting door to the second carriage only opened inwards, impossible with the crowd of panicking passengers inside. Finally, {{the windows of the}} carriage were too small to escape through: 63 series cars, of wartime design, employed many cost-cutting measures, one of which was a three-pane window design, where only lower and upper panes could be opened. Intended to escape an expense of a large, full-sized glass pane, this design left the openings too small to pass through. The passengers were therefore trapped; the first car, constructed soon after World War II of combustible materials (another cost-cutting measure was the wooden roof of these cars), was completely consumed by fire within ten minutes, killing 106 people and injuring 92 more.|$|R
5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> scissor <b>doors</b> and a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|R
50|$|When delivered, the R16's {{quickly became}} the new {{standard}} in car design for the New York City Transit Authority. Structurally and mechanically, they were the larger versions of the R17s and yet basically an improved version of the R10s with same exact dimensions except that the R16's had <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>door</b> motors while the R10s had pneumatic door engines. When they were new, the R16's could give the R10 some competition {{when it came to}} speed - both cars were mechanically similar with four 100 horsepower motors and a balancing speed of 55 MPH.|$|E
50|$|The LX and Red Elephant versions, {{which cost}} €15.060 list, came with {{standard}} including driver and passenger airbags, air conditioning, ABS, power steering, Blaupunkt radio/navigation system with 6 speakers, split rear seat with headrests, the Alcantara interior, outdoor temperature display, <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>door</b> mirrors painted in body colour, the helm station and instrument panel were red instead of green, central locking with remote control, power windows, adjustable seat and steering wheel, leather interior with red stitching on the Red Elephant, fog lamps and alloy wheels with 185/60 R 14 tires for the LX and 195/50 R15 for the Red Elephant.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{armament}} {{for production}} {{versions of the}} Leopard 2 is the Rheinmetall 120 mm smoothbore gun - the same gun currently used on the M1 Abrams - in either the L44 variant (found on all production Leopard 2s until the A5), or the L55 variant (as found on the Leopard 2A6 and subsequent models). Ammunition for the gun comprises 27 rounds stored in a special magazine in the forward section of the hull, {{to the left of}} the driver's station, with an additional 15 rounds stored in the left side of the turret bustle, which are separated from the fighting compartment by an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>door.</b> If the ammunition storage area is hit, a blow-off panel in the turret roof would direct an explosion upwards away from the crew compartment. The gun is fully stabilized, and can fire a variety of types of rounds, such as the German DM43 APFSDS-T anti-tank round, which is said to be able to penetrate 560 mm of steel armour at a range of 2000 m, and the German DM12 multipurpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT). For the L55 gun, a newer APFSDS-T round was introduced to take advantage of the longer barrel, the DM-53, which is said to be able to penetrate 750 mm of RHAe armour at a range of 2,000 meters. The bore evacuator and the gun's thermal sleeve of the A4 and A5, designed to regulate the temperature of the barrel, are fabricated from glass-reinforced plastic. The barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. The main gun is capable of power elevating from +20° to −9°.|$|E
50|$|The Toyota FT-EV II is a small, battery electric, {{concept car}} built by Toyota as a {{modified}} Toyota iQ and first {{shown at the}} October 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. It differs from the FT-EV by seating four people, by having more {{parts of the body}} transparent and <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> sliding <b>doors.</b> A pair of linked joysticks (each joystick duplicating the other) control acceleration, braking and steering using drive-by-wire. The top speed is over 100 km/h and the range is 90 km.|$|R
25|$|While the Tennessees and Pennsylvanias {{shared the}} same number of {{transverse}} bulkheads, the Tennessees were built with a greater amount of longitudinal subdivision. The inner bottom, subdivided into 35 watertight compartments, extended from the keel to the protective deck at each side and fore and aft to the knuckle of the keel. Underwater protection was further increased by continuing this subdivision up the complete side of the subsurface hull to the lower edge of the armored deck slopes. Twenty-eight <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> Long-Arm watertight <b>doors</b> and five armored hatches helped maintain watertight integrity beneath the armored deck.|$|R
5000|$|Alstom {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to supply 168 coaches to Chennai Metro {{at a cost of}} [...] Alstom will supply 42 train-sets composed of four coaches each with each car measuring 22.5 m in length and can accommodate 319 passengers. The trains will have a first-class compartment and a women's section with 14 seats in the first-class car and 44 seats in the normal car. The first nine trains will be imported from Brazil and the remaining will be manufactured at a new facility set up Tada about 75 km from Chennai. The trains are air-conditioned with <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> automatic sliding <b>doors</b> and a regenerative braking system. The cars will operate on 25 KV AC through an overhead catenary system with a maximum speed of 80 km/h.|$|R
50|$|To {{fulfill its}} {{reconnaissance}} role, the XF-12 contained three separate photographic compartments aft of the wing. One vertical, one split vertical, and one trimetrogon each using a six-inch Fairchild K-17 camera. For night reconnaissance missions, the XF-12 {{had a large}} hold in the belly which accommodated 18 high-intensity photo-flash bombs; these were ejected over the target area. All of the bays were equipped with <b>electrically</b> <b>operated,</b> inward retracting <b>doors</b> (again designed for maximum aerodynamic cleanliness). The camera lenses were electrically heated to eliminate distortion. All of this combined to allow full photo operations during high speed flights. The XF-12 also carried a variety of photographic equipment, including complete darkroom facilities to permit the development and printing of films in flight. This was augmented by adjustable storage racks, able to handle any size film containers and additional photo equipment. This allowed the Army Intelligence units to have immediate access to the intelligence the aircraft was able to collect, with no delay in processing.|$|R

50|$|By late in 1948, Burlingham {{was able}} to begin {{to move away from}} its {{enforced}} policy of rigid standardisation, helped by a couple of longstanding and influential customers. Local British Electric Traction subsidiary Ribble Motor Services was responsible for the largest share of inter-urban routes in Lancashire, and wished to make more efficient use of its crews on limited-stop services running from the great industrial conurbations in the South, Centre and East of the county, to the seaside resorts in the West. As a result, they commissioned a double-deck lowbridge coach body with 49 seats on 30 Leyland Titan PD1/3 chassis, to the newly authorised 8-foot width. These had full fronts, <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> platform <b>doors</b> and coach trim, as well as luxury seating; the outline was generously curved, as were the window outlines. These became famous as the first of Ribble's 'White Lady' coaches. Ribble also took the same outline but with a half cab and 53 bus seats for service duties {{over the next few years}}. Scottish Motor Traction, seeking to publicise the return of peacetime standards on its Edinburgh-London coach service, chose a special Burlingham body for display at the 1948 Commercial Motor Show. This was mounted on the new AEC Regal III coach chassis and had a full front, with the AEC radiator hidden behind a chrome grille arrangement, the whole front of the coach tapering in plan, so that a single full-width windscreen with opening upper section could be fitted, rather than the traditional vertically divided style (as on pre-war fully fronted designs). The ensemble was completed by bulbous front and rear wings and a pair of low-set rectangular headlights. No other bodies were quite like that show coach, but it pointed the way to the future. Incidentally, SMT took Ribble-style double-deck bodies from Burlingham on 20 AEC Regent III chassis in 1950, which incorporated Ribble's post-war style of destination and number-blind glazing, to an irregular hexagonal outline - basically a triangle with the corners chopped off. This style of destination glazing spread over the next few years to become the double-deck standard throughout the Scottish Bus Group until the 1980s.|$|R
