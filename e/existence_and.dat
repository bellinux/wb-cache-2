50|$|In {{his recent}} books, from {{the notions of}} phenomenography, ontography and ontology, Albert Piette elaborates {{anthropology}} as an empirical and theoretical science, different from sociology and ethnology.

Piette’s anthropological world is filled with Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, apes and monkeys, gods <b>and</b> institutions, <b>existences</b> <b>and</b> presences, activity and passivity, instants and evolution.
