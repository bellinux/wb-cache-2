40|$|Several recent {{papers have}} studied the impact of {{macroeconomic}} shocks on the financial policies of firms. However, they only consider the case where these macroeconomic shocks affect the profitability of firms but not the financial markets conditions. We study the polar case where the profitability of firms is stationary, but interest rates and issuance costs are governed by an exogenous Markov chain. We characterize the optimal dividend policy and show that these two macroeconomic factors have opposing effects: all things being equal, firms distribute more dividends when interest rates are high and less when <b>issuing</b> <b>costs</b> are high...|$|E

Firms prefer to choose a stronger underwriter to show a positive signal to the outsiders in order to raise more money. However, the larger or stronger an underwriter is, the greater its bargaining power becomes. Because the main revenue of underwriters comes from their underwriting fees, management fees, sales allowances, and transaction commission of stock listing, given the fixed <b>issuing</b> <b>costs,</b> underwriters will attempt to convince the IPO firms to lower their issue prices so as to reduce risks; whether new stock issue may be successful is dependent on the market conditions.|$|E
40|$|Debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> {{generally}} are incurred {{in connection with}} the issuance of debt securities or other short- or long-term borrowings. Opinion 21 requires that debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> be reported in the balance sheet as deferred charges. Generally, debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> are capitalized as an asset and amortized over the term of the debt. Statement 95 requires that cash receipts and payments in a statement of cash flows be classified as operating, investing, or financing activities. However, some believe that Statement 95 does not provide specific guidance on the classification of debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> in the statement of cash flows. Because debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> have aspects of more than one class of cash flows, diversity in practice has arisen.

Imperfect substitutability of assets and international transaction costs give a comparative advantage to large markets, because of demand effects.

40|$|We {{explain why}} some private firms lead a hot IPO market by going public early, while others follow by delaying their IPOs {{until late in the}} same market. In our model, there is {{uncertainty}} about the future state of economy and going public is valuable only in the good state of economy. Consequently, firms have to decide whether to go public now or to wait until the state of economy becomes known. Bad firms always wait. If the economy turns out to be good (bad), they go public (remain private) and incur (save) <b>issuing</b> <b>costs.</b> Good firms, which can increase their probability of success by pre-committing to invest, may prefer to go public immediately. They, however, have to underprice their shares, since bad firms have an incentive to mimic them otherwise. We find evidence for our arguments in the U. S. IPO market: Early IPOs of a hot market are underpriced more severely on average, but they experience higher growth in sales, assets, EBITDA, and capital expenditure. Moreover, their shares outperform the market up to nine months after their issues, while those of late IPOs underperform the market from the start. JEL classification: G 32; L...|$|E

40|$|The author {{documents}} the precise costs of debt and equity issuance, both domestically and internationally, for firms in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Costs include investment banking and legal fees, regulatory and exchange listing costs, rating agency fees, and expenditures for marketing and publishing. Her {{findings suggest that}} Brazilian firms face similar costs in issuing debt locally or abroad, whereas domestic equity issuance is nearly twice as expensive as debt. While the Chilean domestic corporate debt market is well developed by emerging market standards (size {{of the market and}} maturity of issues), Chilean firms can issue debt more cheaply internationally than at home. In addition, while equity financing is cheaper in Chile from a transaction cost perspective, over the past decade most firms have used bonds rather than shares to raise capital. This financing trend is true in all three countries. Finally, Mexican firms can issue debt at the lowest costs of the three, but face the highest equity <b>issuing</b> <b>costs.</b> In addition to documenting these features, the author sheds light on how the investor base in these countries plays a strong role in influencing the ability of firms to access domestic capital markets.

The reduction in <b>issue</b> <b>cost</b> was not due to a decrease in underwriter compensation, but rather to the elimination of underpricing (the difference between the market price after trading commences and the offering price). Underwriter fee has declined substantially after the EMU, but that decline was offset by an increase in the underwriter spread (the difference between the offering price and the guaranteed price to the issuer), leaving total underwriter compensation unchanged. The EMU is also associated with significant reductions in bond maturity and syndicate size, consistent with its expected effects on liquidity and <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> in the Eurobond market. ...|$|R

Our results indicate that foreign IPOs involve approximately the same costs on average as domestic IPOs, for all except those experiencing strong demand and upward revisions in the offer price {{over the course of}} the road show. For upwardly revised IPOs, foreign IPOs have significantly lower underpricing compared to domestic IPOs. For these offers, we find that lower underpricing is associated with less risk due to the generally greater quality of foreign issuers. It is also the case that these offers are sold more frequently in multiple markets. In addition, we observe lower underpricing for IPOs from emerging markets, which is consistent with demand being driven to some extent by diversification. Overall, we uncover no evidence to suggest that foreign IPOs experience greater capital raising costs than domestic IPOs. 1 U.
