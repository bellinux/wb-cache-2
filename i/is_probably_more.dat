Held during Refugee Rights Week in Toronto, Adelman {{reviewed}} recent research on refugees, suggesting it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> beneficial than detrimental to assist refugees.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as insomnia, delirium, cognitive deficits, tremor, hallucinations, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than a}} degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E

5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in the 80th Olympiad (460–457BC) {{according}} to Apollodorus of Athens, and although Thrasyllus placed his birth in 470 BC, the later date <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> likely.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian {{has many}} biradical and perhaps monoradical roots, in {{contrast}} to the Semitic preference for triradical roots. Egyptian <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> conservative, and Semitic likely underwent later regularizations converting roots into the triradical pattern.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Babawayh died in Ray in 381 A.H. He <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> than 70 {{years of}} age. He is buried at Ebn-e Babooyeh in Persia (modern day Iran).|$|R
25|$|In {{the public}} sector, where service {{providers}} usually enjoy a monopoly, the usage gap {{is probably the}} most important factor in activity development. However, persuading more consumers to take up family benefits, for example, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> important to the relevant government department than opening more local offices.|$|E
25|$|Academics and {{therapists}} say cheating <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> prevalent {{on the road}} than close to home. The protection of the road offers a secret life of romance, far from spouses or partners. Affairs range from one-night stands to relationships that last for years. They are usually with a co-worker, a business associate or someone they repeatedly encounter.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> accurate, however, to {{say that}} deism evolved into, and contributed to, other {{religious}} movements. The term deist became rarely used, but deist beliefs, ideas, and influences remained. They {{can be seen in}} 19th-century liberal British theology and in the rise of Unitarianism, which adopted many of deism's beliefs and ideas.|$|E

50|$|On 19 January 2000 the Zambian Government closed {{them down}} due to {{concerns}} with safety. The real reason <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> {{to do with}} politics between David Tokoph and Zambian Government officials.|$|R
5000|$|The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> {{commonly}} {{known by its}} Spanish acronym FMLN. It was an umbrella organization or alliance of five left-wing guerrilla groups backed by Cuba.|$|R
25|$|Efficiency: Conventional rail <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> {{efficient}} at lower speeds. But {{due to the}} lack of physical contact between the track and the vehicle, maglev trains experience no rolling resistance, leaving only air resistance and electromagnetic drag, potentially improving power efficiency. Some systems however such as the Central Japan Railway Company SCMaglev use rubber tires at low speeds, reducing efficiency gains.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, he {{constructed}} a narrative from Creation to his present, again similar to Herodotus or the Hebrew Bible. Within this construction, the sacred myths blended with history. Whether he shared Hellenistic {{skepticism about the}} existence of the gods and their tales is unknown, though it is likely he believed them more than the satirist Ovid, for example. The naturalistic attitude found in Syncellus' transmission <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> representative of the later Greek authors who transmitted the work than of Berossus himself.|$|E
25|$|Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences {{obviously}} bored him; he {{was always}} for movement, for some betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion he was {{a master of the}} art of persuasion, unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his lighter side he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both cynical and personal...|$|E
25|$|Clear {{aligners}} {{are more}} noticeable than lingual braces, but <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> comfortable. They can be removed, which makes cleaning of the teeth easier, {{and they are}} faster for the dentist to apply.|$|R
50|$|Some shops accept euros, {{and price}} tags in euros exist in some tourist {{oriented}} shops, as in more cities in Sweden. Acceptance of and price tags in Danish kroner <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> common.|$|R
50|$|The storyline of Moulin Rouge can {{be traced}} back to Alexandre Dumas, fils' The Lady of the Camellias, {{although}} Luhrmann, as an opera director, <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> directly influenced by Verdi's adaptation, La traviata.|$|R
25|$|However {{oral hygiene}} <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> {{effective}} at preventing gum disease (periodontal disease) than tooth decay. Food is forced inside pits and fissures under chewing pressure, leading to carbohydrate-fueled acid demineralisation where the brush, fluoride toothpaste, and saliva have {{no access to}} remove trapped food, neutralise acid, or remineralise demineralised tooth like on other more accessible tooth surfaces. (Occlusal caries accounts for between 80 and 90% of caries in children (Weintraub, 2001).) Chewing fibre like celery after eating forces saliva inside trapped food to dilute any carbohydrate like sugar, neutralise acid and remineralise demineralised tooth. The teeth at highest risk for carious lesions are the permanent first and second molars due to length of time in oral cavity and presence of complex surface anatomy.|$|E
25|$|While {{the sign}} system in ISL {{appears to be}} largely indigenous, {{elements}} in ISL are derived from British Sign Language. For example, most ISL signers nowadays use fingerspelling based on British Sign Language fingerspelling, with only isolated groups using an indigenous devanagari-based fingerspelling system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in Vadodara/Baroda, Gujarat). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from American Sign Language. A small number of the Deaf in and around Bengaluru are often said to use American Sign Language (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> correct {{to say that they}} use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or Signed English), while incorporating also a not inconsequential ISL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly ISL and not ASL.|$|E
25|$|Just like data {{on water}} availability, {{publicly}} available data on water use in Greater Damascus are contradictory and outdated. In 2001 water use {{has been estimated}} at between 1,350 and 1,700 million cubic metres per year. This includes water use for irrigation that was estimated at between 920 and more than 1,200 million cubic metres per year, accounting for 68% and 76% of total water use in the basin. Domestic water use was estimated at between 300 and 390 million cubic metres per year. The lower bound of this estimate <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> realistic and is equivalent {{to an average of}} about 220 liter/capita/day before distribution losses for a population connected to the network of about 3.75 million. Taking into account non-revenue water of about 50%, this corresponds to about 110 liter/capita/day which is about as much as domestic water use in Germany. However, during summer water availability and thus water use drop significantly. For example, in the summer of 2001 the city received 317,000 cubic meter per day, corresponding to about 85 liter/capita/day before losses and 43 liter/capita/day after losses.|$|E
5000|$|Eocathayornis is a genus of enantiornithean {{birds that}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> basal or [...] "primitive" [...] than related genera Sinornis and Cathayornis. These birds lived during the Early Cretaceous in today's People's Republic of China.|$|R
50|$|LDCOM was {{a smaller}} company, but {{fast-moving}} and opportunistic. Cegetel provided good {{service and a}} recognized brand, especially in the enterprise and wholesale segments (over 16,000 corporate clients), but <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> conservative and slower-moving.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{map shows}} the {{probable}} extent {{of land and}} water {{at the time of}} the last glacial maximum, 20,000 yrs ago and when the sea level <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> than 110m lower than today.|$|R
25|$|There were 245 {{feminine}} and 24 masculine nouns in this class. 6 nouns have common gender: (the first three {{can also be}} attributed to masculine gender) palikuõnis 2, 34b 'progeny, offspring', grobuõnis 2, 3a 'predator', žiniuõnis 2, 4 'knower; witchdoctor', delsuonìs 3b 'who is dallying', giežuonìs 3b 'tiresome, sour (person)', vagìs 4 'thief'. Some other -uonis words are attributed to a masculine gender, for example, geluonìs 3b (2) – sting, deguõnis 2 (3b) (here in the table given as 3b, while 2 accentuation pattern <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> used) – oxygen. A word vinìs f, c 4 'nail, spike' is also sometimes understood as of common gender. The singular dative is -iui for the common gender, like in masculine nouns. The biggest part of these words have -t- stem. The second accentuation pattern is the rarest, among its examples are: durys pl. 2 'door', slistis 2 (4) 'simulation', gaištis 2, 4 'dallying' (the two latter can also be accentuated in the fourth paradigm), masculine: pirmuõnys pl. – protozoa, deguõnis (3b) – oxygen. Words with a suffix -m-en-, for example, ãšmenys pl. 3b – blade, sė́dmenys pl. 3a – buttocks, nates, nẽšmenys pl. 3b – silts, sediments carried by a water stream, are attributed to the third declensional pattern here, but they are of the fifth: the singular (can be used for all, but is not usual for all) nom. is -uo: sėdmuõ – buttock. The singular instrumental is -imi, like in the third declension, while for masculine words of the fifth declension the proper ending is given to be -iu; but -imi can also be and is chosen for {{the words of the}} fifth declension.|$|E
25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>more</b> common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E
