It is necessary to have a high strength joint without much distortion in the above applications. In the present investigation, Al 1100 H 14 aluminum alloy strips were joined by friction stir welding (FSW) process by single and double sided welding. Also the effect of <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> on tensile properties of the joints was investigated. Standard thickness (4 mm) aluminium pieces were joined by FSW under various traversing speeds and rotational speeds.

When the existence of surface active element (e. g. the content of S is about 0. 02 - 0. 04 % in steel) change the sign of surface tension temperature coefficient to positive, undercut always occurs in TIG moveless welding, and not occurs when the content of S in iron is very low (e. g.

The depth of undercut is bigger with the increase of temperature gradient when the othe r parameters are the same.

40|$|Engineering & Systems DesignThe use {{of laser}} welding has become quite {{widespread}} {{because it can}} achieve higher productivity than spot welding. This is due to its desirable features, which include high power density, faster welding speed, highly accurate welding, and excellent repeatability. In addition, laser welding can minimize the distortion in heat-affected zones (HAZs), {{and there is no}} tooling that wears out or must be changed over. In spite of these advantages, laser welding still causes many problems when used on compositions such as galvanized steel and aluminum alloy. Galvanized steel, for example, is composed of a zinc layer whose physical parameters differ from those of steel as a base material. Zinc vaporizes at a temperature of 907 K, whereas steel begins to melt at 1510 K. This phenomenon causes serious defects in welds because the pressure of zinc is more powerful than that of steel. As a result, a certain manipulable control is needed in order for the zinc coating to be able to evaporate. To prevent this circumstance, the following solutions have been proposed: (i) a de-gassing method that induces the zinc fumes to escape from the part-to-part gap between two materials; (ii) the removal of zinc layers that will be joined together; (iii) a pulsed laser method that minimizes zinc vaporization using a high energy per pulse and a short pulse duration; (iv) a laser hybrid method; and (v) the addition of additional elements to the surface, which form a compound with the vaporizing zinc. Despite these suggestions, applications involving zinc-coated steels are rarely used in the automotive industry because the shapes of the materials to be welded are not always uniform. 	In this study, we ascertain the effects of the part-to-part gap and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> on the quality of laser welding. Using a 2 kW fiber laser and galvanized steel sheets (with thicknesses of 1. 4 mm and 1. 8 mm), our experiments employed lap welding, which has been applied to side members in the automotive industry. The experimental design was used with a 33 factorial design with 3 replications. The three types of welding direction used are ascendance, descendance, and a uniform gap. Based on the experiments, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) it was determined that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> is an important factor that can affect the weld quality. In addition, the differences between the shear tensile strengths in the ascendance and descendance directions were determined using a t-Test. The maximum shear tensile strength in the ascendance direction was achieved with a laser power of 2000 W and a welding speed of 2100 mm/min, followed by a part-to-part gap of 0. 32 mm/min as the steepest ascent method. Moreover, we analyzed cross-sections of sampling specimens, varying the gap differences in order to verify the differences in shear tensile strength based on two different directions of welding. ope...|$|E

It {{was found that}} the fatigue crack growth rates (d a /d N) for AA 7075 -T 6 welded joints along the weld center line, advanced and retracted side regions are all slower than that of LC 4 CS alloy, but the d a /d N values along the perpendicular <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> for both alloys are the approximate same values. The d a /d N along the weld center line is the lowest, the second is that of retracted and advanced side and the d a /d N along the vertical <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> is the highest. The d a /d N of AA 7075 -T 6 FS welds is slower at the range of low load Δ K compared to base material, but for the range of high Δ K, the d a /d N of AA 7075 -T 6 base material is slower. The fracture surface of crack growth along the weld center line is obviously different from that of advanced and retracted side regions and base materials.

40|$|In the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process, a rotating, {{shouldered}} tool with a {{threaded pin}} is inserted under pressure along the seam of {{two pieces of}} metal which are tightly clamped together, and secured against a rigid anvil underneath. The rotating pin travels along the seam and {{through a combination of}} pressure and friction heating produces a zone of plastic deformation around the pin within the workpiece {{on either side of the}} seam. As the pin is moved in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding,</b> the plasticised material moves around the tool and bonds together behind it. The elements of the material flow behavior are a combination of three elements. There is a rotational transport of material being carried around the tool, extrusion of material being forced around the pin on both sides into the cavity created behind it, and a lifting and dropping of material as it is stirred and mixed by the rotating action of the pin. It was assumed that rotational motion of the plastic zone is the primary mechanism for transport of material around the welding tool. A kinematic mathematical model was used to compute trajectories of material movement for various distributions of rotational slip within the plastic zone. These trajectories were then compared with the results of an experiment that produced radiographs of markers embedded in a workpiece that was welded with the FSW process. It was assumed that the copper wire markers retained their original length as the aluminum material flowed around them. The kinematic model included a constraint so that the displacements were such that the total length of the wire markers did not increase after deformation. There was good agreement between the calculated trajectories for the case of localized slip at the outer surface of the plastic deformation zone and the radiographs of the copper wire markers. The trajectories differed markedly from the radiograph traces when a distributed slip zone was assumed. It was concluded that the flow field could be described generally by a rotating plug model with slip occurring on the surface at the outer boundary of the plastic zone...|$|E

40|$|Cold laps {{are defined}} as micro-lack of fusion defects at the weld toe more or less {{parallel}} {{to the surface of}} the parent plate. These defects are known to negatively influence the fatigue properties of weldments. Previous studies suggest that cold lap formation can not be avoided completely in Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW). Therefore, a better understanding of formation mechanisms is imperative to be able to minimize the number and size of these defects. The main objective of this work has been to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cold laps, including categorising, characterisation and defining the most significant factors for formation. GMAW was used to produce welds that were investigated by metallographic methods using light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. A novel classification of cold laps was introduced and three types of cold laps were identified: spatter cold laps, overlap cold laps and spatter-overlap cold laps. It was shown that cold laps are partially or fully filled by oxides. The most common oxides are manganese silicon oxides which were concluded to be formed primarily by oxidation of droplets. The presence of oxides was found to significantly increase the tendency to form spatter cold laps as well as overlap cold laps. Particularly for overlap cold laps, it was found that the depth (in transverse <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>weld)</b> is reduced when welding in a non-oxidising environment. Welding on blasted surfaces increased the cold lap formation by entrapment of gas. The droplet and base metal temperatures were also found to be significant factors in cold lap formation. For overlap cold laps the occurrence frequency decreased with increased preheating temperature of the base metal. Mechanisms of overflowing resulting in overlap cold laps were discussed based on an extensive literature review. Several phenomena are believed to contribute to overflow including Rayleigh instability, the balance of forces, transfer of lateral momentum by droplets and an outward Marangoni fluid flow <b>of</b> the <b>weld</b> pool. The present studies suggest that cold lap formation can be suppressed by ensuring that the welding process (arc) is as stable as possible and by welding on a preheated work piece in a non-oxidising environment...|$|R

An Abaqus Extension, in {{the form}} of an Abaqus/CAE Plug-In, is {{presented}} that enables an easy, efficient, model-tree based approach to setup all aspects <b>of</b> a <b>welding</b> model from within Abaqus/CAE. Specifically, the paper describes the extension to 3 -D of a similar capability, namely the 2 -D Abaqus Welding Interface (AWI), that currently exists for automating most of the repetitive, time-consuming tasks associated with building a welding model in a traditional CAE environment to facilitate weld simulations. The tasks supported by the 3 -D AWI include weld-bead definitions based on simple cross-sectional geometric entity picks, options for geometry- or element-based bead-chunking in the <b>weld</b> <b>direction,</b> automatic definition <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> passes, steps and boundary conditions for each pass, and set-up of both the thermal and stress analysis models. The 3 -D AWI is expected to make the normally time-consuming welding analysis setup significantly faster. The use of the AWI is demonstrated on a six-pass plate welding problem described in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of melt temperature and hold pressure on the static tensile and fatigue be-havior of an injection-molded 40 wt % talc-filled polypro-pylene. Injection molding caused anisotropy in the ma-terial. Both yield strength and fatigue strength {{were higher in the}} flow <b>direction.</b> The presence <b>of</b> <b>weld</b> line caused a large reduction in yield strength and fatigue strength. For specimens in the flow direction, both yield strength and fatigue strength increased with increasing hold pressure, but they were relatively insensitive to melt temperature. For specimens normal to the flow direc-tion, both yield strength and fatigue strength increased with increasing hold pressure and decreased with increas-ing melt temperature. For specimens containing a weld line, the yield strength and fatigue strength increased with increasing hold pressure as well as increasing melt tem-perature. The observed differences in properties are ex-plained in terms of the skin-core morphology, which was influenced by both melt temperature and hold pressure...|$|R

40|$|The <b>welding</b> <b>of</b> {{austenite}} {{stainless steel}} {{often results in}} large amount <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> distortion due to its high thermal expansion coefficient and low thermal conductivity. This has created great difficulty in the dimensional control <b>of</b> the <b>welded</b> stainless steel structure, ending up with high manufacturing cost. Researches on the <b>welding</b> distortion <b>of</b> stainless steels were very limited, especially for large weld structures with complex component shapes. The studies of this thesis were initiated with focus on the stainless steel nozzle-to-shell-can weld structures, a very typical structural configuration for pressure vessels used in petrochemical and nuclear power generation industries. Both the experimental and the FEA (finite element analysis), i. e. computational simulation, approaches were taken in the studies which addressed the influences <b>of</b> the <b>welding</b> fixture, the welding sequence, and the welding process on the distortion caused by stainless steel nozzle-to-shell welding. The investigations employed single and multi-nozzle weld test models (called mockups in the thesis) or FEA models. Manual GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding) and SMAW (shielded metal arc welding) processes were selected to represent the most common practice for stainless steel nozzle welding. The FEA simulations were conducted with ABAQUS program using sequentially coupled transient analysis method with lumped weld passes to achieve high computing efficiency. The investigations on the effect <b>of</b> the <b>welding</b> fixture concluded that the contour fixtures introduced in the thesis be effective for reducing the welding distortion for both the single and the multi-nozzle welding. The contour fixtures tend to localize the welding distortion, hence yield less impact on the global distortion <b>of</b> the whole <b>weld</b> structure. The rib-bar fixture, a more common fixture type for multi-nozzle welding, was found resulting in a big jump in the shell plate distortion when the fixture was removed. The studies on the influence <b>of</b> the <b>welding</b> sequence revealed that a progressive approach was more favorable for distortion control under the given nozzle-to-shell weld structure configurations. The best sequence suggested is to start welding at one nozzle, firstly on shell OD (outside diameter) side then on ID (inside diameter) side, then proceed to next neighboring nozzle. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>welding</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> each <b>weld</b> pass was found affecting only the nozzle angular distortion. The experimental data showed that the manual GTAW process developed much higher shell plate distortion than the SMAW process. The reason would be that a higher percentage <b>of</b> the <b>welding</b> heat had been consumed on the base metal. The influence <b>of</b> the <b>weld</b> bead size didn’t appear to be significant. In the FEA study {{on the effect of}} the size <b>of</b> the lumped <b>weld</b> pass, the increase in weld bead size even resulted in a decrease in weld distortion. From the FEA simulation point of view, using large lumped pass would be a highly efficient choice without compromising too much in the precision of the distortion prediction. The FEA study confirmed that a decrease in cooling time after welding would result in more welding distortion. The large scale multi-nozzle mockup with rib-bar fixture demonstrated a maximum out-of-plane shell distortion of 16. 4 mm after the <b>welding</b> <b>of</b> 10 nozzles with GTAW+SMAW process, which suggests that additional measures should be developed to further control the welding distortion. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{production}} and consumption of energy has become the top priority of national and international policies around the world. Manufacturing industries have to address {{the requirements of the}} government in relation to energy saving and ecologically sustainable products. These industries are also concerned with energy and material usage due to their rising costs. Therefore industries have to find solutions that can support environmental preservation yet maintain competitiveness in the market. Welding, a major manufacturing process, consumes a great deal of material and energy. It is a crucial process in improving a product’s life-cycle cost, strength, quality and reliability. Factors which lead to weld related inefficiencies have to be effectively managed, if industries are to meet their quality requirements and fulfil a high-volume production demand. Therefore {{it is important to consider}} some practical strategies in welding process for optimization of energy and material consumption. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the methods of minimizing the ecological footprint <b>of</b> the <b>welding</b> process and methods to effectively manage its material and energy usage in the welding process. The author has performed a critical review of the factors including improved weld power source efficiency, efficient weld techniques, newly developed weld materials, intelligent welding systems, weld safety measures and personnel training. The study lends strong support to the fact that the use <b>of</b> eco-friendly <b>welding</b> units and the quality weld joints obtained with minimum possible consumption of energy and materials should be the main <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> improvement in <b>welding</b> systems.
