40|$|The black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Rottemburg), is a {{globally}} distributed species. Within {{the different}} regions of its home range it may have other common names: floodplain cutworm, <b>greasy</b> <b>cutworm</b> and overflow worm. Black cutworms have numerous plant hosts and may cause economic damage to seedling plants of corn, cotton, soybeans, turf grasses, vegetables (e. g., lettuce and tomato), wheat and other cultivated and wild plant species...|$|E
40|$|The larva of the near-cosmopolitan noctuid moth Agrotis ipsi/on (Hufnagel) (-A. ypsilon, Rhyacia ypsi/on (Rott.), R. ypsilon (Warren), Scotia ipsilon (Rott.)) is {{popularly known}} as the <b>greasy</b> <b>cutworm</b> in Asia and North America, the dark sword grass in Britain, and the black cutworm in Europe. The name 'cutworm' reflects. its feeding habit of cutting off plant {{seedlings}} {{at the base of}} the stem, and the adjectives 'greasy' or 'black' describe its greasy, earthy-brown, blackish or grey-green appearance which is due to its black head, numerous dark tubercles, and dorsal longitudinal dark stripes and lateral pale ones. The <b>greasy</b> <b>cutworm</b> can be of very considerable economic importance, not only because of its prolific and often localized breeding but also because its nocturnal feeding habits often cause outbreaks to escape notice until a late stage. The sudden appearances of A. ipsilon, often in large numbers, and its seasonal disappearances, especially in India, the Celebes, Egypt and the Middle East, caused this pest to be recognized as a migrant about half a century ago. The present author has attempted to obtain additional circumstantial biogeographical evidence of major seasonal redistributions of populations on a world-wide basis, particularly over continental land masses and remote islands. This has been done by plotting historical records, obtained from museum specimens, light-traps and the scientific literature, on monthly distribution maps. This type of analysis has previously been undertaken for the armyworm moth, Spodoptera exempta (Walk.), in Africa (Betts, Haggis & Odiyo 1968), and for the Desert Locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk.), throughout its vast distribution area in Africa, the Middle East and south-west Asia (Waloff 1946; Donnelly 1947; Davies 1952; Fortescue-Foulkes 1953). A further aim is to attempt an interpretation of the role of seasonal changes in the distribution of A. ipsilon as a natural means of adaptation...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study on the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval,(El-Ibrashy, 1971) {{it was suggested that}} the corpus allatum may control develop-ment by controlling secretion in the ecdysial gland. Metamorphosis into pupae is deferred if allatectomy is performed on newly ecdysed 6 th-instar larvae, whereas allatectomy in newly ecdysed 5 th-instar larvae shortens larval life and produces precocious dwarf pupae incapable of developing into adults. It has long been suggested that larval life in many insects could be shortened by complete starvation {{at the beginning of the}} last instar, whereas semi-starvation prolongs larval life (cf. Boden-stein, 1953). El-Ibrashy & Mansour (1970) have suggested that chemicals with apparent hormonal action on the growth rate of larvae of the <b>greasy</b> <b>cutworm</b> Agrotis ypsilon may act by changing the amount of food consumed. We therefore investigated whether the food intake of S. littoralis larvae alters in relation to the growth rate after allatectomy in 5 th- and in 6 th-instar larvae. Larvae were obtained from our established laboratory culture (El-Ibrashy & Chenouda, 1970). Allatectomy was performed within 24 h of ecdysis according to the method developed by El-Ibrashy (1971). All experimental animals were kept singl...|$|E
30|$|The most {{detailed}} {{work on the}} insect fauna of corn fields was that carried out in Giza by Tawfik et al. (1974). Their studies showed that corn fields are inhabited by representatives of 66 families from 14 orders. About 40 of these species have been recorded as corn feeders. Among them, the three corn borers Sesamia cretica Led., Chilo agamemnon Bles, and Ostrinia nubilalis (Hb.) and the aphid species Macrosiphum (=Sitobion) avenae F., Rhopalosiphum padi L., and R. maidis Fitch. are considered the major pests of corn plants in Egypt. Sometimes, and in some areas, the cotton leafworm S. littoralis, the <b>greasy</b> <b>cutworm</b> A. ipsilon, and the mole cricket Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa L. could be destructive to these plants. However, the pest status in corn fields {{is associated with the}} existence of 42 beneficial species which play efficiently, as biological control agents, against these pests. Aphids are controlled by several predaceous species, such as the nymphs and adults of the anthocorids Orius albidipennis Fieb. and O. laevigatus Fieb. (the former is more common than the latter); adults of the staphylinid Paederus alfierii Kock.; larvae and adults of the coccinellids Cydonia (=Chilomenes) vicina var. isis Cr. and var. nilotica Muls, Coccinella undecimpunctata L., Scymnus interruptus, and S. syriacus; larvae of the syrphids Syrphus corollae Fabre, Sphaerophoria flavicauda Zett, and Paragus aegyptium Macq.; and larvae of the octhiphilid Leucopis puncticornus aphidivora Rond. Aphids, on corn, are parasitized by the braconid species Aphidius sonchi Marsh and Praon flavinoda Hal.|$|E
