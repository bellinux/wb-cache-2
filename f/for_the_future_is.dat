Outgoing Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie also offered congratulations, pledging 'not be a back seat driver' and was 'confident that she is more than equal to taking on Alex Salmond'. Murdo Fraser conceded defeat, saying he was 'disappointed that I {{was not able to}} persuade more of our members that my vision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> the correct one', but pledged to support Davidson as leader.|$|E
500|$|On Enter the Wu-Tangs {{effect on}} the group and the music industry, the Milwaukee Journals Aaron Justin-Szopinski wrote [...] "The Wu showed us that a hip-hop group can control its own destiny in the tangled web of the industry. It owns {{publishing}} rights, controls its samples and has 90% influence over its career. And that control, that outlook <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> what makes it the best." [...] Wu-Tang Clan have produced four subsequent group albums since Enter the Wu-Tang, including Wu-Tang Forever (1997), which is certified as a quadruple platinum record. None of the subsequent Wu-Tang Clan albums have garnered the critical accolades that their debut was accorded.|$|E

Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type {{that he has made}} his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R - as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever you may think of him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls." [...] Jude Rogers of BBC Music said the song was catchy, but was one of the album's tracks that were a [...] "pale imitation of Justin Timberlake album tracks." ...|$|E

2500|$|Overall, with nuclear- or {{hydroelectric}} power, {{and efficient}} manufacturing, CO2 generation {{can be reduced}} to [...] per kg cement, but can be twice as high. The thrust of innovation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> to reduce sources 1 and 2 by modification of the chemistry of cement, by the use of wastes, and by adopting more efficient processes. Although cement manufacturing is clearly a very large CO2 emitter, concrete (of which cement makes up about 15%) compares quite favourably with other building systems in this regard.|$|E
2500|$|Sartre {{objected to}} the {{existence}} of God: If existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a pour-soi (a being-for-itself; a consciousness) who is also an en-soi (a being-in-itself; a thing) which is a contradiction in terms. Critics of Sartre rebutted this objection by stating that it rests on a false dichotomy and a misunderstanding of the traditional Christian view of God. Kierkegaard has Judge Vilhelm express the Christian hope this way in Either/Or, Either, “the first” contains promise <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> the forward thrust, the endless impulse. Or, “the first” does not impel the individual; the power which is in the first does not become the impelling power but the repelling power, it becomes that which thrusts away. .... Thus – for the sake of making a little philosophical flourish, not with the pen but with thought-God only once became flesh, and it would be vain to expect this to be repeated.

60|$|All {{that the}} public can expect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> only to be {{sometimes}} warned to beware of Mr. Wood's halfpence; and refer them for conviction to the Drapier's reasons. For, {{a man of the}} most superior understanding, will find it impossible to make the best use of it, while he writes in constraint; perpetually softening, correcting, or blotting out expressions, for fear of bringing his printer, or himself, under a prosecution from my Lord Chief-Justice Whitshed. It calls to my remembrance the madman in Don Quixote, who being soundly beaten by a weaver for letting a stone (which he always carried on his shoulder) fall upon a spaniel, apprehended that every cur he met was of the same species.|$|E
60|$|You may now {{understand}} that the quiet economical citizen of San Francisco who now addresses you, a bonhomme given to cheap living, early to bed though scarce early to rise in proportion (que diable! let us have style, anyway), busied with his little bits of books and essays and with a fair hope <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>is</b> no longer the same desponding, invalid son of a doubt and an apprehension who last wrote to you from Monterey. I am none the less warmly obliged to you and Mrs. Gosse for your good words. I suppose that I am the devil (hearing it so often), but I am not ungrateful. Only please, Weg, do not talk of genius about me; I do not think I want for a certain talent, but I am heartily persuaded I have {{none of the other}} commodity; so let that stick to the wall: you only shame me by such friendly exaggerations.|$|E
6000|$|Thus the Future {{of which}} we spoke at the {{beginning}} has (in England at least) always been the ally of tyranny. The ordinary Englishman has been duped out of his old possessions, such as they were, and always {{in the name of}} progress. The destroyers of the abbeys took away his bread and gave him a stone, assuring him that it was a precious stone, the white pebble of the Lord's elect. They took away his maypole and his original rural life and promised him instead the Golden Age of Peace and Commerce inaugurated at the Crystal Palace. And now they are taking away the little that remains of his dignity as a householder and the head of a family, promising him instead Utopias which are called (appropriately enough) [...] "Anticipations" [...] or [...] "News from Nowhere." [...] We come back, in fact, to the main feature which has already been mentioned. The past is communal: the future must be individualist. In the past are all the evils of democracy, variety and violence and doubt, but the future is pure despotism, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>is</b> pure caprice. Yesterday, I know I was a human fool, but to-morrow I can easily be the Superman.|$|E

60|$|Now first I would ask, is any really {{continuous}} and thorough mental process {{going on at}} all about this war? I mean, is there any considerable {{number of people who}} are seeing it as a whole, taking it in as a whole, trying to get a general idea of it from which they can form directing conclusions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future?</b> <b>Is</b> there any considerable number of people even trying to do that? At any rate let me point out first that there is quite an enormous mass of people who--in spite of the fact that their minds are concentrated on aspects of this war, who are at present hearing, talking, experiencing little else than the war--are nevertheless neither doing nor trying to do anything that deserves to be called thinking about it at all. They may even be suffering quite terribly by it. But they are no more mastering its causes, reasons, conditions, and the possibility of its future prevention than a monkey that has been rescued in a scorching condition from the burning of a house will have mastered the problem of a fire. It is just happening to and about them. It may, for anything they have learnt about it, happen to them again.|$|E
