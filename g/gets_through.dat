5|$|Four months later, Dot is {{released}} and shares her regret with Ian {{that she did}} not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally <b>gets</b> <b>through,</b> he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.|$|E

25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well.

500|$|Appeal to Reason {{also had}} less {{positive}} reception, with most negative reviews criticizing the band's further movement into the mainstream. Entertainment Weekly criticized the album, saying, [...] "Songs like [...] "Re-Education (Through Labor)" [...] and [...] "Entertainment," [...] {{which seeks to}} redress the evils of media manipulation upon the land, are peppy but pretty empty, power-chord downers with little bark or bite." [...] In giving the album five out of ten stars, PopMatters said, [...] "McIlrath rarely reaches beyond his one-note vocal performance despite apparent and commendable earnestness...he never channels the intensity of early-career songs like [...] "Dead Ringer", let alone the intensity of Henry Rollins. The {{other members of the}} band don't fare much better: new lead guitarist Zach Blair, in particular, might have his three-chord attack down to a science, but the formula wears thin by the time the album <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> its first 30 minutes—and after that, there are still 18 to go.

500|$|The game {{is played}} {{over the course of}} a school semester; the first day of school is on April 1.

The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters.

500|$|Carol Buckland of CNN {{considered}} that [...] "Evita {{is basically a}} music video with epic pretensions.

But for all the movie's grand style, it falls short in terms of substance and soul." [...] Newsweeks David Ansen wrote, [...] "It's gorgeous. It's epic. It's spectacular. But two hours later, it also proves to be emotionally impenetrable." [...] Giving the film a C- rating, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly criticized Parker's direction, stating, [...] "Evita could have worked had it been staged as larger-than-life spectacle... The way Alan Parker has directed Evita, however, it's just a sluggish, contradictory mess, a drably [...] "realistic" [...] Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times praised Madonna's performance as well as the costume design and cinematography, but wrote that the film was [...] "breathless and shrill, since Alan Parker's direction shows no signs of a moral or political compass and remains in exhausting overdrive all the time." [...] Jane Horwitz of the Sun-Sentinel stated, [...] "Madonna sings convincingly and <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> the acting, but her performance lacks depth, grace and muscle. Luckily, director Alan Parker's historic-looking production with its epic crowd scenes and sepia-toned newsreels shows her off well." ...|$|E

[...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that [...] "The much talked-about Beyoncé collaboration 'Telephone', which—with its double-time beat and rapid-fire verses—proves {{to be one of the}} most adrenaline-pumped songs that Gaga has yet crafted, the whole thing feeling like it's about to veer of [...] the tracks at any moment simply due to the giddy excitement shared between the two divas, easily turning it into the unquestioned highlight of The Fame Monster".

[...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game plays as a 2D sidescrolling {{platformer}} {{with elements}} of a run and gun game as well.

The whip move also allows the player to grab hold of, and swing from, certain hooks in the game. Some levels have additional requirements beyond merely getting {{to the end of the}} level. For example, the level [...] "For Pete's Sake", involves making sure the computer-controlled Peter Puppy character <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> the level unharmed, which is accomplished by whipping him to make him jump over pits, and defeating enemies before they can damage him.

2500|$|Season six (2001–2002) depicts Buffy's {{struggle}} with depression after her friends, believing she {{was trapped in}} a Hell dimension, performed a spell {{to bring her back}} from the dead; however, she was actually in Heaven, and feels great loss after being ripped out. Forced to take a mundane and degrading job slinging burgers at the Doublemeat Palace after realizing her family were in financial ruin, she sinks into a deep depression amid feelings of self-loathing and spends much of the season on a downward spiral alienating her friends and family and embarking on a violent sexual relationship with the vampire Spike which leaves neither satisfied and spawns dire consequences for the both of them. As the season draws to a close, Buffy is forced to battle her best friend when Willow becomes psychotic with dark magics after the human, Warren (Adam Busch) shoots and kills Willow's girlfriend Tara (Amber Benson) and wounds Buffy in the process. Willow then tries to destroy the world to end all suffering, although Xander <b>gets</b> <b>through</b> to her in the end. Buffy then promises to change her self-destructive behavior in order to be there for her sister. In the final season of the show (2002–2003), things start to come around for Buffy when Principal Robin Wood (D. B. Woodside) hires her as a school counselor for the newly rebuilt Sunnydale High School and she has repaired her relationships with Dawn and her friends. However, she is also confronted with the threat of the First Evil and becomes a reluctant leader to the Potential Slayers, who are initially respectful of her, but become increasingly more alienated by her tactics and decisions throughout the season. She unexpectedly becomes emotionally close with Spike, who has sought out his soul in an effort to prove himself to her. In the show's final episode [...] "Chosen", Buffy shares her power with her fellow Slayers before leading them into an epic battle against an army of Turok-Han vampires. She also confesses her love to a disbelieving Spike before he sacrifices himself to save the world; as he dies, Buffy escapes Sunnydale's destruction with the surviving characters. Following the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the character maintains a presence in the fifth season of Angel (2003–2004), but does not appear onscreen. In the episode [...] "The Girl in Question", Angel and a resurrected Spike travel to Rome to find her, where they learn she is apparently now dating the Immortal. Sarah Michelle Gellar was approached to appear as Buffy in Angels one hundredth episode, but declined, so the character of Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter) was used instead. She was asked to appear in the second to last episode of the series, [...] "Power Play", but had to decline due to outside conflicts.|$|E
