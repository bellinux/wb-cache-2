5|$|By 1883, Gilligan {{had become}} the Grays {{starting}} catcher. Despite breaking <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> missing two weeks in May, Gilligan led the National League in assists as a catcher, while his team {{finished third in the}} NL. He continued his tenure with the Grays the following season. Gilligan played in a career-high 82 games, while also recording career highs in RBI (38), strikeouts (41), and on-base percentage (.325) and leading MLB in defensive games as a catcher (81). After finishing {{at the top of the}} NL, the Grays played in the 1884 World Series against the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. Gilligan went 4–for–9 over the three-game series, with the Grays defeating the Metropolitans three games to none.|$|E
5|$|Hansen scored {{his first}} NHL regular season point on 11 October 2008, an assist on a Ryan Kesler goal against the Calgary Flames. He scored his first NHL goal two games later against goaltender Chris Osgood in a 4–3 win against the Detroit Red Wings. Midway through the season, Hansen was briefly {{sent back to}} Manitoba for the Canucks to make room on the roster for the {{recently}} acquired Mats Sundin. He was, however, recalled within three days. In late-February, he broke <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> was sidelined for 14 games. He completed the season with 21 points in 55 games, ranking 26th in scoring among NHL rookies. In the off-season, he became a restricted free agent before re-signing with the Canucks to a one-year, two-way contract worth a reported US$550,000.|$|E

25|$|Hindlekar toured England in 1936 and 1946 as India's first-choice wicket-keeper. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he {{wore his}} cap at a 'bewildered angle' and 'stood with his toes pointing up at an angle of 45 degrees'. He opened in the First Test at Lord's in 1936, but chipped a bone in <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> suffered from blurred vision. This injury and his subsequent exclusion from the next Test led to the famous opening partnership between Vijay Merchant and Mushtaq Ali.|$|E
25|$|Khawaja was {{selected}} {{as part of the}} 17-man Australian squad for the 2010–11 Ashes series. During the third test, Ricky Ponting fractured <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> Khawaja was named as a stand-by if Ponting could not recover in time. He was subsequently selected in the Australian cricket team to play England in the fifth Test against England in Sydney on 3 January 2011. On 3 January 2011, Khawaja became the 419th Australian to be presented with an Australian Cricket Test baggy green cap. Khawaja became the first Muslim and first Pakistani-born Australian player to play test cricket for Australia, and only the seventh foreign-born cricketer {{to do so in the}} last 80 years.|$|E

25|$|In {{his next}} game, Hobbs badly injured <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> missed the {{remainder}} of the Test series; in three games, he scored 132 runs at an average of 26.40. England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn. Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered from the injury and his scoring was inconsistent, but he still finished the season with 2,114 runs at 40.65. However, nearly half of those runs came in the first month of the season, and he passed 40 only four times in his last 20 innings. Surrey also had a difficult season, falling from third to fifth and losing the services of three players including the amateur Jack Crawford following internal disciplinary issues.|$|E
25|$|Applewhite was {{the backup}} for Simms for the {{entirety}} of the 2001 regular season and Simms led Texas to a #3 ranking and a trip to the Big 12 Championship against #10 Colorado. But in that game Applewhite got the opportunity to go out as a starter and a hero. Because of an upset loss by Florida earlier in the day, Texas went into that game knowing that a win would put them in the BCS Championship Game. But Simms had a disastrous game and was responsible for four turnovers (three interceptions and a fumble) {{in the first half of}} play. Meanwhile, Major was seen attempting to rally the offense before they took to the field, even as the restless Texas fans booed Simms. Two plays later, Simms injured <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> Applewhite entered the game with Texas down 29-10. His second pass was completed for a 79-yard touchdown and he baited the University of Colorado bench in an attempt to rally the Texas fans. He led Texas back to within 2 points, but eventually Texas would come up short losing 39-37 after an onside kick attempt failed.|$|E
500|$|The single's b-side is [...] "Gotta Boogie", {{which was}} co-written by Joe Earley.

500|$|On May 8, 1890, {{southeast}} of Tucson, Arizona Territory, Empire Ranch owner Walter Vail captured {{and thought he}} had killed a Gila monster. He tied it to his saddle and it bit the middle finger {{of his right hand}} and wouldn't let go. A ranch hand pried open the lizard's mouth with a pocketknife, cut open his finger to stimulate bleeding, and then tied saddle strings around <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> wrist. They summoned Dr. John C. Handy of Tucson, who took Vail back to Tucson for treatment, but Vail experienced swollen and bleeding [...] glands in his throat for sometime afterward.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Ross was {{supposed}} to begin the season in the minors for Detroit. However, with Detroit desperate for bullpen help, Ross {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers on April 1 for relief pitcher Steve Colyer. He was assigned to the AAA Las Vegas 51s of the Pacific Coast League, where he was teammates with Jayson Werth and Shane Victorino, whom he went on to face in the 2010 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Injuries marred Ross's 2004 campaign; a knee injury kept him out for two weeks early in the season, he missed time from May 26 to July 15 after smashing his hand in a car door and breaking <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> <b>and</b> he broke his wrist on August 25 which ended his season. In 60 games, he batted [...]273 with 65 hits, 17 doubles, 14 home runs, and 49 RBI. Ross spent most of 2005 with Las Vegas. From July 26 to August 11, he hit 10 home runs and had 25 RBI in 17 games. In 115 games, he batted [...]267 with 105 hits, 21 doubles, 22 home runs, and 63 RBI.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{features}} the titular parody, {{as well as}} three original comedy songs, with music written by Yankovic. In April 1980, Yankovic recorded the first song for the album, [...] "Gotta Boogie". The song, co-written by Joe Earley, is a play on words discussing {{a man with a}} [...] "boogie" [...] on <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> his quandary therein. The second song to be recorded for the EP was [...] "Another One Rides the Bus", on September 14, 1980. Yankovic wrote the song, a parody of Queen's hit [...] "Another One Bites the Dust", and debuted it live on the Dr. Demento Show, hosted by Barret [...] "Dr. Demento" [...] Hansen. While practicing the song outside the sound booth, Yankovic met Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz who told Yankovic he was a drummer. Schwartz agreed to drum on Yankovic's accordion case to keep a steady beat to the song. [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] became so popular that it landed Yankovic a short-lived record deal with TK Records, and also led to his first appearance on a TV show, The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion and Schwartz banged on Yankovic's accordion case and played the bulb horns.|$|E

500|$|The creature's {{nature was}} {{described}} by Walter Gregor, a folklorist {{and one of the}} first members of the Folklore Society, as [...] "useful", [...] "hurtful", or seeking [...] "human companionship"; in some cases, kelpies take their victims into the water, devour them, and throw the entrails to the water's edge. In its equine form the kelpie is able to extend the length of its back to carry many riders together into the depths, a common theme in the tales is of several children clambering onto the creature's back while one remains on the shore. Usually a little boy, he then pets the horse but his hand sticks to its neck. In some variations the lad cuts off his fingers or hand to free himself; he survives but the other children are carried off and drowned, with only some of their entrails being found later. Such a creature said to inhabit Glen Keltney in Perthshire is considered to be a kelpie by 20th-century folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs, but a similar tale also set in Perthshire has an each uisge as the culprit and omits the embellishment of the young boy. The lad does cut his finger off when the event takes place in Thurso, where a water kelpie is identified as the culprit. The same tale set at Sunart in the Highlands gives a specific figure of nine children lost, of whom only the innards of one are recovered. The surviving boy is again saved by cutting off <b>his</b> <b>finger,</b> <b>and</b> the additional information is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the creature responsible to have been a water horse rather than a kelpie, and the tale [...] "obviously a pious fraud to keep children from wandering on Sundays".|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>and</b> hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done little good. [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E
