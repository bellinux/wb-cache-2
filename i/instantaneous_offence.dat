2500|$|On 5 December 2006 Akhtar and Asif were acquitted by the {{tribunal}} appointed to review their appeals against the drugs ban {{imposed on them}} by an earlier committee. After a clear hearing from Akhtar's lawyer Abid Hassan Minto, the three-man committee, headed by Justice Fakhruddin Ebrahim, voted two to one in favour of the acquittal.
