5|$|On June 23, 1998, an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> was {{announced}} in orbit around Gliese876 by two independent teams led by Geoffrey Marcy and Xavier Delfosse. The planet was designated Gliese876b and was detected by Doppler spectroscopy.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> is largely unknown {{because of the}} difficulty in making direct observations of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets.</b> In addition, analogies with planets in the Solar System can apply for few of the <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> known; because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example the hot Jupiters.|$|R
40|$|The known <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> exhibit many {{interesting}} and surprising features—extremely shortperiod orbits, high-eccentricity orbits, mean-motion and secular resonances, etc. —and have dramatically expanded our {{appreciation of the}} diversity of possible planetary systems. In this review we summarize the orbital properties of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets.</b> One of the most remarkable features of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> is their high eccentricities, far larger than seen in the solar system. We review theoretical explanations for large eccentricities and point out the successes and shortcomings of existing theories. Radial-velocity surveys have discovered ∼ 120 <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets,</b> and have provided us with accurate estimates of orbital period P, semimajor axis a, eccentricity e, and the combination M sini of the planetary mass M and orbital inclination i (assuming the stellar masses are known). Understanding the properties and origin of the distribution of masses and orbital elements of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> is important for at least two reasons. First, these data constitute essentially everything we know about <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets.</b> Second, they contain several surprising features, which are inconsistent with the notions of planet formation that we had before <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> were discovered.

5|$|In 2004, a team {{of astronomers}} in Hawaii {{observed}} an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> around the star HD 179949, which appeared to be creating a sunspot {{on the surface of}} its parent star. The team hypothesized that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing its already high 7,760°C temperature by an additional 400°C.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d is an {{exoplanet}} approximately 15 {{light-years away}} in the constellation of Aquarius. The planet was the third planet discovered orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 876. At {{the time of its}} discovery, the planet had the lowest mass of any known <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> apart from the pulsar planets orbiting PSR B1257+12. Due to this low mass, it can be categorized as a super-Earth.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the IAU officially {{released}} a statement to define what constitutes an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> and what constitutes an orbiting star.

40|$|We {{point out}} some {{advantages}} of making observations of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> in linearly polarized (LP) light. Older cool stars have quite low levels (~ 10 ^- 4 to 10 ^- 5) of fractional LP, while <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planets</b> can have relatively high fractional LP (~ 0. 1). Observations in LP light can therefore significantly enhance {{contrast between the}} planet and its parent star. Data on LP {{as a function of}} planetary orbital phase can be used to diagnose the properties (e. g., composition, size, and shape) of the scatterers in the planetary atmosphere.

5|$|WASP-13b is an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> {{that was}} {{discovered}} in 2008 in the orbit of the sunlike star WASP-13. The planet has a mass of nearly half that of Jupiter, but a radius five-fourths the size of Jupiter.

5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> {{designated}} Gliese 876 b. In 2001, further analysis of the star's radial velocity revealed {{the existence of a}} second planet in the system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet, which meant that the radial velocity signature of the second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E

5|$|HD 28185 b is an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> {{approximately}} 138 {{light-years away}} from Earth {{in the constellation}} of Eridanus. The planet was discovered orbiting the Sun-like star HD 28185 in April 2001 {{as a part of}} the CORALIE survey for southern extrasolar planets, and its existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Survey in 2008. HD 28185 b orbits its sun in a circular orbit that is at the inner edge of its star's habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 {{is similar}} to our Sun in terms of mass, radius, and luminosity. The star is on the main {{sequence}} and is generating energy by fusing hydrogen in its core. The spectral type of G5V implies HD 28185 is cooler than the Sun. Like the majority of <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> host stars, HD 28185 is metal-rich relative to the Sun, containing around 173% of the solar abundance of iron. The star rotates slower than the Sun, with a period of around 30 days, compared to 25.4 days for the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 an <b>extrasolar</b> <b>planet</b> {{similar in}} size to Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered in orbit around the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
