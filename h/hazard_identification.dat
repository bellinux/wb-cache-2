5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including <b>hazard</b> <b>identification</b> and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Hazard</b> <b>identification</b> or {{assessment}} {{is an important}} step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are [...] "acceptable risks" [...] in the workplace. A hazard-based program {{may not be able to}} eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept [...] "satisfactory" [...] – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach.|$|E
40|$|The Wenchuan {{earthquake}} triggered many landslides along Province Road 303 (PR 303) in Sichuan Province. These landslide deposits pose hazards to {{the safety}} of the traffic and road facilities under rainfall conditions. Some of the slopes are hard to access as the terrains are steep and high. How to identify the hazards is a challenge to engineers. In this paper, a method for <b>hazards</b> <b>identification</b> is demonstrated for a segment of PR 303 between milestones K 34 + 00 m and K 34 + 200 m. This method consists of three steps. First, identify all possible hazard sources based on field surveys and aerial photographs. Second, analyze past failure events to single out the most likely sources of hazards. Finally, apply numerical reliability analysis to ascertain the sources of hazards. Results of the case study show that the proposed method is effective for <b>hazards</b> <b>identification</b> in inaccessible terrains. © 2011 ASCE...|$|R

This research was aimed at analysing the risk from related pollutant for people who live or work in the vicinity of industries. This research consists of four steps i. e <b>hazard</b> <b>identifications,</b> exposure assessment, toxicity assessment, and risk characterization. Four locations had been selected for field sampling. <b>Hazard</b> <b>identifications</b> to dust (TSP) concentration was mirrored to ambient air standard that maximal concentration for the TSP is 230 μg/m 3. On exposure assessment the TSP concentration in PT. IGYS, Ngepos II street, Sugriwo II street and Krapyak complex exceed ambient air standard (SK. Gub. Jateng No. 08 / 2001). Toxicity assessment revealed that TSP intake in all place was safe since the calculated intake were still under maximal intake 0, 0452 mg/kg. day. Based on risk characterization result, it can be concluded that level of risk in all places was less than unity (< 1) so it implies that in those area was safe for daily activities in specified time with respect to dust (TSP). However the relative high risk was pointed out to the Krapyak complex and the lowest risk was in Ngepos II street...|$|R
