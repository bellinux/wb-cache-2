Yankovic's on-stage wardrobe changed dramatically during the tour, and he specifically stipulated that every promoter [...] "had to supply one garish Hawaiian shirt" [...] for him to wear. Yankovic eventually acquired [...] "a couple closets full" [...] of them. Yankovic also started wearing exclusively Vans, and joked that [...] "whenever <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> they let me go to their warehouse and take home an armload." ...|$|E

Her vocals throughout the song have been described as a shouty sing-speak style.

5000|$|Bogdanovich {{was going}} to direct Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastrioanni in Saturday Sunday Monday but the film was delayed so he did this instead.

60|$|But I did {{go back in}} 1915. Long ago on my lonely desert trips I {{learned the}} value of companions and I dreaded the strain of this swordfishing game. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> one to help lessen it. Besides that, <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> {{snapshot}} pictures of leaping swordfish, and {{it was obvious that}} Captain Dan and I would have our hands full when a fish got hooked. We had music, books, magazines--everything that could be thought of.|$|R
500|$|Musically, Animal {{is of the}} dance-pop and electro-pop genres, while {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} electro in its production and beats. Kesha's vocals uses Auto-Tune and vocoders to alter her voice and includes samples. David Jeffries of AllMusic noted that the album lyrically revolves around avoiding reality with a preference for a [...] "garbage chic" [...] life, with lyrics such as [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> rehab, or maybe just need some sleep" [...] from the opening song [...] "Your Love Is My Drug". Lyrically, {{the majority of the}} album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having a good time. [...] "Your Love Is My Drug" [...] is a dance song that is layered with a heavy electronic backdrop. Her vocals throughout the song have been described as a shouty sing-speak style. Musically, the song uses a simple, upbeat lyric line. On [...] "Tik Tok" [...] Kesha uses a spoken word rap style on the verses while the chorus is sung.

500|$|Chicago Sun-Times praised West's vocal delivery, saying [...] "he rips more hard raps on 'Devil in a New Dress' -- chuckling through lines like, 'We love Jesus / but {{you done}} {{learned a lot}} from Satan / We ain't married / but tonight <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> consummation,' and later chewing through an {{impersonation}} of a preacher, 'Say-tan! Say-tan! Say-tan!'—all over a fluttery, high, quiet-storm soul vocal that's part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer." [...] MTV stated [...] "West's breezy GOOD Fridays release gets a wintertime tune-up with Ross riding shotgun. The Miami Don's majestic contribution comes with a revamped breakdown setting up his slick boats. Still, Yeezy's verse holds up over the Boss's even with the refinement." [...] Dan Vidal of URB stated Ross brought his best to the track, writing that he [...] "steps his tired old coke-rhymes up to intense lyrical portraits on the final version of 'Devil In A New Dress'." [...] Stereogum's Amrit Singh described the production style as a throwback to vintage hip-hop beats, and praised West's extended use of metaphors on the track. AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer cited the track as an example of West's [...] "penchant for soul", calling the track excellent. AllMusic's Andy Kellman also described the beat as a [...] "throwback soul production", writing that it was [...] "provided by the Smokey Robinson-sampling Bink, it’s as gorgeous as any of West’s own early work, yet it’s marred by an aimless instrumental stretch, roughly 90 seconds in length, that involves some incongruent electric guitar flame-out." ...|$|E
500|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the race; two 90 minute sessions on Friday and one lasting {{an hour on}} Saturday. Nico Rosberg was the fastest driver in the first practice session, ahead of Alonso and Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher. Vettel caused the session to be suspended after crashing into the circuit's [...] "Wall of Champions" [...] on the last corner, heavily damaging his car. After the morning session Sergio Pérez, who had suffered from concussion after a crash at the previous race, withdrew from the Grand Prix. Although he had passed the FIA's medical examination, Perez said that [...] "I only want to drive when I'm a hundred per cent well. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> more time to recover". He was replaced by McLaren's reserve driver Pedro de la Rosa, who had competed for Sauber in [...] Alonso was fastest in the second session, ahead of Vettel, Massa and Hamilton – [...] although the McLaren driver received a puncture midway through practice. The session was disrupted by incidents as Kamui Kobayashi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio struck the barriers – both accidents requiring a suspension as marshals cleared the track of debris – and Adrian Sutil's Force India broke its suspension in a crash at turn 7. The third session on Saturday morning saw Vettel fastest, ahead of Alonso, Rosberg and Massa. A KERS failure on Mark Webber's RB7 prevented him from participating. A crash by de la Rosa {{in the final minute}} brought out a red flag, and the session was prematurely ended due to the limited time remaining.|$|E
60|$|And {{the story}} about George Washington and his little hatchet has also been {{suggested}} to me in these letters--in a fugitive way, as if <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> of George Washington and his hatchet in my constitution.

40|$|Years ago I was set {{to spend}} a full weekend in my apartment, as it was {{forecast}} to snow outside. I decided that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> good reading to keep me company. I had heard of something called The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (1979), {{which was supposed to}} be clever and funny. It was, and I’ve never traveled without a towel since. [...] ...|$|R
60|$|When I woke, {{a little}} light was {{stealing}} into the room through the blinds of my shutters. I quickly slipped out of bed, opened a window, and looked out. Day was just breaking, the rain and wind had ceased, and I could discern objects. But {{it seemed as if}} <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> light in my brain to enable me to comprehend what I saw. My eyes fell upon nothing familiar.|$|R
500|$|Musically, [...] "Creep" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in the key of C minor with Watkins and Thomas' vocals ranging from the chords of C4 to F5. [...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only cause <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just keep it on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E
500|$|... "Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>some</b> air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your lips together and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus {{a number of things that}} give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ All the things I try to hide." ...|$|E

5000|$|I told B <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> socks too and {{at least}} 30 pairs of Jockey shorts. He {{suggested}} I switch to Italian-style briefs, {{the ones with the}} T-shaped crotch that tends to build you up. I told him I'd tried them once, in Rome, the day I was walking through a Liz Taylor movie - and I didn't like them because they made me too self-aware. It gave me the feeling girls must have when they wear uplift bras.|$|R
60|$|Next {{came the}} job of lassoing the monster's tail. Here I shone, for I had lassoed mountain-lions with Buffalo Jones, and I was {{efficient}} and quick. Captain Dan and I were unable to haul the fish on board, {{and we had to}} get out the block and tackle and lift the tail on deck, secure that, and then pull up the head from the other side. After that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>some</b> kind of tackle to hold me up.|$|R
