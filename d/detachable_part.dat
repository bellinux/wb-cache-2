I want to tell of something more general than that. This misadventure is in our strain. It is our inheritance. It is a possibility in the inheritance of all honest and emotional men and women. There are no doubt people altogether cynical and adventurous to whom these passions and desires are at once controllable and permissible indulgences without any radiation of consequences, a secret and <b>detachable</b> <b>part</b> of life, {{and there may be}} people of convictions so strong and simple that these disturbances are eliminated, but we Strattons are of a quality neither so low nor so high, we stoop and rise, we are not convinced about our standards, and for many generations to come, with us and with such people as the Christians, and indeed with most of our sort of people, we shall be equally desirous of free and intimate friendship and prone to blaze into passion and disaster at that proximity.|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this paper, I examine {{the charge that}} Gopnik and Meltzoff’s ‘Child as Scientist’ program, {{outlined}} and defended in their 1997 book Words, Thoughts and Theories is vitiated by a form of ‘cognitive individualism’ about science. Although this charge has often been leveled at Gopnik and Meltzoff’s work, it has rarely been developed in any detail. I suggest that we should distinguish between two forms of cognitive individualism which I refer to as ‘ontic’ and ‘epistemic’ cognitive individualism (OCI and ECI respectively). I then argue - contra Ronald Giere – that Gopnik and Meltzoff’s commitment to OCI is relatively unproblematic, since it is an easily <b>detachable</b> <b>part</b> of their view. By contrast, and despite their explicit discussion of the issue, their commitment to ECI is much more problematic...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores a {{range of}} {{perspectives}} on people-first language, considering how the taxonomical prescriptivism in policy since the early 1990 s locates disability as a <b>detachable</b> <b>part</b> of an individual. I attend both to some activists’ championing of this linguistic turn for its recognition of personhood outside impairment and to the charge within disability studies that it restricts the conceptual domain of disability to physical impairment. Moreover, I examine how people-first language is both the product of prescriptive policy documents {{as well as a}} contributing factor in future policy – determining, for instance, whether disability initiatives are intended to focus on physical rehabilitation or improved accessibility. Lastly, I turn to recent work in sociolinguistics on political correctness and people-first language, positioning it against various approaches to the ethical valence of such linguistic modifications, and their potential to remake social realities. My purpose in tracing the status of people-first language in this multitude of discursive venues is to consider {{the extent to which it}} determines how disability is conceptualized and consequently realized in more practical settings...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} focus {{the study of}} the colour on tornament on {{relevant}} competitions of the two Portuguese Pritzker winner architects – Álvaro Siza Vieira and Eduardo Souto de Moura– and will try to propose a reading on its use and description. Ornament has radically changed on {{the course of the last}} centuries and is now understood as a new question of meaning and communication. It is now embed in the very condition of architecture and not imposed on architecture. We cannot longer find ornament as a <b>detachable</b> <b>part</b> of the building or autonomously but in the meaning the building intends to deliver as a whole. Competitions have gained importance as procurement and as on-going research for architects. As ornament communicates and gives meaning and it is a relevant tool for the rhetoric put into use at competitions. Transmitting, decoding and understanding the very nature of the project is essential to winning a competition. Álvaro Siza Vieira in 1992 and nineteen years after Eduardo Souto de Moura have been distinguished by their work. There is a common ground of understandings of shared histories and complicities between them. Although quite different in their work they have the same fundamental ethical position of professional practice and share the same genetic code so often attributed to Portuguese architects of context, social responsibility and fierce attention to detail. It is proposed that ornament is part of their work, despite the current association with a clean, aseptic and white South European architecture...|$|E

50|$|Proper {{handling}} {{techniques are}} essential to protect specimens from damage. Conservators will inspect taxidermy specimens for signs of weakness or <b>detachable</b> <b>parts</b> before moving the object. It is important for anyone handling taxidermy to remove jewelry, such as watches, rings, or bracelets, that may scratch or snag parts of the specimen. If the taxidermy specimen is mounted on a base or in a tray, it is preferred to only handle the base or tray while moving the object, rather than the specimen itself. Conservators will also use a secondary support, such as padding, to support the taxidermy specimen while in transit. Wearing nitrile gloves while handling specimens will help prevent oil and perspiration transfer.|$|R

5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with <b>detachable</b> <b>parts</b> from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|R
40|$|Ever since historiographers {{invented the}} period {{known as the}} Renaissance {{in the middle of}} the last century, studies of the age have been preoccupied with the individual. In recent years, however, there has been an {{increasing}} amount of scholarly interest in the objects of the early modern period—its material culture. This dissertation situates itself on the border between these two areas of research, examining a group of <b>detachable</b> <b>parts</b> which are prominent in the literature and culture of the Renaissance but which do not fit neatly into the categories of subject and object: beards, hair, codpieces; and handkerchiefs. Each chapter focuses on one of these “prostheses”, analyzing the way in which it worked to fashion early modern gendered and erotic identities. ^ Chapter One argues that the facial hair was a primary way in which masculinity was materialized in the Renaissance. Chapter Two focuses on the hair of the head, demonstrating that it too was crucial, and that it constituted not only gendered identities, but also the political identities that emerged during the English Civil War (Roundheads and Cavaliers). Moreover, this chapter examines how these meanings of hair were mediated by Milton 2 ̆ 7 s Samson Agonistes. ^ The last two chapters move from “auxiliary organs” which we tend to see as parts of the body to those which we tend to see as objects attached to the body. Chapter three concentrates on the codpiece, analyzing the paradox of viewing this part as both an essential element of manhood and, at the same time, an empty signifier. Finally, the fourth chapter focuses on the handkerchief, a “prosthesis” which first appeared—or at least came into widespread use—during the early modern period. It demonstrates how this article served as a nodal point for a series of strategic maneuvers regarding the regulation and production of female sexuality, and how these concerns were both registered and rearticulated by the “napkins” in Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Othello and Cymbeline. ^ In suggesting that these <b>detachable</b> <b>parts</b> had the ability to deeply make a person, this dissertation seeks to problematize one of our most basic notions about subjectivity and identity. Going back at least as far as Descartes, the individual has been conceptualized as an entity which is, first and foremost, individual (in the sense of “indivisible”). Indeed, the Renaissance is often imagined as the age which witnessed the birth of this unified individual. Against these ideas, I argue that at the very moment in which this unified subject was supposedly coming to stand on its own two feet over and against the world of things, that subject was and remained a “prosthetic god”. ...|$|R

After Ludo howls and summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, Didymus joins the group (Her three new friends are just like some of the toys in her room). After the group gets hungry, Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and begins to lose her memories. She has a dream where Jareth comes to her at a masquerade ball, proclaiming his love for her, but she begins to remember and escapes, falling into a junkyard. After an old Junk Lady fails to brainwash her and her memory is jogged, she is rescued by Ludo and Didymus, and they are right outside Goblin City near Jareth's castle. They are confronted by the gate guard, but Hoggle bravely comes to their rescue. Despite his feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and they enter the city together.|$|R

Algorithms ensure orderly operation of engineers {{in the development of}} new or upgrading old processes, and may also be useful for students enrolled in the specialty "Mechanical Engineering". The use of modern tools is effective on both new and old equipment. Correctly chosen tool make it possible for you to quickly recoup the cost of new equipment and significantly improve the work of the old equipment. Currently, all cutting tools can be divided into the following groups: a) a solid; b) composite; c) assembly; d) modular (dial-up). In composite cutting tools and parts theholders are attached permanently. For example, the attachment can be blocked by welding or soldering. At modular and modular cutting tools and <b>parts</b> are <b>detachable.</b> In those <b>parts</b> of the modular tool there are separate assembly units (modules) with standardized mounting surface.
