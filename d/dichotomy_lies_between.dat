40|$|Recent {{writings}} on Asian urbanization have stressed how the continuing outward {{expansion of the}} largest metropolitan regions has been eroding the long-standing distinction between rural and urban, particularly in terms of land use and economic structure. In this paper I examine the cultural implications of this phenomenon by looking at recent changes in the extended metropolitan region of Jakarta, Indonesia. Over {{the course of the}} 1980 s, urbanization trends in Jakarta's periphery have resulted in a greatly expanded interface between urban and rural components of Indonesian society. Although this has created the opportunity for much broader popular participation in the urban economy, it may also be fostering a new perception within Indonesian society [...] that the primary social <b>dichotomy</b> <b>lies</b> not <b>between</b> the city and the countryside but between socioeconomic classes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{conditioned}} taste aversion (CTA) {{threshold for}} either citric acid (CA) or HCl solutions and the two-bottle taste preference (TBP) threshold were determined in rats that are familiarized to {{the odor of}} conditioning solutions or that are naive. The CTA method appeared {{to be more sensitive}} than the TBP test, particularly when rats were not familiarized to the odor of the conditioning solution. The CTA threshold for HCl-conditioned rats and familiarized to the odor of conditioning solution <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 1. 00 and 2. 00 mmol; in unconditioned rats, it <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 4. 00 and 5. 00 mmol. In CA-conditioned and odor-familiarized rats, the threshold <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 09 and 0. 20 mmol; in unconditioned rats, it <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 7. 00 and 10. 00 mmol. In rats not familiarized to the odor of the conditioning solution, the threshold for HCl-conditioned rats <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 90 and 1. 00 mmol; in unconditioned rats, it <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 2. 00 and 3. 00 mmol. In CA-conditioned rats, the CTA threshold <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 03 and 0. 05 mmol; in unconditioned rats, it <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 4. 00 and 7. 00 mmol. The two-bottle test is less sensitive than the CTA method. The TBP threshold <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> HCl 4. 00 and 5. 00 mmol, and between CA 4. 00 and 7. 00 mmol. The odor of a solution may potentiate the ability of rats to detect the concentration of CA and HCl solutions...|$|R

Based on the REE chemistry, the characteristics of Devonian and its significance to mineralization were discussed. The total REE content has a large variation (being 2. 9 to 318. 77), LREE <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 2. 26 to 298. 13, HREE <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 64 to 20. 64, the ration of LREE/HREE <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 3. 53 to 14. 44, LaN/YbN <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 47 to 3. 18, δEu <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 27 to 7. 69, δCe <b>lies</b> <b>between</b> 0. 52 to 1. 01 (the average value being 0. 71).
