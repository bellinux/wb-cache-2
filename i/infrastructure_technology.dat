40|$|We {{develop an}} {{adoption}} model of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>technologies</b> and test it with survey {{data collected from}} companies in six industries in South Korea (hereafter: Korea).

The adoption of IPv 6 in Korea is mostly driven by a governmental strategy that created user demand, and normative pressure. IPv 6 adoption in Korea is also driven by perceived resource concentration and power due to the uneven allocation of IPv 4 addresses. Conversely, killer applications, technical sponsorship and financial factors had no influence on the adoption decision by Korean companies. Taken together, the findings of our explorative study suggest the need to consider technical as well as social and policy factors to understand the adoption dynamics of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>technologies.</b> Technology adoption Government policy Internet standards Resource concentration Normative pressure Korea...|$|R
