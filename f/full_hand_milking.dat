40|$|A {{total of}} 200 Murrah buffaloes were {{utilized}} {{for the study}} with 100 buffaloes in each group of machine and <b>hand</b> <b>milking.</b> The milk yield and milk flow parameters were recorded in both machine <b>milked</b> and <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> groups during the evening milking. The average milk yield in machine milked buffaloes (3. 62 ± 0. 08 kg) was higher when compared to <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> buffaloes (3. 51 ± 0. 08 kg) but {{the difference was not}} significant. The fat percent in the <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> buffaloes (6. 57 ± 0. 09) was significantly higher than that of machine milked buffaloes (6. 01 ± 0. 081) while the SNF % was more in the milk obtained through machine. The average total milking time in case of machine milking was significantly (P < 0. 05) less than that of <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> (5. 32 vs 5. 60 min) while the average letting down time was almost similar in both the groups. The stripping time was higher in <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> (1. 30 min) while the strip yield (0. 24 ± 0. 01 kg) and average flow rate (0. 68 ± 0. 01 kg/min) were higher in machine milking.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for mastitis of cattle and the mean lactation number at which mastitis is more frequent. A retrospective based study was carried out in Khartoum and White Nile States in two farms, designated as Farm A and Farm B. Farm A practiced <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> twice daily; while Farm B used mainly machine <b>milking,</b> (with <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> to lesser extent) three times a day. A convenient sample of 94 lactating cows in Farm A and 690 lactating cows in Farm B was used for this study. A four years period data (2005 - 2008) were collected for FarmA and two years period data (2007 - 2008) for Farm B from health (mastitis), production and reproduction records. The data collected included number ofmastitis cases per day, lactation number, daily milk production in litres, number of lactating cows and type of milking used, including risk factors related to hygienic measures and management practices. These data were analyzed using SPSS software programme. The results revealed that there was a high prevalence of mastitis throughout the study area (34. 4 % inFarm A and 38. 9 % in Farm B). Lack of appropriate hygienic measures and management practices were reflected in the high prevalenceof mastitis inthe study area. viii The mean lactation numbers at which mastitis was more frequent were the third and second. To indicate which of the milking techniques (machine and <b>hand</b> <b>milking)</b> is a risk factor for bovine mastitis, odds ratiowas calculated using a 2 X 2 table. The odds ratio of 1. 3 indicates that <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> is a risk factor for bovine mastitis,meaning that cows which are <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> are 1. 3 times more likely to get mastitis than those milked with machine. Accordingly, it may be recommended that special care must be directed towards cows at the third and the second lactations; and where <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> is practiced, application of rigorous hygienic measures should be considere...|$|R

In {{the present study}} 84 lactating Galla goats on a Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay basal diet and supplemented with 500 g (as is) of a concentrate diet constituting of poultry litter (0, 15, 30 or 45 %) were used to compare milk yield estimates using two methods. Milking method 1 involved <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> first followed by kid suckling of residual milk while method 2 involved a reversal of this procedure where the kids first suckled to their satisfaction followed by <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> of residual milk. The total milk yield was estimated as the total of the <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> and suckled milk; the kids milk intake was estimated by the weigh-suckle-weigh method. The goats were milked weekly on two consecutive days. On the first day the milking method I was used both {{in the morning and}} in the evening while method 2 was used on the second day. The total daily milk yield was then estimated as the total milk yield obtained in the morning and in the evening. The total daily milk yield estimates with both milking methods were not significantly (P> 0. 05) different. However, whatever the milking method used, the amount of milk consumed by the kid was higher than that obtained by hand stripping...|$|R

Ewes of groups A and B were <b>hand</b> <b>milked</b> twice daily during the following 9 days. Ewes of groups C and D were dried off by reducing the milking frequency. They were milked on days 5, 8 and 12. In groups B and D, bromocryptin (1 ml of 1 g/l ethanol 50 %) was injected intramuscularly twice daily while control ewes (groups A and C) received 1 ml ethanol 50 %.

25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by <b>hand</b> <b>milking.</b> These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting <b>milk,</b> <b>hand</b> <b>milking</b> was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|R
