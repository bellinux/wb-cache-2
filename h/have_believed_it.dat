She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had said to me that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E

500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology. Christman told Morning Edition: [...] "It feels like we've been out in this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, {{and all of a}} sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..." [...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've never seen anything like that before. This is incredible. I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> if I didn't see it on a Web cam." ...|$|E
500|$|For Thriller 25, The Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am remixed the {{demo version}} of [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)". The singer commented on Jackson and the project, [...] "You always just dream of meeting him, let alone working with him. I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it.</b> I {{grew up in}} the {{projects}} in East Los Angeles and Thriller was filmed about two blocks from my house, but my mother was really strict and she wouldn't {{let me go to the}} factories—she didn't care who was filming a video there; but I'm on the 25th anniversary, 25 years later—that's pretty awesome." [...] Entitled [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing) 2008", the remix was well received by Rolling Stone. The publication described the track, along with [...] "The Girl Is Mine 2008", as being one of the best songs on the album. They noted that will.i.am [...] "updates the songs' original sound to make them dancefloor-worthy twenty-five years after their release".|$|E
500|$|While the Emir vacillated, {{the mission}} found a more {{sympathetic}} and ready {{audience in the}} Emir's brother, Prime Minister Nasrullah Khan, and the Emir's younger son, Amanullah Khan. Nasrullah Khan had been present at the first meeting at Paghman. In secret meetings with the [...] "Amanullah party" [...] at his residence, he encouraged the mission. Amanullah Khan gave the group reasons to feel confident, even as rumours of these meetings reached the Emir. Messages from von Hentig to Prince Henry, [...] intercepted by British and Russian intelligence, were subsequently passed on to Emir Habibullah. These suggested that to draw Afghanistan into the war, von Hentig was prepared to organise [...] "internal revulsions" [...] in Afghanistan if necessary. Habibullah found these reports concerning, and discouraged expedition members from meeting with his sons except in his presence. All of Afghanistan's immediate preceding rulers save Habibullah's father had died of unnatural causes. The fact that his immediate relatives were pro-German, while he was allied with Britain, gave him justifiable grounds to fear for his safety and his kingdom. Von Hentig described one audience with Habibullah where von Hentig set off his pocket alarm clock. The action, designed to impress Habibullah, instead frightened him; he may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was a bomb about to go off. Despite von Hentig's reassurances and explanations, the meeting was a short one.|$|E

2500|$|Reports of an {{attempted}} fording {{of the river}} at Medicine Tail Coulee might explain Custer's purpose for Reno's attack, that is, a coordinated [...] "hammer-and-anvil" [...] maneuver, with Reno's holding the Indians at bay {{at the southern end}} of the camp, while Custer drove them against Reno's line from the north. Other historians have noted that if Custer did attempt to cross the river near Medicine Tail Coulee, he may <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was the north end of the Indian camp, although it was only the middle. Some Indian accounts, however, place the Northern Cheyenne encampment and the north end of the overall village to the left (and south) of the opposite side of the crossing. The precise location of the north end of the village remains in dispute, however.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse {{corresponded with}} a Carmelite mission {{in what was}} then French Indochina and was invited to join them, but, because of her sickness, could not travel. As a result of tuberculosis, she {{suffered}} terribly. When she was near death, [...] "Her physical suffering kept increasing so that even the doctor himself was driven to exclaim, [...] "Ah! If you only knew what this young nun was suffering!" [...] During the last hours of Thérèse's life, she said, [...] "I would never <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> was possible to suffer so much, never, never!" [...] In July 1897, she made a final move to the monastery infirmary. On August 19, 1897, she received her last communion. She died on 30 September 1897, aged 24. On her death-bed, she is reported to have said, [...] "I have reached the point {{of not being able to}} suffer any more, because all suffering is sweet to me." [...] Her last words were, [...] "My God, I love you!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Also on 24 July, after Berchtold {{met with}} the Russian chargé d'affaires, furious {{complaints}} were prompted from Berlin, warning that Austria should not engage in talks with any other powers in case a compromise might be worked out. That same day, Wilhelm wrote on the margin of a dispatch from Count Tschirschky, calling Austria-Hungary [...] "weak" [...] for not being aggressive enough in the Balkans, and writing that alteration in the power in the Balkans [...] "has got to come. Austria must become predominant in the Balkans {{as compared to the}} little ones, and at Russia’s expense." [...] Count Szögyény reported to Vienna that [...] "here, it is generally taken for granted that if Serbia rejects our demands, we shall at once reply by declaring war, and opening military operations. We are advised... to confront the world with a fait accompli (emphasis in the original)." [...] When the German ambassador in Belgrade reported how sad the Serbian people were with being faced with the choice of either war or national humiliation, Wilhelm wrote on the margins of the report: [...] "Bravo! One would not <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> of the Viennese!... How hollow the whole Serbian power is proving itself to be; thus, it is seen to be with all the Slav nations! Just tread hard on the heels of that rabble!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Dobre {{sees the}} strike as a [...] "prelude" [...] {{to the events}} of December 1989. To be sure, the {{movement}} helped break down the myth of unity between the Communist Party and the working class, something that Solidarity would continue in Poland a few years later. In a country labouring under hardline Communism, the strike offered a brief opportunity for an exercise in democracy: for almost three days, miners demanded and protested before a microphone; they spoke freely, none were excluded and no censorship was imposed. Those investigating the miners who had been arrested perceived the strike as an [...] "uprising", frequently using this term during interrogations. This term had significant implications as the miners were part of a social class until then supposed to be an ally of the party, and the apparent break with workers frightened the leadership boded ill for the regime, which could depend even less upon the peasants (then being forced into agricultural cooperatives) or the intellectual élite (part of which at the time was chafing under the rise of Protochronism heralded six years earlier by the July Theses). Ceaușescu himself appeared stricken; as his near-fainting episode indicates, he was not prepared for the outbreak of dissent and had seen that the regime was not as stable as he might <b>have</b> <b>believed.</b> <b>It</b> was, Verdeț said, [...] "the first self-abasement of Ceaușescu's political career." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never <b>have</b> <b>believed</b> <b>it</b> refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit {{that one of the reasons}} I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E
