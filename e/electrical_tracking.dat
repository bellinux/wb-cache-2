Here, formulations with aluminium diethyl phosphinate meet the glow wire ignition test (GWIT) [...] at 775 °C and the glow wire flammability test (GWFI) at 960 °C. Another important criterion in E&E applications is the Comparative Tracking Index (CTI), which determines the risk of <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> of insulating material that is exposed to contaminating environments and surface conditions. With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low smoke density which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E
50|$|In the {{presence}} of water, a diffuse, partially conductive 3D plume-like structure, called a water tree, may form within the polyethylene dielectric used in buried or water-immersed high voltage cables. The plume is known to consist of a dense network of extremely small water-filled channels which are defined by the native crystalline structure of the polymer. Individual channels are extremely difficult to see using optical magnification, so their study usually requires using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Water trees begin as a microscopic region near a defect. They then grow under the continued presence of a high electrical field and water. Water trees may eventually grow {{to the point where}} they bridge the outer ground layer to the center high voltage conductor, at which point the stress redistributes across the insulation. Water trees are not generally a reliability concern unless they are able to initiate an electrical tree. Another type of tree-like structure can form with or without {{the presence}} of water is called an electrical tree. It also forms within a polyethylene dielectric (as well as many other solid dielectrics). Electrical trees also originate where bulk or surface stress enhancements initiate dielectric breakdown in a small region of the insulation. This permanently damages the insulating material in that region. Further tree growth then occurs through as additional small electrical breakdown events (called partial discharges). Electrical tree growth may be accelerated by rapid voltage changes, such as utility switching operations. Also, cables injected with high voltage DC may also develop electrical trees over time as electrical charges migrate into the dielectric nearest the HV conductor. The region of injected charge (called a space charge) amplifies the electrical field in the dielectric, stimulating further stress enhancement and the initiation of electrical trees as the site of pre-existing stress enhancements. Since the electrical tree itself is typically partially conducting, its presence also increases the electrical stress in the region between the tree and the opposite conductor. Unlike water trees, the individual channels of electrical trees are larger and more easily seen.Treeing has been a long-term failure mechanism for buried polymer-insulated high voltage power cables, first reported in 1969. In a similar fashion, 2D trees can occur along the surface of a highly stressed dielectric, or across a dielectric surface that has been contaminated by dust or mineral salts. Over time, these partially conductive trails can grow until they cause complete failure of the dielectric. <b>Electrical</b> <b>tracking,</b> sometimes called dry banding, is a typical failure mechanism for electrical power insulators that are subjected to salt spray contamination along coastlines. The branching 2D and 3D patterns are sometimes called Lichtenberg figures.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} More Electric Aircraft, where is {{to utilize the}} {{electrical}} power to drive more or all aircraft subsystem instead of conventional combination of pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical and electrical power, can be recalled to World War II. It has been proven to have more advantages for decades in terms of energy efficiency, environmental issues, logistics and operational maintenance. It can also enhance aircraft weight, volume and battle damage reconfigurability. Thanks to the new electronics technologies {{and the emergence of}} new materials, It becomes feasible for high power density electrical power components to drive the majority of aircraft subsystem. However, sustaining the transmission of hundreds of kilowatts of electrical power at low voltages is not feasible owing to the penalties incurred due to high cable weights and voltage drop may become critical. It is very easy {{to come up with the}} solution of the increase of voltage. However, higher voltage will introduce other problems such as the reliability of insulation coordination on the aircraft due to the increased probability of electrical discharge. For aircraft designers, it is very important to understand the rules of insulation coordination on the aircraft including determining clearance and creepage distances, and also have a clear investigation of the phenomena and mechanism of electrical discharges. Past research has identified a number of the concerns of operating electrical systems at higher voltages in an aerospace environment, especially for dimensioning of clearances. However, there is little study on dimensioning of creepage distances and relevantly flashover and <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> on solid insulating material surfaces. This thesis firstly discusses the rules for determining clearances and creepage distances. The experimental validation work was done for breakdown in air gap and on the solid insulating material surfaces under dry condition so that some standard recommended values can be evaluated not only with theoretical values such Paschen's law. Suggestions of application of those standards were provided. Secondly, the complex electrical discharge under wet condition on solid insulating material surfaces was discussed. A mathematical model to predict this type of electrical failure -electrical tracking (the electrical discharges on solid insulation materials which will lead to physical damage in the materials) with the consideration of different environmental conditions including air pressure, ambient temperature, and pollution degrees was developed. A series of <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> tests were carried out on organic materials to find out the mechanism of <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> and validate the finding by the mathematic model.

40|$|Polymeric nanocomposites {{are widely}} used for high voltage outdoor {{insulating}} application due to their efficient electrical performance. Recently, SiO 2, TiO 2 and MMT nanofillers are used as fillers because there are listed as the main nanofiller commonly used in electrical engineering due to the increases of effective activation energy. Natural rubber (NR) is used because {{the nature of the}} interphase is found to affect viscoelasticity and it develops several interphases with the Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) matrix. This thesis presents the outcome of an experimental study which has been carried out to determine the conductivity level and dielectric response function of the LLDPE-NR compound, filled with different amount of SiO 2, TiO 2 and MMT nanofillers using Polarization and Depolarization Current (PDC) measurement technique. LLDPE and NR with the ratio composition of 80 : 20 were selected as a base polymer. The PDC testing was done on samples at various conditions: without any defect (normal condition), wet condition (moisture absorption) and after <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> effect condition based on BS EN 60587 : 2007 standards. One of the problems associated with outdoor polymeric insulators is the tracking of the surface which can directly influence the reliability of the insulator. The amount of water content can be used to monitor the dielectric quality of insulation and as an indicator of possible deterioration for outdoor degradation. Besides PDC, surface morphology analysis using FESEM was also conducted to study the changes in physical structure which can explain the conductivity and response function. This research found that an addition of certain weight percentage of nanofiller and NR into the LLDPE improved conductivity level of the insulator.

40|$|Animals must sense their {{surroundings}} to update their internal {{representations of the}} external environment, and exploratory behaviours such as sensory sampling are influenced by past experiences. This thesis investigates how voluntary sensory sampling activities undergo learning-dependent changes. Studies of freely behaving animals impose two major challenges: 1) the accuracy of biological measurements is compromised by movement-induced artifacts, and 2) large degrees of freedom in unrestrained behaviours confound well-controlled studies. Pulse-type weakly electric fish (WEF) are an ideal choice to study adaptive sensory sampling from unrestrained animals, since they generate readily observable and quantifiable sensory capture events expressed by discrete pulses of electric organ discharges (EODs). To study the voluntarily movements and sensory sampling while animals navigated in darkness, we developed three novel experimental techniques to track movements and detect sensory sampling from a freely behaving WEF: 1) an EOD detector to remotely and accurately measure the sensory sampling rate, 2) an <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> method to track multiple WEF using their own EODs, and 3) visual tracking algorithm for robust body tracking through water under infrared illumination. These techniques were successfully applied to reveal novel sensory sampling behaviours in freely exploring Gymnotus sp.

Next, we tested whether these animals can be trained to learn a location of food using electrically detectable landmarks and, if so, whether they can use their past experiences to optimize their sensory sampling. We found that animals revisited the missing food location with high spatial accuracy, and they intensified their sensory sampling near the expected food location by increasing the number of EOD pulses per unit distance travelled...|$|E
40|$|The current thrust {{towards the}} {{compaction}} of electrical power equipment, resulting in increased insulation electrical stress levels, necessitates new electrical insulating materials. In {{the last few}} decades, polymeric materials that exhibit light weight, excellent mechanical properties, low cost, and some with unique non-wetting surface characteristics, have surpassed {{the use of the}} conventional porcelain and glass insulating materials. Despite these advantages, polymeric materials are incapable of withstanding the high heat from surface arcing that is instigated by the synergism of pollution, moisture, and voltage. Surface arcing results in material loss due to heat ablation and/or the <b>electrical</b> <b>tracking</b> of polymeric materials. To overcome such issues, inorganic fillers are added to the base polymers to enhance their resistance to surface discharge activities and other performances. Since their addition can significantly reduce material costs, their use is compelling. Micron-sized fillers, here after defined as microfillers, have been used to acquire these desirable properties, but due to limitations in material processability, the further application of such fillers is limited. Consequently, nano-sized fillers, here after defined as nanofillers, have been viewed as replacements or assistant combinations to microfillers. Nanofillers are characterized by large surface areas, resulting in increased bond strengths that yield significant improvements in the various properties at fill levels well below that of microfillers. However, the primary problem of using nanofillers is their characteristic property of agglomeration due to their physical size and the forces between the fillers. Conventional mechanical mixing of nanofillers does not adequately separate the nanofillers, leading to behaviour similarly to that of microfillers. Therefore, the implementation of nanofillers is not completely effective. In chemical dispersion techniques, for example, the use of surfactants, are normally very elaborate and complicated. Due to the negative impact of agglomeration, the successful dispersion of nanofillers is pivotal in the further development of nanodielectrics for various insulation applications. In this thesis, electrospinning is proposed and realized as a new dispersal method for nanofillers in polymeric materials. This novel technique facilitates polymeric nanocomposites with improved properties due to the uniform distribution of fillers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) clearly indicate that electrospun nanocomposites demonstrate a better filler distribution than nanocomposites, produced by conventional mechanical mixing. Also electrospinning introduces the possibility of separating different nanofillers in different base polymers. The mechanical properties: tensile strength and hardness; the electrical properties: permittivity, tracking, and erosion resistance; and the thermal properties: thermal conductivity, thermal degradation, and heat erosion resistance of electrospun nanocomposites are compared to those of conventional nanocomposites for silicone rubber and cycloaliphatic epoxy-based polymers. All the experimental studies in this thesis confirm that electrospun nanocomposites exhibit better thermal performances than the conventional composites which are attributed to the improved distribution of the nanofillers by the newly developed electrospinning process. Also in this investigation, a two-dimensional thermal model is developed in COMSOL MultiphysicsTM by using the finite element method (FEM) to theoretically address the benefits of using nanofillers and the effects of filler dispersion. The model confirms that electrospun nanocomposites have much more uniform temperature distribution than conventional nanocomposites. This thesis presents the possible mechanisms by which nanofillers improve the heat and erosion resistance of silicone rubber nanocomposites, and also addresses the possible mechanism by which electrospinning improves nanofiller dispersion...|$|E

This renders the presented sensor a floating two-terminal capacitor with low offset capacitance and offers design freedom for <b>electrical</b> <b>tracks</b> and bond pads. The presented transducer can be cost-effectively fabricated and integrated into systems as a non-polar pressure dependent capacitance. Prototypes have lateral dimensions of 0. 6 × 1. 2 mm 2 and a thickness of 0. 5 mm which {{can be reduced to}} 0. 17 mm on wafer level. The measured average normal- and touch mode sensitivities of 2 pF/bar and 1. 8 pF/bar, respectively, provide enough output swing for ambient pressure monitoring with a 1 / 10 mbar resolution using a discrete AD 7745 readout circuit on PCB. Processing on fused silica is discussed in detail with a focus on surface micromachining. Substrate material related process challenges are addressed such as high film stress levels as well as viscose and elastic deformation. The substrate’s general features are a high thermal stability, a good electrical and thermal insulation, an...|$|R
