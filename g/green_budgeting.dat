This paper investigates the integration of environmental concerns into government fiscal cycles, or <b>green</b> <b>budgeting.</b> Despite being an increasingly popular means of pursuing environmental policy, the global spread of <b>green</b> <b>budgeting</b> governance norms has been manifestly uneven. However, recent stimulus packages employed by many advanced economies to promote economic growth have had a strong green element. This raises questions over how the current desire for fiscal austerity interacts with existing factors that constrain or facilitate environmental policy via budgeting. By drawing on theoretical arguments that argue macro ‘politics matters’ in budget composition, we develop an analytical framework for explaining budgeting practices. This political preference framework (PPF) is then employed to examine <b>green</b> <b>budgeting</b> in two leading but otherwise contrasting industrialised economies, namely the USA and the UK. From this analysis, it is argued that key veto players have often set the <b>green</b> <b>budgeting</b> agenda in the current age of austerity. The scope for further theoretical, empirical and normative research is consequently discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the phenomenon of}} institutional change through the implementation of sustainable strategies of medium-term budgeting, having as an effect the growth of opportunity to attract proper resources for social and environmental programs. The study analyzes green budget practices and suggests several ways to use {{them in order to}} ensure consistency in implementing key elements of sustainable economy. Thus, we conducted an empirical study to explain the decisive factors impact (greenhouse gas emissions and national income) on health expenditure and we obtained statistically significant positive relationship, suggesting that <b>green</b> <b>budgeting</b> is an important factor for sustainable economy. The reasons behind the introduction of a sustainable perspective for budgeting in any country are important since they will dictate, to a large extent, the way the medium term budgeting will be institutionalize...|$|E
40|$|An {{abundance}} of approaches, strategies, and instruments – in short: tools – {{have been developed}} that intend to stimulate or facilitate the integration {{of a variety of}} environmental objectives into development planning, national or regional sectoral policies, international agreements, business strategies, etc. These tools include legally mandatory procedures, such as Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment; more voluntary tools such as environmental indicators developed by scientists and planning tools; <b>green</b> <b>budgeting,</b> etc. A relatively underexplored question is what integration tool fits what particular purposes and contexts, in short: “what works where?”. This paper intends to contribute to answering this question, by first providing conceptual clarity about what integration entails, by suggesting and illustrating a classification of integration tools, and finally by summarising some of the lessons learned about how and why integration tools are (not) used and with what outcomes, particularly in terms of promoting the integration of environmental objectives. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Budget is an {{important}} tool {{in the hands of}} state for affirmative action for improvement of gender relations through reduction of gender gap in the development process. It can help to reduce economic inequalities as well as gender inequalities. Hence, the budgetary policies need to keep into consideration the gender dynamics operating in the economy and in the civil society. There is a need to highlight participatory approaches, bottom up budget, child budget, <b>green</b> <b>budgeting,</b> local and global implications of pro-poor and pro-women budgeting and inter-linkages between gender-sensitive budgeting and women’s empowerment. It is good economic sense to make national budgets gender-sensitive, as this will enable more effective targeting of government expenditure to women specific activities and reduce inequitable consequences of previous fiscal policies. The Gender Budget Initiative is a policy framework, methodology and set of tools to assist governments to integrate a gender perspective into the budget as the main national plan of public expenditure. It also aims to facilitate attention to gender analysis in review of macroeconomic performance, ministerial budget preparations, parliamentary debate and mainstream media coverage. Budget impacts women’s lives in several ways. It directly promotes women’s development through allocation of budgetary funds for women’s programmes or reduces opportunities for empowerment of women through budgetary cuts...|$|E

It also discusses information recently released by HM Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs concerning their methodology for calculating how much revenue these reforms will raise. The Briefing Note shows that there is considerable uncertainty over the revenue that could be raised from the very rich by increasing income tax rates, both because we cannot be certain about the distribution of incomes above £ 100, 000 and because we cannot be certain how those affected will respond to the tax increase.

40|$|Australia's {{greenhouse}} measures {{provide the}} answer to reducing greenhouse gas emissions - the alternative to 'environmentally related taxes'? By Anna Mortimore? 1. INTRODUCTION The Australian Government did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol Agreement on 16 February 2005, as not all major emitters signed the agreement, {{and it was not}} in Australia's economic interest being one of the world's leading nations in the exportation of energy resources. Even so, the Australian Government claims that every effort will be made to achieve the countries Kyoto Protocol obligation of limiting its greenhouse gas emissions to 108 % of 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 from the implementation of its 'greenhouse measures'. The measures are in contrast with other OECD countries, and ignores the 2001 OECD report which reprimanded Australia for failing to introduce taxes and charges to deal with greenhouse gas emissions, where 'one way to keep it down was to price it'. Australia's answer is not in adopting such fiscal instruments but in 'greenhouse measures' that are 'science based, results-oriented that delivers practical outcomes by working in partnership with industry, regions and community'. Not only will such measures need to address the countries existing poor energy efficiency record which improved at less than half the rate of other countries, but it will also need to account for the future energy demand, expected to increase by 50 % by 2020. Whether such measures are adequate in reducing GHG emissions and meeting the Kyoto Protocol target is questionable, particularly when the <b>Green</b> <b>Budget</b> News reports that Australia's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have increased by 22 % from 1990 to 2002.

We find that donors with a larger <b>green</b> domestic <b>budget</b> tend to allocate a smaller portion of overseas aid to mitigation finance (possibly {{as a result of}} a competing interest between spending on domestic environmental projects and international climate projects). The opposite holds for donor countries with better institutions (governance) that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

50|$|Up to 2013 {{the annual}} reports of Austrian parties include revenue and {{expenses}} for the federal level only.

Such spending is among the highest for established liberal democracies. In 2012/13 two leading Austrian newspapers reported that party spending in Austria was the second highest in the world. With Austrian parties annual routine spending (on operational costs of a full-time party organization) has always been more important than extra campaign expenses.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance gain {{of a novel}} power efficient multi-RAT link adaptation metric, denoted <b>Green</b> Link <b>Budget</b> metric, dedicated to multi-RAT network densification for future 5 G networks. In the paper, mm-wave and Wi-Fi technologies for phantom cells with a maximum radio coverage of 40  m are considered. This metric, based on normalized link budget parameters, allows a fair comparison between independent interfaces and highlights benefits of mm-wave phantom cells with gains ranged from 10 to 25  dB on Tx-power level requirements to guaranty a radio coverage up to 40  m. The next step of the work will be to integrate multi-user distribution in the GLB metric assessments in order to evaluate and optimize multi-RAT end-to-end architectures. The second aspect is to pursue in a multi-user context, the integration of such metrics in emerging C/U plane splitting architectures [10] dedicated WLAN-LTE-A interworking including mm-wave components.|$|R

Architects Stanfield, Imel & Walton of Tulsa designed the 1963 master plan {{but most of}} the buildings were designed by Tulsa architect Frank Wallace. Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as [...] "sculptures", noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was [...] "whittling since I was a kid".

40|$|In practice, it is {{difficult}} to determine the optimal amount to spend on marketing and administering a <b>green</b> pricing program. <b>Budgets</b> for marketing and administration of green pricing programs are a function of several factors: the region of the country; the size of the utility service area; the customer base and media markets encompassed within that service area; the point or stage in the lifespan of the program; and certainly, not least, the utility's commitment to and goals for the program. All of these factors vary significantly among programs. This report presents data on programs that have funded both marketing and program administration. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) gathers the data annually from utility green pricing program managers. Programs reporting data to NREL spent a median of 18. 8 % of program revenues on marketing their programs in 2008 and 16. 6 % in 2007. The smallest utilities (those with less than 25, 000 in their eligible customer base) spent 49 % of revenues on marketing, significantly more than the overall median.

40|$|The {{greening}} {{of economic}} growth series ESCAP, its partners and Asia-Pacific countries have advocated "green growth" as a strategy to achieve sustainable development in the resource-constrained, high-poverty context of the Asian and the Pacific region. The conventional "grow now, clean up later" approaches to economic growth are increasingly placing the futures of regional economies and societies at risk. The forward-thinking policymaker is tasked to promote development based on eco-efficient economic growth and, at the same time, record more inclusive gains in human welfare and socio-economic progress. In order to assist policymakers in responding to such challenges, ESCAPâ€™s activity on green growth has been developed to focus on five paths: sustainable infrastructure development; investment in natural capital; <b>green</b> tax and <b>budget</b> reform; sustainable consumption and production; and the greening of business and markets. The ESCAP â€œGreening {{of economic growth}}â€ series provides policymakers with quick access to clear, easy-to-read guidance to specific "green growth" policy tools and actions.

40|$|In 2020, {{decoupled}} payments will represent about 42 % of the CAP <b>budget</b> (<b>green</b> payments excluded). This report assesses the potential effects of European {{decoupled payments}} on farmers' production decisions, {{prior to a}} sensitivity analysis of different coupling factors using the Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET). Scientific literature reveals different coupling channels such as capitalisation in land value, farmers' risk behaviour, credit accessibility, uncertainty about future policies and labour allocation through which European decoupled payments influence farm choices and thus output. For each of these channels the relevant literature introducing theoretical and empirical assessments is evaluated {{with the aim of}} deriving plausible behavioural parameters that improve the representation of decoupled payments in economic simulation models. To capture completely decoupled production behaviour, many CGE models typically represent decoupled payments as a uniform subsidy rate to the land using (agricultural) sectors. Nevertheless based on a thorough review of the literature, it appears that a more suitable modelling approach which caters for heterogeneous member state land markets, may be to split the allocation of decoupled payments. On the one hand, a proportion is committed to land {{as a function of the}} capitalisation rate into the rental value, whilst a second tranche is distributed uniformly across all factors, reflecting a balance of different coupling channels. A sensitivity analysis concludes that if one assumes differing degrees of coupling, it does have some implication for output and price results when conducting policy analysis. JRC.

40|$|One of the {{important}} factors that {{has been difficult to}} be overcome by each country is poverty, beside unemployment and environmental degradation. To eradicate the poverty is {{one of the goals of}} each government in this planet to build a social justice. For instance, among Asian-Pacific countries, the economic growth has indicated a tremendous progress, but at the same time most people still live beyond the poverty line and the quality of our environment is still unsolvable. Therefore, the postulate “growth first, clean up later” is no longer applicable. The concept of “green growth” which was declared in Soul (2008) by Asian-Pacific countries might be more suitable in integrating sustainable development for social justice, since one of the approaches to be implemented in green growth is how to involve the poor people in developing the economic sector. Involving the poor people is one of the forms of social justice. So, how students understand those concepts and are there any difference in understanding those concepts among level of study, by conducting a comparative research, is the main topic of this paper.

40|$|Det partipolitiska landskapet i Sverige har på kort tid förändrats och migrationsfrågor är på allas läppar. Både i Europa och i Norden har radikala högerpopulistiska partier haft stora framgångar den senaste tiden men bemötandet av dessa partier ser väldigt olika ut. Den här rapporten handlar om hur svenska tidningar på ledarplats beskriver Sverigedemokraterna (SD) och jämför med hur andra radikala högerpo- pulistiska partier beskrivs i Danmark, Norge och Finland. I rapporten studeras även hur SD bemöts på sajten Avpixlat. Resultatet visar att den offentliga debatten och media knappast är enhetlig, utan ett parti som SD behandlas väldigt olika i olika mediala rum. The {{starting}} point of this report are the ambivalent views in Sweden Democrats’ (SD’s) role and position in Swedish politics. At the mid-point of its second mandate period since the party entered the Swedish parliament in 2010, no other party has yet attempted to move closer or to initiate talks and negotiations with the party. To speak figuratively, SD {{was still in the}} entrance hall, and there were no signs of invitations to enter the living room. SD’s policy program differs from those of the other Swedish parliamentary parties, especially in the field of migration policy. SD wants to drastically reduce the number of asylum seekers, as well as to bring down the numbers of all migrants to a mini- mum, regardless of how many are currently entering the country. The party aims for a different Sweden, not only in the field of migration policy. They want a country with minimal elements of other cultures and religions and stress uniformity, foun- ded {{on the basis of what}} SD consider to be Swedish values and traditions. SD is an extreme nationalist party, and distinguishes itself from other similar par- ties in neighbouring countries by its history and by virtue of its previously strong ties with fascists and Nazi movements. Reducing immigration is thus, for SD, not just about preserving welfare, jobs and housing. The intention is to transform or rather restore the national community: a tight fusion between nation and state. This report is based on the assumption that the Swedish debate on migration po- licy is unusually polarized. In the 2014 election campaign, voters were faced with two options: either a generous immigration policy or a much more restrictive policy, while concrete proposals in the area of migration policy were conspicuous by their absence in both political camps. Since then issues of migration and integration are ￼ix on everyone’s lips. In its initial background part, this report shows how SD’s poli- cies on migration were radically different from those of other parties in the election campaign of 2014. Since the election 2014 migration has been the big issue in the political debate, and other parties have put forward more restrictive policies towards migration. This has not really changed the situation with the polarisation; no parties will admit that they are moving closer to SD. Put in other words, in the area of party politics, the differences between the other parliamentary parties and the SD has undoubtedly decreased but in the area of public opinion the polarisation yet remains. SD has successfully attracted new voters by exploiting the mismatch between de- mand and supply of concrete policy proposals in migration policy. The SD also ex- ploits the fact that criticism of various forms of immigration has been more or less absent in the other parties’ platforms. By election time in 2014, SD had also moved forward as the party in Sweden which is the most critical of the EU and as the only remaining party which clearly propagates Swedish exit from the EU. 1 The Swedish situation is unique in Nordic comparison. In Norway, Finland and Denmark, comparable parties have already made the journey from being funda- mentally debarred of cross-party political cooperation into more central political positions. 2 The investigations presented in this report show how the image of SD is reproduced both externally and internally. The first part of the study examines how Swedish edi- torial articles in the daily press deal with SD, compared to corresponding reporting about similar parties on the editorial pages in other Nordic countries. This study relies on descriptive statistics based on own calculations. The second part of the study examines how the image of SD is reproduced by a review of texts from the site Avpixlat, formally independent but with close ties to the SD. The texts analysed were those which have been presented as authentic letters from persons that used to vote for other parties (published in the series ”From the seven clover to the SD”), but who have now changed their minds and have decided to vote for SD in the next ￼x election. We cannot know for sure that the letters are authentic, but regardless of this, we can trace a common narrative in the letters which can be analysed. This study is based on narrative analysis; to study how individual experiences and per- ceptions of everyday events transmute into changes in party political preferences. We present the following conclusions from the study’s first part, on editorial articles: 1) There was no major change in the way SD was treated in Swedish editorial articles between 2009 and 2012; it was yet based on a cordon sanitaire. The negative treatment afforded in Swedish editorial articles stands out as sig- nificantly more negative in comparison with the discursive order in editorial articles in the neighbouring countries Denmark, Finland and Norway. 2) How mainstream media reacts to the SD cannot explain the fact that the party managed to attract such a significant number of voters and voter sympathy during the studied period (in the 2010 elections, as well as in opinion polls subsequently). 3) In the editorial articles, it has often been assumed that voters had a choice, to either vote for the Sweden Democrats or for any of the other parliamentary parties, which may have contributed to polarization in Swedish politics. (This polarization has later been even more exaggerated due to later events in Swedish politics – such as, for example, the December agreement, when the established right-wing parties agreed not to vote against the Social Democratic and <b>Green</b> government <b>budget,</b> as well as later developments following the current refugee situation.) We also present the following conclusions from the study’s second part, dealing with texts on the website Avpixlat: 1) Alternatives to the mainstream media play an important role for a party that is not part of the establishment, and Avpixlat clearly constitutes such a venue. 2) Avpixlat offers a counter-narrative that differs entirely from how SD is presen- ￼xi ted in the parliamentary debate proceedings, as well as in editorial articles in the mainstream press. This counter-narrative can help us understand how voting for the Sweden Democrats may seem logical for those doing so. 3) The Avpixlat texts can be seen as often presenting a nostalgic vision, whereby things used to be better in the past, but whereby promises for a better future also can be held out. There are reasons to believe that the readers of such texts may come to see the other parliamentary parties as comparatively unable to hold forth an equally compelling vision. According to the texts in Avpixlat, Sweden is not capable of taking on more immigrants, and is also burdened with increasing costs for migration. The text authors also believe that there is reason to be worried about the lack of political leadership in migration po- licy. They also believe that other countries should take more responsibility for asylum seekers. Based on such a description of the political situation, a vote for the Sweden Democrats can be seen as understandable. 4) The authors of the texts at Axpixlat often put into evidence the desire to strike a balance between a radical message on the one hand, and (on the other) a normalising understanding of the policy situation which most people could see as familiar. The aim of the authors seems to be to radicalise present popular sentiments, rather than to appear all too extreme and strident. We also wish to situate these results with comments pertaining to the very latest developments in Swedish migration policy. Starting in the fall of 2015, more com- mentators and politicians from other parties are advocating visions and policies similar to those discussed on Avpixlat: less migration, ID controls at the borders, and so on. This partial policy realignment may well give more credibility to domi- nant messages on Avpixlat and to the SD. Both Avpixlat authors and the SD can now point to having raised migration-critical policy solutions long before others have done so. Being rejected by mainstream media might affect a populistic party in opposition to the establishment in a different way; it might even strengthen its position. This ￼xii report shows that a party both can attract many voters and at the same time lack credibility according to political competitors and mainstream media. How a party is portrayed in media has no such direct effect on voting behaviour. The relation between opinion, media representation and individual party preferences is a com- plex and contested phenomenon (Bonjour & Schrover 2015). One way forward, as suggested in this report, is to move from studying the public debate as monolithic, but instead as pluralistic...|$|R

The project was initiated by the Nordic Council of Ministers {{as part of the}} Nordic Prime Ministers’ green growth iniatiative, The Nordic Region – leading in <b>green</b> growth, with <b>budget</b> from the Food and Agriculture program. The project has focused on redistribution of food that has been donated to prevent food waste, which means that ordinary sponsored food, either free of charge or to a very low price, is not included. The main goals of this study and the report has been to: - Give an overview and evaluation of the extent and potential effects of food redistribution in the Nordic region, both via food banks and more direct and local redistribution. - To summarize the legal basis for regulation and control with food redistribution in the Nordic countries. - To evaluate to what extent it has been harmonized or if it is regarded as important barriers to development of food redistribution. There are few studies and little scientific data on food redistribution in a waste prevention perspective. Some new references to studies in the UK and Australia were found interesting through this study. Food banks are not a well-defined concept in present literature. In this report we have limited the concept of food banks to specific organisations that have been set up to function as open redistribution centres and where several stakeholders collaborate in establishment and operation. Matsentralen in Norway, fødevareBanken in Denmark and Allwin in Sweden fits within this definition, with a question mark on how the stakeholders are involved in the operation of Allwin. Redistribution of food has been divided into two main approaches: - Redistribution from food supply chain donors via redistribution centres like food banks, for storage and further distribution to end users which typically are charity organisations (the typical “food bank redistribution route”). - Direct redistribution from food supply chain donors to charity organisations, which is typical for local redistribution. Another important part of the project has been to compile available information about laws and regulations in the Nordic countries that can be potential barriers to establishment and operation of food banks and food redistribution in general. The main methodology applied {{in the second part of}} the project has been to carry out surveys by questionnaires to key persons in the involved organisations, both in national food banks, national charity organisations, local charity organisations and food donators, in many cases followed up by interviews either by telephone or through physical meetings. The report gives an overview of both food legislation in the EU as well as nationally. Within the European Union food legislation is harmonized. Since 2002 the Union has a general food law; Regulation (EC) No. 178 / 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (hereafter regulation (EC) No. 178 / 2002). The regulation constitutes the basis for the union food legislation and shall apply to all stages of production, processing and distribution of food and feed. It shall not apply to primary production for private domestic use or to the domestic preparation, handling or storage of food for private domestic consumption. Food banks should be regarded as food business operators according to regulations, and should thus follow the same overall rules as other types of businesses in the food supply chain. However, the four Nordic countries included in this study have defined food banks different with regard to the role in the supply chain, which can give quite different situations with regard to what is accepted and what is not to be redistributed. As far as possible the role of food banks could be harmonised in the Nordic countries. Direct food redistribution is in many cases not specifically mentioned in the survey of regulatory measures, making it unclear how national regulations and rules relates to charity organisations getting food directly from the food supply chain. This should be clarified and harmonised as far as possible. The three food banks that exist in the Nordic region have quite different backgrounds and also quite different models for organisation and ownership. The founding process of the three food banks was also quite different. The Danish and Swedish food banks have been established and developed in a continuous process, whereas the Norwegian food bank was established after two years with planning. The three food banks have also developed quite different business models, where the Swedish one is a private limited company, the Danish one a membership organisations with more than 300 members and the Norwegian one a cooperative organisations mostly owned by the national charity organisations, but also with a number of members. All three food banks were established with a two-sided purpose, both to reduce food waste and to make it easier for charity organisations to get access to food donations. The three food banks do also differ with regard to number of employees and volunteers, which is quite natural taken the length of operation into consideration. The three food banks redistributed in 2013 about 900 tonnes of food, that otherwise would have ended as food waste. The number of meals served based in redistributed food has been estimated to about 1. 67 mill in 2013, with about 926, 000 in Copenhagen, 346, 000 in Oslo and 400, 000 in Gothenburg. The most important donors to the food banks today are food producing companies and to some extent wholesale companies, and mainly from the surrounding area of the cities where the food banks are located. In general, there have not been problems with the quality of food being donated, as the regulations on this are the same as for normal food distribution. The problem is more to receive fairly stable amounts of food and to have a sufficient variety of food types. The food banks do both have capacity to receive more food and there is a need for more food for redistribution, so there is potential for increase in redistribution in the future. The main lessons learned from this brief overview of food banks in Nordic countries are that they are a small, but important actor in food waste prevention. It is important to consider the role for food security for low-income people, which gives redistribution a double role in the society. Food banks must find their role between the food sector and charity organisations, to supplement and not compete with the existing systems for redistribution locally. The food banks could also take the roles as “system operators” for redistribution of donated foods and be national competence centres for all actors being involved in food redistribution. Food banks can also have roles in certification of actors being involved in redistribution of food, which should be further discussed in Phase II of the project. The food banks struggle with low incomes and low support from national authorities; it is thus important to consider how the food banks should be financed. National surveys were carried out based in a common research approach and with the same questionnaires applied in all countries. As this survey is the first attempt to get an overview of direct food redistribution in any Nordic country, it should be regarded as a pilot study where the objectives were both to establish a methodology for the survey as well as getting a first overview of the extent of food redistribution outside the “official” food banks. 2 – 4 cities/regions were included in each country, where the cases were selected in collaboration with national charity organisations. The survey indicated that locally organised direct redistribution makes a significant contribution to prevention of food waste and to social security for low income people in all countries. This does not mean that it will contribute to a big reduction in total amounts of food waste in each country, nor that a large proportion of low-income people will be served with redistributed food. For the weaker groups, this is the most important service of the charity organisations, and donated food makes up more than 50 % of served food in most organisations. The figures are still quite uncertain and the regions studied are not representative for the whole country. Finland seems however to have a much better organized and a much higher number of serving places for low income people than the other countries. Food redistribution has a long tradition in most countries, but is still relatively loosely organised by local relationships and direct contacts between persons in the charity organisations and food companies/retail companies. Central agreements between organisations and food and retail companies would certainly have made it easier to establish and manage local and direct redistribution. A main barrier mentioned by the local organisations is lack of resources to establish and maintain a system for receiving food donations. One way to better facilitate food redistribution from food producers and retailers to local charity organisations is by providing access to monetary and human resources for the purpose of establishing and maintaining local systems for receiving food donations. This system also needs to include infrastructure such as storage and cooling facilities as well as solutions for transportation of food from the donor to the organisation. The main findings from direct redistribution of food in the Nordic countries, based in the regional studies carried out shows that the average number of meals served per year per 1, 000 inhabitants varies between 217 and 335, whereas the number of food bags delivered per 1, 000 inhabitants varies between 17 in Sweden and 522 in Finland. Those figures should be used carefully, since the calculations are based in a number of uncertain conditions which are discussed in the report. Our pilot survey of direct redistribution indicates that direct redistribution today have a much larger volume than the amount of food being redistributed via food banks alone. The study also indicates that it can be a great potential for increasing the amount of food being redistributed in the Nordic countries from the present status, and most of the charity organisations say there is a need for more food donations. Better organisation and clear guidelines from food authorities nationally can make it more acceptable for the food industry and retail companies to donate food, and realise the big potential for redistribution. This survey has shown that there are significant differences in how food redistribution activities are organised in the Nordic countries, and that there are many models for how it can be organised. Food redistribution lack a systems organisation in the Nordic countries and there could be developed a good model that integrate the food banks operating on national and regional levels with local direct redistribution initiatives. There are several areas that are important to be followed up through more specific studies, either as a direct following up from this pilot study or eventually in other similar settings, in the Nordic region or on a European scale. The three areas that have been described and that are proposed as input to discussions for Phase II of the Nordic Food Waste project are: - Following-up study on the quantification of food redistribution in the Nordic region, both via food banks nationally and regionally and direct redistribution locally. - Development of food banks as “system operators” in food redistribution, with regional networks and good collaboration with local direct redistribution systems. - Further development of rules and control routines for both redistribution via food banks and especially for directly to charity organisations within the given EU regulations.
