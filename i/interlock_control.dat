40|$|Long term {{mechanical}} creep {{and fatigue}} testing at elevated temperatures requires reliable systems with safeguards to prevent destruction of equipment, loss {{of data and}} negative environmental impacts. Toward this goal, a computer controlled system has been developed and built for interlocking tests run on elevated temperature mechanical test facilities. Sensors for water flow, water pressure, water leakage, temperature, power and hydraulic status are monitored to control specimen heating equipment through solid state relays and water solenoid valves. The system is designed {{to work with the}} default interlocks present in the RF generators and mechanical tests systems. Digital hardware consists of two National Instruments 1 / 0 boards mounted in a Macintosh IIci computer. Software is written in National Instruments LabVIEW. Systems interlocked include two MTS closed loop servo controlled hydraulic test frames, one with an RF generator and one with both an RF generator and a quartz lamp furnace. Control for individual test systems is modularized making the addition of more systems simple. If any of the supporting utilities fail during tests, heating systems, chill water and hydraulics are powered down, minimizing specimen damage and eliminating equipment damage. The <b>interlock</b> <b>control</b> is powered by an uninterruptible power supply. Upon failure the cause is documented in an ASCII file...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Control {{systems are}} {{required}} to comply with certain safety and liveness correctness properties. In most cases, such systems have an intrinsic degree of complexity {{and it is not}} easy to formally analyze them, due to the resulting large state space. Also, exhaustive simulation and testing can easily miss system errors, whether they are life-critical or not. In this work, we introduce an <b>interlocking</b> <b>control</b> approach that is based on the use of the so-called Distributed Signal Boxes (DSBs). The proposed control design is applied to a railwayinterlocking problem and more precisely, to the Athens underground metro system. Signal boxes correspond to the network’s interlocking points and communicate only with their neighbor signal boxes. Communication takes place by the use of rendezvous communication channels. This design results in a simple <b>interlocking</b> <b>control</b> approach that compared to other centralized solutions produces a smaller and easier to analyze state space. Formal analysis and verification is performed with the SPIN model checker...|$|R
