5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, resulting from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. <b>Genetic</b> <b>predisposition,</b> trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition.</b> Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E

5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition,</b> or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout {{at some point in their}} lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> for DPB {{susceptibility}} {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, {{that is more}} likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.|$|E
25|$|It is {{debated whether}} the {{above-mentioned}} effects {{are the result}} of a <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> to increased density, rather than experience-related structural reorganization. A second language is likely acquired through social experience, in early bilinguals, rather than through <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition.</b> Thus, the research suggests that the structure of the human brain is reworked by the experience of acquiring a second language.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} fibroids is not clearly understood, {{but the current}} working {{hypothesis}} is that <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions,</b> prenatal hormone exposure {{and the effects of}} hormones, growth factors and xenoestrogens cause fibroid growth.

40|$|For a {{long list}} of {{investment}} “biases, ” e. g., home bias, loss aversion, and performance chasing, we find that genetic differences explain up to 45 % of the variation across individual investors. The genetic factors that influence investment biases are also found to affect behaviors in other, non-investment, domains. This evidence is consistent with a view that investment biases are manifestations of innate and evolutionary ancient features of human behavior. The environment an investor experiences also affects investment biases, either directly or as a moderator of <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions.</b> For example, we find that work-related experience with finance seems to reduce <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions</b> to investment biases, while general education does not. Finally, even genetically identical investors, who grow up in the same family environment, often differ substantially in their investment behaviors due to individual-specific experiences or events...|$|R

25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a <b>genetic</b> <b>predisposition</b> will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E

40|$|Both {{expectations}} towards {{interactions with}} conspecifics, and <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions,</b> affect adults׳ social behaviors. However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} remain largely unknown. Here, we report data to investigate the interaction between genetic factors, (oxytocin receptor (OXTR) and serotonin transporter (5 -HTTLPR) polymorphisms), and adult interactional patterns in shaping physiological responses to social distress. During the presentation of distress vocalizations (cries of human female, infants and bonobos) we assessed participants׳ (N = 42 males) heart rate (HR) and peripheral nose temperature, which index state of arousal and readiness to action. Self-reported questionnaires were used to evaluate participants’ interactional patterns towards peers (Attachment Style Questionnaire, Feeney et al., 1994 [1]), {{and the quality of}} bond with intimate partners (Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, Fraley et al., 2000 [2]). To assess participants׳ <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions,</b> the OXTR gene (regions rs 53576, and rs 2254298) and the 5 -HTTLPR gene (region SLC 6 A 4) were genotyped.

40|$|Are {{hallucinations}} and delusions really {{symptoms of}} an illness called 'schizophrenia'? Are {{mental health problems}} really caused by chemical imbalances and <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions?</b> Are psychiatric drugs as effective and safe as the drug companies claim?

In particular it challenges beliefs that madness can be explained without reference to social causes and challenges the excessive preoccupation with chemical imbalances and <b>genetic</b> <b>predispositions</b> as causes of human misery, including the conditions that are given the name 'schizophrenia'. This edition updates the now extensive body of research showing that hallucinations, delusions etc. are best understood as reactions to adverse life events and that psychological and social approaches to helping are more effective and far safer than psychiatric drugs and electroshock treatment. A new final chapter discusses why such a damaging ideology has come to dominate mental health and, most importantly, how to change that...|$|R
