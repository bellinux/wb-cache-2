25|$|Paul Vandenbrink <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{alphabet}} {{inspired by}} the Shavian alphabet which takes the controversial step of replacing most of the specific vowel letters with markers indicating which of several sets of vowel types a vowel belongs to, thus {{reducing the number of}} vowel distinctions and lessening the written differences between dialectal variations of English.|$|E
25|$|Regional impacts {{from the}} {{unpredictable}} operation of wind power <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> need for interactive demand response, where the utility communicates with the demand. Historically {{this was only}} done in cooperation with large industrial consumers, but now may be expanded to entire grids. For instance a few large scale projects in Europe link variations in wind power to change industrial food freezer loads, causing small variations in temperature. If communicated on a grid-wide scale, small changes to heating/cooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid.|$|E

25|$|Johnston has {{traveled}} to the past through a separate universe. Johnston has been found by the local people {{and for this reason}} <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> persona for himself as a Magister who has come to help the Abbot of the local monastery look for important information in their archives. In this capacity, Johnston quickly becomes something of a fable among the people of the area and this causes Sir Oliver to ask for his help in defeating Arnaut. Johnston plays along until the moment comes when he can return home.|$|E
25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E

500|$|The show {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} critical acclaim. David Segal from The Washington Post {{noted that the}} [...] "difference between this show and the last, the Drowned World Tour of 2001, was striking. That show seems standoffish compared with this one, in part because Madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits. [...] Madonna <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> performance hybrid." [...] Segal's view was shared by Elizabeth Smith from The New York Times who also commented that [...] "Unlike 2001's Drowned World Tour, which was dark, often hostile, Re-Invention returns Madonna to the light. She looks {{as if she is}} having a good time." [...] Edna Gunderson of USA Today gave the concert four out of four stars and said [...] "Madonna seems to be having a jolly good time. Whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth, Reinvention finds Madonna reinvested emotionally. The show doesn't have the degree of flesh, carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered, but this time Madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity." [...] Joshua Klein from Chicago Tribune commented that Madonna's show displayed more spectacle than substance.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{noted the}} sociopolitical issues that, unusually for an {{animated}} series on a children's channel, run through The Legend of Korra. According to Forbes, by telling [...] "some of the darkest, most mature stories" [...] ever animated, The Legend of Korra <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> genre, [...] "the world's first animated television drama". Thill {{proposed that the}} Equalists' cause in season 1 reflected the recent appearance of the Occupy movement, and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before Occupy Wall Street began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted [...] "a large {{group of people who}} felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power." [...] Beck wrote that The Legend of Korra used magic to illustrate [...] "the growing pains of a modernizing world seeing the rise of technology and capitalism, and taking halting, jerky steps toward self-governance", while portraying no side of the conflict as entirely flawless. Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon's Equalists reflected some of the ideas of John Rawls' [...] "luck egalitarianism", praising the series for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.|$|E

2500|$|Multimodality {{has evolved}} along with technology. This {{evolution}} <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> concept of writing, a collaborative context keeping {{the reader and}} writer in relationship. [...] The concept of reading is different with the influence of technology due to the desire for a quick transmission of information. [...] In reference {{to the influence of}} multimodality on genre and technology, Professor Anne Frances Wysocki expands on how reading as an action has changed in part because of technology reform: “These various technologies offer perspectives for considering and changing approaches we have inherited to composing and interpreting pages....”. Along with the interconnectedness of media, computer-based technologies are designed to make new texts possible, influencing rhetorical delivery and audience.|$|E
2500|$|Jewish legends about Elijah {{abound in}} the aggadah, which is found {{throughout}} various collections of rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> history of him, which, beginning with his death or [...] "translation" [...] ends {{only with the}} close {{of the history of the}} human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.|$|E
2500|$|Chromosomes {{are tiny}} {{packages}} which contain one DNA molecule {{and its associated}} proteins. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). This number varies between species—for example, many primates have 24 pairs. Meiosis creates special cells, sperm in males and eggs in females, which only have 23 chromosomes. These two cells merge into one during the fertilization stage of sexual reproduction, creating a zygote. [...] In a zygote, a nucleic acid double helix divides, with each single helix occupying one of the daughter cells, resulting in half the normal number of genes. By the time the zygote divides again, genetic recombination <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> embryo with 23 pairs of chromosomes, half from each parent. Mating and resultant mate choice result in sexual selection. In normal cell division (mitosis) is possible when the double helix separates, and a complement of each separated half is made, resulting in two identical double helices in one cell, with each occupying {{one of the two}} new daughter cells created when the cell divides.|$|E

2500|$|The {{city and}} {{surrounding}} area suffered {{the bulk of}} the economic damage and largest loss of human life {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with Al-Qaeda piloted American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and United Airlines Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and later destroyed them, killing 2,192 civilians, 343 firefighters, and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area. The North Tower was subsequently the tallest building ever to be destroyed and still is. The rebuilding of the area, <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> One World Trade Center, and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure.

2500|$|The Daleks {{returned}} in the 2008 season's two-part finale, [...] "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", accompanied once again by their creator Davros.

Davros <b>has</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in [...] "The Vault", a section of the Dalek flagship, the Crucible. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a [...] "reality bomb" [...] for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of Donna Noble, a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed. The Daleks {{returned in}} the 2010 episode [...] "Victory of the Daleks", the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the [...] "Progenitor". This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA. The activation of the Progenitor results {{in the creation of a}} [...] "new paradigm" [...] of Daleks. The New Paradigm Daleks deem their creators inferior and exterminate them; their creators make no resistance to this, deeming themselves inferior as well. They are organised into different roles (drone, scientist, strategists, supreme and eternal), which are identifiable with colour-coded armour instead of the identification plates under the eyestalk used by their predecessors. They escape the Doctor at the end of the episode via time travel with the intent to rebuild their Empire.|$|E
