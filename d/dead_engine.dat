2500|$|Another {{issue with}} the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of {{outwardly}} rotating (at the [...] "tops" [...] of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engine non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the <b>dead</b> <b>engine</b> and rolling the wingtip {{down on the side}} of the <b>dead</b> <b>engine.</b> Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and hit the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load. This same design feature was present from its earliest days on both the Luftwaffe twin-engine Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, and from the fourth prototype onwards of the otherwise troubled Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber.|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, Clarence Duncan Chamberlin was friends with, {{and worked}} as chief test pilot for, the {{aircraft}} designer Giuseppe Mario Bellanca. A flight instructor in World War I, Clarence was an early customer of Bellanca designs, purchasing the only Bellanca CE, built {{when he was working}} for the Maryland Pressed Steel Company. Through Clarence, Bellanca secured a position as a consultant for the Wright Aeronautical company to produce a 5–6 passenger aircraft to demonstrate their new [...] Wright Whirlwind J-4 engine. Bellanca built an all-wood aircraft, the WB-1 in 1926, which crashed at Curtiss Field in an attempt on the world non-refueled endurance record. The WB-2 follow-on aircraft, made of fabric-covered steel tubing, was already in development to test the updated Wright Whirlwind J-5. The aircraft had some features intended for long-distance overseas flights built in. The landing gear was able to be dropped, to prevent flipping in a water landing. Once on the water, the large gas tanks could provide flotation, and a saw was carried to drop the <b>dead</b> <b>engine</b> weight if needed.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1942, VMF-121 {{pilots and}} {{aircraft}} {{were sent to}} Guadalcanal as part of Operation Watchtower to relieve VMF-223, which had been fighting {{for control of the}} air over the island since mid-August. On October 9, Foss and his group were catapult launched off the [...] escort carrier and flew [...] north to reach Guadalcanal. The air group, code named [...] "Cactus", based at Henderson Field became known as the Cactus Air Force, and their presence played a pivotal role in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Foss soon gained a reputation for aggressive close-in fighter tactics and uncanny gunnery skills. Foss shot down a Japanese Zero on his first combat mission on October 13, but his own F4F Wildcat was shot up as well, and with a <b>dead</b> <b>engine</b> and three more Zeros on his tail, he landed at full speed, with no flaps and minimal control on Henderson Field, barely missing a grove of palm trees. On 7 November his Wildcat was again hit, and he survived a ditching in the sea off the island of Malaita.|$|E

50|$|The {{small size}} of the {{railroad}} obviates the need for high running speeds, as do the short distances spanned. Operating speeds are therefore low as compared to longer railroads. The maximum speed for both passenger and freight trains on the “main line” of the Mulberry Island and James River Subdivisions therefore was 25 mph with the maximum speed on the Industrial Subdivision being 15 mph. On all subdivisions, the maximum speed through sidings, within yard limits, on spurs and through switches was also 15 mph. There were more restrictive maximum speeds specified for <b>dead</b> <b>engines</b> (engines not under power while being towed), which were 15 mph, rail mounted derricks and cranes run between 5 mph and 10 mph, and track motor cars travel to about 2 mph and 15 mph.|$|R

60|$|But {{never did}} life renew so monstrously on a dead {{railroad}} {{as it did}} on those two roads. From the west came the whistle of a locomotive. It was coming in our direction, bound east. We were bound east. A stir of preparation ran down our ranks. The whistle tooted fast and furiously, and the train thundered at top speed. The hobo didn't live that could have boarded it. Another locomotive whistled, and another train came through at top speed, and another, and another, train after train, train after train, till toward the last the trains were composed of passenger coaches, box-cars, flat-cars, <b>dead</b> <b>engines,</b> cabooses, mail-cars, wrecking appliances, and all the riff-raff of worn-out and abandoned rolling-stock that collects in the yards of great railways. When the yards at Council Bluffs had been completely cleaned, the private car and engine went east, and the tracks died for keeps.|$|R

50|$|Ashmore and {{the others}} {{parachute}} to safety. Mitchell is able to extinguish the fire by diving the airplane but loses half of his aileron control in the process. Then, despite Conway's order and the urgings of others, he decides to try to land the aeroplane rather than crashing it into the sea. However, he has to fly {{back and forth for}} half an hour to use up fuel, shifting the centre of gravity in the aircraft away from the <b>dead</b> <b>engine</b> to make the landing more feasible. Ashmore is convinced of the aircraft's value by its performance in the dive and expresses confidence in Mitchell's ability to land it.|$|E
50|$|APUs {{fitted to}} extended-range {{twin-engine}} operations (ETOPS) aircraft are a critical safety device, as they supply backup electricity and compressed air {{in place of}} the <b>dead</b> <b>engine</b> or failed main engine generator. While some APUs may not be startable in flight, ETOPS-compliant APUs must be flight-startable at altitudes up to the aircraft service ceiling. Recent applications have specified starting up to 43000 ft from a complete cold-soak condition such as the Hamilton Sundstrand APS5000 for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. If the APU or its electrical generator is not available, the aircraft cannot be released for ETOPS flight and is forced to take a longer non-ETOPS route.|$|E
50|$|The {{interchange}} of {{cars with}} the national rail system occurs only at the Lee Hall junction where interchange tracks exist linking the FEMRR to (originally) the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) (now CSX). FEMRR engines and cars were not permitted on C&O tracks beyond the Yorktown Road grade crossing except in emergencies. Cars outbound from Fort Eustis would be spotted on a designated interchange track (other than passing track #493, which was a dedicated runaround track) and deemed delivered to the C&O when the bills of lading and switch lists were signed by the C&O station agent. Inbound cars would be spotted on the interchange track by the C&O and deemed delivered to the Government when uncoupled from the engine (or {{the rest of the}} train) that brought them there. FEMRR engines and trains were not allowed on the C&O main line except in emergencies. However, with proper prior arrangement, C&O trains or light engines (engines under power but not coupled to cars or <b>dead</b> <b>engines)</b> were allowed to operate on FEMRR tracks on the Industrial Subdivision (save the Port Branch), the Wye Tower Interlocking Plant, and the part of the James River Subdivision between O’Brien, the wye and Hanks, including Hanks Yard. The Commanding Officer, Company A, 714th TBROS&DE had to approve the use of any other tracks by the C&O. All C&O trains and light engines were to be provided a pilot and any necessary highway crossing protection.|$|R
50|$|The T-54 and T-55 have a cabin layout {{shared with}} many post-World War II tanks, with the {{fighting}} compartment in the front, engine compartment in the rear, and a dome-shaped turret {{in the center}} of the hull. The driver's hatch is on the front left of the hull roof. The commander is seated on the left, with the gunner to his front and the loader on the right. The tank's suspension has the drive sprocket at the rear, and <b>dead</b> track. <b>Engine</b> exhaust is on the left fender. There is a prominent gap between the first and second road wheel pairs, a distinguishing feature from the T-62, which has progressively larger spaces between road wheels towards the rear.|$|R
40|$|In the {{following}} report, we will first draw some conclusions of purely theoretical interest, {{from the general}} equations of motion. At the end, we will consider the motion of an airplane, with the <b>engine</b> <b>dead</b> and {{with the assumption that}} the angle of attack remains constant. Thus we arrive at a simple result, which can be rendered practically utilizable for determining the trajectory of an airplane descending at a constant steering angle...|$|R
50|$|The B-25 was a {{safe and}} {{forgiving}} aircraft to fly. With one engine out, 60° banking turns into the <b>dead</b> <b>engine</b> were possible, and control could be easily maintained down to 145 mph (230 km/h). The pilot had to remember to maintain engine-out directional control at low speeds after takeoff with rudder; if this maneuver was attempted with ailerons, the aircraft could snap out of control. The tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. The only significant complaint about the B-25 was the extremely high noise level produced by its engines; as a result, many pilots eventually suffered from varying degrees of hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|His combat successes {{continued}} into July and August as the Battle of Britain gathered pace, although {{he himself was}} forced to bail out on 18 August. While attacking a formation of Junkers Ju 88s over Kent, he shot one down and damaged another. However, during the head on attack at Ju 88, when he overtook it, cannon shells hit his Spitfire and {{he was forced to}} bail out near Tunbridge Wells. He fell at Tucks Cottage, near Park Farm, Horsmonden. In another incident on 25 August Tuck's Spitfire was badly damaged during combat with a Dornier Do 17 bomber, which he destroyed 15 miles off the coast. His aircraft had a <b>dead</b> <b>engine,</b> but he glided it back to dry land and made a forced landing.|$|E

On {{the morning of}} pole day, he drove a practice lap of 220.372 mph, second only to Rick Mears (222.827 mph). Mario drew the coveted first qualifying attempt, but his qualifying speed was curiously slow and disappointing (214.692 mph). On race day, his car was plagued with problems. About 30 laps into the race, a gearbox bearing failed and created an oil leak. A long pit stop was needed to make repairs. Later in the race, an ignition problem forced another series of long pit stops to change various electrical components. With the leaders at lap 170, Mario was about 50 laps down, when the team finally called the day quits with a <b>dead</b> <b>engine.</b> Mario was credited with 118 laps in 20th place.|$|E
5000|$|Sega Golden Gun is {{technically}} {{not part of}} The House of the Dead series, but is related due to using The House of the <b>Dead</b> 4 <b>Engine.</b> The game features a Chinese setting, and not only has zombies, but also phantoms and related fantasy creatures, the latter of which are reincarnated through resurrected historical figures (Zhang Jiao (from Romance of the Three Kingdoms) as the Black Tortoise, Gao Qiu (from Water Margin) as the Azure Dragon, and Daji (from Fengshen Yanyi) as the White Tiger). The game has three stages which are linear depending on which stage was selected first, all of which also include a mid-boss battle against Sun Wukong (the game keeps his real identity a secret while nicknaming him [...] "The Monkey King") from Journey to the West.|$|R
50|$|In a {{compression}} release engine braking {{system for a}} turbocharged internal combustion engine, excessive stress associated with opening the exhaust valves of the <b>engine</b> near top <b>dead</b> center of <b>engine</b> compression strokes when the engine is turning at high speed is prevented by reducing the intake manifold pressure from what it otherwise would be at that high speed. This is done by retarding the turbocharger so that its speed is less than it otherwise would be at high engine speed.|$|R
50|$|During {{the normal}} {{operation}} of the engine as the fuel mixture is being compressed an electric arc is created to ignite the fuel. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top <b>Dead</b> Centre). As <b>engine</b> rpm rises the spark point is moved earlier in the cycle so that the fuel charge can be ignited while it is still being compressed. We can see this advantage reflected in the various Otto engines designs. The atmospheric (non-compression) engine operated at 12% efficiency. The compressed charge engine had an operating efficiency of 30%.|$|R
50|$|J2Fs of {{the utility}} {{squadron}} of US Patrol Wing 10 were destroyed at Mariveles Bay, Philippines, by a Japanese air raid on 5 January 1942.

Following repairs the J2F-4 departed after midnight on 9 April 1942, overloaded with five passengers and the pilot, becoming the last aircraft to depart Bataan before the surrender of the Philippines to the Japanese only hours later. Among its passengers was Carlos P. Romulo (diplomat, politician, soldier, journalist and author), who recounted the flight in his 1942 best-selling book I Saw the Fall of the Philippines (Doubleday, Doran & Company, Inc., Garden City, New York 1943, pp. 288-303), for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence.|$|E
