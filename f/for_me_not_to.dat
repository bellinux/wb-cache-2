500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... {{it never occurred to me}} that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E
2500|$|When Roosevelt {{addressed}} the Congress in person on March 1, 1945, {{about a month}} before his death, he made public reference to his disability for almost {{the first time in}} 20 years. [...] "I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down," [...] Roosevelt began, [...] "but I know you will realize that it makes it a lot easier <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 {{season was}} the first in which Coulthard was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team. He was optimistic for the new season, saying: [...] "If they need an opinion then they have to come to me this year. In the past they didn't. But that said, it's important <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get bogged down in the history of what happened in the past. We just have to go forward." [...] He endured a torrid start: Coulthard's car suffered from gearbox issues and retired after 35 laps; and in the following race in Malaysia, both cars retired from engine failure after 24 laps. Two weeks later in the Brazilian Grand Prix, Coulthard secured his first podium of the season with a third-place finish. The start managed to get better as Coulthard took four consecutive finishes inside of the points; this included his only victory of the season in Monaco.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, Nees was {{instrumental}} in the purchase of a flatbed plotter, the Zuse Graphomat Z64 designed by Konrad Zuse, for the data center at the Schuckertwerke in Erlangen. At the exhibition Georg Nees - The Great Temptation at the ZKM Nees said: ″There it was, the great temptation <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> once <b>not</b> <b>to</b> represent something technical with this machine but rather something ‘useless’ - geometrical patterns.″ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} {{that you will not}} be my wife--that you care <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but <b>not</b> enough <b>to</b> marry me?" [...] he cried. She shook her head slowly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{say it in}} that way, my dear, or else you'll make {{me think}} you mean to turn a cold {{shoulder}} on <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> coming <b>to</b> you before." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Larry Sanger left Wikipedia, Wales's {{approach}} {{was different from}} Sanger's. Wales was fairly hands-off. Despite involvement in other projects, Wales has denied intending to reduce his role within Wikipedia, telling The New York Times in 2008 that [...] "Dialing down {{is not an option}} <b>for</b> <b>me...</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> be too dramatic about it, but, 'to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language,' that's who I am. That's what I am doing. That's my life goal." [...] In May 2010, the BBC reported that Wales had relinquished many of his technical privileges on Wikimedia Commons (a Wikipedia sister project that hosts much of its multimedia content) after criticism by the project's volunteer community over what they saw as Wales's hasty and undemocratic approach to deleting sexually explicit images he believed [...] "appeal solely to prurient interests".|$|E
2500|$|When Davout marched from Naumburg {{to glory}} at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused {{to join his}} fellow marshal despite {{positive}} orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt. Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy. The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary, [...] "This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial {{it will be the}} equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> speak to him about it, but I shall take care he shall know what I think of his behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him." [...] In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife Désirée Clary, whom he almost married.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, isn't it lovely here--like the country! I'm afraid I must go; it's my practice-time. It's so {{important}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> miss any now, isn't it?" [...] And she rose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. A very neat way {{of putting}} it. And now here is a minor point. On second thoughts, I think the best plan will be <b>for</b> you, <b>not</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> lace the juice." ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR Sir:--I {{am not in}} a {{position}} where it would hurt much <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> be nominated on the national ticket; but I am where it would hurt some <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> get the Illinois delegates. What I expected when I wrote the letter to Messrs. Dole and others is now happening. Your discomfited assailants are most bitter against me; and they will, <b>for</b> revenge upon <b>me,</b> lay to the Bates egg in the South, and to the Seward egg in the North, and go far toward squeezing me out in the middle with nothing. Can you help me a little in this matter in your end of the vineyard. I mean this to be private.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{seen him}} {{once or twice}} before he fell into Broughton's hands; the {{imported}} Red Rover strain is marked in him, {{and a friend of}} mine, who's going in <b>for</b> Herefords, told <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> stick at a few dollars if I could pick up such a bull." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No,--not exactly," [...] he replied. [...] "But [buoyantly] it's a {{great deal}} better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take {{anything}} in a hurry and tie myself to any particular line. Now, I'm quite free." ...|$|E
60|$|LOB (bursting into tears). I {{wanted you}} to go. I had set my heart on your going. It is the thing I wanted, and it isn't good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get the thing I want.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hoped so. I am so thankful. So {{well done}} of you, Charley dear! It is better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come (except {{when he wants}} me) {{between him and his}} prospects. You think so, Mr Headstone?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Aham pacami, ime ne pacanti, na arahami pacanto apacantanam adatun ti danam deti: [...] "I cook, {{they do not}} cook. It is <b>not</b> proper <b>for</b> <b>me</b> who cooks <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give {{to those}} who do not cook." [...] Some give urged by such altruistic motives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! but you will, Monsieur," [...] she entreated in accents that {{completed}} my subjugation to her charms. [...] "Besides, you do <b>not</b> know <b>me!</b> How could I {{expect you}} <b>to</b> work <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> know if, in the end, I should repay {{you for all}} your trouble? I pray you to take this small sum without demur. Mr. Farewell keeps me well supplied with pocket money. There will be another hundred {{for you when you}} place the papers in my hands." ...|$|R
60|$|Adam. In vain! {{my right}} to thee is sealed above; Look round and see where thou canst place thy love: All creatures else are much unworthy thee; They matched, and thou alone art left <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> If <b>not</b> <b>to</b> love, we both were made in vain; I my new empire would resign again, And change with my dumb slaves my nobler mind, Who, void of reason, more of {{pleasure}} find. Methinks, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> they beg; each silently Demands thy grace, and seems to watch thy eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} more than {{endeavour}} on this occasion. I went down to Hendon Hall, and was shown into the drawing-room. I am sorry for Hampstead's sake, {{but it was impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, women's faces {{have had}} too much power over me already <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fear them! An evangelist {{has nothing to do}} with such as they; and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{postscript}} gave me {{the excuse}} that I wanted. I knew perfectly well {{that it would be}} better <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see her--and I went to London, for the sole purpose of seeing her, by the first train.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be as damn colloquial as I want to. How do you {{get that}} 'thanks to you'? Here {{about a year ago}} you jump <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> remembering <b>to</b> give you money. Well, I'm reasonable. I didn't blame you, and I SAID I was to blame. But have I ever {{forgotten}} it since--practically?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I'm <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> wait much longer," [...] {{said the}} Paladin; [...] "and when I do start you'll hear from me, I promise you that. There are some who, in {{storming}} a castle, {{prefer to be}} in the rear; but as <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> give me the front or none; I will have none in front of me but the officers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And proof another. Yes, I know; and I'm as sorry as you {{are this}} should have come here,' tapping the body with his cane. 'The next best thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{recognise}} it; and,' he added coolly, 'I don't. You may, if you please. I don't dictate, but I think {{a man of the}} world would do as I do; and I may add, I fancy that is what K- would look for at our hands. The question is, Why did he choose us two for his assistants? And I answer, because he didn't want old wives.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive this liberty," [...] began Ferrand, [...] "but I {{thought it}} due to you after all you've done <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> throw up my {{efforts to get}} {{employment}} in England without letting you know first. I'm entirely {{at the end of}} my resources." ...|$|E
60|$|Since {{that awful}} night in Rothland Wood, my mother's {{behaviour}} towards me {{had been a}} source of constant and painful wonder. She had become an enigma, and an enigma which I somehow felt that it would be well <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> attempt to solve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] Bransome answered. [...] "It is just {{possible}} that this person requires an immediate reply, in which case it may be convenient <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to get}} at the Prime Minister. Bring him along into my private room, Sidney." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} wrong {{of you to}} keep it," [...] Grizel answered, [...] "but I can't take it to him, for I see now that his reason <b>for</b> wanting <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come here was to prevent my hearing about it. I am sorry you told me. Corp must take it back." [...] But when she saw it being crushed in Corp's rough hand, a pity for the {{helpless}} glove came over her. She said: [...] "After all, I do know about it, so I can't pretend to him that I don't. I will give it to him, Corp"; and she put the little package in her pocket with a brave smile.|$|R

This follows the tragic accident of LaMia Flight 2933 which took place on 28 November 2016, claiming the lives of 71 passengers. Only 6 survived; 3 of which were Chapecoense players.|$|R
60|$|HORNBLOWER. [Who {{has shown}} a sign of weakening] Now, look here! I will not have revolt in my family. Ye'll just have to learn that a man who's worked as I have, who's risen as I have, and who knows the world, is the proper judge of what's right and wrong. I'll answer to God <b>for</b> <b>me</b> actions, and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> you young people.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand to take leave. How could I reply? If I had been a {{resolute}} man, I might have remembered that it would be best <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> see too much of her. But I am a poor weak creature--I accepted her invitation for the next day.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{allow you}} to study," [...] replied Forester, [...] "all this forenoon, but to require you to sit still at your desk, with nothing to do. You see {{it will be a}} sort of solitary imprisonment, only your prison will in itself be a {{pleasant}} place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My love,' {{observed}} Mr. Micawber, 'it {{is impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{be touched by}} your affection. I am always willing to defer to your good sense.

5000|$|Growing up in Sydney, Mozgawa {{was raised}} by her Polish parents, who had moved from Poland to Australia to perform music {{together}} as a musical duo. Regarding her musical family, Mozgawa noted: [...] "It would have been totally unnatural <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> play an instrument in the family. That said, when I told my mum I wanted to play drums, she was like, 'No fuckin' way!' We managed to sort things out after that though".|$|R
6000|$|... "Villa {{has turned}} against the Americans," [...] replied Harding, dully. [...] "The {{operator}} evidently feels friendly toward us, <b>for</b> she warned <b>me</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> appeal to Villa and told me why. Even now, this minute, the man has a force of twenty-five hundred ready to march on Columbus, New Mexico. Three Americans were hanged in Cuivaca this afternoon. It's horrible, sir! It's horrible! We {{are as good as}} dead this very minute. Even if we stand off Pesita we can never escape to the border through Villa's forces." ...|$|R
