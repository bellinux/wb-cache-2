Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. <b>Individuals</b> <b>are</b> motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study the comet assay was {{performed}} in buccal epithelial cells to evaluate DNA damage among pan masala or gutkha chewers and smokers. The assay is a rapid, suitable and sensitive method for detecting various forms of DNA damage at individual cell level. The study comprises 300 individuals of which 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> gutkha chewers along with smoking, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> pan masala chewers along with smoking, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> gutkha chewers, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> pan masala chewers, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> smokers and 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> non-users (control) or not having any addiction. Comet tail length was observed to measure the extent of DNA damage. In all groups {{a significant increase in}} the tail length was observed as compared to the non-users (control). The highest tail length was observed among gutkha chewers along with smoking (36. 9 ± 3. 60). The results of {{the present study}} suggest that the panmasala and gutkha are genotoxic agents and induce DNA damage...|$|R
50|$|In an {{autosomal}} recessive disease, if an <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> heterozygous for the mutant allele, {{they are a}} carrier because the disease is recessive. If homozygous, they have the disease. All offspring of an affected <b>individual</b> <b>are</b> either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutated allele. Consequently, all unaffected (heterozygous) offspring of an affected <b>individual</b> <b>are</b> obligate carriers of the disease because they will necessarily carry the mutated allele.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} Wild Pig Syndrome will run its course, and no {{treatment}} is needed. In severe cases the individual {{will return to}} the village in the wild state, in which the <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> captured and a ceremony is held where the <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> restrained over a smoking fire until he returns to his normal state. Then the <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> rubbed down with liquefied pig fat; a small pig is killed in his name by a person of high status in the village, then afterward the <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> presented with a collection of cooked tubers and roots.|$|R
5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate. For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, the use of levofloxacin {{as part of the}} therapy has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> {{free to choose}} either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus is {{currently}} regarded as having two valid species: type species E. regalis, and E. annectens. E. regalis is known {{only from the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, dating from the late Campanian stage of the late Cretaceous period. At least a dozen <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> known, including seven skulls with associated postcrania, and five to seven other skulls. The species formerly known as Thespesius edmontoni or Anatosaurus edmontoni represents immature individuals.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, and analytical chemistry. Once in the position, <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> trained in the protocols that are performed at that specific lab until they can prove they are competent to perform all experiments without supervision.. Practicing chemists already {{in the field are}} expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency.|$|E
5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E

5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, cheetahs {{are poor}} breeders in captivity, while wild <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> far more successful. In a 1992 study, females in Serengeti {{were found to}} have 95% success rate in breeding. In contrast, only 20% of the North American captive cheetahs bred {{successfully}} in 1991. Studies have shown that in-vitro fertilisation in cheetah poses more difficulties than are faced in the case of other cats.|$|E
