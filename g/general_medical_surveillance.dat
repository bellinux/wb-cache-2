Nanoparticles may, just {{by virtue of}} their size, exert biological effects unrelated to the chemicals they are composed of. These considerations, and results from experimental animal studies suggesting that engineered nanomaterials may pose a health hazard to employees, all underscore the need for preventive measures. In this context, the need for, the feasibility, and the appropriateness of targeted occupational <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> are currently subject to debate. Methods We compared established concepts for the development of occupational <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> programs to existing knowledge on exposures in workplaces and on health effects of nanomaterials. Results A variety of potential effect parameters have been proposed for <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> of exposed personnel, such as heart rate variability, blood-clotting parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines, etc. None of these parameters are specific, most are not validated as individual health risk indicators, and some require sophisticated equipment not routinely available. Against this background, BASF currently puts specific weight on risk assessment and exposure control in workplaces. Particle emissions are primarily avoided by manufacturing in closed systems or using effective extraction systems. Appropriate personal protective equipment has been defined for such operations where an exposure potential cannot be excluded. Conclusions While there is presently no evidence-based foundation for “nano-specific” occupational medical screening, one can perform <b>general</b> <b>medical</b> screening with methods targeted at some of the health outcomes under discussion.

As a result, communities invest substantially in <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> to protect first responders. Yet, {{little is known}} as to the actual exposures, consequent injuries, and cost-effectiveness of <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Objective: The {{purposes of this study}} were: 1) Determine actual HAZMAT threats. 2) In light of these threats, evaluate current regulatory requirements, recommendations and practices for their basis in evidence. Methods: National HAZMAT data was analyzed for trends and compared with local response records from 2008 through 2011. Regulations applicable to <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> (federal, state and local) were reviewed and compared with local practice. Results: An increasing trend was noted nationally in HAZMAT incidents, but not injuries. Locally, departments responded to 62 HAZMAT calls over four years. The most common call situations involved chemical hazards (32 %), and petroleum spills. Roads and parking lots were the most common site (39 %), with manufacturing and processing facilities next (13 %). HAZMAT technicians reported no injuries. Conclusions: While HAZMAT incidents (but not injuries) increased nationally, 62 local events resulted in no technician injuries. HAZMAT team response procedures and equipment appear to be extremely effective. Efforts to reduce injuries from such incidents should be aimed at those most immediate to the hazard – company employees and the public.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} to engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) {{is considered a}} new and challenging occurrence. Preliminary information from laboratory studies indicates that workers exposed to some kinds of ENMs could be at risk of adverse health effects. To protect the nanomaterial workforce, a precautionary risk management approach is warranted and given the newness of ENMs and emergence of nanotechnology, a naturalistic view of risk management is useful. Employers have the primary responsibility for providing a safe and healthy workplace. This is achieved by identifying and managing risks which include recognition of hazards, assessing exposures, characterizing actual risk, and implementing measures to control those risks. Following traditional risk management models for nanomaterials is challenging because of uncertainties {{about the nature of}} hazards, issues in exposure assessment, questions about appropriate control methods, and lack of occupational exposure limits (OELs) or nano-specific regulations. In the absence of OELs specific for nanomaterials, a precautionary approach has been recommended in many countries. The precautionary approach entails minimizing exposures by using engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE). Generally, risk management utilizes the hierarchy of controls. Ideally, risk management for nanomaterials should be part of an enterprise-wide risk management program or system and this should include both risk control and a <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> program that assesses the frequency of adverse effects among groups of workers exposed to nanomaterials. In some cases, the <b>medical</b> <b>surveillance</b> could include <b>medical</b> screening of individual workers to detect early signs of work-related illnesses.
