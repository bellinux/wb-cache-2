40|$|Heterotopic {{ossification}} (HO) {{is defined}} as the process by which trabecular bone forms outside of the skeletal structure, occupying space in soft tissue where it does not normally exist. The current popular prophylactic treatment modalities include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and radiation therapy, although the literature remains inconclusive as to which is superior. Additionally, both treatments can lead to adverse effects to the patient. Recently there have been several studies attempting to identify new aspects of the etiology of heterotopic bone formation and introduce new prophylactic modalities with increased efficacy and fewer side effects. For this review, we selectively retrieved articles from Medline published from 1958 – 2008 on the prophylaxis of HO with the aim of assisting readers in quickly grasping the current status of research and clinical aspects of HO prophylaxis.

40|$|This {{chapter of}} the Cleaner Technologies Substitutes Assessment (CTSA) {{addresses}} the health and environmental hazards, exposures, and risks that may result from using a making holes conductive (MHC) technology. The information presented here focuses entirely on MHC technologies. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not,</b> <b>nor</b> is it intended to, represent {{the full range of}} hazards or risks that could be associated with printed wiring board (PWB) manufacturing. Section 3. 1 identifies possible sources of environmental releases from MHC manufacturing and, in some cases, discusses the nature and quantity of those releases. Section 3. 2 assesses occupational and general population (i. e., the public living near a PWB facility; fish in streams that receive wastewater from PWB facilities) exposures to MHC chemicals. This section quantitatively estimates inhalation and dermal exposure to workers and inhalation exposure to the public living near a PWB facility. Section 3. 3 presents human health hazard and aquatic toxicity data for MHC chemicals. Section 3. 4 characterizes the risks and concerns associated with the exposures estimated in Section 3. 2. In all of these sections, the methodologies or models used to estimate releases, exposures, or risks are described along with the associated assumptions and uncertainties. In order to protect the identity of the proprietar...|$|E

For the most part, women were the subjects not the artists. Historically, the female body was regarded as being an object of desire for the pleasure of men. In the early 20th century we see works that flaunted female sexuality- the pin-up girl being a good example. By the late 1960s however, there was a plethora of feminine artwork that broke from the tradition of depicting women in a sexualized fashion.|$|R
