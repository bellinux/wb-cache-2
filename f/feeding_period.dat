25|$|Copper is {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of human fetuses, infants, and children. The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its liver during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. Human milk is relatively low in copper, and the neonate's liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the breast <b>feeding</b> <b>period.</b> These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as cellular respiration, melanin pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, gene expression, and the normal functioning of the heart and immune systems in infants.|$|E
40|$|Thirty {{tethered}} sows {{were observed}} for 5 min every half-hour for 9 h spanning the two <b>feeding</b> <b>periods.</b> Activity, consisting largely of food searching behaviour and drinking, was largely restricted to two 2 -h <b>periods</b> following each <b>feed.</b> Three categories of stereotyped behaviour were observed {{and these were}} {{closely tied to the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>periods.</b> Short-duration bouts of rubbing, head-waving and bar-biting occurred during food delivery, while long-duration bouts of highly stereotyped and idiosyncratic sequences of rubbing and drinking were shown by older sows immediately after feeding. Vaccuum chewing tended to occur slightly later. I suggest that frustration of feeding motivation rather than under-stimulation underlies stereotypies in pigs, and that the different forms may represent stereotype of the appetitive and consummatory phases. Aggression was rare and was not closely related to the <b>feeding</b> <b>periods</b> or to stereotypies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the main aspects that {{characterize}} the feeding and rumination behavior of threemonths old calves during the summer season when daily temperatures were normal (daily peak of + 30 °C) and duringdays with very high temperatures (daily peak + 41 °C). During the experiments the following feeding and ruminationbehavior aspects were determined: number of <b>feeding</b> <b>periods,</b> the length of <b>feeding</b> <b>periods,</b> number of ruminatingperiods and length of rumination periods. Results showed that calves spent feeding, on average 383. 7 minutes per dayduring 13. 1 <b>feeding</b> <b>periods</b> with an average length of 29. 5 minutes when the when the daily temperatures werenormal and 341. 7 minutes per day during 12. 9 <b>feeding</b> <b>periods</b> with an average length of 26. 7 minutes when the dailytemperatures were very high.

40|$|Ten {{children}} with advanced cirrhosis and malnutrition (less than 90 % weight for height) were fed {{for eight weeks}} with a nasogastric feed comprising whey protein (enriched with branched chain amino acids), fat as 34 % medium chain and 66 % long chain triglycerides, and glucose polymer. Six {{of the children were}} studied for an eight week control <b>period</b> before <b>feeding.</b> Weight, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle area, and fasting plasma ammonia and amino acid concentrations were measured before and after the control period and after the consequent <b>feed</b> <b>period.</b> Results showed that despite high energy and protein intakes the children remained malnourished over the control period. All anthropometric indices improved significantly during the <b>feed</b> <b>period,</b> and no child developed clinical encephalopathy. The <b>feed</b> <b>period</b> was associated with a small, and not clinically significant, increase in the plasma ammonia concentration, but no consistent trend in the plasma amino acid concentrations.

25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from sieves that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The sieve bottom allowed the lice to stick out their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard <b>feeding</b> <b>period</b> took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the discomfort of the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse had to watch over the feeding process as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|E
500|$|A {{study of}} black {{honeyeaters}} at seven sites in Western Australia regularly recorded breeding females eating ash from the campsite fires and often making repeated visits over {{a brief period}} of time. It was noted that the birds seemed attracted to the remote campfire with groups of around six hovering around and landing beside the fire, an activity described as similar to [...] "bees buzzing around a honeypot." [...] After pecking at the ash, some of the females foraged for insects, sallying from the foliage of nearby Wheatbelt wandoo (Eucalyptus capillosa) before returning for more ash. The activity of the females approaching the fire ranged from a single peck to sustained feeding for a minute or more. Male birds occasionally landed near the fire, but none were seen to take ash. Well developed brood patches on the birds mist netted near the fires, suggest that the females take ash around the time of laying, and throughout the incubation and <b>feeding</b> <b>period.</b> Wood ash is rich in calcium and it was hypothesised that the females were eating ash to form medullary bone before egg-laying or to repair a calcium deficit after laying. When other small birds, such as American hummingbirds, were recorded eating calcium-rich ash, bones or shell it was suggested that the bones of small species {{may not be able to}} store enough calcium for egg production.|$|E
2500|$|The EU report {{notes that}} {{continued}} force feeding leads to early {{death of the}} animal, and the birds are typically slaughtered just at the point that mortality would drastically increase from the force feeding.

40|$|Traditional break-even/fed cattle price {{projections}} do {{not provide}} adequate risk information to feeders, investors, lenders, and other stakeholders interested in cattle feeding decisions. The objectives {{of this study were}} two-fold: 1) develop a spreadsheet model that could estimate the net income distribution surrounding a cattle placement decision based on historical errors of futures based price forecasts, and 2) determine whether information generated from the model can be used to improve placement and marketing decisions. To accomplish objective 1, model was developed that could estimate the income distribution around a pen of cattle under a cash speculating and short hedge pricing strategy. Distribution estimates were based on 7 alternative forecast horizons and were derived from historical forecast errors. To accomplish objective 2, decision rules were developed that allow the feeder to specify the maximum probability he/she is willing to risk losing a specified level of income. These decision rules were compared to random and naive decision rules by simulating the outcomes over 168 discrete six months <b>feeding</b> <b>periods</b> between 1987 and 2000. Risk averse decision rules were successful in signaling highly unprofitable <b>feeding</b> <b>periods,</b> but also filtered out highly profitable <b>feeding</b> <b>periods.</b> Livestock Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the main aspects that {{characterize}} the feeding behavior in six months old calves fed using three different feed spaces allowance. During the experiments the following feeding behavior aspects were determined: number of <b>feeding</b> <b>periods,</b> the length of <b>feeding</b> <b>periods</b> and the total length of <b>feeding</b> <b>periods.</b> Results showed that calves spent feeding, on average, 292 minutes in the morning, 198 minutes in the afternoon and only 71 minutes during the night when the length of feeding space was 0. 6 m per calf. Calves spent feeding 175 minutes during the morning, 193 minutes during the afternoon and 53 minutes during the night when the length of the feeding space was 0. 32 m per calf. Calves spent feeding 255 minutes during the morning, 227 minutes during the afternoon and 30 minutes during the night when the length of the feeding space was 0. 28 m per calf.

50|$|Once the {{nematode}} {{arrives at}} a root tip, it feeds by puncturing several successive layers of the plant's cells with its odontostyle; while penetrating, the nematode secretes enzymes that result in cell hypertrophy and thickening. The nematode is then able to begin extracting the cell's cytoplasm. The <b>feeding</b> <b>period</b> of X. americanum can last anywhere from several hours to several days, with the average being around 36 hours at each feeding site along the plant's roots. While feeding, {{it is common for}} the nematodes to remain still with their bodies either outstretched or curled, and following the <b>feeding</b> <b>period</b> they move slowly {{along the length of the}} root with their stylet remaining protruded and in search of a new feeding site. Unlike some species of nematodes, the observation of food passing into the gut of X. americanum is not seen. Although the nematodes are non-specific in their Host Range, they generally feed on plants that are in poorer condition for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
