5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails</b> {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it. Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E

25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails</b> to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails,</b> the pressure difference will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma. The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth if the air supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E

25|$|Flipper {{solenoids}} contain two {{coil windings}} in one package; a short, heavy gage 'power' winding {{to give the}} flipper its initial thrust up, and a long, light gage 'hold' winding that uses lower power (and creates far less heat) and essentially just holds the flipper up allowing the player to capture {{the ball in the}} inlane for more precise aiming. As the flipper nears the end of its upward travel, a switch under the flipper disconnects the power-winding and leaves only the second sustain winding to hold the flipper up in place. If this switch fails 'open' the flipper will be too weak to be usable, since only the weak winding is available. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails</b> 'closed' the coil will overheat and destroy itself, since both windings will hold the flipper at the top of its stroke.|$|E
25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware used to read the media <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails,</b> is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.|$|E
25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that means that we can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work will be performed as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, and then <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails</b> at some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last branching point, and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough work to get the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E

25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and checked for leaks, umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails</b> the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|E

[...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could bring us to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>fails,</b> it could kill us all."
