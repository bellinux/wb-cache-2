Was {{a heavily}} {{modified}} Nikon F3 (Japan) 35 mm SLR and MD-4 motor drive with 1024×1280 pixel (1.3 MP) charge-coupled-device (CCD) sensor, 8 MB DRAM memory and a tethered 200 MB (160 images) <b>Digital</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit</b> (DSU) hard drive. Used manual focus Nikon F mount lenses with 2× lens {{field of view}} factor compared to standard 135 film. List price was US$19,995 (standard Nikon F3HP was US$1295 list; MD-4, US$485). Electronic still (then using analogue processing and called still video) photography was first publicly demonstrated by original Sony Mavica (Japan) 490×570 pixel (280 kP) CCD, prototype SLR camera in 1981. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has called the DCS's Kodak KAF-1300 (USA, 1986) image sensor one of [...] "25 Microchips That Shook the World" [...] because the DCS began the digital photography revolution. Digital photography did not alter the basic focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror, pentaprism, auto-diaphragm lens, TTL meter, autoexposure and autofocus formula of SLR camera design developed over the previous century - except, of course, it is filmless.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} more {{economically}} use energy in industrial processes, <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> {{can be integrated}} into processes. Latent heat <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> enable an isothermal energy storage and release, which is applicable in two-phase industrial processes. This concept has been demonstrated in low-temperature applications such as heating and refrigeration; however experience in the high temperature range is limited. Cost effective implementation of <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> demands cost effective designs of the <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> Due to the usually low thermal conductivity in the phase change materials, a fin design has been developed to counter this deficiency. However, a balance has to be found between the added fin materials and their costs {{and the increase in}} heat transfer. To more effectively design <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> for high temperature applications, the rate of heat transfer in the storage material has to be better quantified and a layout tool can be created.

40|$|Electric <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> {{constitute}} {{a key element}} in the emerging smart grid system. In this paper, the interactions and energy trading decisions of a number of geographically distributed <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> are studied using a novel framework based on game theory. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> such as PHEVs, or an array of batteries that are trading their stored energy. Here, each <b>storage</b> <b>unit's</b> owner can decide on the maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the revenues from energy trading and the accompanying costs. Then in this energy exchange market between the <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> and the smart grid elements, the price at which energy is traded is determined via an auction mechanism. The game is shown to admit at least one Nash equilibrium and a novel proposed algorithm that is guaranteed to reach such an equilibrium point is proposed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate heat storage in a heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM heat storage model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the heat <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> heated from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> heated from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall heat storage model was developed to combine heat supply, heat storage and heat distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> and the heat transfer rate to the surroundings. The heat supplied to the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was based on calculations of batch combustion of wood. The results showed that none of the tests for the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> or the optimization of the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> reached the requirements of heat transfer to the surroundings set for the model. The length of the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was also proved to be excessive...|$|R
