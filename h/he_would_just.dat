500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg {{made a deal}} with Paramount Pictures for five Indiana Jones films. Following the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lucas let the series end as he felt he could not think of a good plot device to drive the next installment, and chose instead to produce The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles for TV, which {{explored}} the character in his early years. Harrison Ford played Indiana in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 Chicago. When Lucas shot Ford's role in December 1992, he realized the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction 1950s B-movie, with aliens as the plot device. Meanwhile, Spielberg believed he was going to [...] "mature" [...] as a filmmaker after making the trilogy, and felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> produce any future installments.|$|E
500|$|Babayane and Mshete {{had arrived}} back in Bulawayo in August, {{accompanied}} by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that [...] "If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country, {{it is not}} so." [...] But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> have to accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: [...] "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly." ...|$|E

500|$|Around {{the time}} of Henson's characters' final {{appearances}} on SNL, he began developing two projects featuring the Muppets: a Broadway show and a weekly television series. In 1976, the series was initially rejected by the American networks who believed that Muppets would appeal to only a child audience. Then Henson pitched the show to British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show. The show would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where The Muppet Show began taping. The Muppet Show featured Kermit as host, {{and a variety of}} other memorable characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, along with other characters such as Animal. Kermit's role on The Muppet Show was often compared by his co-workers to Henson's role in Muppet Productions: a shy, gentle boss with [...] "A whim of steel" [...] who [...] " [...] things as firmly as it is possible to run an explosion in a mattress factory." [...] Caroll Spinney, the puppet performer of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, remembered that Henson [...] "would never say he didn't like something. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> go 'Hmm.' That was famous. And if he liked it, he would say, 'Lovely!' [...] " [...] Henson himself recognized Kermit as an alter-ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; he once said of the character, [...] "He can say things I hold back." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Story" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who previously directed the videos for the singles from Taylor Swift. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again {{because she had been}} able to balance both of their ideas for music videos, something Swift appreciated deeply. The video is a period piece that draws influence from Medieval, Renaissance, and Regency eras. Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed. When writing the song, she envisioned it in a prior time period, and encoded it with details accordingly. She believed [...] "Love Story"'s plot was a timeless scenario: [...] "I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008." [...] Thus, she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest. With six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of Nashville Star, recommended contestant Justin Gaston. Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video. Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a [...] "Prince Charming that could've been alive in the 1800s." [...] However, because Gaston was competing on Nashville Star, he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video. Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: [...] "I was so impressed by the way his [...] were in the video. Without even saying anything, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> do a certain glance and it really came across well." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{letters were}} very informal; {{sometimes}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> write {{the name of}} the person and start the letter. He was very humorous and wrote very interesting letters. In one letter he wrote, [...] "Main koshish karta hoon ke koi aisi baat likhoon jo padhe khush ho jaaye'" [...] (I want to write lines such that whoever reads them would enjoy them). Some scholars say that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu literature {{on the basis of his}} letters only. They have been translated into English by Ralph Russell in The Oxford Ghalib.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wording of}} this clause caused much {{controversy}} {{at the time}} it was first used. When William Henry Harrison died in office, a debate arose over whether the Vice President would become President, or if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> inherit the powers, thus becoming an Acting President. Harrison's Vice President, John Tyler, believed that he had the right to become President. However, many Senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election. Because the wording of the clause is so vague, it was impossible for either side to prove its point. Tyler took the Oath of Office as President, setting a precedent that made it possible for later Vice Presidents to ascend to the presidency unchallenged following the President's death. The [...] "Tyler Precedent" [...] established that if the President dies, resigns or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes President.|$|E
2500|$|The Master and the Doctor {{are shown}} to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates on Gallifrey, where the Master {{outperformed}} the Doctor. A similar {{connection between the two}} was also referenced in The End of Time in which the Master reminisces with the Tenth Doctor about his father's estates on Gallifrey and his childhood with the Doctor before saying [...] "look at us now". In the 2007 episode [...] "Utopia", the Tenth Doctor calls the transformed and disguised Master a genius and shows admiration for his intellect before discovering his true identity. The Tenth Doctor further expresses admiration for the Master's intellect in The End of Time by calling him [...] "stone cold brilliant" [...] and yet states that the Master could be more if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> give up his desire for domination. The Twelfth Doctor states that Missy is [...] "the one person almost as smart as me" [...] ("The Lie of the Land").|$|E
2500|$|Lucas rarely {{spoke to}} the actors, who felt that he {{expected}} too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "more intense". Kurtz stated that [...] "it happened a lot where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, they just get on with it. But some actors really {{need a lot of}} pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job." [...] Kurtz has said that Lucas [...] "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite {{his success}} at the junior and college levels, Gordon {{experienced}} a difficult transition to pro hockey, in large part due to his sub-par skating ability. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> register <b>just</b> 25 points in 63 games for the Syracuse Crunch, Vancouver's AHL affiliate in 1996-97, and was at one point demoted to the ECHL. The following season, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> record <b>just</b> 10 points in 40 games. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> finally get up to speed in 1998-99, improving to respectable totals of 16 goals and 38 points for Syracuse, and earning himself a four-game callup to the Canucks. However, his development was still considered a disappointment, and he was released by the Canucks following the season.|$|R
2500|$|Puyi {{soon learned}} that the real reasons for the Articles of Favorable Settlement was that President Yuan Shikai was {{planning}} on restoring the monarchy with himself as the Emperor of a new dynasty, and wanted to have Puyi {{as a sort of}} custodian of the Forbidden City until he could move in. Puyi first learned of Yuan's plans to become Emperor when he brought in army bands to serenade him whenever he had a meal, and he started on a decidedly imperial take on the presidency. Puyi spent hours staring at the Presidential Palace across from the Forbidden City and cursed Yuan whenever he saw him come and go in his automobile. Puyi hated Yuan as a [...] "traitor" [...] and decided to sabotage his plans to become Emperor by hiding the Imperial Seals, only to be told by his tutors that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> make new ones. In 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor, but had to abandon his plans in the face of popular opposition.|$|E

"True Romance" [...] was {{recorded}} {{late into the}} process; drums for the entire album had already been recorded and the group's drummer, Tony Thaxton, was to be leaving town on a plane the very next day; he tracked drums two hours prior to his flight. [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was described as [...] "just a quirky love song {{about a guy who}} doesn't really get it." [...] Cain's guitar solo was written as a joke of sorts, but was eventually kept on the record which Cain later found amusing. [...] "Timelines" [...] is directly autobiographical, covering Pierre's beginnings in Catholic school, a stuttering problem, and losing his virginity at 17. It was developed from an acoustic guitar lick Cain created while on tour; the initial eight bars of the song were recorded and quickly forgotten about. Taylor later found the file when sifting through his computer, and the band tackled the song from there. The influence behind the lyrics came from Pierre's father. [...] "Something my Dad used to always say to me, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> say, 'J, it's all about timing. Being at {{the right place at the}} right time.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{developed}} the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the Bay Area and coming across a wallaby {{that seemed to}} be oblivious to the chaos around him.

Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had [...] "forgotten about" [...] the concept and was working on My Dog Zero when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for My Dog Zero. On his website he describes My Dog Zero as [...] "that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to Rocko." [...] "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic" [...] was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that Heffer Wolfe, one of the characters, would be [...] "a little too weird for test audiences". Murray, instead of removing Heffer from [...] "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic", decided to write [...] "Trash-O-Madness" [...] as the pilot episode.|$|E
