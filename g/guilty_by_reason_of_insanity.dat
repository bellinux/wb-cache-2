5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{was indicted}} on eight counts of {{first degree murder}} on May 7, 1973. He was {{assigned}} the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson—who had defended John Linley Frazier and also been assigned to the Herbert Mullin case—but due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> to the charges. Kemper twice {{tried to commit suicide}} in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.|$|E
25|$|Woodcock {{was tried}} {{only for the}} murder of Carole Voyce. On April 11, 1957, after a four-day trial, he was found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and was sent to the Oak Ridge {{division}} of the maximum-security Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre in Penetanguishene, Ontario.|$|E
50|$|On August 30, 2004, Hirte {{was charged}} with first-degree murder. He was held in Winnebago County jail on $400,000 bond. He pleaded not guilty, and later changed his plea to not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> mental disease or defect. If he were found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> mental disease or defect, Hirte {{would be able to}} {{petition}} every six months for release.|$|R

25|$|Three {{separate}} {{mental health}} examinations determined that Berkowitz was competent to stand trial. Despite this, defense lawyers advised Berkowitz {{to enter a}} plea of not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> but Berkowitz refused. He appeared calm in court on May 8, 1978, as {{he pleaded guilty to}} all of the shootings.|$|E

25|$|Sweeney was {{eventually}} found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> {{and committed to}} full-time psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia. By 1992, Sweeney was on 16-hour-a-day furloughs. Members of the Lowenstein family, who had opposed prosecutorial plans to seek a sentence of death for Sweeney, expressed grave concern about the supervision Sweeney would receive and anger that a murderer was being given such privileges.|$|E
50|$|Originally, South Africa {{followed}} English law, {{using the}} “guilty but insane” formula, but in 1977 {{the verdict was}} changed to “not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> mental illness or mental defect.” Section 78(8)(a) of the CPA allows an appeal against such a finding. Whether or not the verdict in insanity cases is tantamount to an acquittal, from which no appeal is allowed, and whether the State may appeal against a verdict <b>of</b> not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> mental illness or defect—these conundrums {{have not yet been}} answered by the courts.|$|R

His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.|$|E
25|$|Gacy had {{attempted}} to convince the doctors that he suffered from a multiple personality disorder. His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> to the charges against him, and produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy the previous year to testify to their findings. Three psychiatric experts appearing for the defense at Gacy's trial testified they found Gacy to be a paranoid schizophrenic with a multiple personality disorder.|$|E

5000|$|... "Not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity" [...] (NGRI) is one {{potential}} outcome {{in this type}} of trial.

25|$|On July 26, 2006, the Texas jury in her retrial {{found that}} Yates was not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> She was {{consequently}} {{committed by the}} court to the North Texas State Hospital, Vernon Campus, a high-security mental health facility in Vernon, where she received medical treatment and was a roommate of Dena Schlosser, another woman who committed infanticide by killing her infant daughter. In January 2007, she was moved to a low security state mental hospital in Kerrville, Kerrville State Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Reported to {{have been}} driven by an obsessive {{fixation}} on Jodie Foster, he was found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and remained under institutional psychiatric care until September 2016. Public outcry over the verdict led to the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, which altered the rules for consideration of mental illness of defendants in Federal Criminal Court proceedings in the United States. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and lives full-time at his mother's home.|$|E
25|$|Garner was stalked by Steven Burky from 2002 to 2003, {{and again}} from 2008 to 2009. She, her husband, and her {{daughter}} Violet obtained a restraining order in 2008.

He was charged with two counts of stalking, to which he pleaded not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> In March 2010, he was ruled insane, sent to California's state mental hospital, and ordered {{to stay away from}} the Affleck family for 10 years if released from hospital.|$|E
50|$|After a {{trial in}} Lansing, Michigan, Francine was found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> {{temporary}} insanity. Both {{the prosecution and the}} defense agreed that Francine's plight was sympathetic. However, no jurors have ever confirmed publicly whether that was a factor in their decision. The concept of jury nullification may apply here.|$|R

[...] His daughter Ruth was not called to testify as a witness during the trial.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps.

He was found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> {{and was sentenced to}} serve time in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism has been that the Peace Corps seemingly worked to keep one of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it would have on the organization.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} members of her family preoccupied, Miriam's {{obsession}} takes a new turn when she finds herself entering people's houses and stealing small objects from them. Several times she is almost discovered, but, though she tries to anchor herself to the real world through emotionally detached sex with Saul, she cannot resist the pull of the empty houses. At the National Spelling Bee, Eliza performs well but does not win, so she begins to prepare for the following year, with Saul's enthusiastic help. But the family is about to be torn apart. Miriam is arrested, pleads not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Aaron announces his intention to leave home, and his faith, to join ISKCON.|$|E
25|$|Anatomy of a Murder {{is based}} on a real murder (and {{subsequent}} trial) that occurred in Big Bay in the early morning of July 31, 1952. Coleman A. Peterson, a lieutenant in the Army, was charged with murdering Maurice Chenoweth. The alleged motive was revenge for the rape of Peterson's wife by Chenoweth. Voelker successfully defended Peterson, who was found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity.</b> Other books by Voelker were based on other legal cases in the Upper Peninsula or his love of fly fishing for brook trout. He authored over 100 opinions during his short tenure on the Michigan Supreme Court, the most famous of which was in a case called People v. Hildabridle involving a nudist colony near Battle Creek.|$|E

50|$|In 1768, Calvert {{was accused}} of {{abduction}} and rape by Sarah Woodcock, a noted beauty who kept a milliner's shop at Tower Hill.

After deliberating {{for an hour and}} twenty minutes the jury acquitted Calvert, believing that Woodcock did not make adequate attempts to escape.|$|R
25|$|During the 1870s Abe Buford {{suffered}} {{a series of}} financial reversals that forced him into bankruptcy with the resulting loss of Bosque Bonita Farm to his creditors. In addition, he {{suffered a}} devastating personal loss when his only son, William A. Buford, died at age twenty-three in 1872. He lost his wife Amanda Harris Buford in 1879 and on March 26 of that same year, his brother, Colonel Thomas Buford of Henry County, Kentucky, shot and killed Judge John Milton Elliott in Frankfort, Kentucky. Tom Buford surrendered to police and was jailed pending trial. Abe Buford came to his brother's aid and {{spent a great deal}} of money on legal fees for his defense. On appeal of a guilty verdict, Thomas Buford would eventually be found not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> and was sent to the Anchorage, Kentucky psychiatric hospital.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1974, Anthony Barbaro was arraigned {{on three}} counts of second-degree murder, six counts of first-degree assault, and five counts of first-degree {{reckless}} endangerment. Barbaro was then being held without bail at the Olean City Jail. Following the shooting, police had found homemade smoke bombs, {{as well as}} gasoline and glass bottles, and empty propane canisters in Barbaro's bedroom. Police also found, in Barbaro's bedroom, bomb recipes and a journal that detailed {{his plans for the}} shooting. In April 1975, he had entered a plea of not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity,</b> however he was found competent to stand trial by two court-appointed psychiatrists. Barbaro was soon transferred from the Olean City Jail to the Cattaraugus County Jail in Little Valley. On October 21, 1975, a grand jury was seated for Barbaro's trial at the Olean Municipal Building.|$|E
25|$|Uyesugi {{pleaded not}} <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> <b>insanity</b> {{and claimed that}} he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the {{delusions}} about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, {{but he did not}} meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong.|$|E
50|$|An {{arraignment}} {{is held in}} both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, {{the complaint}} or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant {{a copy of the}} information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead “guilty”, “no contest”, “not guilty”, or “not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> mental disease or defect”. A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.|$|R
5000|$|At his trial, Rynerson {{was found}} not <b>guilty</b> (<b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> self-defense), but many thought the court {{proceedings}} were corrupt.

The historian Richard Henry Brown says that the murder of Slough [...] "helped affirm the position of New Mexico as 'apparently the only place where assassination became {{an integral part of the}} political system.'" ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to the defence of automatism in English law. Prior fault generally excludes automatism. Intoxication generally excludes automatism, even when involuntary. Any defence that rests on insanity comes under the M'Naghten Rules. Under English law internal causes of automatism are generally {{judged to be}} insane automatism and so result in the special verdict ('not <b>guilty</b> <b>by</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> insanity') rather than simple acquittal.|$|R
