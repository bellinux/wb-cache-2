5|$|Black {{adopted a}} {{narrower}} {{interpretation of the}} Fourth Amendment than {{many of his colleagues}} on the Warren Court. He dissented from Katz v. United States (1967), in which the Court held that warrantless wiretapping violated the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Amendment only protected tangible items from physical searches or seizures. Thus, he concluded that telephone conversations were not within the scope of the amendment, and that warrantless wiretapping was consequently permissible.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of the report, was not capable of writing it. Then <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and {{taking advantage of the}} natural resources of the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Reformist Party was founded, which {{attracted}} intellectuals. Figures {{like its}} leader, Alejandro Lerroux, helped attract wide {{support from the}} working class. His advocacy of anti-clericalism made him a successful demagogue in Barcelona. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church was inseparable from the system of oppression the people were under. It was around this time that republicanism came to the fore.|$|E

25|$|In addition, <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> watchmaker's {{creation}} of <b>the</b> watch implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> watchmaker {{must be more}} complex than the watch.|$|R
50|$|Fish’s {{pamphlet}} {{rejects the}} sale of indulgences. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supposed act of penance was merely a ruse to fill the clergy's coffers.|$|R
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States {{had to develop}} six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In his {{dissertation}} <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> iron ore near Clinton was a primary sediment; {{at the time}} the deposits were believed to be secondary nodules formed by replacement of primary limestone. His Princeton graduate student Hayes proved a similar result about the iron ores of his native Wabana, Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1919, Smyth showed that a green mineral in the Clinton ores was chamosite and also a primary sediment.|$|E
5|$|Raath (1972) {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with {{the head and neck}} bended backwards above the pelvis, a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons. The teeth would have been the only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass.|$|E

25|$|In al-Haytham's Book of Optics <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{celestial}} spheres {{were not}} made of solid matter, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heavens are less dense that air.|$|R

5|$|Rick Holland, an {{instructor}} at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> advice the Ludys share {{in the book is}} sound and that their story is an encouraging one.|$|E
5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} to {{articulate}} a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism in the modern world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated {{the value of the}} sacraments. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced no means of reliably dating {{the construction of the}} site. Wainwright suggested that the ring was Early Bronze Age on the basis of other, dated circles in Britain. Based on his analysis of the site's stratigraphy, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stones had likely been removed from their original position amid agricultural development {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} {{scientist}} {{among the five}} AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore {{less important than the}} risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.|$|E
5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, he gave a lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming {{able to read the}} texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E

5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E
5|$|In January {{and again}} in February, Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to accept Germany's proposals. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{territorial}} losses were acceptable if it ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik-led government. The majority of Bolsheviks rejected his position, hoping to prolong the armistice and call Germany's bluff. On 18 February, the German Army launched Operation Faustschlag, advancing further into Russian-controlled territory and conquering Dvinsk within a day. At this point, Lenin finally convinced a small majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee to accept the Central Powers' demands. On 23 February, the Central Powers issued a new ultimatum: Russia had to recognise German control not only of Poland and the Baltic states but also of Ukraine, or face a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, <b>he</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
50|$|Michael Ward (born 6 January 1968) is a British scholar, {{best known}} for his book Planet Narnia, in which <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Chronicles of Narnia is {{structured}} around the seven planets.|$|R
50|$|Norheim has {{referred}} to the Progress Party as Norway's “new Labor Party.” <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Labor Party has become less a party of workers and more a party of public employees.|$|R
30|$|<b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{loss of a}} {{cultural}} leads to the extermination of self-worth in a society, intensifying problems of poverty, school drop-out rates, drug and alcohol abuse, and even suicide (Excerpt 3).|$|R
5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. The tribe was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and with it all treaty rights. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne's successors {{would later}} {{come to the}} aid of the Byzantines under Louis II and during the Crusades, but {{relations}} between the two empires would be strained; based on the Salerno Chronicle, we know the Emperor Basil had sent an angry letter to his western counterpart, reprimanding him for usurping the title of emperor. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Frankish rulers were simple reges, and that each nation has its own title for the ruler, whereas the imperial title suited only the ruler of the Eastern Romans, Basil himself.|$|E
5|$|The Junta was {{rejected}} in Montevideo, {{as was the}} exile of Cisneros and the former Audiencia. Moreno reacted immediately, replying to the Montevidean concerns. He supported {{the legitimacy of the}} Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas, as it was debated during the open cabildo. He also called for unity and support of the metropolis, and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch. <b>He</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Junta treated the exiles initially with moderation, but their obstinacy, particularly on the part of Cisneros, generated popular discontent. Matías Irigoyen told the same thing to the British Lord Strangford in Río de Janeiro.|$|E
50|$|David Rudd takes a {{more generous}} view {{in his study}} of the novel Coraline, where <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work plays and riffs productively on Sigmund Freud's notion of the Uncanny, or the Unheimlich.|$|R
50|$|A {{completely}} opposite view {{is argued}} by Bryan Cheyette. <b>He</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> negative 'Jewish financier' stereotype was present first, and indeed {{was established in}} British culture quite some time before the scandal broke.|$|R
5000|$|In 1743 Trattato de' tributi, delle monete e del governo {{politico}} della sanità was printed. In {{this book}} <b>he</b> <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tax {{system should be}} reformed {{and based on the}} individual contributory capacity.|$|R
