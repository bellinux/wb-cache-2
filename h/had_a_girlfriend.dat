5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} {{for the first time to}} detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Friday {{returned}} to Acton, where he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> called Maxine Doughan {{and a baby}} daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, {{and led to a}} physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £10 per week. Many of his new teammates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.|$|E

25|$|On October 6, 1969, Allen {{was interviewed}} by detective John Lynch of the Vallejo Police Department. Allen had been {{reported}} {{in the vicinity of the}} Lake Beryessa attack against Hartnell and Shepard on September 27, 1969; he described himself scuba diving at Salt Point on the day of the attacks. Allen again came to police attention in 1971 when his friend Donald Cheney reported to police in Manhattan Beach, California, that Allen had spoken of his desire to kill people, use the name Zodiac, and secure a flashlight to a firearm for visibility at night. According to Cheney, this conversation occurred no later than January 1, 1969. Jack Mulanax of the Vallejo Police Department subsequently wrote Allen had received an other than honorable discharge from the US Navy in 1958, and had been fired from his job as an elementary school teacher in March 1968 after allegations of sexual misconduct with students. He was generally well-regarded by those who knew him, but was also described as fixated on young children, angry at women and apparently never <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> or wife. In September 1972, San Francisco police obtained a search warrant for Allen's residence. In 1974 Allen was arrested for committing lewd sex acts upon a 12-year-old boy; he pleaded guilty and served two years imprisonment.|$|E

500|$|Another American star {{provided}} by Robert L. Lippert was Margia Dean, who played Judith Carroon. A former beauty queen, Dean was allegedly cast {{on account of}} her association with the 20th Century Fox president, Spyros Skouras. According to executive producer Michael Carreras, [...] "Skouras <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> who was an actress and he wanted her in pictures, but he didn't want her in pictures in America, because of the tittle-tattle or whatever, so he set it up though his friend Bob Lippert". Val Guest recalled of her, [...] "She was a sweet girl, but she couldn't act". Her American accent was considered {{out of place in}} the film and so her lines were dubbed in post production.|$|E
500|$|Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review, rating it as a C-. Hyden criticized Levi as being [...] "likeable but unconvincing playing a loser who hasn't <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> in five years" [...] and Levi and Gomez as [...] "blandly recreating Judd Apatow's loser heroes {{without any of}} the authentic details", though calling Baldwin's performance [...] "one of the few bright spots". Katey Rich of Television Blend wrote that the episode, like Chuck, was [...] "gangly and awkward" [...] and [...] "a lot to swallow in a pilot episode, not to mention totally implausible." [...] However, Rich concluded that the series showed comedic promise and was loved by its audience, [...] "while not necessarily being a slam dunk." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{production}} {{of the second half}} of the season, Lucas, Lyon, and Senn departed from the series. Port also left her position at Diane von Fürstenberg and resumed working at her previous employer Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. As the season resumed, Port's friend Roxy Olin was introduced as a new main cast member, and was hired at People's Revolution. Palermo had left Diane von Fürstenberg for a position with Elle, where she clashed with co-worker and new main cast member Erin Kaplan. With Cutrone's guidance, Port begins designing a fashion line, while Kaplan becomes increasingly displeased with Palermo's under-performance. Port also began dating friend Freddie Fackelmayer, but was dismayed to learn that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend.</b> By the season finale, Port had presented the [...] "Whitney Eve" [...] lookbook to Bergdorf Goodman, and decided to further publicize her collection through a fashion show at Bryant Park.|$|E
500|$|Mason said {{he hoped}} that his storyline would [...] "draw in viewers in a {{responsible}} way" [...] and the feedback would stay positive. Mason added {{that he would like}} to see Chris happy in the future and hopes the viewers will warm to him. He added [...] "I know it's quite a sensitive topic, but I think the difference between his and the last encounters they've had is that we're looking more in-depth into more than just a [...] "gay kiss". We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this up, saying [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chris's character, not Chris to be the gay character. He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. He's on the basketball team, he's <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E
500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in the alleys. The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E

500|$|Ian Brady {{was born}} in Glasgow as Ian Duncan Stewart on 2 January 1938 to Margaret [...] "Peggy" [...] Stewart, an {{unmarried}} tea room waitress. The identity of Brady's father has never been reliably ascertained, although his mother {{said he was a}} reporter working for a Glasgow newspaper, who died three months before Brady was born. Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood. Various authors have stated that he tortured animals, although Brady objected to such accusations. Aged nine, he visited Loch Lomond with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new council house on an overspill estate at Pollok. He was accepted for Shawlands Academy, a school for above-average pupils. At Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and {{took a job as a}} tea boy at a Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend,</b> Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a flick knife after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him, and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother. By then she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady, and it was the latter who got Brady a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market.|$|E
