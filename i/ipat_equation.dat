This article tracks the various forms the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> has taken over 30 years as a means of examining an underlying shift among many environmentalists toward a more accepting view of the role technology can play in sustainable development. Although the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> was once used to determine which single variable was the most damaging to the environment, an industrial ecology view reverses this usage, recognizing that increases in population and affluence can, in many cases, be balanced by improvements to the environment offered by technological systems.

40|$|Reducing human {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide by 80 % by 2100 requires more than technological innovation. Historical rates of emissions decline due to such innovation of about 0. 7 % are insufficient to offset the 3 % growth in emissions that stems from population and per capita income growth. Existing scientific and political debates are dominated by a “technophilic optimism ” that projects emission reductions from technological improvement that are not supported by the evidence. If we fail to develop policies proactively to constrain population, affluence, and consumption while respecting other human values, we will almost certainly face impacts from climate change that constrain population, affluence, and consumption for us. Keywords climate change, economic growth, <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation,</b> population, technological innovation In addressing climate change, policies that foster technological innovation will be cru-cial but inadequate unless they are coupled with policies that reduce population, afflu-ence, and consumption. Without the latter policies, we necessarily place the Earth on a trajectory toward far higher global temperatures with troubling human and environ-mental implications.

40|$|As Hummel et al. {{demonstrate}} {{in their}} background paper for this cyberseminar, population-environment (P-E) analysis takes many theoretical and methodological forms. One approach to P-E analysis is STIRPAT which I discuss here. I {{will focus on}} providing a brief but informative overview of STIRPAT, highlighting some of the important issues raised by Hummel et al, and include a discussion of some misconceptions about STIRPAT. STIRPAT comprises three coordinated elements: A theoretical framework (Structural Human Ecology or SHE), a composite of first principles derived from IPAT, and a research program that comprises an analytic frame that is fully distinct from IPAT. Thomas Dietz and Eugene Rosa founded STIRPAT and the research program was strengthened considerably {{with the addition of}} Richard York (see www. stirpat. org). STIRPAT is an interdisciplinary innovation inspired by the variables of IPAT, an environmental accounting equation familiar to natural scientists, and linked to social science theory and methods (Dietz and Rosa 1994). STIRPAT is a radical reformulation of the <b>IPAT</b> environmental accounting <b>equation</b> into stochastic form which is estimated using regression techniques common in the social sciences...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs a less {{developed}} country, China has witnessed a rapid GDP growth of over 8 % since 2007. The negative {{side of this}} glory, however, is numerous resource problems and heavy environmental pollution. How to achieve a harmonious development between economy and environment has become an urgent problem {{that need to be}} replied. This paper sets up a quantitative relationship between economic growth and environmental load by applying <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> and its derived equations. Firstly, combined with actual situation of China in 1997 - 2007, <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> and IGT equation are used to analyze actual situation and existing problems of China in the last 10 years. The relation between descent rate of environmental load (t) and g*=g/ (1 +g) is used in analyzing the impacts of economic growth on ecological environment. Secondly, based on STIRPAT model, this paper makes a prediction formed 4 different scenarios on the future relation of economic growth and environmental load in China from 2010 to 2020. In the 4 scenarios, predictive indexes include GDP, energy consumption, SO 2 emission and COD emission. Results of the scenario analysis show that the recommended scenario is the solution suitable to China most, i. e. it can both satisfy the demand of economic development as a {{less developed}} country and guarantee the sustainable utilization of resource and environment. Finally, the paper puts forward some measures and strategies that should be taken if the recommended scenario is adopted by China...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to attempt to identify the underlying driving forces which affect CO 2 emissions. Based on the known <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation,</b> in this paper, economic scale was considered as one of main determinant of CO 2 emissions, and the model on the factors was established to analyze the relationship between CO 2 emissions, economic scale, technology, income and population in China. The regression results indicated that economic scale, income and population {{have a positive effect on}} CO 2 emission; the impact of technology on CO 2 emission was more complex. In first phase of the new technology, its effect on CO 2 emission was positive. While at the later stage, the effect was negative through technology improvement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Since {{the view}} that energy {{efficiency}} improvement would increase rather than reduce energy consumption, so-called rebound effect, was put forward and {{has been the focus}} that is encouraging a fierce debate within mainstream economics. This paper tries to introduce an improved estimation model by efficiency share decomposed from energy intensity, based on <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> to estimate the rebound effect of three major regions in Guangdong, together with redistricting Guangdong applying hierarchical clustering analysis. The result shows the average rebound effect of low-intensity high-yield area, high-intensity low-yield area, and low-intensity low-yield area, is 17. 91 %, 10. 82 % and 8. 10 %, correspondingly. While the empirical study provides support of existence of rebound effect, it does suggest we should not only rely on improving energy efficiency, but also using market instruments such as resources taxes, to reinforce the energy savings...|$|E
40|$|Estimates of the {{relative}} contribution of population size and economic growth to global carbon emissions out to 2100 have been made for the industrialised 'North' and populous 'South' of the planet.

Nevertheless, the cumulative build-up of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations is largely a consequence of historic emissions released by the North since the start of its 'industrial revolution' around 1850...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{similarities}} between Canada and Sweden, as both are relatively affluent northern nations with diverse modern economies. Both have witnessed demographic growth and climbing affluence, with predominantly export-oriented economies. Yet {{in terms of}} their respective records on greenhouse gas emissions, there is a stark contrast between the two. Sweden is often considered a world leader in reducing emissions, whereas Canada has been widely criticized for its failure to meet international commitments. The current paper attempts to delineate some of the factors responsible for the observed differences between the two countries. It examines trends in environmental impact (CO 2 levels) by applying a modified and updated version of Ehrlich’s <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation.</b> The crux of the matter in comparing the two countries is Canada’s substantial population growth and heavy demand for energy (29 th among 30 countries in the OECD on our measure of energy intensity) whereas Sweden has managed to move away from fossil fuels in driving its economic activity...|$|E
40|$|Scaling relations, {{such as the}} <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> and the Kaya identity, {{are useful}} for quickly gauging the scale of economic, technological, and {{demographic}} changes required to reduce environmental impacts and pressures; {{in the case of}} the Kaya identity, the environmental pressure is greenhouse gas emissions. However, when considering large-scale economic transformation, as with a shift to a low-carbon economy, the IPAT and Kaya identities and their cousins fail to capture the legacy of existing capital, on the one hand, and the need for new investment, on the other. While detailed models can capture these factors, they do not allow for rapid exploration of widely different alternatives, which is the appeal of the IPAT and Kaya identities. In this paper we present an extended Kaya identity that includes investment and capital stocks. The identity we propose is a sum of terms, rather than a simple scaling relation. Nevertheless, it allows for quick analysis and rapid exploration of a variety of different possible paths toward a low-carbon economy. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has examined the}} relationship between natural resources and economic growth. Considered vitally important, not only for humanity’s well-being but also for ecosystem integrity, the relationship between water use and economic growth has traditionally garnered little attention by analysts. This paper studies water use trends from 1900 to 2000 throughout the world, and their main determinants. To do this, we first analyse historical water use trajectories. Second, to proceed with the determinants of water use, we reformulate the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971; Commoner et al. 1971), decomposing water use trends into changes in economic demands and in water use intensity. Finally, a simple scenario analysis is conducted, to project future water use trends under different economic, demographic and technological assumptions. The empirical evidence shows that economic and population growth have been crucial for explaining the increase in water use over the past 100 years, with significant regional differences. Nevertheless, the decline in water use intensity has been responsible for a significant reduction in the growth of total water use.

40|$|In recent years, the {{worsening}} of {{the quality}} of the air has urged more people to attach great importance to circular economy. Shaanxi, abundant in natural resources, maintained the GDP growth rate of 14. 9 % during the period of the twelfth five-year plan. However, the fast economic growth under the extensive traditional economic growth mode renders Shaanxi inadequate in resources supply and noticeably worse in ecological environment issues. With the method of the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation,</b> this paper quantitatively analyzes the developmental stage and the developmental level of the circular economy of Shaanxi to cover the shortage of the previous studies having only been focused on the policy study and the practice mode. The result shows that Shaanxi is in the intermediate stage of circular economy and the advanced stage has an apparent advantage over the intermediate one by comparing their energy consumption and solid pollutant discharge.

40|$|The paper {{uses the}} {{framework}} of the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation,</b> as applied to CO 2 emission, to decompose the various driving forces in the global energy use. Data from recent history are superimposed on projections of SRES IPCC scenarios to determine if enough sustainable capacity can be built to prevent irreversible ecological deterioration. The conclusion from the analysis is that, in agreement with the IPCC 4 th report, until about 2030 there are no large differences between a sustainable scenario and the one that resembles “business as usual”. The sharp divergence that follows stems from different estimates in population growth and in the percentage of use of fossil fuels in the total energy mix. Decomposition of alternative energy options indicate that the rate of increase of alternatives such as hydroelectric and nuclear start with a relatively high base but a growth rate too short for major contribution to a timely replacement of fossil fuels while wind and solar starts from a much lower base but rate of growth, if maintained, that can satisfy a timely replacement.

40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this paper is to {{statistically}} test whether Buddhist countries tend to contribute to global warming mitigation in comparison with other religious groups of countries. A sample of 160 countries were classified into seven groups coded as ‘Buddhist’, ‘Hindu’, ‘Muslim’, ‘Catholic’, ‘Protestant’, ‘Christian mixed’ and ‘None of the above’. This study modelled the religious heritage of a nation into the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> (Environmental Impact = Population × Affluence × Technology), religion being as a cultural proxy of the technology factor. ‘Buddhist’ countries were found likely to emit lower CO 2 compared with ‘Protestant’ and ‘Christian mixed’ countries, although likely to emit higher CO 2 compared than ‘Hindu’, ‘Muslim’ and ‘Catholic’ countries, all other factors being held equal. The relatively low group effect of ‘Buddhist’ countries on CO 2 emissions can be interpreted to support the argument that teaching Buddhist economics and ecology could be a useful ingredient to curb ever-increasing global CO 2 emissions. Thus, further study is warranted as to how teachings from Buddhism can translate into lower CO 2 emissions. Jungho Su...|$|E

40|$|The {{evidence}} of impending and serious climate and other consequences of an expanding world economy based on fossil carbon energy continues to accumulate. This two-part paper examines the potential {{contribution of the}} world view and insights of Buddhism to this search. It presents both a conceptual and practical case that Buddhism can help shape and move towards an alternative and effective paradigmatic basis for sustainable economies - one capable of bringing about and maintaining genuine, high welfare levels across the world's societies. The first paper outlined a comprehensive analytical framework to identify the fundamental nature of anthropogenic climate change. Based on the integration {{of two of the}} most influential environmental analysis tools of recent decades (the DPSIR model and <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation),</b> the framework was then broadened to facilitate ideas from the Buddhist world view by injecting two key missing aspects - the interrelated role of (1) beliefs and values (on goals and behavior) and (2) the nature of well-being or human happiness. Finally, the principal linkages between this climate change analysis framework and Buddhism were explored. In this concluding paper, the systems framework is used to demonstrate how Buddhist and related world views can feed into appropriate and effective responses to the impending challenges of climate change. This is undertaken by systematically presenting a specific, if indicative, list of relevant strategies informed by the understanding of interconnectedness and other basic principles about the nature of reality and human well-being as proposed in Buddhism.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to conduct an extended evaluation of sustainability based on the material flow analysis of resource productivity. We first present updated information on the material flow analysis (MFA) database in Taiwan. Essential indicators are selected to quantify resource productivity associated with the economy-wide MFA of Taiwan. The study also applies the IPAT (impact-population-affluence-technology) master equation to measure trends of material use efficiency in Taiwan and to compare them {{with those of other}} Asia-Pacific countries. An extended evaluation of efficiency, in comparison with selected economies by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA), is conducted accordingly. The Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) is thereby adopted to quantify the patterns and the associated changes of efficiency. Observations and summaries can be described as follows. Based on the MFA of the Taiwanese economy, the average growth rates of domestic material input (DMI; 2. 83 %) and domestic material consumption (DMC; 2. 13 %) {{in the past two decades}} were both less than that of gross domestic product (GDP; 4. 95 %). The decoupling of environmental pressures from economic growth can be observed. In terms of the decomposition analysis of the <b>IPAT</b> <b>equation</b> and in comparison with 38 other economies, the material use efficiency of Taiwan did not perform as well as its economic growth. The DEA comparisons of resource productivity show that Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Japan performed the best in 2008. Since the MPI consists of technological change (frontier-shift or innovation) and efficiency change (catch-up), the change in efficiency (catch-up) of Taiwan has not been accomplished as expected in spite of the increase in its technological efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} {{data about the}} state of our planet, presented at the 2012 (Rio+ 20) summit, documented that today's human family lives even less sustainably than it did in 1992. The data indicate furthermore that the environmental impacts from our current economic activities are so large, that we are approaching situations where potentially controllable regional problems can easily lead to uncontrollable global disasters. Assuming that (1) the majority of the human family, once adequately informed, wants to achieve a "sustainable way of life" and (2) that the "development towards sustainability" roadmap will be based on scientific principles, one must begin with unambiguous and quantifiable definitions of these goals. As will be demonstrated, the well known scientific method to define abstract and complex issues by their negation, satisfies these requirements. Following this new approach, it also becomes possible to decide if proposed and actual policies changes will make our way of life less unsustainable, and thus move us potentially into the direction of sustainability. Furthermore, if potentially dangerous tipping points are to be avoided, the transition roadmap must include some minimal speed requirements. Combining the negation method and the time evolution of that remaining natural capital in different domains, the transition speed for a "development towards sustainability" can be quantified at local, regional and global scales. The presented ideas allow us to measure the rate of natural capital depletion and the rate of restoration that will be required if humanity is to avoid reaching a sustainable future by a collapse transition.
