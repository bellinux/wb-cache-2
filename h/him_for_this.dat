5|$|Ramírez is {{friends with}} José Mesa. Mesa helped teach Ramírez English, helped teach {{him how to}} pitch, and {{translated}} for him in 2006 while both were with the Rockies. After Mesa signed with the Detroit Tigers in 2007, Ramírez still remained in contact with him. Ramírez enjoys Christian music, and he sings it at his house. He often donates baseball equipment to children who need it, and in 2006 the Rockies recognized <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> by making him their Roberto Clemente Award nominee.|$|E

5|$|In 1646, {{after several}} naval successes against Spain along the Mediterranean, Cardinal Mazarin planned a naval {{expedition}} {{to conquer the}} Spanish-held State of Presidi {{with the aim of}} interrupting Spanish communications with the Kingdom of Naples, threatening the initial stage of the Spanish military corridor, the so-called Spanish Road, and also to frighten pope Innocent X, whose Spanish sympathies displeased <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> purpose, a fleet commanded by young Admiral Marquis of Brézé was assembled at Toulon. Made of 36 galleons, 20 galleys and a large complement of minor vessels, it had on board an army of some 8,000 infantry and 800 cavalry with baggage under the command of Thomas Francis of Savoy, who had previously been at the employ of the Spanish Crown.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many canals, where navvies {{were brought}} into the {{neighbourhood}} {{to carry out the}} work, the Earl employed local men on the project, most of them already employed by him, and a clergyman praised <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> when writing in 1808, as it led to much less disruption, but provided increased income for those who worked on the scheme. Wages rose from 8 or 9 shillings (40-45p) per week to 14 or 15 shillings (70-75p). During his life, the Earl invested some £100,000 in waterways, some in his native county of Sussex, but also in attempts to build a canal from London to Portsmouth. Between 1802 and 1831, the average income from the canal was around £550 per year. Competition arrived in 1859, when the Mid-Sussex Railway opened a line from Horsham through Pulborough to Petworth. Traffic declined, and by the 1880s, the navigation was no longer used by commercial boats, although it was not officially abandoned until 1936.|$|E
25|$|Schwarz's {{background}} in mathematics {{is considered one}} of his strengths as a reporter, particularly in his investigation of football brain injuries.

25|$|Douglas {{strongly}} opposed Buchanan's machinations, {{and the two}} became bitter enemies. Even his Republican critics praised <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> stand, and he restored his standing with the moderates of the North.

25|$|Roosevelt never forgave <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> remark, and Moses {{later said}} that this {{incident}} was {{the root of the}} antipathy between them that lasted into Roosevelt's later presidency. Moses, who also served as New York's Secretary of State for two years during this period, used his influence with the legislature and control of the parks budgeting process to keep the TSPC's finances low enough that it could barely maintain existing facilities under its jurisdiction, much less acquire right-of-way or hire staff.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars Hutt gained command of the 98-gun second rate HMS Queen, the result of patronage by Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner who had commanded Hutt in the West Indies and now personally requested <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> prestigious command. Hutt joined Gardner in the West Indies and Queen was involved in the first unsuccessful attempt to capture Martinique in 1793. A few months later, Gardner's squadron was attached to the Channel Fleet and with that horse, under Admiral Lord Howe, Queen participated in the Glorious First of June.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 20, Túrin accidentally killed Saeros, one of Thingol's counsellors, who had scorned him for his attire and mortal lineage. Túrin injured <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> {{but later}} was ambushed by Saeros. Túrin {{overpowered}} him, chasing him at sword point to a ravine where, {{in an attempt to}} jump, Saeros stumbled and died on the rocks below. Heedless of Mablung's counsels, and before Túrin could have been either punished or absolved, he fled from Doriath, fearing imprisonment. Thingol, after learning of the circumstances from Nellas, eventually pardoned Túrin, and Beleg obtained leave to seek out his friend.|$|E

60|$|But it says more.

25|$|In April 1663, Shivaji {{launched}} a surprise attack on Shaista Khan in Pune; {{accounts of the}} story differ in the popular imagination, {{but there is some}} agreement that Shivaji and band of some 200 followers infiltrated Pune, using a wedding procession as cover. They overcame the palace guards, breached the wall, and entered Shaista Khan's quarters, killing those they found there. Shaista Khan escaped, losing his thumb in the melee, but one of his sons and other members of his household were killed. The Khan took refuge with the Moghul forces outside of Pune, and Aurangzeb punished <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> embarrassment with a transfer to Bengal.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 213 BC, at the {{instigation}} of Li Si and {{to avoid}} scholars' comparisons of his reign with the past, Qin Shi Huang ordered most existing books to be burned {{with the exception of}} those on astrology, agriculture, medicine, divination, and the history of the State of Qin. This would also serve the purpose of furthering the ongoing reformation of the writing system by removing examples of obsolete scripts. Owning the Book of Songs or the Classic of History was to be punished especially severely. According to the later Records of the Grand Historian, the following year Qin Shi Huang had some 460 scholars buried alive for owning the forbidden books. The emperor's oldest son Fusu criticised <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> act.|$|E
25|$|The {{making of}} alebrijes in Oaxaca was {{initially}} established in Arrazola by Manuel Jimenez. Jimenez began carving wooden figures {{since he was}} a boy tending animals in the 1920s. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Jimenez’s work was being sold in the city of Oaxaca, which led them to being shown to folk art collectors such as Nelson Rockefeller. By the late 1960s, he was giving exhibitions in museums in Mexico City and the United States and tourists began visiting his workshop in the 1970s. He kept his carving techniques strictly within the family with only his sons and a son in law carving with <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, only six families were carving alebrijes in Arrazola as late as 1985. Jimenez died in 2005. Today, Jimenez’s works fetch a minimum of $100 USD.|$|E

25|$|Snoopy {{is lying}} {{on top of his}} doghouse, {{relaxing}} vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state ("Snoopy"). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets ("My Blanket and Me"). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen. However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} series three Tests to nil. After {{managing}} {{to draw the}} first two Tests, they lost the next three; the West Indies did not lose a second innings wicket all tour. Hughes {{did not have a}} successful tour with the bat, scoring 215 runs at an average of 21.50. The pressure of the tour told on Hughes. In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as unreasonableness by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he could not care less about the welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.|$|E
25|$|When the {{two sides}} met at Arogye, in the plain facing Magdala, on April 10, 1868, the British {{defeated}} the Abyssinian army. With Tewodros' army so decisively defeated, many of his men began to desert and the emperor was left with only 4,000 soldiers. Tewodros II attempted to make peace. Napier responded with a message thanking <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> peace offering and stating that he would treat the Emperor and his family with every dignity. Tewodros II furiously responded {{that he would never}} be taken prisoner. The British shelled Magdala, killing most of Tewodros II's remaining loyal men. The emperor committed suicide on Easter Monday, April 13, 1868, as the British troops stormed the citadel of Magdala. He used a pistol which he had used during fighting for unification during the era. Tewodros II was buried by the British troops at Magdala's Medhane Alem (Savior of the World) Orthodox Church under the name of Theodore II.|$|E
