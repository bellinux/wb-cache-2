One of his pet fads was palmistry. To another one he gave no name, neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but merely {{said it was an}} amusement. In fact, he had found that his fads added to his reputation as a pudd'nhead; there, he was growing chary of being too communicative about them. The fad without a name was one which dealt with people's finger marks. He carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves strips of glass five inches long and three inches wide. Along the lower edge of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper. He asked people to pass their hands through their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil) and then making a thumb-mark on a <b>glass</b> <b>strip,</b> following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession. Under this row of faint grease prints he would write a record on the strip of white paper--thus: ...|$|E

However, the brittle nature of polymer matrix composites makes them susceptible to damage propagation, requiring special material applications and designs to limit damage growth. <b>Glass</b> buffer <b>strips,</b> embedded within laminates, have shown the potential for improving the damage tolerance of unstitched composite laminates loaded in tension. The <b>glass</b> buffer <b>strips,</b> less stiff than the surrounding carbon fibers, arrest crack growth in composites under tensile loads.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} use of CO 2 laser to induce <b>glass</b> <b>strip</b> peeling off to form microchannels on soda lime gass substrate. The strip peeling {{exhibits}} a strong dependence on the energy deposition rate on the glass surface. In spite of the vast difference in the combination of laser power and scanning speed, when {{the ratio of the}} two makes the energy deposition rate in the range 3. 0 - 6. 0 [*]J/(cm 2 [*]s), the temperature rising inside glass will be above the strain point and reach the softening region of the glass. As a result, <b>glass</b> <b>strip</b> peeling is able to occur and form microchannels with dimensions of 20 - 40 [*]μm in depth and 200 - 280 [*]μm in width on the glass surface. Beyond this range, higher energy depsotion rate would lead to surface melting associated with solidification cracks and lower energy deposition rate causes the generation of fragment cracks...|$|E

Coatings have been deposited by magnetron sputtering on M 2 tool steel, {{as well as}} on <b>glass</b> <b>strip,</b> to determine their intrinsic electrochemical behavior. Corrosion resistance afforded by CrN is better than TiN, which is explained by the formation of a thin oxide passive film with favorable semiconductive properties.

A particular case, that of a parabola for use as a laboratory X-ray collimator, is considered in detail. The analysis predicts that a collimation of one or two arc seconds should be obtainable in practice, with simple and inexpensive apparatus.

Two applications are described; a parabolic reflector for use as a laboratory X-ray collimator for testing mechanical collimators to be used in space instruments, and an elliptical reflector for point-to-point focussing. The latter device has been used for testing gratings in the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regions and for concentrating radiation on the entrance slit of a spectrometer, with a resultant gain in speed and resolution.

40|$|Emulsification {{is a key}} step in many {{processes}} for the production and functionalization of dispersed liquid systems. Here, we report a versatile and robust device that generates monodisperse milliemulsions by step-emulsification. In contrast to the conventional design in which each channel is physically separated, we use a shallow plateau sandwiched between two parallel <b>glass</b> <b>strips</b> to connect all channels in a microcapillary film (MCF) before emerging in a deep reservoir. Because of the open plateau that connects different channels, the flow tips from neighboring channels may get immediately in contact with each other; this interaction {{may lead to the}} relative movement and deformation of the flow tips, to repulsion or even coalescence, enabling droplet generations from different channels to synchronize. By simply tuning the interaction, we achieve Janus droplets, drops of fluids mixed at different ratios and mixed drops of different compositions. The in situ generation of droplets with excellent control is essential for various applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{honeycomb}} made of sinusoidally corrugated <b>glass</b> <b>strips</b> was optimized {{for use in}} water-cooled, single-glazed flat plate solar collectors with non-selective black absorbers. Cell diameter (d), cell height (L), and pitch/diameter ratio (P/d) maximizing solar collector performance and cost effectiveness for given cell wall thickness (t sub w) and optical properties of glass were determined from radiative and convective honeycomb characteristics and collector performance all calculated with experimentally validated algorithms. Relative lifetime values were estimated from present materials costs and postulated production methods for corrugated glass honeycomb cover assemblies. A honeycomb with P/d = 1. 05, d = 17. 4 mm, L = 146 mm and t sub w = 0. 15 mm would provide near-optimal performance over the range delta T sub C {{greater than or equal}} to 0 C and less than or equal to 80 C and be superior in performance and cost effectiveness to a non-honeycomb collector with a 0. 92 / 0. 12 selective black absorber...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the {{automotive}} and aeronautic industries, security is of prime importance and so corrosion prevention is essential. Steel parts were once protected with deposits such as cadmium or zinc-nickel produced using a chromatation treatment but recent environmental directives dictate that these methods {{are no longer}} acceptable. Aluminium sacrificial coatings have excellent corrosion behaviour but unfortunately they have poor mechanical characteristics and a fast dissolution rate. The present study investigated a possible solution: alloying the aluminium with a more noble element, chromium, in order to decrease the sacrificial galvanic effect of the deposit and therefore improve its lifetime. The corrosion protection afforded by such coatings {{in relation to their}} structure and mechanical properties was investigated. The coatings were produced on carbon steel by a vacuum PVD arc evaporation process at a pilot scale. Intrinsic electrochemical properties were determined on pure materials and on layers deposited on <b>glass</b> <b>strip.</b> Several elaboration configurations (pure as well as composite targets) were investigated. In most cases the coatings were stratified and composed of pure aluminium and numerous hardened AlxCry intermetallic phases. Chromium enrichment of aluminium based coatings induces not only a beneficial hardening effect on the surface characteristics (> 700 HV) but also significantly improves the corrosion behaviour of the coated pieces (increasing lifetime by up to three times compared to pure Aluminium) ...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{measurements}} {{of the effects of}} ions on fluorescent antibody reactions have not been reported in the literature. Data in this report show the effects of ranges of H+, phosphate, Mg 2 +, and Ca 2 + molarities on antigen-antibody coupling during an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) reaction for Clostridium botulinum type E. These effects were quantified in two ways: (i) by microphotometric measurement of cell fluorescence intensity; and (ii) by visual estimation of cell fluorescence intensity on long <b>glass</b> <b>strips</b> treated with antibody in ion gradients. Optimal pH for {{the first part of the}} reaction (coupling of rabbit antibody to cells) was 7. 25, and optimum in the second part (coupling of tracer globulin to the rabbit globulin) was pH 7. 37. Running the reaction as little as 0. 10 to 0. 15 pH units off from the optima considerably reduced fluorescence intensity. Sodium phosphate buffer up to 0. 1 M did not significantly affect either portion of the reaction. Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + showed no effect on the first part of the reaction. These results support the use of higher-strength phosphate buffer and indicate for the first time that IFA reactions may have two independent, narrow pH optima...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{report on}} the {{realization}} of a silicon-based mi-croresonator/waveguide coupled system, fully integrated on a sil-icon chip. The device uses a vertical coupling scheme of the res-onator and a buried strip waveguide. We demonstrate that its high optical quality follows from the accurate planarization of the wave-guide topography, {{which is achieved by}} multiple depositions-and-reflows of a borophosphosilicate <b>glass</b> over <b>strip</b> waveguides. More importantly, we demonstrate wafer-scale mass fabrication of free-standing planar resonators suspended in air and coupled to inte-grated bus waveguides, as well as controlled selective excitation of different mode families of the resonator. This opens the door for the realization of stable all-integrated complex resonator systems for optomechanical and metrological applications, with the poten-tial to substitute today’s intensive use of complicated fiber-taper coupling schemes.

40|$|From the {{perspectives}} of energy as well as indoor climate, thermally activated concrete ceilings make sense. Used in office buildings, however, their drawback becomes apparent: they are acoustically reflective. The conventional approaches use sound-absorbing suspended sails and absorber baffles or heat-conducting sound absorbers embedded in {{large areas of the}} concrete. In this paper, an alternative approach is presented and is evaluated acoustically and thermally. A few strips of sound absorber, arranged at intervals, are mounted flush into the concrete ceiling. To calculate the sound-absorption spectrum, an already widely publicised model (the Rayleigh approach) is used. It predicts the sound-absorption spectrum for normal sound incidence very well. For diffuse sound incidence, the difference to reverberation chamber measurements is greater, presumably because of the edge effect. The sound- absorption coefficient of the design can be tuned by skilful choice of the strip geometry, and it is significantly higher than the expected average value for the surface. On the one hand, the thermal efficiency of the components is determined by comparing the heat fluxes in the ceilings with absorber strips to an untreated reference ceiling. On the other hand, the indoor climate is investigated using a room model for office rooms of both solid and lightweight constructions. The influence of the strips (proportion of absorber area 20 %) on the thermal efficiency and indoor climate is low. Two absorber materials are examined in the strip approach: open-cell foam glass and a micro-perforated metallic absorber. While the metallic absorber displays thermal advantages, its sound absorption spectrum - even at high surface-coverage proportions - exhibits a much lower absorption coefficient than, for example, open-cell foam <b>glass</b> <b>strips</b> with only 20 % ceiling coverage. A demonstration in situ shows the potential of the absorber strips spaced at intervals. However, the method chosen in this demonstration project to incorporate the absorber strip into the concrete ceilings needs to be improved...|$|R
