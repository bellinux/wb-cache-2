5|$|An {{effort to}} {{recreate}} the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the USDA ARS Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's genetic sequence, using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist Johan Hultin from a female flu victim buried in the Alaskan permafrost and samples preserved <b>from</b> <b>American</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Apart <b>from</b> <b>American</b> and Soviet {{strategic}} forces, however, camouflage {{continued to}} be applied tactically. For example in the Korean War, American B-29 bombers were switched to night flying with black undersides when Chinese fighters became a significant threat. In the Vietnam War, Vietcong MiG-21 fighters were painted by hand in green ground camouflage patterns, while the USAAF and US Navy both restarted experiments with painted camouflage. In the Soviet–Afghan War, Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters were camouflaged in a sand and spinach pattern.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic, and subsidised competition <b>from</b> <b>American</b> shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only. An example of the delaying effect of the strikes in the Canadian ports, with consequent impact on operating costs, was an extended ninety-day return voyage to Quebec City in early 1967 by the new Manchester Progress.|$|E

5|$|Her {{choice to}} {{film in the}} Kingdom met some resistance.

As Iraq dominated discourse in America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.|$|E
