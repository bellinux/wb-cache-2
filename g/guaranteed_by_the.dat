5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} {{domestic and foreign}} policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam.

During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance while at the same time maintaining his nation's neutrality (<b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E

5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down a federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E
