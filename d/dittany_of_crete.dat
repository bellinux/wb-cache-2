40|$|AbstractA new culinary {{concept has}} been {{developed}} to praise ancient and modern uses of exclusive Mediterranean ingredients, focusing the world׳s attention in a region: Crete, Greece. We reviewed the vernacular names, medicinal properties and traditional uses of the <b>Dittany</b> <b>of</b> <b>Crete</b> (local endemic of the island of Crete, Greece) and we explored the possibility of cooking different dishes. We developed a novel concept {{which resulted in the}} culinary use of the infusion, the leaves and/or inflorescences of this perennial herb in modern sweet and savoury dishes of Mediterranean cuisine (five case-studies are described and illustrated). Our study expands the use of a unique and beneficial herb (Origanum dictamnus) rendering it as a new spicy ingredient suitable for gastronomic experimentation. The promotion of new uses for this traditionally used medicinal plant (currently cultivated only at small scale on the island of Crete) (i) offers new ingredients to international gastronomy, (ii) may prove to be beneficial for local economies, and (iii) supports sustainable plant exploitation...|$|E
