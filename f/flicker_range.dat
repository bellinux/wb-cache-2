40|$|To {{determine}} the navigation performance of observers using a simulated navigational aid {{proposed by the}} U. S. Coast Guard. The aid is a single-station flashing or <b>flickering</b> <b>range</b> indicator, which would indicate lateral position in a channel by varying the flash frequency observed by the vessel operator, with a steady light seen when on the centerline and an increasing flash rate as {{the edge of the}} channel is approached. FINDINGS The ability of observers to detect motion across a channel's width was measured over a range of flash frequencies. The sensitivity to lateral motion afforded by this type of indicator was found to be potentially quite high, but the magnitude of the uncertainty in the judgments of motion would considerably reduce the operational sensitivity of such a device. APPLICATION These findings describe the navigational sensitivity afforded by a frequency-encoded single-station range indicator. They will allow comparison with other proposed single-station range indicators and with current two-station parallax range indicators.

40|$|AbstractSpontaneous {{transient}} depolarizations in {{mitochondrial membrane}} potential (ΔΨm), mitochondrial flickers, {{have been observed}} in isolated mitochondria and intact cells using the fluorescent probe, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). In theory, the ratio of [TMRE] in cytosol and mitochondrion allows ΔΨm to be calculated with the Nernst equation, but this has proven difficult in practice due to fluorescence quenching and binding of dye to mitochondrial membranes. We developed a new method to determine the amplitude of flickers in terms of millivolts of depolarization. TMRE fluorescence was monitored using high-speed, high-sensitivity three-dimensional imaging to track individual mitochondria in freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells. Resting mitochondrial fluorescence, an exponential function of resting ΔΨm, varied among mitochondria and was approximately normally distributed. Spontaneous changes in mitochondrial fluorescence, indicating depolarizations and repolarizations in ΔΨm, were observed. The depolarizations were reversible and {{did not result in}} permanent depolarization of the mitochondria. The magnitude of the <b>flickers</b> <b>ranged</b> from 100 mV with a mean of 17. 6 ± 1. 0 mV (n= 360) and a distribution skewed to smaller values. Nearly all mitochondria flickered, and they did so independently of one another, indicating that mitochondria function as independent units in the myocytes employed here...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt {{temporal}} frequencies between approximately 30 and 70 Hz, the flicker electroretinogram (ERG) of {{the cone}} system can exhibit an alternation in response amplitude from cycle to cycle {{that has been}} termed synchronous period doubling. This phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a nonlinear feedback mechanism at an early retinal locus. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to define the effect of stimulus contrast on period doubling in order to better understand the nature of the underlying mechanism. ERGs were recorded from three visually normal subjects in response to sinusoidal <b>flicker</b> <b>ranging</b> from 20 to 100 Hz, using stimulus contrasts of 37. 7, 56. 5, 75. 4, and 94. 2 %. Period doubling was quantified as: (1) the amplitude of an harmonic component of the ERG waveform that was 1. 5 times the stimulus frequency, and (2) the difference between the mean trough-to-peak amplitudes on even and odd cycles of the ERG waveform. Amplitudes were converted to responsivity by dividing by stimulus contrast. By both measures, subjects showed discrete regions of period doubling that were displaced to lower temporal frequencies as stimulus contrast was increased. The temporal frequency shift of period doubling with altered stimulus contrast can be accounted for quantitatively by postulating a neural threshold for the nonlinear feedback signal that is presumed to generate synchronous period doubling...|$|R
40|$|In most animals, vision {{plays an}} {{important}} role in detecting prey, predators and conspecifics. The effectiveness of vision in assessing cues such as motion and shape is influenced by the ability of the visual system to detect changes in contrast in both space and time. Understanding the role vision plays in shark behaviour has been limited by a lack of knowledge about their temporal resolution, contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this study, an electrophysiological approach was used to compare these measures across five species of sharks: Chiloscyllium punctatum, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, Mustelus mustelus and Haploblepharus edwardsii. All shark species were highly sensitive to brightness contrast and were able to detect contrast differences as low as 1. 6 %. Temporal resolution of <b>flickering</b> stimuli <b>ranged</b> from 28 to 44 Hz. Species that inhabit brighter environments were found to have higher temporal resolution. Spatial resolving power was estimated in C. punctatum, H. portusjacksoni and H. ocellatum and ranged from 0. 10 to 0. 35 cycles per degree, which is relatively low compared to other vertebrates. These results suggest that sharks have retinal adaptations that enhance contrast sensitivity at the expense of temporal and spatial resolution, which is beneficial for vision in dimly lit and/or low contrast aquatic environments. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} the slow and fast rod signals of the scotopic 15 -Hz flicker ERG {{in patients with}} molecularly confirmed Stargardt disease type I (STGD 1). There is evidence that these slow and the fast rod ERG signals {{can be attributed to}} the rod bipolar–AII cell pathway and the rod–cone coupling pathway, respectively. METHODS. Twenty-seven patients with STGD 1 with mutations in both alleles of the ABCA 4 gene were included. Scotopic ERG response amplitudes and phases to <b>flicker</b> intensities <b>ranging</b> from � 3. 37 to � 0. 57 log scotopic troland � sec (log scot td � sec) were measured at a flicker frequency of 15 Hz. In addition, scotopic standard ERGs were obtained. Twenty-two normal subjects served as controls. RESULTS. The amplitudes of both the slow and fast rod ERG signals were significantly reduced in the STGD 1 group. The phases of the slow rod signals lagged significantly, whereas those of the fast rod signals did not. The standard scotopic ERG did not reveal significant alterations. CONCLUSIONS. The results provide evidence that a defective ABCA 4 transporter can functionally affect both the rod bipolar–AII cell pathway and the rod–cone coupling pathway. In STGD 1, the scotopic 15 -Hz flicker ERG may reveal subtle abnormalities at different sites within the rod system that remain undetected by standard ERG techniques. (Invest Ophthalmo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the extent of, and basis for, abnormalities in the flicker electroretinogram (ERG) of the cone system {{of patients with}} X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a form of hereditary vitreoretinal degeneration. ERGs were recorded from six patients with XLRS and from six visually normal subjects using high-contrast sinusoidal <b>flicker</b> that <b>ranged</b> in temporal frequency from 8 to 96 Hz, and that was presented against a rod-desensitizing adapting field. Compared to the control subjects, the patients with XLRS showed {{a significant reduction in}} the amplitude of the ERG response fundamental at temporal frequencies of 32 Hz and higher. In addition, their response phases were at or below the lower limits of normal (representing a phase lag) for temporal frequencies greater than 8 Hz. The higher harmonics of the patients’ ERG responses to a low frequency stimulus were attenuated over the same temporal frequency range as was the response fundamental. This finding indicates that a major component of the abnormal temporal filtering responsible for the ERG abnormalities in XLRS occurs beyond the level of the early retinal nonlinearity that generates the harmonic components of the ERG response, and therefore is most likely postreceptoral in origin. Consistent with this interpretation, the ERG waveforms of the XLRS patients showed a significant attenuation of the ON-response component, with a normal OFF response. The overall pattern of results suggests that the marked reduction of ERG response amplitudes and the phase lag at the higher temporal frequencies in XLRS stem, at least in part, from a predominant attenuation of the ON-bipolar cell contribution to the flicker ERG...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSymmetric flicker modulates about a {{background}} light level and effects {{no change in}} the time-average luminance. Rectified flicker is achieved by modulating a luminance-increment and results in both a flickering component and an increase in the time-averaged luminance (luminance-pedestal) above the adapting background light level. We studied the effect that changes in adapting light level and local luminance (within the area of the flickering target) have on thresholds. We measured thresholds for single and multiple cycles of <b>flicker</b> over a <b>range</b> of adapting light levels (Threshold versus Intensity paradigm) and defined their gain as a function of luminance-pedestal amplitude (Threshold versus Amplitude paradigm). The dynamics of symmetric and rectified flicker responses were determined using a Stimulus Onset Asynchrony paradigm. The data show rectified flicker thresholds differ from symmetric flicker thresholds due to two factors that can be contrast-dependent or contrast-independent: (1) local adaptation, which varies with stimulus duration and (2) surround interactions that depend on adapting light level. The dynamics of the thresholds for symmetric and rectified flicker stimuli suggest the detection mechanisms occur early in the visual pathways, involving the magnocellular pathway...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{television}} and computer screens for presenting stimuli to animals is increasing as it is non-invasive and can provide precise control over stimuli. Past studies have used cathode ray tube (CRT) screens; however, {{there is some evidence}} that these give different results to non-flickering thin film transistor (TFT) screens. Hens’ critical <b>flicker</b> fusion frequency <b>ranges</b> between 80 and 90 Hz – above standard CRT screens. Thus, stimuli presented on CRT screens may appear distorted to hens. This study aimed to investigate whether changing the flicker rate of CRT screens altered hens’ discrimination. Hens were trained (in a conditional discrimination) to discriminate between two stimuli on a TFT (flickerless) screen, and tested with the stimuli on a CRT screen at four flicker rates (60, 75, 85, and 100 Hz). The hens’ accuracy generally decreased as the refresh rate of the CRT screen decreased. These results imply that the change in flicker rate changed the appearance of the stimuli enough to affect the hens’ discrimination and stimulus control is disrupted when the stimuli appear to flicker...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} better {{understand}} the nature of long-wavelength (L) and middle-wavelength (M) cone input into spectral sensitivity functions and determine the reliability with which it is possible to predict L:M cone inputs, we developed analytical methods to determine confidence intervals for L:M cone input for spectral sensitivity functions or data transformed to cone-contrast space. Spectral sensitivity functions measured by direct heterochromatic brightness matches are dominated by the L/M opponent channel over most of the spectral range. For detection of large/long test stimuli, spectral sensitivity functions show a characteristic “notch” at the adapting wavelength, with the L/M opponent channel dominating most of the spectral <b>range.</b> <b>Flicker</b> increment threshold (FIT) spectral sensitivity functions display many of the characteristics of the luminance flicker mechanism described by Stromeyer et al. (1987). [Vision Research, 27, 1113 – 1137]. Previous modelling of FIT spectral sensitivity functions proposed a 2 : 1 L:M cone input for most of testing conditions. We show that FIT spectral sensitivity functions are dominated by L cones but show L cone suppression under bright red adapting fields. For the fitted spectral sensitivity functions or simulated data sets, we found small confidence intervals for L:M cone input into the L/M opponent channel and conclude {{that it is possible to}} reliably predict L:M cone input ratios. However, for similar data sets of additive spectral sensitivity functions, we found large confidence intervals for L:M cone input ratios and conclude that it is not possible to reliably predict L:M cone input into the L/M non-opponent channel using available spectral sensitivity functions. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Purpose: We {{report on}} a semi-automated system for {{frequency}} analysis of the Stiles-Crawford effect of the first kind (SCE-I) using flicker methodology designed to gain insight into the temporal dynamics of the perceived visibility for alternating pupil entrance points. We describe the system and its calibration in detail and discuss psychophysical measurement data obtained for the two authors. Methods: A uniaxial system is used for SCE-I characterization of two emmetropic subjects {{as a function of}} flicker frequency for narrow wavelength bands chosen in the range of 450 - 700 nm using a fibre-guided tungsten-halogen lamp as light source. The flicker is realized using two orthogonally mounted galvanometric scanning mirrors that allow linear trajectories at any angle across the pupil. A fast tuneable liquid-crystal neutral density filter is used for brightness adjustment and another liquid-crystal filter is used for wavelength adjustment at each pupil point allowing simultaneous hue-shift determination for the Stiles-Crawford effect of the second kind (SCE-II). Results: Validation of the system is realized with a CCD camera, a spectrometer and a powermeter, and the data obtained are used in the software to calibrate all subsequent human subject measurements. The psychophysical data obtained show a strong frequency dependence of the Gaussian SCE-I with a characteristic directionality parameter,, that is found to increase from 0. 03 to 0. 06 /mm(2) with <b>flicker</b> in the <b>range</b> of 1 - 10 Hz. The simultaneously determined hue shift could not be determined beyond 1 Hz due to the longer time required for a subjective determination. Conclusion: We have reported on a fast uniaxial system for temporal characterization of the SCE-I. The psychophysical results obtained show that accurate specification of frequency in flicker analysis is mandatory when comparing SCE-I visibility and directionality curves obtained with those obtained using quasi-static bipartite fields. A uniaxial design offers unique advantages over that of common two-channel systems by completely eliminating spectral errors or brightness differences in the two branches that otherwise will impose on those of the visual system and degrade the psychophysical data.
