5000|$|Ilisha elongata, {{called the}} <b>elongate</b> <b>ilisha</b> (the FAO name) or Chinese herring or slender shad (even {{though it is}} not a close {{relative}} of herrings and shads) ( [...] , or simply 鳓, lè), is a species of longfin herring native to the coastal waters and estuaries of North Indian Ocean and Northwest Pacific. It is a relatively large species, up to 45 - 60 cm in total length. It is an important fishery species.|$|E

MG significantly induced 42 % of the neurite outgrowth of PC 12 cells at a concentration of 10 μM. To study the structure-activity relationships of MG, a series of monoglycerides was designed and synthesised. Bioassay results indicated that the alkyl chain length {{plays a key role in}} the neuritogenic activity of the monoglycerides. The groups that link the propane- 1, 2 -diol and alkyl chain were also investigated. An ester linkage, rather than an amido one, was found to be optimal for neuritogenic activity. Therefore, 1 -O-(stearoyl) glycerol (SG), which induces 57 % of the neurite outgrowth of PC 12 cells at 10 μM, was determined to be a lead compound for neuritogenic activity. We then investigated the mechanism of action of neurite outgrowth induced by SG on PC 12 cells using protein specific inhibitors and Western blot analysis. The mitogen-activated kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U 0126 and the phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) inhibitor LY 294002 significantly decreased neurite outgrowth. At the same time, SG increased phosphorylation of CREB in protein level. Thus...|$|R

Thus, SG-induced neuritogenic activity depends on the activation of the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK), cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and PI 3 K signalling pathways in PC 12 cells...|$|R
