40|$|Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) {{have been}} commercially {{harvested}} for many years, however wild stocks have declined due to environmental degradation, habitat loss and overfishing. The U. S. wild fishery of striped bass was 6. 8 million kg (15 million lbs.) in 1973, {{but declined to}} less than 0. 2 million kg (0. 5 million lbs.) in 1990. In {{the past few years}} striped bass populations have started to rebound due to restrictions on their harvest, but are unlikely to approach the 1973 levels. In response to decreased commercial catches, the striped bass and its hybrids have been commercially produced in ponds, raceways, and tanks to fulfill the <b>established</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>markets.</b> The 1995 aquaculture production was 4 million kg (9 million lbs.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. AI {{planning}} algorithms are {{not easily}} found in organizational scheduling support systems. Other areas that deal with scheduling, for example constraint based approaches and operations research, seemingly flourish. Although practical use of these approaches is also not abundant compared with their potential use, there at least is a clear and <b>established</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>market</b> for powerful optimization techniques. In this article, we describe an alternative {{way to deal with}} plan generation algorithms and techniques in organizational planning and scheduling support. Instead of focusing on planning problems, we propose to focus on planning subtasks and planning subproblems. Because this removes some of the elements that AI planning techniques typically have difficulties with, it might provide an opening for AI planning techniques to prove their value in practice...|$|R

40|$|Miscanthus is {{a highly}} productive, low-input biofuel crop that {{supports}} agricultural diversification with improved performance for climate commitment, energy security, and water quality over first generation biofuels. Despite its high performance, no local or regional markets for the feedstock have formed in North America, and current climate-based productivity assessment methods lack the information farmers and decision-makers need to <b>establish</b> <b>commercial</b> scale bioenergy <b>markets,</b> programs, and thermal co-firing plans. This study develops a Miscanthus Suitability Rating and a transferable field-scale siting method, applied at 10 m resolution across the State of Iowa to assess miscanthus production potential and identify individual farms that are highly suitable for large-scale miscanthus cultivation while maintaining a majority of existing row cropping acreage. Results show that highly suitable fields within 50 miles (84 km) of each of Iowa’s coal-fired electrical generating units (EGUs) can displace up to 43 % of current coal consumption. Every EGU in Iowa has land resource to produce local miscanthus to co-fire with other solid fuels at industry-leading levels without significantly impacting local row crop production. Seven of the state’s smaller facilities could even operate exclusively on local miscanthus with advancements in densification technology. The energy evaluation tool developed in this work estimates the energy return on investment (EROI) of Iowa miscanthus for existing thermal generation facilities between 37 and 59, depending on transportation requirements and chemical field applications. This transition would diversify local agribusiness and energy feedstocks, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide a sustainable, dispatchable, in-state fuel source to complement wind and solar energy...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade insecticide-treated nets have become a key {{strategy}} for malaria control. Social marketing is an appealing tool for getting such nets to poor rural African communities who are most afflicted by malaria. This approach usually involves subsidized prices to make nets and insecticide more affordable and help <b>establish</b> a <b>commercial</b> <b>market.</b> We evaluated a voucher system for targeted subsidy of treated nets in young children and pregnant women in two rural districts of southern Tanzania. Qualitative work involved focus group discussions with community leaders, male and female parents of children under 5 years. In-depth interviews were held with {{maternal and child health}} clinic staff and retail agents. Quantitative data were collected through interviewing more than 750 mothers of children under 5 years during a cluster sample survey of child health. The voucher return rate was extremely high at 97 % (7720 / 8000). However, 2 years after the start of the scheme awareness among target groups was only 43 % (45 / 104), and only 12 % of women (12 / 103; 95 % CI 4 - 48 %) had used a voucher towards the cost of a net. We found some evidence of increased voucher use among least poor households, compared with the poorest households. On the basis of these results we renewed our information, education and communication (IEC) campaign about vouchers. Discount vouchers are a feasible system for targeted subsidies, although a substantial amount of time and effort may be needed to achieve high awareness and uptake - by which we mean the proportion of eligible women who used the vouchers - among those targeted. Within a poor society, vouchers may not necessarily increase health equity unless they cover a high proportion of the total cost: since some cash is needed when using a voucher as part-payment, poorer women among the target group are likely to have lower uptake than richer women. The vouchers have two important additional functions: strengthening the role of public health services {{in the context of a}} social marketing programme and forming an IEC tool to demonstrate the group at most risk of severe malari...|$|R
