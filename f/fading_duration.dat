40|$|Aircraft {{navigation}} {{based on}} GPS (Global Positioning System) and WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) requires both code and carrier measurements {{to calculate the}} position estimate [1]. A GPS receiver’s carrier tracking loop is weaker than code tracking loop. Thus, carrier lock can more easily be broken under deep signal fading caused by ionospheric scintillation. If a receiver cannot track code and carrier of at least four satellite channels, the aircraft cannot navigate using GPS or WAAS. The solar maximum data set analyzed in this research demonstrates frequent deep fades and almost all satellites in view suffered from scintillation, which could significantly reduce number of simultaneous tracked satellites. Statistics of number of tracked satellites under 45 minutes of strong scintillation are given in this paper and importance of shorter reacquisition time of a receiver is also emphasized. In order to design an aviation receiver with shorter reacquisition time under frequent deep signal fadings, characteristics of signal fading have to be well understood. Two important characteristics of deep fading are analyzed, which are <b>fading</b> <b>duration</b> and time between deep fades. The <b>fading</b> <b>duration</b> model in this paper can provide a guideline for more robust aviation receiver design.

This paper compares the statistical properties of the two latest standardized MIMO channel models: Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) and IMT-Advanced (IMT-A) channel models. Closed-from expressions are derived for the spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), temporal autocorre-lation function (ACF), envelope level-crossing rate (LCR), average <b>fading</b> <b>duration</b> (AFD), power delay profile (PDP), and frequency correlation function (FCF) for both models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an energy-efficient power allocation strategy for Nakagami-m flat-fading channels with a delay-outage probability constraint. The operating input transmit power value {{is limited to}} P max The energy efficiency (EE), expressed in units of b/J/Hz, is represented as {{the ratio of the}} effective capacity to the sum of transmission power P t and circuit power P c. Since the EE-maximization objective function is quasi-concave, a unique global maximum exists. By using fractional programming, we develop an EE-optimal power allocation strategy that consists of two steps: 1) obtaining the power level P un, at which the maximum EE can be achieved, and 2) distributing the power optimally based on the minimum of P max and P un. We prove that while P un monotonically increases with P c, the maximum achievable EE is a monotonically decreasing function of P c. The analysis further allows us to derive the EE of three important cases: non-fading channels, extremely stringent delay-limited systems, and systems with no delay constraints.

The SU transmission parameters are chosen such that the primary user imposed interference power constraint (IPC) is satisfied. Three different types of IPCs, namely average interference power, peak interference power and interference power outage, are considered. For each IPC, the analytical solutions for choosing the AMC mode and power allocation in each fading block, and the corresponding SU achievable EC under given QoS requirements are derived. Furthermore, we investigate {{the performance of a}} hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) /AMC and obtain the closed-form packet loss rate expression. Illustrative results show the effects of the IPC, <b>fading</b> <b>duration</b> and fading severeness on the SU achievable EC under given QoS requirements. It is shown that for loose delay-outage requirements, average interference power and interference power outage constraints give higher SU EC than peak interference power constraint. However, for more stringent delay-outage requirements, the SU achievable EC for the three IPC is significantly reduced. The results also indicate that ARQ is helpful to significantly reduce the packet loss rate for loose delay constraint.

These models contain two individual summations and are, therefore, easy to implement with lower complexity. Detailed statistical properties, including auto- and cross-correlations of the in-phase, quadrature components of the channels, envelopes, and squared envelopes are derived. The time-average statistical properties and the corresponding variance are also investigated to justify that the proposed models achieve good convergence performance. Then, we present mobile-to-mobile (M 2 M) channel measurements at 2. 1 GHz and 700 MHz bands in suburban and forest environments. Four test scenarios are considered for the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) placed inside traveling vehicles or on a test cart pushed at a walking speed. Channel models are proposed for path loss, shadowing, small-scale fading based on measurements. The path loss exponents were found between 1. 2 to 7. 7, and the reference path loss is found larger due to the placement of antenna inside vehicle. The mean of shadowing is close to 0, and the variance varies from 1. 8 to 4. 9. Measurements suggest that small-scale fading follows distributions of the Weibull and cascaded Rayleigh with LOS.

40|$|Background: Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{a relatively}} prevalent disease and affects approximately 2. 4 – 15 % newborns. Probiotics supplementation therapy could assist to improve the recovery of neonatal jaundice, through enhancing immunity mainly by regulating bacterial colonies. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of probiotics on bilirubin level in neonates. Therefore, this study aims at systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of probiotics supplement therapy for pathological neonatal jaundice. Methods: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database (Wan Fang), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) were searched and the deadline is December 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics supplementation for pathological neonatal jaundice in publications were extracted by two reviewers. The cochrane tool was applied to assessing the risk of bias of the trials. The extracted information of RCTs should include efficacy rate, serum total bilirubin level, time of jaundice <b>fading,</b> <b>duration</b> of phototherapy, duration of hospitalization, adverse reactions. The main outcomes of the trials were analyzed by Review Manager 5. 3 software. The relative risks (RR) or mean difference (MD) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) {{was used to measure}} the effect. Results: 13 RCTs involving 1067 neonatal with jaundice were included in the meta-analysis.
