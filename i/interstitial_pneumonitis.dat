5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis.</b> Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Brazilian {{researchers}} have recently recognized a marked {{increase in the}} number of people using abusable drugs and the consequences of this habit. It has become a major public health problem in a potentially productive segment of the general population. In the last few years, several medical articles have given special emphasis to pulmonary complications related to cocaine use. This review is based on this information and experience acquired with groups of cocaine users. OBJECTIVE: To present to physicians the pulmonary aspects of cocaine use and warn about the various effects this drug has on the respiratory system, stressing those related to long-term use. DESIGN: Narrative review. METHOD: Pulmonary complications are described. These may include infections (Staphylococcus aureus, pulmonary tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/aids, etc.), aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, septic embolism, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, barotrauma, pulmonary granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia, <b>pneumonitis</b> and <b>interstitial</b> fibrosis, <b>pneumonitis</b> hypersensitivity, lung infiltrates and eosinophilia in individuals with bronchial hyperreactivity, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, vasculitis, pulmonary infarction, pulmonary hypertension and alterations in gas exchange.

Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis.</b>|$|E

Both types of mice develop a rapidly fatal disease characterized by hyperglobulinemia, production {{of a variety of}} autoantibodies (including antithymocyte and anti-red blood cell), and a number of lesions suggestive of an autoimmune pathology: neutrophilic dermatitis, thymic atrophy, glomerular immune complexes, <b>interstitial</b> hemorrhagic <b>pneumonitis</b> (which is usually the immediate cause of death), and swollen limb joints (1). The B cells of viable motheaten mice {{have been shown to be}} all or nearly all of the Ly- 1 + phenotype (Ly- 1 B cells) (4).

Because of the severity of the autoimmune syndrome in these mice, including the elaboration of autoantibodies exhibiting a variety of specificities, we examined and here report the immunochemical specificities and V gene family usage of mAb secreted from hybridomas obtained from viable motheaten mice.

A 12 -year-old, {{castrated}} {{male cat}} {{with a history}} of respiratory disease developed bilateral endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and granulomatous choroiditis, and unilateral glaucoma, and was killed. Other lesions included granulomatous optic neuritis, myositis involving extraocular muscles, and focal retinitis.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{incidence}} and clinical impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with acute myeloid leukemia at the time of diagnosis and during chemotherapy. The aims of the present study were to assess prospectively the incidence of active CMV infection in 69 consecutive patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to describe the outcomes of treatment. pp 65 antigenemia was monitored at diagnosis, post-induction and post-consolidation chemotherapy, and whenever CMV reactivation was suspected. Patients with pp 65 antigenemia received pre-emptive anti-CMV treatment. Fifty-nine patients achieved complete remission. Baseline CMV serology results were available for 56 of the 59 patients: 52 patients (93 %) were IgG positive. The overall incidence of pp 65 antigenemia in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy was 35 % (21 / 59) : 9 patients after induction and 12 post-consolidation. Sixteen of the 21 pp 65 -positive patients received anti-CMV treatment: 15 as pre-emptive therapy and 1 for <b>interstitial</b> CMV <b>pneumonitis.</b> Five patients received no anti-CMV treatment and did not develop CMV disease. Patients with pp 65 antigenemia had more hospital admissions (2. 57 vs. 2. 16; P= 0. 009), while patients with > 10 pp 65 -positive cells had more clinical complications (8 / 9 vs. 2 / 12; P= 0. 002). In conclusion, patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy should be monitored for active CMV infection. CMV reactivation in these patients was associated with an increased number of hospital admissions, and high levels of pp 65 antigenemia were associated with more clinical complications. Controlled studies are needed to assess the relevance of pre-emptive anti-CMV therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy. J. Med. Virol. 82 : 1201 - 1207, 2010.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Few {{published}} studies have compared epidemiological {{data on the}} prevalence, incidence or relative frequency of the different interstitial lung diseases. In this review, the data of such registries from three countries in Europe (Belgium, Germany and Italy) are compared {{with those in the}} USA (Bernalillo County, NM). These registries show some striking similarities, but also discrepancies, which in part may be real, but may also be due to selection bias. Indeed, the registries in the European countries encompass the patients seen by pulmonologists, while the registry in Bernalillo County is based on a general population study in a limited area. In addition, in some studies, prevalences and incidences were registered, while in others, only prevalences or incidences were registered. Finally, most, but not all studies were prospective. Nonetheless, the different studies showed that sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity <b>pneumonitis,</b> <b>interstitial</b> lung diseases due to collagen vascular diseases and not-defined (or postinflammatory) fibrosis were most frequent. In the majority of disease entities a male predominance was found. Surprisingly large differences in the use of diagnostic techniques, such as high-resolution computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage, open lung biopsy and transbronchial lung biopsy, were noted between the different studies...|$|R
40|$|Intraperitoneal {{injections}} of cord factor (trehalose dimycolate, TDM) provides {{a model for}} interstitial and hemorrhagic lung disease that is produced by a chemically defined substance. A single injection of 10 micrograms of TDM, in light mineral oil or hexadecane, into C 57 BL/ 6 mice produces <b>interstitial</b> and hemorrhagic <b>pneumonitis.</b> Following injection of TDM the pulmonary lesions increase gradually and become maximal by the seventh to ninth day, at which time 70 % of the mice show both gross hemorrhages and dense mononuclear infiltrates; an additional 20 % of the mice show only microscopic lesions. From day 14 onward the incidence and severity of the lesions decrease, and by day 28 the lungs are normal by both gross and light-microscopy examination. Only 5 % of the mice succumb. Except for peritonitis other organs are not affected. Doses of 3. 3 and 10 micrograms of TDM are equally effective in producing the lesions, but a dose of 1. 0 microgram of TDM causes only mild interstitial inflammation and lesser doses do not induce lesions. A single subcutaneous injection of 10 micrograms of TDM causes lesions in only 20 % of mice. Vehicle-injected mice do not develop lesions.

40|$|Objectives. To {{review all}} the current {{evidence}} of LEF-induced pneumonitis (LEIP) {{which will help}} rheumatologists recognize suspected cases of LEIP and to influence clinical guidelines. Methods. Thirty-two reported cases of LEIP (13 males and 19 females) were identified from a literature search and classified using Searles and McKendry’s classification criteria. Their clinical characteristics were reviewed. Results. All patients {{had a history of}} either exposure to MTX or interstitial lung disease (ILD) or both and all patients had RA. Most patients (82 %) had LEIP within the first 20 weeks of initiation of LEF. All patients who had a loading dose LEF and most patients with ILD developed LEIP early (within 12 weeks of exposure). Case mortality was 19 %. Two patients had previous MTX-induced pneumonitis (MTX-P) prior to initiation of LEF; both died from LEIP. There was a high mortality in the following groups of patients: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histological examination, pre-existing ILD and ground glass shadowing on high resolution computerised tomography (HRCT). Treatment with cholestyramine did not appear to alter clinical outcome. Conclusions. LEIP usually occurs within the first 20 weeks of initiation of LEF. Clinical features of patients who died were pre-existing ILD, ground glass shadowing on HRCT and DAD on histological examination, and these could be poor prognostic indicators. Patients need to be made aware of this rare complication. LEF should not be used in patients with previous MTX-P and should be used with caution in patients with ILD.

40|$|Interstitial lung {{diseases}} (ILD) {{are characterized}} by an acute or chronic inflammation of the alveolar capillary membrane, which affects the permeability of this membrane. A possible way to measure the permeability of the membrane is by radionuclide aerosol imaging. Pertechnegas, a gas composed of technetium-labelled carbon particles, has recently been proposed as a new ventilation agent to measure this lung clearance. The clearance by pertechnegas in the four most common forms of ILD (eight patients with connective tissue disease, 10 with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, nine with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and 10 with sarcoidosis) was measured and compared with 10 nonactive smoking controls. Because forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC) and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lung (DL,CO) {{are used in the}} assessment of functional severity of the ILD, the pertechnegas clearance was correlated with these lung-function indices. It was found that the time to half clearance of pertechnegas of the lung is significantly decreased in idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (p< 0. 0001), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (p= 0. 0005) and connective tissue disease (p= 0. 002) but not in sarcoidosis when compared with 10 nonsmoking controls. A significant correlation is also found between time to half clearance and FVC (r= 0. 76; p< 0. 0001), TLC (r= 0. 63; p< 0. 0001) and DL,CO (r= 0. 75; p< 0. 0001) for all groups together. For all subjects as a group, the time to half clearance is shorter in the upper lung zones than in the lower zones (p< 0. 0001) and the ratio between both zones is not significantly different between the different types of disease. These results indicate that pertechnegas clearance is increased in idiopathic <b>interstitial</b> pneumonia, hypersensitivity <b>pneumonitis</b> and connective tissue disease, but not in sarcoidosis and is related to the functional severity of the disease. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Community {{acquired}} pneumonia is one {{the frequent}} cause of hospital admissions. Whereas, hyponatremia {{is a common}} electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients and {{has been shown to}} be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We aim to studyt the association of hyponatremia with community acquired pneumonia in terms of morbidity and mortality. Methods: A prospective observational hospital based study was conducted in a hospital for a year. All patients with a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia and admitted in medicine ward, were included. Patients with diarrhea, known Chronic Kidney Disease, Heart Failure, Cirrhosis of Liver, Malignancy, taking diuretics, chemical <b>pneumonitis,</b> <b>interstitial</b> pneumonias and other debilitating disease were excluded. Results: Among the 72 cases of CAP, 61 % were females and 39 % were males. The mean age of patients was 51. 3 years, 22 (30. 55 %) patients had severe CAP. A total of 7 cases expired with an overall mortality of 13. 7 %. The mortality risk increased with increasing CURB- 65 score; CURB- 65 score 0, 0 %; CURB- 65 score 1, 0 %; CURB- 65 score 2, 0 %; CURB- 65 score 3, 10 %; CURB- 65 score 4, 33 %; CURB- 65 score 5, 100 %. i. e higher the CURB- 65 score, higher the death rate of CAP patients (p< 0. 05). Hyponatremia was a common occurrence at hospital admission with an incidence of 36. 11 %. Hyponatremia at hospital admission was also associated with a longer length of hospital stay in cured CAP patients. The mean length of hospital stay was 4. 3 days.

40|$|Advances in the {{understanding}} of human respiratory disease can come from careful clinical studies of the diseases as they occur in man, but such studies are naturally limited in terms of experimental manipulation. In the last 2 decades, an increasingly complex plethora of experimental respiratory disease models has been developed and utilized by investigators, but relatively less {{attention has been paid to}} the naturally occurring pulmonary diseases of animals as potential models. This paper is aimed at presenting selected examples of spontaneous pulmonary disease in animals that may serve as exploitable models for human chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, emphysema, interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hyaline membrane disease, and bronchial asthma. Chronic bronchitis in dogs is characterized by chronic cough, excessive mucus production, and chronic inflammatory changes in bronchial walls. The disease affects mainly smaller-breed dogs of middle age or older. Equine chronic bronchitis tends to be a small airway disease with marked goblet cell proliferation and excessive mucus production, which may be accompanied by alveolar emphysema. Many animals develop bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis obliterans secondary to chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia, but chronic respiratory disease (CRD) of rats may be the most useful model of bronchiectasis. Models for emphysema must include actual alveolar destruction and ideally should be accompanied by appropriate pathophysiologic decrements. Many animals occasionally develop emphysema, but the disease has not been well documented, except possibly in horses. The interstitial lung diseases of man represent a complicated and poorly understood group of entities and near-entities. The same is true for animals, although interstitial lung disease in animals is much less common than bronchopneumonia. Cattle seem prone to develop interstitial lesions. Proliferative interstitial pneumonia of cattle includes many morphologic similarities to the spectrum of human interstitial pneumonitides. Fibrosing alveolitis of cattle is a morphologic end point that may have its origins in different forms of <b>interstitial</b> injury. Hypersensitivity <b>pneumonitis</b> has been best detailed in cattle and in horses and is clinically, etiologically, immunologically, and morphologically similar to the disease in man. Hyaline membrane disease has been poorly documented in animals, with the possible exception of the neonatal respiratory distress syndromes of foals and piglets. Bronchial asthma is similarly not well established as a spontaneous disease in animals, although experimental models exist. Eosinophilic bronchiolitis of cattle may represent a useful asthma model but has been poorly detailed. In order to make them useful as models, more attention should be paid to detailing the clinical, morphologic, and etiologic aspects of these naturally occurring animal pulmonary diseases...|$|R
