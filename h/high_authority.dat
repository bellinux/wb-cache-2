5|$|The <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> (the {{predecessor}} to the European Commission) was a nine-member {{executive body}} which governed the Community. The Authority consisted of nine members {{in office for}} a term of six years. Eight of these members were appointed by {{the governments of the}} six signatories. These eight members then themselves appointed a ninth person to be President of the <b>High</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Special Council of Ministers (equivalent to {{the current}} Council of the European Union) was {{composed}} of representatives of national governments. The Presidency was held by each state {{for a period of}} three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the harmonisation of the work of the <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> and that of national governments, which were still responsible for the state's general economic policies. The Council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the <b>High</b> <b>Authority.</b> Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> and in these areas the Council (unlike the modern Council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> which was called the Commission in these Communities. The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E

5|$|The {{institutions}} of the ECSC were the <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> as a fifth institution representing civil society. This was the first international representation of consumers in history. These institutions were merged in 1967 {{with those of the}} European Community, which then governed the ECSC, except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other <b>high</b> <b>authority.</b> In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E

Notable scriptures throughout the sect include the Shikshapatri and the Vachanamrut. Other important works and scriptures include the Satsangi Jeevan, Swaminarayan's authorized biography, the Muktanand Kavya, the Nishkulanand Kavya and the Bhakta Chintamani.|$|E
5|$|The Authority's {{principal}} innovation was its supranational character. It had a broad area {{of competence}} to ensure {{the objectives of the}} treaty were met and that the common market functioned smoothly. The <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> could issue three types of legal instruments: Decisions, which were entirely binding laws; Recommendations, which had binding aims but the methods were left to member states; and Opinions, which had no legal force.|$|E
5|$|The ECSC {{was run by}} four institutions: a <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> {{composed}} of independent appointees, a Common Assembly {{composed of}} national parliamentarians, a Special Council composed of nation ministers, and a Court of Justice. These would ultimately form the blueprint for today's European Commission, European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Court of Justice.|$|E

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of <b>high</b> <b>authority,</b> Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{childhood}} marked by ostracism from his family, {{as a young}} man Rainilaiarivony was elevated to a position of <b>high</b> <b>authority</b> and confidence in the royal court, serving alongside his father and brother. He co-led a critical military expedition with Rainivoninahitriniony at the age of 24 and was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the army following the death of the queen in 1861. In that position he oversaw continuing efforts to maintain royal authority in the outlying regions of Madagascar and acted as adviser to his brother, who had been promoted to Prime Minister in 1852. He also influenced the transformation of the kingdom's government from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, in which power was shared between the sovereign and the Prime Minister. Rainilaiarivony and Queen Rasoherina worked together to depose Rainivoninahitriniony for his abuses of office in 1864. Taking his brother's place as Prime Minister, Rainilaiarivony remained in power as Madagascar's longest-serving prime minister for the next 31years by marrying three queens in succession: Rasoherina, RanavalonaII and RanavalonaIII.|$|E

5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to the Economic and Social Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} in 1957 of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) created new duplicate institutions to the ECSC (except for the Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice, which were shared). On 7 January 1958, {{it was decided}} that Brussels, Luxembourg, and Strasbourg would again be provisional venues until a final decision. Strasbourg would retain the Assembly, Luxembourg the Court and both Brussels and Luxembourg would host meetings of the Councils and Commissions (or <b>High</b> <b>Authority).</b> The discretion of the exact meeting place of the new Councils was given to the President of the Council. In practice, this was to be in the Château of Val-Duchesse until the autumn of 1958, at which point it would move to 2 Rue Ravensteinstraat in Brussels. Meanwhile, the ECSC Council was still based in Luxembourg, holding its meetings in the Cercle Municipal on Place d’Armes. Its secretariat moved within the city on numerous occasions, but between 1955 and 1967, it was housed in the Verlorenkost district.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Luxembourg {{ended its}} neutrality, {{and became a}} {{founding}} member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> of the European Coal and Steel Community. In 1967, the <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the European Parliament until 1981. Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Investment Bank. Several departments of the European Commission are also based in Luxembourg.|$|E
