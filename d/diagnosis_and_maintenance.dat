40|$|SUMMARY It is {{important}} to look for alternative forms of physical movement of people and equipments in order to assure <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks, especially {{in an environment where}} workers are subject to danger. An evident and classical solution is the use of the tele-operation and tele-robotics. If the tele-operation helps to solve a lot of real and technical problems, it still remains insufficient to assure an appropriate remote <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The use of virtual reality techniques with the tele-operation can be the solution for an effective remote maintenance and diagnosis. In this paper we show the inefficiency occurred with the use of only tele-operation in the remote maintenance, we introduce our original new system where we use virtual reality techniques and 2 D- 3 D matching (2 D camera image- 3 D virtual objects) with tele-operation to remotely collect machinery vibration data.

40|$|Aim: The {{inhalation}} {{route is}} widely used {{for the treatment of}} obstructive lung diseases. It is con-sidered that inadequate inhaler technique {{is the leading cause of}} therapy failure. This study was aimed to evaluate the parameters on adequate inhaler technique (IT) and treatment compliance of patients. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was applied to 200 patients with obstructive lung dis-ease (55 hospitalized and 145 outpatients) who were using inhaler devices in a chest diseases department of a university hospital. Results: In outpatient and hospitalized groups, the most selected form of inhaler therapy was metered dose inhaler (MDI). Younger patients were using inhaler devices more correctly than older ones (p< 0. 05). There was a positive relationship between the duration of therapy and prop-er IT (p< 0. 05). An initial education of inhaler usage and proper IT were also statistically associ-ated (p< 0. 001). There was no relationship between the educational level of patients and proper IT, awareness of the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> of inhaler therapy. The relations between the number of hospitalization and correct application technique, awareness of the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> of inhaler therapy were significant in hospitalized patients. Patients who know their diagnosis, were using inhaler devices correctly. Conclusion: The inhaler technique can be improved with an initial instruction of usage in these patients. The educational level of the patient may not influence the correct application rate with-out an adequate initial education of usage. In hospitalized patients, this period can be an op-portunity for the education of inhaler technique and serve to select a proper inhaler treatment modality in individual basis.

40|$|For many systems, like medical devices, nuclear reactors, and {{transportation}} systems, an adequate maintenance optimization approach {{is essential to}} ensure high levels of reliability and safety while keeping operational costs low. A promising approach towards this goal is condition-based maintenance, which plans maintenance only when the system health indicates a need for it. To infer the system health, monitoring devices are installed to collect health-related data. The path from the monitoring data to a maintenance schedule then involves the following steps: 1. fault diagnosis, i. e. detecting abnormal system behavior and identifying its cause; 2. failure prognosis, i. e. predicting future system health; 3. maintenance optimization, i. e. determining the required type of maintenance {{as well as the}} optimal time to perform the maintenance task. Although various methods have been published for all three tasks, discrepancies still exist between the assumptions made in the literature and the conditions encountered in practice. These discrepancies include, e. g., unrealistic assumptions regarding the absence of component interdependencies and regarding the (number of) available monitoring signals. This thesis contributes to resolving these discrepancies by proposing methods for fault <b>diagnosis,</b> failure prognosis, <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> optimization, particularly focusing on narrowing the gap between theory and practice. When treating the individual tasks, the dependencies between fault <b>diagnosis,</b> failure prognosis, <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> optimization are explicitly taken into account. <br/...|$|R
