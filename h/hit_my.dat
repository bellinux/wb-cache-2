I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was <b>hit.</b> <b>My</b> plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
500|$|Tonelli {{continued}} in the United States in 1978, recollecting [...] "I really <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> straps", reporting that he had swum world records in time trials at training. Because {{he was in the}} United States, he was allowed to qualify for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada by swimming fast times in events in North America. Tonelli raced in five events at the Canada Cup held in Edmonton, winning four. During a drunken party after the competition, Tonelli and some fellow swimmers decided to steal three giant flags from poles in the city centre: those of Canada, the City of Edmonton, and Alberta. In the process, Tonelli fell off the staff and was hospitalised, his arm put in plaster.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is based}} on a 19th-century Russian folktale, which Joe Ranft {{introduced}} to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film began production in November 2003, while Burton was completing Big Fish. He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: [...] "In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another. Our approach was more organic. Tim knew where he wanted the film to go as far as the emotional tone and story points to <b>hit.</b> <b>My</b> job was to work with the crew on a daily basis and get the footage {{as close as possible to}} how I thought he wanted it." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{was educated}} at Monk's Walk School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's parents split up when Dixon was four and Dixon's father moved away, {{resulting}} in Dixon later describing her family life as [...] "very dysfunctional". Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't <b>Hit</b> <b>My</b> Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I think about that time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good... I believe that every child {{has the right to}} grow up in an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, {{when asked about the}} lyrics [...] "Keep her coming every night" [...] and [...] "Sinking my fingertips into every inch of you", Levine said: [...] "Yep, that's sexual, all right. I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach. The little girls would enjoy them, and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect." [...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre." ...|$|E
500|$|Weaver began {{recording}} Saturday Night! – The Album in 1986. He {{was being}} {{barred from the}} studio where he originally recorded his single for [...] "P.S.K. What Does It Mean?" [...] and went to INS Studios in New York. To compose the music, Weaver first started working on the drums, stating that [...] "by 1985 I had mastered the 909." [...] After completing the drums, Weaver worked on lyrics and vocals when he [...] "smoked and drank until we got silly enough. At that point, {{the first thing that}} <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> mind-that was the song". Some songs were performed with live musicians such as [...] "B-Boy Rhyme and Riddle" [...] which had a live drummer brought in by engineer Joe Nicolo. The music on [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was the result of DJ Codemoney forgetting a plug for the 909. Weaver used the drum machine at the studio to record the song without the 909 on hand and accidentally pushed a button that sent the kick and snare to go to the timbales sound. This new sound was used for the song [...] "Saturday Night".|$|E

500|$|Brudenell was prosecuted in 1841 for a duel {{with one}} of his former officers, another long-serving professional. He was acquitted on a legal technicality, {{notwithstanding}} his boast on arrest that [...] "I have <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> man". The prosecution had demonstrated that Cardigan (using a duelling pistol with concealed rifling and a hair trigger, which was thought unsporting according to the usages of duelling) had fired upon Captain Harvey Tuckett. The indictment, however, was that the victim had been [...] "Harvey Garnet Phipps Tuckett". The discrepancy in the name allowed the jury of his peers, 120 in number, unanimously to acquit him; as a nobleman the law of the time allowed him to be tried for a capital crime before the House of Lords sitting as a jury, with the Lord High Steward as judge. This added to his unpopularity, with The Times alleging that there was deliberate, high level complicity to leave the loop-hole in the prosecution case and reporting the view that [...] "in England there is one law for the rich and another for the poor" [...] and The Examiner describing the verdict as [...] "a defeat of justice". Even his obituary described this evasion of justice as [...] "an absurd technical deficiency".|$|E
500|$|Nowitzki paced Dallas to a 60-win season. The team {{finished}} with the third-best record in the league, behind the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons. As in the 2004–05 season, he {{finished third in the}} league's MVP voting, this time behind Nash and LeBron James. He was again elected to the first team All-NBA squad. Nowitzki confirmed his superstar status during the playoffs as he averaged 27.0 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 2.9 assists. The Mavericks swept the Memphis Grizzlies, 4–0, with Nowitzki scored a clutch three-pointer in the closing seconds of Game 3 which tied the game and forced overtime. In the Western Conference Semifinals, the Mavericks played against the San Antonio Spurs again. After splitting the first six games, the Mavericks took a 20-point lead in Game 7 before Spur Manu Ginóbili broke a tie at 101 by hitting a 3 with 30 seconds left. On the next play, Nowitzki completed a three-point play, which tied the game at 104. In the end, the Mavericks won, 119–111, and Nowitzki ended the game with 37 points and 15 rebounds. Nowitzki commented: [...] "I don't know how the ball went in. Manu <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> hand. It was a lucky bounce." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Eric B. Is President" [...] was {{released}} {{as the first}} single with [...] "My Melody" [...] as the B-side. It peaked at number 48 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number forty on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. The track sparked debate on the legality of unauthorized sampling when James Brown sued to prevent the duo's use of his music. PopMatters' Mark Anthony Neal called it [...] "the most danceable hip-hop recording" [...] of 1986. According to Touré of The New York Times, [...] "It is Rakim's verbal dexterity {{as well as his}} calm, deep voice and dark tone that has made this song a rap classic: 'I came in the door/ I said it before/ I'll never let the mic magnetize me no more/ But it's bitin' me/ Fightin' me/ Invitin' me to rhyme/ I can't hold it back/ I'm looking for the line/ Takin' off my coat/ Clearin' my throat/ The rhyme will be kickin' it/ Til I <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> last note.'" [...] The second single, [...] "I Ain't No Joke", peaked at number 38 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Described as one of the album's [...] "monumental singles", Michael Di Bella wrote in the All Music Guide to Rock that [...] "Rakim grabs the listener by the throat and illustrates his mastery of the rhyming craft".|$|E

500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> home directly. A really big bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E
2500|$|Dalkowski's {{claim to}} fame was the high {{velocity}} of his fastball. Accurate measurements {{at the time were}} difficult to make, but the consensus is that Dalkowski regularly threw well above 100 miles per hour. Dalkowski's raw speed was aided by his highly flexible left (pitching) arm, and by his unusual [...] "buggy-whip" [...] pitching motion, which ended in a cross-body arm swing. [...] "I <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> left elbow on my right knee so often, they finally made me a pad to wear", recalled Dalkowski.|$|E
2500|$|Henry told a {{reporter}} after the incident, [...] "Yes, there was hand, but I'm not the referee. 'Toto' (Sébastien Squillaci) was going for the front, I was behind two Irishmen, the ball ricocheted and <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> hand. Of course, I continued to play... The referee did not whistle 'hand' but I can't say there wasn't hand." [...] Henry later defended himself against criticism, stating, [...] "Obviously I would have preferred that things panned out differently but I am not the official. I do not think we have stolen qualification".|$|E

2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling on top of my opponent. At that moment, I <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
2500|$|Tatum played chords with a {{relatively}} flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training. [...] Composer/pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett, [...] "Tatum {{taught me how to}} <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> notes, how to control them without using pedals. And he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone." [...] Jimmy Rowles said, [...] "Most of the stuff he played was clear over my head. [...] There was too much going on—both hands were impossible to believe. [...] You couldn't pick out what he was doing because his fingers were so smooth and soft, and the way he did it—it was like camouflage." [...] When his fastest tracks of [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] are slowed down, they still reveal a coherent, syncopated rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} college {{football}} game, {{he helped the}} Wolverines win back the Little Brown Jug that he had helped the Gophers secure from 1940-1942. [...] He holds {{the distinction of being}} the only player to win Little Brown Jug games playing for both Minnesota and Michigan. [...] Asked at the time about having the opportunity to battle for the Little Brown Jug {{from the other side of}} the fence, Daley denied having qualms about playing his former teammates: [...] "It will have to be just another game. [...] I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. [...] There won't be any qualms about how hard I <b>hit</b> <b>my</b> teammates or how hard they hit me." [...] He did note, though, that he wanted his last college football game to be memorable: [...] "If this is going to be my last game, I'd really like it to be one I can remember." ...|$|E
