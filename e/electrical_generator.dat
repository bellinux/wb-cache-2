5|$|The Panzerbeobachtungswagen IV (Pz.Beob.Wg.IV) was an {{artillery}} observation vehicle {{built on the}} Panzer IV chassis. This, too, received new radio equipment and an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator,</b> installed in the left rear corner of the fighting compartment. Panzerbeobachtungswagens worked in cooperation with Wespe and Hummel self-propelled artillery batteries.|$|E
5|$|The ships had {{extensive}} <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> systems. Leipzig had three power plants that {{each had a}} 180kilowatt turbo-generator and a 180kW diesel generator; this gave the ship a combined output of 1,080kW at 220volts. Nürnberg had four generators which comprised two 300kW turbo-generators and two 350kW diesel generators, for a total output of 1,300kW, also at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a {{short distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E
50|$|Three main loading devices used in turboexpanders are {{centrifugal}} compressors, <b>electrical</b> <b>generators</b> or hydraulic brakes. With {{centrifugal compressors}} and <b>electrical</b> <b>generators</b> the shaft {{power from the}} turboexpander is recouped either to recompress the process gas or to generate electrical energy lowering utility bills.|$|R

5|$|After 1994, Reck Club {{restored}} the wheels and brakes to original Model A specifications. Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 {{that saw the}} car repainted and the motor rebuilt. Pete George, although several years retired, aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration. After the restoration, a small modification replaced the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> with a more efficient Nu-Rex alternator.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary <b>electrical</b> <b>generator.</b> To {{make room for the}} new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, several weather {{stations}} reported hurricane-force winds. The Weather Bureau office in Wilmington, North Carolina, reported maximum sustained winds of 88mph (142km/h) and a peak gust of 135mph (220km/h), exceeding {{the previous record}} for fastest measured wind speed of 98mph (158km/h) set during Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Beach resorts there were heavily damaged. In Wrightsville Beach, located 10mi (15km) of Wilmington, 12houses were flattened by the hurricane. Damage to homes there were estimated by police to cost $300,000, and extensive damage to the water system was reported. In Long Beach, damage was less severe, with only minor property damage. Waves pushing past sand dunes caused cracks in seaside roads. Though surveys made no damage estimates, damage in Holden Beach {{was reported to have}} been worse than in Long Beach. A 300ft (90m) pier and a pavilion in Ocean Isle Beach were destroyed. In Topsail Beach and Kure Beach, several homes and businesses were either unroofed or destroyed. Yaupon Beach and Shallotte also had similar reports of unroofed homes. Two homes on Topsail Island were demolished, and extensive property damage was reported in Atlantic Beach. At Cape Fear, winds were estimated at 125mph (200km/h), with gusts as high as 160mph (260km/h), well into Category3 intensity. The powerful winds forced power to be cut off in Wilmington as a precautionary measure. As a result, 7,000telephones were knocked out of service. Damage to the Southern Bell Telephone Company's offices cost $150,000. Total damages in the city was estimated to cost nearly $2million. In Morehead City, a roof was blown from a yacht shed and multiple structures. Long-distance telephone services were also cut off. Off the coast on Ocracoke Island, power and communications failed during the storm after the island was battered by winds of 60mph (100km/h). Power outages were commonplace in other areas as well. In Southport, metal debris was scattered across city streets, and the damage there was described as worse than Hurricane Hazel. Half of its pier was swept away by the rough seas, and other buildings collapsed or sustained heavy damage. Numerous trees, including live oak, were uprooted by the winds. The United States Army provided the port with a temporary <b>electrical</b> <b>generator,</b> which provided power for water pumps and light. In Cape Hatteras, Helene caused an estimated $1million in damages. Although damage to infrastructure tapered off 10mi (15km) from the coast, crop damage was observed 40mi (65km) inland. Corn was the crop most affected by Helene.|$|E

25|$|The {{generator}} component, {{which is}} approximately 34% {{of the wind}} turbine cost, includes the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator,</b> the control electronics, and most likely a gearbox (e.g. planetary gearbox), adjustable-speed drive or continuously variable transmission component for converting the low speed incoming rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity.|$|E
25|$|A GTEL uses a turbo-electric {{drivetrain}} {{in which}} a turboshaft engine drives an <b>electrical</b> <b>generator</b> or alternator via a system of gears. The electrical power is distributed to power the traction motors that drive the locomotive. In overall terms the system {{is very similar to}} a conventional diesel-electric, with the large diesel engine replaced with a smaller gas turbine of similar power.|$|E
25|$|The {{refrigerant}} is boiled by {{the heat}} source in the evaporator to produce super-heated vapor. This fluid is expanded in the turbine to convert thermal energy to kinetic energy, that is converted to electricity in the <b>electrical</b> <b>generator.</b> This energy transfer process decreases {{the temperature of the}} refrigerant that, in turn, condenses. The cycle is closed and completed using a pump to send the fluid back to the evaporator.|$|E
