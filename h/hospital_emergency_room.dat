5|$|Adi Da's {{father told}} Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E

40|$|Leading {{causes of}} {{consumer}} product-related ocular trauma {{have not been}} well described. To delineate these causes in a nationally representative sample, data collected by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) were reviewed. Data {{were obtained from the}} National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a national probability sample survey conducted by USCPSC that continuously monitors consumer product-related injuries treated in <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> across the United States. These data formulated the product summary report for the calendar year 1991. The sampling frame for the NEISS consisted of hospitals listed on the Center for Health Statistics Master Inventory File stratified geographically by size of hospital and number of emergency-room visits. During the calendar year 1991, there were a nationally estimated 298, 852 consumer product-related eye injuries treated in <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms.</b> Appoximately 500 different products were implicated in these injuries, with the leading cause being contact lenses (hard and soft), accounting for an estimated 26, 490 emergency-room visits. This is followed by welding equipment (12, 771 visits), hair curlers/curling irons (5946 visits), and workshop power grinders (5476 visits).

500|$|Using {{a facial}} {{recognition}} system, the ferry bomber is identified and taken into custody.

Considering the case now closed, the government shuts down the [...] "Snow White" [...] investigation. Despite the killer having been caught, Claire and the ferry victims remain dead, which unsettles Doug since he is convinced that the [...] "Snow White" [...] team can actually alter history. Doug persuades Denny to do one last experiment: send Doug to the past to save Claire and stop the bombing; a risky procedure, since no human has ever been sent back. Doug survives the trip, because he was sent back to a <b>hospital</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> where they were able to revive him.

2500|$|The EMT {{program in}} the United States began {{as part of the}} [...] "Alexandria Plan" [...] in the early 1970s, in {{addition}} to a growing issue with injuries associated with car accidents. Emergency medicine (EM) as a medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960s and 1970s, hospital emergency departments were generally staffed by physicians on staff at the hospital on a rotating basis, among them general surgeons, internists, psychiatrists, and dermatologists. Physicians in training (interns and residents), foreign medical graduates and sometimes nurses also staffed the Emergency Department (ED). EM was born as a specialty in order to fill the time commitment required by physicians on staff to work in the increasingly chaotic emergency departments of the time. During this period, groups of physicians began to emerge who had left their respective practices in order to devote their work completely to the ED. The first of such groups was headed by Dr. James DeWitt Mills who, along with four associate physicians; Dr. Chalmers A. Loughridge, Dr. William Weaver, Dr. John McDade, and Dr. Steven Bednar at Alexandria Hospital, VA established 24/7 year-round emergency care which became known as the [...] "Alexandria Plan". It was not until the establishment of American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the recognition of emergency medicine training programs by the AMA and the AOA, and in 1979 a historical vote by the American Board of Medical Specialties that EM became a recognized medical specialty. The nation's first EMT's were from the Alexandria plan working as Emergency Care Technicians serving in the Alexandria <b>Hospital</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>Room.</b> The training for these technicians was modeled after the established [...] "Physician Assistant" [...] training program and later restructured to meet the basic needs for emergency pre-hospital care. On June 24, 2011, The Alexandria Hospital Celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Alexandria Plan. In attendance were three of the nation's first ECTs/EMTs: David Stover, Larry Jackson, and Kenneth Weaver.|$|E
