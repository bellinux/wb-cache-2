40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} the <b>Excesses</b> Incremental Breadth-First Search (<b>Excesses</b> IBFS) algorithm for maximum flow problems. We show that <b>Excesses</b> IBFS {{has the best}} overall practical performance on real-world instances, while maintaining the same polynomial running time guaran-tee of O(mn 2) as IBFS, which it generalizes. Some applications, such as video object segmentation, require solving a series of maximum flow problems, each only slightly different than the previous. <b>Excesses</b> IBFS naturally extends to this dynamic setting and is competitive in practice with other dynamic methods. ...|$|R

Their meaning and relationship have regularly been discussed and clarified. Here we develop a generalized set of one locus two-allele orthogonal contrasts for average <b>excesses</b> and average effects, based on the concept of the effective gene content of alleles. Our developments help understand the average <b>excesses</b> of alleles for the biallelic case.

5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have <b>excess</b> inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this <b>excess</b> is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule {{to take account of}} the residual gas load from the previous dive.

The total elimination of <b>excess</b> gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E
5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation <b>Excess</b> {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. <b>Excess</b> coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep over the Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 over the <b>Excess</b> convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to one encounter, MacLachlan flew over the <b>Excess</b> convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|E

Also, no Mg- 26 <b>excesses</b> were found in three plagioclase-bearing chondrules that were also examined. The Mg- 26 <b>excesses</b> in the hibonite chondrites indicated a common origin for chondrites with the <b>excesses.</b> The implied Al- 26 content in a proposed parent body could not, however, be confirmed as a widespread heat source in the early solar system...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} large Spitzer/MIPS GTO program, we have {{searched for}} {{infrared}} <b>excesses</b> due to debris disks toward 26 FGK field stars known from radial velocity (RV) studies to have one or more planets. While none of these stars show <b>excesses</b> at 24 µm, we have detected 70 µm <b>excesses</b> around 6 stars at the 3 -σ confidence level. The <b>excesses</b> are produced by cool material (< 100 K) located beyond 10 AU, well outside the “habitable zones ” of these systems and consistent with the presence of Kuiper Belt analogues with ∼ 100 times more emitting surface area than in our own planetary system. These planet-bearing stars are, by selection for RV studies, typically older than 1 Gyr, and the stars identified here with <b>excesses</b> have a median age of 4 Gyr. We find a preliminary correlation of both the frequency and the magnitude of dust emission with the presence of known planets. These are the first stars outside the solar system identified as having both well-confirmed planetary systems and well-confirmed IR <b>excesses.</b> Subject headings: infrared:stars; Kuiper Belt; planetary systems:formation; planetary systems:protoplanetary disk...|$|R

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{extending the}} previous analysis of infrared <b>excesses</b> among a volume-limited sample of 134 nearby A-K main-sequence stars to a magnitude-limited sample of stars, culled from the SAO Catalog, with <b>excesses</b> determined from the IRAS Point Source Catalog flux density ratios. This new sample includes 5706 B-M type stars, 379 {{of which have}} infrared <b>excesses.</b> The objective involved use of a statistically complete survey of objects in a standard catalog {{in order to assess}} the frequency with which different physical processes can affect the infrared output of stars. These processes include, but are not limited to, orbiting cold particle clouds and the onset of rapid mass loss. It is concluded that cold disks are consistent with the infrared <b>excesses</b> found among A-G dwarfs and G-K giants in the sample...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{searches}} for first-generation leptoquarks and heavy right-handed $W_R$ bosons have seen <b>excesses</b> in final states with electrons and jets. A bizarre property of these <b>excesses</b> {{is that they}} appear to violate lepton universality. With these results in mind, we study the phenomenology of supersymmetric models in which the Higgs arises as the sneutrino in an electron supermultiplet. Since the electron is singled out in this approach, one can naturally account for the lepton flavor structure of the <b>excesses.</b> In this work, we show that in such a framework, one can significantly alleviate {{the tension between the}} Standard Model and the data and yet evade current constraints from other searches. Lastly we point out that correlated <b>excesses</b> are expected to be seen in future multilepton searches. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

We will discuss in detail how a large boost factor can be obtained by the Sommerfeld and Breit{Wigner enhancement mechanisms.
