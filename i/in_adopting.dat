Therefore, in late 1967 the Isinglass project was terminated, with a brief effort to revive the project in 1968 proving unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy's accomplishments {{paid off}} {{in the form of}} better funding, and it {{embarked}} on the construction of many new ships. However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops during the three decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British <b>in</b> <b>adopting</b> the new technologies.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Ohio {{expressed}} interest <b>in</b> <b>adopting</b> a state flag, as several other states had already done. In late 1860, Qtr. Mr. Gen. David L. Wood and Adj. Gen. Henry B. Carrington devised a flag {{consisting of the}} state seal upon a white field. They had it flown above the Ohio State Arsenal in Columbus, in hopes that it might someday become the state flag. On January 17, 1861, at a banquet organized by the Columbus Typographical Union Local #5, future U.S. President James A. Garfield gave a speech defending the national flag as the only flag Ohio's soldiers would march to battle under. The generals, in attendance, were moved to set aside their proposal and hoist the Stars and Stripes in its place. Later that year, Wood and Carrington joined fellow Ohioans in battle under the 34-star Union flag, which would serve as the inspiration for a state banner decades later.|$|E
5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open one of his own. He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled <b>in</b> <b>adopting</b> new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, {{editor of}} the {{prominent}} trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely), and submitted it to the studios. Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure. Several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors <b>in</b> <b>adopting</b> the Code was to avoid direct government intervention. It was {{the responsibility of the}} Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.|$|E

50|$|Some red stars <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> emblems and flags have a {{significance}} {{that does}} not originally relate to socialism. Among these, the most well-known include the current state flag of California (echoing the Californian red star flag of 1836) and the flag of New Zealand (designed <b>in</b> 1869, officially <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> 1902). The flag of the District of Columbia (designed <b>in</b> 1921, <b>adopted</b> <b>in</b> 1938) recalls George Washington's coat of arms.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>adopting</b> Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several {{personal}} goals. He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland).|$|E
5|$|McCreary {{was not as}} {{successful}} in securing reforms during the 1914 legislative session. He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed responsiveness to McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards <b>in</b> <b>adopting</b> textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{asks for}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) help <b>in</b> <b>adopting</b> a baby, {{as the local}} {{adoption}} agency requires a reference letter from an employer. Andy promises to read her application letter, but tells the camera crew he will only sign it if she admits {{that she is a}} horrible person in it. However, Andy is unaware that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is using her own painful past as a non-adopted orphan to help Nellie with the process. When Andy coldly rejects Nellie's letter (which Erin helped her write), Nellie accepts his decision, but Andy is stunned to hear Erin crying sadly over the failure. He finally adds some mildly snarky but complimentary lines to her letter and signs onto it as a reference, leaving Nellie overjoyed.|$|E

40|$|Families of internationally adopted {{children}} face {{risks associated with}} travel if they pick up their children overseas. Unlike other travelers, they also face risks because of close contact with a child with uncertain infection and vaccination status. Tuberculosis organisms, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, and measles virus have been transmitted from {{adopted children}} to family and community members. Intestinal parasites, Bordetella pertussis, and other infectious disease agents can also be transmitted. Some of these infections may be inapparent or may not manifest <b>in</b> <b>adopted</b> children until many years after the adoption. Increased attention to preventive measures for family members and early diagnosis of infectious diseases <b>in</b> <b>adopted</b> children can reduce transmission of the organisms causing these infections. Those providing health care to families planning international adoption should know about standard pretravel advice, {{as well as the}} spectrum of possible infections <b>in</b> <b>adopted</b> children, so that they can protect the health of the travelers and family members and close friends who will welcome the new child into the home.
