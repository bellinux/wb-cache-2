Directional microphone and hot wire measurements were undertaken on a zero-lift generic plate model (Re = 2. 1 to 7. 9 x 10 Million). Various brush concepts were tested to clarify the functional relationship between design parameters and the ensuing aeroacoustic properties. First results of this ongoing work indicate a significant source noise reduction in excess of 10 db, thereby revealing two relevant noise reduction mechanisms. In addition to broadband turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise also narrow band contributions due to vortex shedding from the edge were alleviated...|$|E

50|$|The brush rabbit inhabits dense, brushy cover, most {{commonly}} in chaparral vegetation. It also occurs in oak and conifer habitats {{and it will}} live in brush or grassland, and form networks of runways through the vegetation. The brush rabbit does not dig its own burrow or den, but uses the burrow of other species, brush piles, or forms. In the San Francisco Bay Area, {{it was found that}} the brush rabbit concentrates its activities at the <b>edge</b> of <b>brush</b> and exhibits much less use of grassy areas. It uses the interior brush of the wilderness and it was also found that this may be a better environment for it than the chaparral one. Studies done on the brush rabbit in Oregon also showed that it rarely left the brushy areas it inhabits. Brush may be used more in the drier seasons while grasses are used in the wetter seasons in relation to growth of annual vegetation. Use of habitat also probably is related to the breeding season.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFollowing the {{decontamination}} {{metaphor for}} searching a graph, we introduce a cleaning process, which {{is related to}} both the chip-firing game and <b>edge</b> searching. <b>Brushes</b> (instead of chips) are placed on some vertices and, initially, all the edges are dirty. When a vertex is ‘fired’, each dirty incident edge is traversed by only one brush, cleaning it, but a brush {{is not allowed to}} traverse an already cleaned edge; consequently, a vertex may not need degree-many brushes to fire. The model presented is one where the edges are continually recontaminated, say by algae, so that cleaning is regarded as an on-going process. Ideally, the final configuration of the brushes, after all the edges have been cleaned, should be a viable starting configuration to clean the graph again. We show that this is possible with the least number of brushes if the vertices are fired sequentially but not if fired in parallel. We also present bounds for the least number of brushes required to clean graphs in general and some specific families of graphs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Edge {{preparation}} {{is a process}} to modify edge geometry and surface integrity of cutting tools. Edge preparation experiments of tungsten carbide cutting tools were carried out through an abrasive nylon brushing method. Tools wear and cutting temperatures with different edge radius were simulated with FEM software. The experimental results show that cutting edge defects were eliminated through <b>brushing</b> <b>edge</b> preparation. The edge radius has influences on cutting tool performance. When the edge radius is 20 µm, the least wear can be obtained. Then tool wear value increases with the edge radius. A suitable edge radius will have a reasonable cutting temperature distribution. The tool temperature distribution shows the same results as tool wear. A suitable edge radius range is needed for edge preparation and a reasonable edge radius is needed to improve tool life...|$|R

We consider such polymer brushes in good solvent and show that previous works, based on a self-similar concentric structure of the brush, are physically inconsistent. We use scaling laws to derive very simply the leading term of the free energy in the high curvature limit, where the osmotic pressure is the relevant physical ingredient.

For annealed polyelectrolyte and in the low-salt regime, the theory predicts that for sufficiently dense brushes, the salt concentration has a small influence on brush height, while the brush expands with increasing grafting density, in agreement with experiment. Expressions are presented for the interaction free energy of compressed ionizable and quenched polyelectrolyte brushes (proportional to the force between particles or curved surfaces).

Brown was unable to bat so the PM's XI were out for 250 and the MCC won by 3 runs. Robert Menzies invited both teams to dinner and at the end of his speech presented a delighted Fred Trueman with a silver tankard as a birthday present from the Australian people. The Duke joked to the Prime Minister [...] "I suppose you know you've just destroyed the disciplinary labours of several months?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me {{know when}} you get a hole in the back wall," [...] said Jean, and he went through the kitchen and {{cautiously}} out another door to slip into a low-roofed, shed-like end of the rambling cabin. This small space was used to store winter firewood. The chinks between the walls had not been filled with adobe clay, and he could see out on three sides. The rustlers were going into the juniper brush. They moved out of sight, and presently reappeared without their horses. It looked to Jean as if they intended to attack the cabins. Then they halted at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>brush</b> and held a long consultation. Jean could see them distinctly, though they were too far distant for him to recognize any particular man. One of them, however, stood and moved apart from the closely massed group. Evidently, from his strides and gestures, he was exhorting his listeners. Jean concluded this was either Daggs or Jorth. Whoever it was had a loud, coarse voice, and this and his actions impressed Jean with a suspicion that the man was {{under the influence of the}} bottle.|$|R
50|$|Support for the Two Strategies Hypothesis {{has been}} shown in studies of {{roosting}} rooks (Corvus frugilegus). A 1977 study of roosting rooks by Ian Swingland showed that an inherent hierarchy exists within rook communal roosts. In this hierarchy, the most dominant individuals have been shown to routinely occupy the roosts highest in the tree, and while they pay a cost (increased energy use to keep warm) they are safer from terrestrial predators. Despite this enforced hierarchy, lower ranking rooks remained with the roost, indicating that they still received some benefit from their participation in the roost. Interestingly, when weather conditions worsened, the more dominant rooks forced the younger and less dominant out of their roosts. Swingland proposed that the risk of predation at lower roosts was outweighed by the gains in reduced thermal demands. Similar support for the Two Strategies Hypothesis has also been found in red-winged blackbird roosts. In this species the more dominant males will regularly inhabit roosts in thicker brush, where they are better hidden from predators than the less dominant individuals, that are forced to roost at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>brush.</b>|$|R
60|$|Upon {{reaching}} camp, {{her attention}} was distracted from herself. Pepe, the Mexican boy, {{with the two}} shepherd dogs, was trying to drive sheep into a closer bunch to save the lambs from coyotes. Ellen loved the fleecy, tottering little lambs, and at this season she hated all the prowling beast of the forest. From this time on for weeks the flock would be besieged by wolves, lions, bears, the last of which were often bold and dangerous. The old grizzlies that killed the ewes to eat only the milk-bags were particularly dreaded by Ellen. She was a good shot with a rifle, but had orders from her father to let the bears alone. Fortunately, such sheep-killing bears were but few, and were left to be hunted by men from the ranch. Mexican sheep herders could not be depended upon to protect their flocks from bears. Ellen helped Pepe drive in the stragglers, and she took several shots at coyotes skulking along the <b>edge</b> of the <b>brush.</b> The open glade in the forest was favorable for herding the sheep at night, and the dogs could be depended upon to guard the flock, {{and in most cases}} to drive predatory beasts away.|$|R
