2500|$|A {{reporter}} from Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's most popular left-wing newspaper, questioned Panoramas practices and said: [...] "I am {{becoming more and}} more surprised with what the BBC says.

[...] According to Human Rights Watch, though many civilians in South Lebanon refused to abandon their homes and act on the IDF's warnings, many others were unable to flee due to crumbled infrastructure. Israel singled out much of Lebanese civilian infrastructure for destruction throughout the war {{and at the end}} of the conflict the damage was estimated to top 2.5 billion dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{eventually}} became the consensus {{candidate of the}} federalists, overcoming competition from like minded men including relative Ludwell Lee, William Fitzhugh, Martin Pickett, {{as well as two}} friends - Leven Powell and Dr. David Stuart. Opposing him for the anti-federalists was state Senator John Pope. Though there is little primary material describing the tenor of this first election, what does exist hints at a hard fought and sometimes dirty campaign. John Pope was called [...] "contemptible" [...] in a letter from John Murray to Horatio Gates, and William Allason writing to John Woodcock described the contest: [...] "I understand one makes very free with the other's Reputation [...] by wch. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear of their having Exchanged a few dry blows." [...] Lee eventually outpolled Pope, defeating him nearly 4 to 1 in Fairfax County alone, which included the vote of George Washington.|$|E

5000|$|.....stand {{back from}} each picture {{and take it}} all in, blink your eyes, and do it again. Then, move in close. Move in so your eyes nearly go crossed. Get close. Look at the brushwork. Look at the lines that fall like {{feathers}} across the canvas. The shapes they form {{look as though they}} grew there, organic. She applies her brush with surgical precision. Some of the forms appear cut and stenciled in place. Look close. You will not find a flaw, a misplaced stroke, a wandering streak of paint. Look at the spatters that land exactly where they should. Look at how she overlays color.Now, step back again, and appreciate her choice of color. It seems as though she perceives wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that elude the rest of us. Her choice of color imbues her pictures with a radiant energy that pulls at you, like the ineffable force that draws subatomic particles close to one another, yielding the essential elements of the universe. Somehow, I get the feeling she sees microwaves emanating from cell towers, or navigates guided by Earth’s magnetic field. She sees something {{the rest of us do}} not. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear that when she steps on to a glorious crowded beach drenched in glittering sunshine, populated by the myriad colors and contrasts of beach umbrellas, skin tones, sand, bathing suits, water—when she steps on that beach she feels breathless for the intensity of it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if she hears music in the midst of such a clamorous riot of light—sort of an inverse synesthesia, where you see colors when you hear music. Somehow, she pairs colors that feel right, but are by no means obvious brethren. And those color pairings elevate her pictures to another plane where sensibility transcends sense.|$|E
5000|$|For the weekend's race, NASCAR {{used the}} same high-drag package that was used at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. One change from the Indy package {{included}} an additional air duct mandated on the right-side window of the car. Previously, this was an option left up to the teams. What led NASCAR to mandating this was the excessive heat buildup in the cars caused by the high-downforce package.

40|$|In {{the field}} of music psychology, where both psychologists {{interested}} in music and music theorists interested in psychology mingle (or at least try to), Lerdahl and Jackendoff ’s Generative Theory of Tonal Music has become the book of reference since its publication in 1983. Despite considerable work accomplished in the meantime, no other theoretical account of music sympathetic to psychology has come to replace it as the first unavoidable reading. Understandably, the task {{would prove to be}} challenging as Lerdahl and Jackendoff have covered all structural aspects tonal music encompasses, in particular both temporal (rhythmic and metric) and pitch relationships. As far as meter is concerned however, Justin London’s Hearing in Time will be more than a serious contender. For those interested in the temporal aspects of music, that is rhythm, and especially meter, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if it superseded the aforementioned.

40|$|There are {{at least}} three {{significant}} problems in supplying information to scientists and engineers working on biomedical engineering projects. (a) By definition, the field is multi-disciplinary. It draws upon at least two separate literatures [...] that of engineering and physics and that of biomedicine. (b) Since it is a relatively new field, i,t does not vet have a significant formal literature of its own-only a few obvious journals such as the American Journal- of Medical Electronics, some new terminology, but that's about it. In the next few years, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to scc publications like the Journal- of Pacemaker Research or the Journal of the Artificial- Organ Society [...] if they don't already exlst. (c) A third factor is that which complicates the life of all scientists today. On the one hand, there is the small but diffuse literature of bioliledical engineering. On the other hand, there is the vast literature that is or may be of interest to biomedical scientists. Consequently, any good system of information retrieval in biomedical en-gineering must have the entire literature as its point of departure.
