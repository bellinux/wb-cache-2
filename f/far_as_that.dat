5|$|The Baltimore Beltway narrows {{from seven}} to six lanes within the interchange, which {{contains}} braided ramps {{providing access to}} the next interchange, MD 122 (Security Boulevard), located near the Security Square Mall and {{the headquarters of the}} Social Security Administration. Continuing north, the road widens to eight lanes again and continues through a mix of suburban homes and business parks in Lochearn. I-695 interchanges with MD 26 (Liberty Road) east of Randallstown and resumes north, narrowing to six lanes. It intersects the southern terminus of I-795 (Northwest Expressway), which serves as a bypass of MD 140 in the Owings Mills area. The Baltimore Metro's line to Owings Mills passes under I-695 within the interchange and runs in the median of I-795 as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> town. At the I-795 interchange, the signage of route changes from northsouth to eastwest.|$|E

25|$|After {{taking stock}} of the situation, and {{achieving}} a partial financial recovery, the CMU set about building the bridge and viaduct to cross the River Wye at Monmouth, and extend its line {{as far as a}} mineral depot at Wyesham, a mile from Monmouth. A transshipment facility was set up there, and the Monmouth Railway continued to operate, unmodernised, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> point. The extension of the CMU from the Troy station to Wyesham opened on 1 July 1861.|$|E

25|$|The Makah tribe linguistically {{belongs to}} the Southern Nootkan branch of the Wakashan family of {{languages}} among North American indigenous peoples. The Makah language, also known as qʷi·qʷi·diččaq (qwiqwidicciat) is the only Wakashan language in the United States. Other tribes speaking Wakashan are located in British Columbia, Canada, immediately across the Strait of Juan de Fuca {{on the west coast}} of Vancouver Island, and northwards as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> province's Central Coast region.

25|$|Eighteen {{years after}} the {{granting}} of the charter of incorporation, Leeds joined with other towns in the neighbourhood in a Memorial to the King wherein he was besought to settle his differences with the rebellious Parliament. Of this no notice was taken, and in the earlier stages of the Civil War the town was garrisoned for the Royal cause under Sir William Savile. But {{it was a very}} small Leeds which he occupied for the King in January 1643, having under him 500 horse and 1,500 foot. He made elaborate preparations for the defence of the place, digging a six-foot trench from St. John's Church by Upper Headrow, Boar Lane, and Swinegate to the banks of the river; erecting breastworks {{at the north end of}} the bridge, and placing demi-culverins in a position to sweep Briggate. Against him on Monday, January 23, advanced the redoubtable Sir Thomas Fairfax, at the head of a Parliamentary force which appears to have numbered at least 3000 horse and foot. Finding the bridge at Kirkstall broken down, Fairfax crossed the Aire at Apperley Bridge, and came on to Woodhouse Moor, from where he called on Savile to surrender. Savile returned the answer which was doubtless expected, and in the teeth of a heavy snowstorm, Fairfax led his troops forward to the assault. The action began about two o'clock of the afternoon and appears to have developed on all sides of the town. It rapidly went in favour of the assailants, and by four o'clock the Parliamentarian leaders and their troops were in Briggate and Boar Lane, while Savile and others were fleeing for their lives. Fairfax took nearly 500 prisoners and immediately released them on their promising not to take up arms against the Parliament on any further occasion. Though not a very great affair, it settled the question of King or Commons so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> part of the West Riding was concerned.|$|E
500|$|Knowing {{that they}} could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead {{designed}} to imitate the look of stop motion. Cory Edwards cited Rankin-Bass as an inspiration and explained, [...] "If we approach our look like that – photographed miniatures in stop-motion – and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures." [...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E

[...] At this point, Sammy Davis, Jr. walks onstage behind Jack, the audience screams, and Davis proceeds to speak and sing and dance for about 25 minutes while Benny continues to stand at center stage, quietly watching the spectacle. When Davis finally walks offstage and the audience's applause dies down, Benny continues to watch Davis offstage for a few moments, then, as the audience is finally quiet, continues: [...] "...

2500|$|The philosopher, if {{he loves}} true wisdom {{and not the}} passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true {{knowledge}} and wisdom in death, as {{he is no longer}} confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. [...] Death, however, is a rite of purification from the [...] "infection" [...] of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially [...] "good," [...] why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser Gods rule and where the most noble souls exist: [...] "And therefore, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead..., something better for the good than for the wicked." ...|$|E

If we're going to do anything, {{we have to do}} it now. I don't want to do it when I'm 60 years old. I mentioned that to Paul. He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's just wait until the winter tour is over and then you and me we're going to sit down in January and discuss what we're going to do.'" [...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on." ...|$|E
