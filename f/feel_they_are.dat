5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic {{games in the}} genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and are set in random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too simple for commercial release.|$|E
5|$|Steiner, Mitchell, and Hill <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{ready to}} present, {{but at the}} event, Blanchard places acid on the machine when {{everyone}} is unaware, causing an explosion. The funding for Steiner's project is ended instantly, however, Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with. Steiner goes to Blanchard's house, where Lembach and Latham are having dinner. He presents the men with the evidence that his machine was deliberately tampered with, and Lembach allows him to have another chance. Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach's house, and, with help from his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), he begins the procedure. However, right then, Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory.|$|E

These phones are easily recognizable by their bright blue light and have an emergency button that anyone can press which will automatically connect them to the UMass Police Department.

25|$|There {{are three}} main types of monastics. Those {{who live in}} monasteries under a common rule are coenobitic. Each monastery may {{formulate}} its own rule, and {{although there are no}} religious orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are highly influential. Eremitic monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> ready for it.|$|E
25|$|Freudian analysts {{claim that}} all sons <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in {{competition}} with their father and often feel in a battle against the father. This is well represented in Greek mythology as Chronos, {{the father of the}} gods, is in constant war with his children should they contradict him. This dominant patriarchal attitude still has roots in society today as men are viewed to be heads of families. (Sigmund Freud referred to this as Oedipus complex.) Freudian psychologists claim that the risk the son runs is that in some cases it is more difficult to win the battle against the father than to lose the battle against the father. This is because a common result of winning the battle against the father is that the son suffers tremendous guilt.|$|E
25|$|Cardinal: The {{cardinal}} {{signs are}} Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn. A native with mainly cardinal signs will {{not want to}} be held under anybody's thumb, and will need to take charge of their own world. Their attention may be concerned with themselves or others, but wherever their energies are directed it is difficult to deflect them from their chosen course. Cardinal signs in a chart will add courage, initiative and self-motivation. Cardinal subjects are hard to influence because they generally believe they know best. A subject lacking cardinal signs may <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> never in control of their own lives, but are manipulated by people and circumstances beyond their control. They may lack courage and initiative and may prefer others to make decisions for them. Planets in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses, and an emphasis on fire and air signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

500|$|English-speaking {{film critics}} were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they {{be accused of}} Boerehaat. According to The Star film critic Robert Greig, [...] "An apology {{situation}} developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want {{to be accused of}} boerehaat (Boer-hater)."

500|$|Church women {{personalize}} their attire, {{according to}} Patricia Fortuny. [...] Rebozos are worn by indigenous members and specially designed veils by other female members. Fortuny says that, [...] "...wearing long skirts does not negate {{the meaning of}} being a woman and, although it underlines the difference between men and women, [...] say {{that it does not}} make them feel like inferior human beings". Fortuny says women describe their attire as part of obeying biblical commands found in 1 Timothy 2:9, and 1 Corinthians 11:15 for long hair. Female members say the Church's dress code makes them <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> honoring God and that it is part of their [...] "essence".|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was {{conflicting}} instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title [...] "Tamarod Storm". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for big numbers to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, [...] "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored and when people <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> equal before law and that they all are first class citizens." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the film refers to a video game character, [...] "The Chumscrubber", who helps his friends {{to survive in a}} {{superficial}} world by keeping things authentic, and is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hero, carrying his severed head in his hand as he fights the forces of evil. The Chumscrubber's world was intended to be a reflection of the Hillside community, shown by the repetition of characters' lines in the video game; a voice in the game yells [...] "Kill him! Stab him! Get him again!", the exact line said by Billy to Lee {{at the end of the}} film, urging him to stab Charlie Bratley. Producer Bonnie Curtis described the character as [...] "this sub-human monster the kids <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> becoming". Posin commented that [...] "the Chumscrubber is everything that that community has suppressed or denied or tried to ignore, and [...] the idea that the collective denial of the community as a whole finally gives birth to a character that will not be ignored".|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, Aaliyah {{finished}} {{recording the}} album after having filmed her part in Queen of the Damned for four months, which ultimately delayed the album's release. In Australia, she also did {{a photo shoot}} for Aaliyah with photographers Jeff Dunas, Jonathan Mannion, David LaChapelle, and Albert Watson. Aaliyah handled five pythons at the shoot and developed an affinity for snakes, finding them [...] "dangerous, but quite beautiful" [...] and representative of her on the album. She revisited the snake theme in her music video for [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] in April and told MTV, [...] "They live in solitude, [...] there are {{times in my life}} [...] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> very complex creatures, [...] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well." [...] She described the record as [...] "a good reflection of [...] and the person [...] today", saying in an interview for Jet magazine, [...] "I am a young adult now, and I think this album shows my growth vocally." [...] Aaliyah was mastered by Bernie Grundman at his studio in Los Angeles.|$|E
