40|$|The role of {{critique}} in the Anglophone analytical {{tradition of}} philosophy {{of education is}} outlined {{and some of its}} shortcomings are noted, particularly its apparent claim to methodological objectivity in arriving at what are clearly contestable positions about the normative basis of education. Many of these issues can be seen to have a long history within European, and especially German, philosophy of education. In the light of this the discussion moves on to a consideration of similarities and contrasts between the Anglophone and German-inspired deployment of the concept of critical rationality in philosophy of education. The claims to objectivity of the Anglophone tradition are contrasted with a more self-conscious concern for social <b>justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> in other European traditions, which has been followed more recently by a greater scepticism concerning the potential of critique for delivering social <b>justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> in education. This has parallels with the growing Anglophone disillusion with 'classical' analytic philosophy of education. This in turn has resulted in a greater awareness of the limitations of critique: its ideological character, its rootedness in specific contexts, its own potential dogmatism and its ambiguities. The various contributions to this volume are briefly described and related to each other...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} strong {{pressure}} from {{just about every}} quarter in {{the last twenty years}} for higher education institutions to evaluate and improve their programs. This pressure is being exerted by several different stake holder groups simultaneously, and also represents the growing cumulative impact of four somewhat contradictory but powerful evaluation <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>movements,</b> models <b>and</b> advocacy groups. Consequently, the program assessment, evaluation <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> cycle today is much different and far more complex than it was fifty years ago, or even two decades ago, and it is actually a highly diversified and confusing landscape from both the practitioner’s and consumer’s view of such evaluative <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> information relative to seemingly different and competing advocacies, standards, foci, findings and asserted claims.

40|$|ABSTRACT In this article, I {{argue that}} we are {{witnessing}} a new phase or ‘theory turn’ {{in the field of}} educational leadership. These more critical perspectives in the field of educational leadership have typically been marginalised by the larger body of orthodox approaches due to a perceived lack of focus on best practice and ‘what works’ discourses, and especially in recent years with the rise of the school effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>movement.</b> However, critical perspectives in educational leadership constitute an essential and vibrant part of educational leadership scholarship and discourse. Drawing on Michel Foucault’s notion of discourse, through this article, I examine how critical perspectives have been constituted historically, with some of the main themes of research. This foregrounding also highlights a number of limitations with more orthodox and hegemonic leadership discourses. I identify a number of key writers in the field and situate them in the current theory turn, that is, an emphasis of theoretically informed research that have been prolific over the last 5 – 10 years...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} temperance and {{prohibition}} {{has long been}} constructed as either a rural backlash against modernity or {{a defining feature of}} middle-class culture. Early scholarship inaccurately denounced prohibition as a consequence of rural discontent in an increasingly urban immigrant America. More recent scholarship has relocated temperance in middle-class culture and politics, often to the neglect of the agrarian sector. Using an exploration of the production of space, this dissertation reexamines the place of temperance in the transition of the North American colonies from a largely subsistence-oriented society to a modern market-centric nation-state. I contend that as a middle-class movement, temperance emerged out of the enclosure <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>movements</b> <b>and</b> trace the movement’s history as a cultural arm of enclosure through to the passage of national prohibition. As shown herein, dry crusaders of the early republic were antagonistic to the subsistence farmers who were viewed {{as a threat to the}} national project. This antagonism was extended to new stock immigrant farmers who arrived in waves through much of the 1800 s. In an attempt to redefine American farms and fields, across the nineteenth and early twentieth century, temperance advocates pushed farm commercialization and the transformation of farming and food systems to meet the needs of an industrial society. But because temperance ideology failed to address the very real economic concerns of farmers in their struggles with the transition to commercial production, agrarian America remained ambivalent to temperance up to and following the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment...|$|R

Facebook has provided Riffians a platform to articulate a shared Amazigh identity, as well as to share their personal commitment to the social movement in the Rif.

Methods: An intervention study held in a private clinic in Fortaleza-CE, {{in the period of}} August to October, 2006 with 12 patients, in the age group of 20 to 55 years old, being submitted to NMB twice a week. Results: All patients (100 %) presented pain relief <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> in <b>movement</b> amplitude for tight femoral flexion, being it the most painful movement (91. 66 %). All presented positive neural tension test, remaining positive for 7 patients. A significant improvement in pain (p= 0. 001) and gain in the amplitude of tight femoral joint (p= 0. 002) occurred comparing the 1 st and 5 th appointments. Even with reduced pain in all patients, 7 (58. 3 %) continued the treatment for a more effective recover and prevention of reincidences.

40|$|Background: Suprascapular nerve block using {{anatomical}} landmark {{has been}} shown to be a safe and effective treatment for chronic shoulder pain from rheumatoid and degenerative arthritis. This can be performed as an outpatient procedure that reduces pain and disability. Aims and Objectives: To access efficacy of suprascapular nerve block in chronic shoulder pain. To compare results between placebo and use of methyl prednisolone with bupivacaine for nerve block. Materials and Methods: 60 patients with chronic shoulder pain were taken up for the trial. In the study group, all patients received the block through the anatomical landmark approach, with a single sitting suprascapular nerve block. On randomized basis, 30 patients were given 10 ml of 0. 5 % bupivacaine and 40 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate (depo medrol) to block the suprascapular nerve. Another 30 patients were injected with 11 ml of 0. 9 % saline. Patients were followed up on 2 nd day, 7 th day, and 21 st day and 3 months for the status of relief of pain <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> of <b>movement</b> of joint. Results: Evaluation of the efficacy of the block was achieved by comparing verbal pain scores <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> in range of movements at 2, 7, 21 days and 3 months after the injection. Significant pain relief is defined as improvement of more than 70 % on verbal and visual analog pain scale scores. Results were consistent with VAS score of pain. Maximum improvement was noted in the bupivacaine+methyl prednisolone mixed group. Conclusion: The result of this study shows a clear benefit of methyl prednisolone + bupivacaine for suprascapular nerve block in cases of chronic shoulder pain.

5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal <b>justice</b> reforms, <b>and</b> <b>improvements</b> in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|R

Fifteen subjects performed a standardised task, first with keyboard and mouse and, after a six week training period, with speech recognition. The use of speech recognition leads to improved postures of wrist, forearm, upper arm <b>and</b> shoulder <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> of neck <b>movements</b> when compared to the use of keyboard and mouse. Although the observation method was basic, this study provides insight into the potential benefits speech recognition has for posture. However, productivity decreased for most subjects and speech recognition appears to be usable for specific tasks only. From the perspective of productivity and the perception of user friendliness further development of speech recognition software is necessary. Up to now, speech recognition seems especially beneficial for people with WMSD complaints. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
