5|$|Export {{customers}} were sought after West Germany withdrew its objections to exporting the aircraft; Saudi Arabia {{was the only}} <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> of the Tornado. The agreement to purchase the Tornado {{was part of the}} controversial Al-Yamamah arms deal between BAE Systems and the Saudi government. Oman had committed to purchasing Tornados and the equipment to operate them for a total value of £250million in the late 1980s, but cancelled the order in 1990 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, the People’s Republic of China was {{identified}} as a possible <b>export</b> <b>customer.</b> Russia's state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion. China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $100million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12–48 aircraft. The fighters were intended to be used with the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme, with the former Soviet carrier Varyag as the centrepiece.|$|E
5|$|Libya {{was also}} {{expected}} to be an early <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for twelve to fifteen Su-35s along with other Russian weapons; however, {{the civil war in}} Libya and the resulting military intervention cancelled such plans. Russia has also offered the modernized Su-35 to India, Malaysia, and Greece; no firm contracts have materialised, with the first two countries having been occupied with other fighter projects and unlikely to procure the modernized Su-35.|$|E
50|$|The rifle {{is being}} marketed for <b>export</b> <b>customers,</b> but no {{sales have been}} achieved.|$|R
500|$|One key {{aspect of}} the Gripen program that Saab have been keen to {{emphasize}} has been technology-transfer agreements and industrial partnerships with <b>export</b> <b>customers.</b> The Gripen is typically customized to customer requirements, enabling the routine inclusion of local suppliers in the manufacturing and support processes. A number of South African firms provide components and systems – including the communications suite and electronic warfare systems – for the Gripens operated by South African Air Force. Operators also {{have access to the}} Gripen's source code and technical documentation, allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated. [...] Some <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> intend to domestically assemble the Gripen; it has been proposed that Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer may produce Gripens for other <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> as well.|$|R
5|$|Early {{variants}} {{included the}} Su-25UB two-seat trainer, the Su-25BM for target-towing, and the Su-25K for <b>export</b> <b>customers.</b> Some aircraft were being upgraded to Su-25SM standard in 2012. The Su-25T and the Su-25TM (also {{known as the}} Su-39) were further developments, not produced in significant numbers. The Su-25, and the Su-34, were the only armoured, fixed-wing aircraft in production in 2007. Su-25s are in service with Russia, other CIS states, and <b>export</b> <b>customers.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{country that}} had been {{reported}} to be a likely early <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35, the country was negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, the Royal Rhodesian Air Force was an {{important}} <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> of Britain, purchasing not only Hunters but also De Havilland Vampires and Canberra bombers. Rhodesia later deployed its Hunter FGA.9s extensively against ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas during the Rhodesian Bush War in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, occasionally engaging in cross-border raids over Zambia and Mozambique. The Zimbabwean Air Force Hunters were flown to support Laurent Kabila's loyalists during the Second Congo War, and were reported {{to be involved in}} the Mozambican Civil War. In Somalia, the Siad Barre regime's fleet of ageing Hunters, often piloted by former Rhodesian servicemen, carried out several bombing missions against rebel units in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, China {{became the}} first <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the Su-35 when the Russian and Chinese governments signed a {{contract}} worth $2billion {{for the purchase of}} 24aircraft for the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Although Chinese officials had first shown interest in the modernized Su-35 design in 2006, it was not until 2010 when Rosoboronexport, the Russian state agency responsible for the export and import of defence products, was ready to start talks with the Chinese government on the sale of the Su-35. Russian officials publicly confirmed that talks had been going on in 2012, when a protocol agreement on the purchase of the aircraft was signed. There were subsequent media reports and official remarks that the two countries had signed a contract and deliveries of the aircraft were imminent, but negotiations would not actually conclude until 2015.|$|E

5|$|India {{had been}} {{approached}} {{as a possible}} customer for the Jaguar as early as 1968, but had declined, partly {{on the grounds that}} it was not yet clear if the French and British would themselves accept the aircraft into service. India had already its Marut fighter-bomber, and tried to upgrade it with new engines, until the new project collapsed. A decade later IAF would become the largest single <b>export</b> <b>customer,</b> with a $1 billion order for the aircraft in 1978, the Jaguar being chosen ahead of the Dassault Mirage F1 and the Saab Viggen after a long and difficult evaluation process. The order involved 40 Jaguars built in Europe at Warton, and 120 licence-built aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) under the local name Shamsher ("Sword of Justice").|$|E
5|$|Jaguars were {{successfully}} {{sold to a}} number of overseas countries, India being the most prolific operator. The Jaguar International was an export version which was sold to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. The Ecuadorian Air Force, the only Latin American <b>export</b> <b>customer,</b> purchased 10 single- and 2 two-seat variants, officially designated Jaguars ES and EB, respectively. The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977. They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, but {{the main part of the}} fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians. Nigeria ordered 13 single-seat SN and 5 two-seat BN variants; SEPECAT delivered the first of these in May 1984. A subsequent order for an 18-aircraft second batch was cancelled. Some of those in service were withdrawn from operations on the grounds of economy, with the remaining aircraft put up for re-sale. The Royal Air Force of Oman, like Ecuador, ordered 10 single-seat and 2 two-seat variants, designated Jaguars OS and OB, respectively; the first was delivered in March 1977. A second identical 12-aircraft order was placed in the mid-1980s; these were joined by two ex-IAF and ex-RAF examples. The last of the Omani aircraft were retired on 6 August 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{continued to}} consider options to acquire heavy-lift helicopters throughout the 1960s, and a formal program {{to do so}} was launched in 1969 by the RAAF. Another team of RAAF officers travelled to the United States, and evaluated the Sikorsky CH-53 and the Chinook. The team leader, Group Captain Peter Raw, ultimately recommended that CH-53s be ordered. Senior RAAF officers and the Army were not pleased with this outcome, and the Air Board rejected Raw's report. Read, who was now an air vice-marshal and deputy chief of the air staff, was directed to review the choice of helicopters, and again recommended that Chinooks be acquired. He justified this choice {{on the grounds that}} the Chinook could carry more cargo than the CH-53 and was better suited for operations in the mountains of the Australian-administered Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Read's recommendation was accepted by the government, and an order for twelve CH-47C Chinooks was placed in August 1970. It was planned to rotate the helicopters in and out of service, six being available at any time. The order was suspended later in 1970 when a series of engine problems affected the United States Army's CH-47Cs, but was reinstated in March 1972 after these issues were resolved. The total cost of the purchase was $A37 million. The order made Australia the first <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the CH-47.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 651 Drakens were {{manufactured}} by Saab. Sweden's fleet of Drakens comprised {{a total of}} six different versions, while two additional models of the Draken were offered to prospective <b>export</b> <b>customers.</b> The final model of the Draken to be produced was the J 35F, which was also the final version to remain in Swedish service. Its <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> included Denmark and Finland. In May 1985, the Austrian Air Force purchased 24 J 35Ds, which had been refurbished by Saab.|$|R

50|$|The largest <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> for Mirage IIICs {{built in}} France were Israel as the Mirage IIICJ and South Africa as the Mirage IIICZ. Some <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> {{obtained}} the Mirage IIIB, with designations only changed {{to provide a}} country code, such as: Mirage IIIDA for Argentina, Mirage IIIDBR and Mirage IIIDBR-2 for Brazil, Mirage IIIBJ for Israel, Mirage IIIDL for Lebanon, Mirage IIIDP for Pakistan, Mirage IIIBZ and Mirage IIIDZ and Mirage IIID2Z for South Africa, Mirage IIIDE for Spain and Mirage IIIDV for Venezuela.|$|R
25|$|According to Flightglobal.com, in January 2007 Pakistan {{became the}} first Falco <b>export</b> <b>customer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Egypt {{became the}} first <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> of the Mirage 2000 when it ordered 20 {{aircraft}} in December 1981. The $890 million order encompassed 16 single-seat Mirage 2000EMs and 4 two-seat Mirage 2000BMs, as well as options for 20 more aircraft. The aircraft were delivered between June 1986 and January 1988.|$|E
25|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of the prototype (registered as X-2) was completed in just seven months. At its introduction at the Paris Air Show in November 1936, even before its first flight, the G.I was a sensation, appearing in a purple and yellow finish (evocative of the Spanish Republican colors, thought to be Fokker's first <b>export</b> <b>customer).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Yevgenia {{class are}} {{a group of}} minesweepers built for the Soviet Navy and <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> between 1967 and 1980. The Soviet {{designation}} was Project 1258 Korund.|$|R

25|$|In 1957, ČSA Czechoslovak Airlines {{became the}} only <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the Tu-104, placing the {{aircraft}} on routes to Moscow, Paris and Brussels. ČSA bought six Tu-104As (four new and two used examples) configured for 81 passengers. Three of these aircraft were subsequently written off (one due to a refuelling incident in India and another to a pilot error without fatalities).|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Portugal {{emerged as}} an early <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the Puma, {{ordering}} 12 of the helicopters for the Portuguese Air Force; Portugal would also be the first country to employ the Pumas in combat operations during the Portuguese Colonial War; the type was used operationally to complement the smaller Alouette III helicopter fleet during the Angola and Mozambican wars of independence, the type had the advantages of greater autonomy and transport capacity over other operated helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Qatar {{became the}} second <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the Mirage 2000-5 as it ordered twelve {{aircraft}} to replace its Mirage F1EDAs. Designated Mirage 2000-5DAs, the aircraft ordered consisted of nine single-seaters and three two-seaters, {{and the first}} delivery was made in September 1997. Qatar also purchased the MICA missile and the Apache stand-off cruise missile. The aircraft would be used sparingly, and by the mid-2000s, {{under pressure from the}} US to dispose of the aircraft and with most of the aircraft's operational life still intact, Qatar offered to sell the aircraft to Pakistan and later India. Such a deal would not materialise.|$|E
50|$|The 76/40 Model 1916's origins {{lay in the}} British QF 12 pounder 12 cwt gun {{designed}} 1893 {{and first}} produced in 1897. The QF 12 pounder 12 cwt gun was designed and produced by the Elswick Ordnance Company for the British Royal Navy and also for <b>export</b> <b>customers.</b> Italy and Japan were two early <b>export</b> <b>customers</b> that later purchased production licenses for the gun. The majority of the Italian guns were produced by the Ansaldo Company from a design provided during World War I by the Armstrong Company, {{the parent company of}} EOC.|$|R

25|$|The Netherlands also {{placed an}} order for 30 aircraft, {{designated}} as the Sea Hawk Mk 50, a ground-attack variant for the Royal Netherlands Navy, which was financed under NATO-issued funding. The Mk 50 was externally similar to the Royal Navy's own aircraft, differing in its use of a Philips-built ultra high frequency (UHF) radio; Dutch Sea Hawks were also later equipped to each carry a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. Between 1957 and 1964, the Dutch Navy operated a total of 22 aircraft. The last <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> was India who ordered a mix of 24 new-build Sea Hawks and 12 refurbished ex-FAA Mk 6s in 1959, following up with 30 additional airframes reconstructed from West German stocks, among others.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands was {{the first}} <b>export</b> <b>customer</b> for the Sea Fury, and the Netherlands Royal Navy {{operated}} the aircraft from two of their aircraft carriers, {{both of which were}} named HNLMS Karel Doorman as they were operated at separate periods from one another. It was common for Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to operate alongside Royal Navy ships, thus Dutch Sea Furies also regularly operated from FAA land bases and RN carriers. During 1947, Dutch Sea Furies operating from HNLMS Karel Doorman were employed in a ground support capacity against insurgent fighters in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch procured and license-built additional Sea Furies for carrier operations, although the type was ultimately replaced by the jet-powered Hawker Sea Hawk from the late 1950s onwards.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} design stages, the {{aircraft}} had grown from being {{roughly the same}} size as the Mosquito to being around double its weight. Although jet-powered, the Canberra design philosophy was very much in the Mosquito mould, providing room for a substantial bomb load, fitting two of the most powerful engines available, and wrapping it in the most compact and aerodynamic package possible. Rather than devote space and weight to defensive armament which historically could not overcome fighter aircraft, the Canberra was designed to fly fast and high enough to avoid air-to-air combat entirely. On 7 January 1946, the Ministry of Supply placed a contract for the development and production of four English Electric A.1 aircraft. It continued to be known as the English Electric A.1 until it was given the name Canberra after the capital of Australia in January 1950 by Sir George Nelson, chairman of English Electric, as Australia had become the aircraft's first <b>export</b> <b>customer.</b>|$|E
