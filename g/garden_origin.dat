5|$|The cottage {{garden in}} France is a {{development}} of the early 20th century. Monet's garden at Giverny is a prominent example, a sprawling garden full of varied plantings, rich colors, and water gardens. In modern times, the term 'cottage garden' is used to describe any number of informal garden styles, using design and plants very different from their traditional English cottage <b>garden</b> <b>origins.</b> Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|R

50|$|Nepeta × faassenii, a {{flowering}} plant {{also known as}} catmint and Faassens catnip, is a primary hybrid of <b>garden</b> <b>origin.</b> The parent species are Nepeta racemosa and Nepeta nepetella.|$|E
50|$|Viburnum × burkwoodii (Burkwood viburnum) is {{a hybrid}} {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Adoxaceae (formerly Caprifoliaceae). It is a cross of <b>garden</b> <b>origin</b> between V. carlesii and V. utile, grown for its early, strongly scented flowers.|$|E
50|$|Amelanchier × grandiflora (serviceberry) {{is a small}} {{deciduous}} flowering tree {{or large}} shrub, a hybrid of <b>garden</b> <b>origin</b> between A. arborea and A. laevis, in the family Rosaceae. It produces white flowers and small red to purple edible fruits.|$|E
50|$|The gardens {{include a}} mixture of native and {{non-native}} vegetation which invariably hosts a diverse range of both native and non-native fauna. The gardens host over 10,000 floral species, the majority being non-native species. The <b>gardens</b> were the <b>origin</b> from which many introduced species spread throughout south-eastern Australia as seeds were traded between early European botanists in the mid-19th century, studying the Australian flora.|$|R
2500|$|Edith Carrow Roosevelt, who had {{established}} her [...] "Colonial Garden" [...] {{on the site}} of the present Rose Garden, oversaw a similar but less formal planting on the east side, the site of the present Jacqueline Kennedy <b>Garden.</b> The <b>origins</b> of the Garden's present form initially began in 1913 with First Lady Ellen Louise Axson Wilson, at the time taking to calling it the East Garden, which saw Mrs. Wilson's design featuring a modest central lily pond. However, this work on the Garden was not completed in full until after the First Lady had already died in 1914, ultimately resulting in an area with a size of some 36 by 19 meters (118x62 feet).|$|R
50|$|Although {{of ancient}} origin, the first news {{documented}} about the town dates to 849, {{when it was}} a Lombard county included in the gastaldate of Salerno. Later (9th century - late 10th century) it was an Arabic stronghold. The terrace <b>gardens,</b> of Arabic <b>origin,</b> are still in use today. In 968 Tricarico was conquered by the Byzantine Empire, and then, in 1048, it became a Norman fortified town.|$|R
50|$|Hamamelis × {{intermedia}} (hybrid witch hazel) is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the family Hamamelidaceae. It is a hybrid of <b>garden</b> <b>origin</b> between H. japonica and H. mollis. Its Latin name refers to its intermediate appearance between those two species.|$|E
50|$|Zantedeschia elliottiana, golden arum or calla lily, is a {{herbaceous}} {{ornamental plant}} in the Araceae family.

50|$|Thymus citriodorus has {{had many}} {{different}} names over time, including Thymus x citriodorus, Thymus fragrantissimus, Thymus serpyllum citratus, Thymus serpyllum citriodorum, and more. It was also believed {{at one time}} that the plant was a hybrid of European <b>garden</b> <b>origin,</b> between Thymus pulegioides and Thymus vulgaris. DNA analysis has shown that T. citriodorus {{is not part of}} the DNA tree that includes T. pulegioides and T. vulgaris.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Gardens</b> had its <b>origin</b> in the 17th century, {{when the}} {{marriage}} of Leopold's great-grandfather Prince John George II of Anhalt-Dessau to the Dutch princess Henriette Catharina, daughter of Prince Frederick Henry of Orange (Oranje), in 1659 brought a team of engineers and architects from the Low Countries {{under the supervision of}} architect Cornelis Ryckwaert to lay out the town, the palace and a Baroque garden in the former settlement of Nischwitz, which was renamed Oranienbaum in 1673. The Dutch influence remained prevalent in the Principality of Anhalt-Dessau for many decades.|$|R
50|$|After the Sovietization of Armenia, the {{administrative}} area of Erivan (Yerevan) was gradually {{expanded to include}} the abandoned settlements of historic Shengavit. In 1938, the Spandaryan raion (Спандарянский район) was formed by {{the decision of the}} Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR, thus laying foundation for the future Shengavit District. Charbakh neighbourhood which is currently within the Shengavit District, was originally formed as a small village in 1924 at the south of the historic Teishebaini site of Karmir Blur hill. The name Charbakh is derived from the Persian words of char (چهار) meaning four, and bagh (باغ) meaning <b>garden.</b> The <b>origin</b> of the name is from the 4 farms or gardens that existed earlier in the area at the southeast of Shengavit, on the left bank of Hrazdan River. The village was mainly home to Armenian migrants from Nakhichevan and Van. With the noatble expansion of Charbakh during the 1950s, the village was divided into Verin Charbakh (Higher Charbakh) and Nerkin Charbakh (Lower Charbakh). In 1958, Charbakh became part of the newly-formed Shahumyan raion (Шаумянский район), thus becoming absorbed by the city Yerevan.|$|R
25|$|The East Corridor {{leads from}} the Central Lobby to the Lower Waiting Hall, and its six panels {{remained}} blank until 1910, {{when they were}} filled with scenes from Tudor history. They were all paid for by Liberal peers and each {{was the work of}} a different artist, but uniformity was achieved between the frescoes thanks to a common colour palette of red, black and gold and a uniform height for the depicted characters. One of the scenes is probably not historical: Plucking the Red and White Roses in the Old Temple <b>Gardens,</b> depicting the <b>origin</b> of these flowers as emblems of the Houses of Lancaster and York respectively, was taken from Shakespeare's play Henry VI, Part 1.|$|R
50|$|Calendula officinalis (pot {{marigold}}, ruddles, common marigold or Scotch marigold) is a {{plant in}} the genus Calendula of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to southern Europe, though its long history of cultivation makes its precise origin unknown, and it may possibly be of <b>garden</b> <b>origin.</b> It is also widely naturalised further north in Europe (north to southern England) and elsewhere in warm temperate regions of the world.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also an}} {{extraordinary}} range of geophytes, the plants that have bulbs or bulbous growths that make them especially adapted to woodland. These include the ancient woodland indicators of lily-of-the-valley, herb paris and ramsons, but also the uncommon in angular Solomon'-seal (Polygonatum odoratum) {{as well as the}} common in bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and lord-and-ladies (Arum maculatum). The one patch of Solomon's-seal (Polygonatum multiflorum) is considered to be of <b>garden</b> <b>origin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... × Heucherella is an {{evergreen}} perennial {{flowering plant}} in the family Saxifragaceae. A hybrid of <b>garden</b> <b>origin,</b> it {{is the result of}} a cross between two distinct genera, Heuchera and Tiarella, and shows similarities to both parents. This type of intergeneric hybrid is quite rare, and is indicated by a multiplication symbol before the name. The name Heucherella is an example of a portmanteau word, a combination of the two parents names.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gardens</b> {{owe their}} <b>origin</b> to the Cumberland Planning Scheme (1946-1951) which {{set aside the}} area {{along the banks of}} the Duck River for recreation. Both before and after the scheme, the council dumped rubbish and sewage along the banks and in brick and tile clay-pits for many years. In July 1968, Black {{presented}} a detailed report to the council on proposing a mixture of sporting grounds and intensive cultivation of the Duck River parklands. Black envisaged a series of gardens representing national styles from around the world. This vision was later reduced, though some elements survived, including the Japanese gardens and lake, the formal gardens and reflection pool, and the different Australian habitats.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>gardens</b> {{trace their}} <b>origin</b> to April 12, 1951 when the Beaumont Council of Garden Clubs was formed. Creation {{of a public}} garden {{was one of the}} goals of that organization. The gardens were first {{established}} in 1968 when the city of Beaumont set aside 10 acres of land at Tyrrell Park. [...] The Beaumont Garden Center Building was dedicated on August 20, 1971. In 1972, a master plan for the gardens was drawn up, and labeling of the trees, vines, and shrubs begun. The Beaumont Garden Center became the Beaumont Botanical Gardens in 1996. [...] In 1999, the city of Beaumont set aside additional acreage increasing the gardens to the present size of 23.5 acres.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the first}} {{recorded}} private botanical garden in Lausanne {{dates from the}} end of the seventeenth century, the first cantonal botanical <b>garden</b> had its <b>origin</b> in the donation by Baron Albert de Büren of his collection of 1700 plants to the state in 1873. This was to serve as the basis for the creation of a botanical garden by the canton. At first, there was a temporary placement at Champ-de-l 'Air near what is now the University Hospital of Lausanne. In 1890, the collection was moved to the site of the newly constituted University of Lausanne, below the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics, rue de Couvaloup, where it was essentially used for the teaching of pharmacy and visited mainly by students.|$|R
5000|$|Eremurus × isabellinus is {{a hybrid}} of <b>garden</b> <b>origin,</b> derived from the {{crossing}} of E. stenophyllus with E. olgae. The first crossing was made by Sir Michael Foster at Great Shelford,http://www.parksandgardens.org/places-and-people/site/5621?preview=1 England, {{at the end of}} the 19th century, and replicated in France by the Vilmorin nursery at Verrières-le-Buisson in 1902. The name of the hybrid is derived from the isabelline colour of the original F1 hybrid flowers. [...] The genus is often known by the common names foxtail lily and desert candle.|$|E
5000|$|Viburnum × carlcephalum (V. carlesii × V. macrocephalum), {{common name}} {{fragrant}} snowball, is a hybrid flowering {{plant in the}} family Adoxaceae (formerly Caprifoliaceae), of <b>garden</b> <b>origin.</b> Growing to 3 m tall and broad, it is a substantial deciduous shrub with heart-shaped leaves often turning red in autumn. Rounded flower-heads composed of many fragrant, tubular white flowers are borne in early summer. Flowering is later than many other deciduous viburnums. [...] The flowers are followed in autumn by insignificant red-black fruits.|$|E
5000|$|Philadelphus × purpureomaculatus is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Hydrangeaceae, of <b>garden</b> <b>origin.</b> It is a hybrid between P. × lemoinei and P. mexicanus Rose Syringa. Growing to 1.2 m tall by 2 m broad, it is a deciduous shrub with broadly oval leaves up to 5 cm long, and single, cup-shaped flowers in summer (June in the Northern Hemisphere). The flowers, which are strongly fragrant, are pure white with prominent purple markings near the centre; hence the Latin specific epithet purpureomaculatus, literally [...] "purple spotted".|$|E
50|$|The city {{centers on}} its Cathedral and the Jardin Floresta (Floresta <b>Garden).</b> The Cathedral’s <b>origins</b> {{date back to}} 1528 when it was {{established}} as a Franciscan monastery, with a church dedicated to Francis of Asisi. This church was reconstructed in 1788 by Damián Ortiz de Castro, and was dedicated to John the Baptist, who is the city’s patron saint. The cloister of the old Franciscan monastery was left intact. In 1862, this church became {{the seat of the}} diocese or see of Tulancingo, gaining cathedral status. In 2007, Tulancingo became an archdiocese with the seat remaining here. This archdiocese is subject to the archdiocese of Mexico and covers a territory of 8000 sq mi, or almost the entire state of Hidalgo and a few parishes in Veracruz. The bishop lives in the old cloister complex.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the area as a botanical <b>garden</b> has its <b>origin</b> in Henry Harold Pearson, a {{botanist}} from Cambridge University {{who came to the}} Cape Colony in 1903 to take up a position as professor in the newly created Chair of Botany at the South African College (the predecessor of today's University of Cape Town.) In February 1911, Pearson visited the area of Kirstenbosch by cart to assess its suitability as a site for a botanical garden. On 1 July 1913, the area was set aside for this purpose by the government of the Colony, with an annual budget of ₤1,000. There was no money set aside for a salaried director's position, but Pearson accepted the position without pay. He lived in the gardens in difficult and reduced circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|This {{provides}} {{plenty of}} scope for growing plants of diverse size and form. However, species {{of many of}} the genera of interest can be found at lower altitudes too. For example, many bulbous plants (or more strictly, geophytes) flower as snow recedes (or as rain begins to fall on the cool down towards snow-falls in the autumn). The timing of this, of course, varies with altitude, and as a result attractive and garden-worthy examples can be found from mountain foothills right up to the upper alpine zones. So we see the alpine enthusiast growing a wide range of the three [...] "Cs" [...] - Crocus, Colchicum, Cyclamen - in order to provide colour and interest through autumn, winter and spring. And so the interest continues to grow, with many plants that are well-suited to the alpine or rock <b>garden</b> having their <b>origins</b> from way outside the alpine zones of the world.|$|R
50|$|For a long time, Philadelphus coronarius was {{the only}} mock-orange of gardens, though some adventurous Americans grew the native P. inodorus that Mark Catesby had {{discovered}} growing {{on the banks of}} the Savannah River; it appeared in Lady Skipwith's garden lists and George Washington ordered some from Bartram in 1792. Mock-oranges are popular shrubs in parks and gardens, grown for their reliable display of late spring flowers; the scented species are particularly valued. In addition to the species, there are numerous <b>garden</b> <b>origin</b> hybrids and cultivars available, selected for doubleness and large flowers, with some compromise as to scent.|$|E

6000|$|John Marrot's {{garden was}} a small one--so small that the break-van of his own [...] "Flyin' Dutchman" [...] could have {{contained}} it easily--but it was not too small to present a luxuriance, fertility, and brilliance of colour that was absolutely magnificent! Surrounded as that garden was by [...] "ballast" [...] from the embankment, broken wheels and rail, bricks and stones, and other miscellaneous refuse and debris of the line, {{it could only be}} compared to an oasis in the desert, or a bright gem on a rugged warrior's breast. This <b>garden</b> owed its <b>origin</b> to Lucy Marrot's love for flowers, and it owed much of its magnificence to Will Garvie's love for Lucy; for that amiable fireman spent much of his small wage in purchasing seed and other things for the improvement of that garden, and spent the very few hours of his life, not claimed by the inexorable iron horse, in assisting to cultivate the same.|$|R
50|$|During {{the work}} of about half a century in Calcutta, Mr. Percy-Lancaster {{introduced}} many new plants from abroad. He had a particular fascination for hybridization work and many plants found in Indian <b>gardens</b> owe their <b>origin</b> to him. A complete list of the hybrids is catalogued in {{the records of the}} Agri-Horticultural Society of India. He watched for worthwhile spontaneous mutations. He discovered many interesting mutants in: Acalypha, Canna, Codiaceum, Hibiscus, Malvaniscus, Panax and Sansevieria.Percy-Lancaster also laid out the Sunder Nursery in Delhi, with Humayun's Tomb as its backdrop. Apart from seeds and saplings, the nursery delivered flowers and fresh fruits and vegetables, on order. As soon as Lutyens and Baker designed plans for the city of New Delhi with broad roads and avenues, he was commissioned to set up a nursery and select trees to be grown at their sides. He did this, by planting 15,000 trees and 150 miles of hedges.|$|R
