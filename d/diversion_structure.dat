The <b>diversion</b> <b>structures</b> will divert runoff from existing conduits at the surface to dropshafts used to transport the runoff down to deep tunnels which serve as temporary reservoirs. The model studies involved the construction and testing of two <b>diversion</b> <b>structures,</b> four vertical dry weather flow dropshafts, two sloping dry weather flow dropshafts, and three vertical storm water flow dropshafts. Also during the test program, various modifications were made on these basic models. The purpose of the model studies was to assist in the development of effective and practical <b>diversion</b> <b>structures</b> and dropshafts and to study their hydraulic operating characteristics for various flow conditions. Numerous modifications were made, with limited documentation of each, to develop an optimum design. When an optimum design had evolved, more detailed observations were made during which static and fluctuating pressures were recorded and black-and-white photos, colored slides, and colored movies were taken. Photographic documentation proved to be an excellent method of recording the overall hydraulic characteristics of the structures and the air entrainment and escape mechanisms.

40|$|Spate {{irrigation}} is {{a complex}} and unique form of water management, which represent {{the main source of}} irrigation water in semi-arid river catchments. Water is diverted from seasonal rivers by using <b>diversion</b> <b>structures</b> made by stones, earth and brushwood, located within the river bed. The modernisation of spate irrigation realised in Raya Valley (northern Ethiopia) resulted in disappointing performances. One of the main reasons for this failure was the poor consideration of the characteristics of seasonal catchments and local communities’ needs and preferences. Local farmers, who showed a deep knowledge of the river system, were involved only at the level of consultation. The aim of this research was to develop a participatory Diagnostic Analysis (DA) for a traditional non-modernised spate irrigation system in Raya Valley, in order to involve local farmers within the development process, and to build a solid knowledge basis for effective improvements. A Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) of the Harosha spate irrigation system was undertaken. PRA techniques focusing on spatial, temporal, socio-economical and spatiotemporal aspects of the system were performed with local farmers in order to identify and rank main problems and constraints to development. Farmers recognised the need of more resistant <b>diversion</b> <b>structures</b> and gabion walls for the stabilisation of the river bank. The involvement of farmers also helped to highlight that not only irrigation-related problems, but also flood-related problems threaten agricultural production and rural livelihoods. Rather than an irrigation system approach, an approach integrating irrigation development and flood risk mitigation is suggested for framing future development strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{atmospheric}} conditions and surface runoff during {{an event of}} extreme precipitation have been simulated using numerical weather and hydrological runoff models. The results are compared to the available observations, indicating that the simulations are quite successful in reproducing the event. In the atmospheric simulations, there are very large orographic gradients in precipitation, but no direct observations to verify these gradients. The increase in runoff provides however an indirect validation {{and the quality of}} the results are such that numerically simulated precipitation will be used in future hydrological studies in the region. These studies are of great importance to improve flood prediction for the area and for the creation of design floods for various hydropower plants, reservoirs and <b>diversion</b> <b>structures</b> within the river basin...|$|R
40|$|Flood-based {{farming is}} among the {{potential}} options in ensuring access to water for crop and livestock production for small-scale farmers in the arid and semiarid lowlands of sub-Saharan Africa, and Ethiopia in particular. Flood-based irrigation while inexpensive is rooted in tradition in many rural communities which {{is in contrast to}} many other irrigation types which are unavailable (in terms of water source, technology or capacity) or are costly to develop. Spate irrigation has been practiced in different parts of Ethiopia for many decades, but it was only recently that it gained the government’s attention. This study was conducted through a review and informal discussion with the objectives of documenting the current status, trends and prospects of spate irrigation in the country and the associated challenges, taking cases of selected schemes in different regional states. The study revealed that spate irrigation is expanding either through improvement of traditional schemes or by developing new ones. Neither the traditional nor modern schemes are free of challenges. The traditional schemes suffer from floods that damage their <b>diversion</b> <b>structures,</b> while poor design and construction of <b>diversion</b> <b>structures</b> have led to the failure of new ones. A range of socio-technical improvements in the planning, implementation and operation of schemes is proposed, including the design of headworks and canals consistent with the size and nature of expected flows, structures to minimize sedimentation, building capacity of farmers and district officers, and monitoring and improving the management that currently adversely impacts the performance of the schemes. Consulting farmers at every stage of the development, and building the capacity of engineers to deal with the unique nature of spate flows are the most likely interventions to ensure successful agricultural production using spate irrigation...|$|R

30|$|Water {{management}} for paddy irrigation usually involves utilization of water available from different sources including river flow at different locations and water {{storage in ponds}} and reservoirs. Within an irrigation district, available irrigation water of different tributaries can also be mutually conveyed to cope with severe droughts.
