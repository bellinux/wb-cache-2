25|$|A {{hearing aid}} or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is {{designed}} to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.|$|E

The research shows that the Roberts Court has been <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> important issues than the other modern Courts. I reason that the Roberts Court has been <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> important issues because interest groups and individuals are turning to the Court to make policy.

Their girlfriends ask to <b>hear</b> <b>more,</b> so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E

500|$|While {{operating}} modes are switched automatically the Volt {{allows the}} driver to choose from three drive modes: normal, sport and mountain. The mountain mode, {{which is expected to}} be required only under unusual power demand conditions, increases minimum battery state of charge (SOC) to around 45%, thus maintaining performance on steep and long grades. The driver will <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> engine noise due to the higher rate of power generation required to maintain this mode. The sport mode causes the engine to rev higher, and the response to the throttle pedal is quicker. The Ampera has an additional option, the [...] "City Mode" [...] or [...] "battery hold", allowing {{the driver to}} save the energy currently stored in the battery for use when traveling in urban areas or restricted zones.

[...] DEP from Billboard, also calling Hudson a talent, classified the record as [...] "textured modern-rock collection that is equal parts grit and vulnerability" [...] and [...] "impressive".

500|$|Elephants {{are known}} to {{communicate}} with seismics, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; {{this is known as}} the [...] "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in marine mammals like toothed whales and sirenians. A unique sphincter-like muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> seismic signals. Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.

Seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to [...] while those from vocalisations travel [...]|$|E
500|$|While {{convinced}} that she would only play violin, eighteen-year-old Autumn decided to sing {{on one of her}} songs as a way of demonstrating to a major music producer, who wanted to sign her on a label, how it should sound. She became unhappy with the changes done to her songs, and decided to break away from the label and create her own independent record label, Traitor Records. Through it, she debuted with her classical album , which she recorded in 1997 when she was seventeen years old; its title refers {{to the fact that the}} album took only a day to record. It consists of her performing works for the baroque violin accompanied by Roger Lebow on the baroque cello, Edward Murray on harpsichord, and Michael Egan on lute. She considered it [...] "more of a demo despite its length", and released it as [...] "a saleable album" [...] after fans who enjoyed her [...] "rock performances starting asking for a classical album so that they could <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> of the violin."
