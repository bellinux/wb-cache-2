5000|$|PLOTEUS is {{an acronym}} of Portal on Learning Opportunities Throughout European Space, meant to connote πλωτηρ (ploter) which means [...] "navigator" [...] in ancient Greek. It is a European Union web portal, coordinated by the European's Commission Directorate-General for {{education}} and culture, that aims to help citizens find out about education and training opportunities, [...] throughout the countries belonging to the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Turkey, though the latter {{did not participate in}} PLOTEUS at its launch, as it was {{not a member of the}} Leonardo da Vinci programme yet. According to France 5, the portal offers an [...] "easy access" [...] to an [...] "excellent source of information" [...] from primary school to postgraduate education. PLOTEUS has been prioritised as a [...] "project of common interest" [...] by the European Commission (Commission Decision of 23 December 2002, article 8.2.c). The European Parliament and the European Council have confirmed in 2006 their [...] "support for transnational web-based services such as PLOTEUS". The portal is run by the <b>Euroguidance</b> network, financed by the Leonardo da Vinci programme, and is interconnected with EURES, the European Commission's portal on job mobility information. Both PLOTEUS and EURES are considered as examples of [...] "pan-European services". After the launch of PLOTEUS and EURES in 2003, the Bologna process drive to favour student mobility in Europe wa further expressed in 2004 by the launch of the Europass program, which is accessible from the EURES portal, as well as PLOTEUS.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{carried out}} by <b>Euroguidance</b> Italy aimed at exploring behaviours, practices and meanings attributed by Italian young people to international and national mobility experiences, outside their regional areas, for studying and working reasons. A sample of 1787 individuals, between the age of 15 and 30, living in different Italian regions were interviewed through the CATI methodology. The outcomes show that only 16 % of the sample spent a period in studying and working abroad and only 17 % spent a period in studying and working in Italian areas different from where they live. The mobility experience for those that moved to an other Country was mainly linked to the interest towards a cultural exchange and involved mostly young people resident in Regions of the North and Centre; while, for those that leaved for other Italian Regions, the mobility experience {{was related to the}} need to find a job and involved mostly young people resident in Southern Regions and Italian islands. Besides, the effective mobility experience, the attitude towards that experience is much more marked concerning more then 60 % of the interviewed sample. The motivation is related above all to cultural elements (to enrich the own knowledge, to learn a foreign language, to compare different cultures). All results gathered stress the importance to realise guidance actions aimed at fostering a mobility culture and to monitor the phenomenon throughout longitudinal studies in order to assess changes and diversities in the attitudes towards a similar experience and the consequent approach of the Italian population...|$|E
40|$|This {{grounded}} theory study explored the existential lived experience of migrants and second-generation Greek-Cypriot returnees to Cyprus {{and implications for}} counselling psychology. It looked at their motivation to return/migrate, their encounter with the new world and desires to belong. Eight semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} four migrants and four returnees, recruited within the Cyprus <b>Euroguidance</b> employment service in three cities, Nicosia, Limassol and Larnaca in Cyprus, E. U. All participants {{were in the process of}} seeking employment. Migrants and returnees faced intense dilemmas following relocation. Returnees ’ motivations to return were influenced by childhood memories of visiting the country, desires for an improved economic and familial lifestyle, and the need to find a true sense of belonging. Migrants’ motivations included being married to a Cypriot, hoping for better economic prospects and living in a sunny environment. People experienced a cultural transition after choosing to put their ethnic identity in a different ethnic environment to the one where it was formed and in their attempts to find work, develop friendships, be accepted and find a home they experienced an unsettling reality. In Counselling psychology terms, the findings support other literature (Ward, Bochner, & Furnham, 2001) highlighting that migrants go through phases of adjustment, with cultural contact and acceptance by the host society, as well as financial independence being key factors. They described their experience as an outsider in a system dominated by nepotism and in a society new to them, that appeared to be suspicious of them. This transition lived by them was psychologically de-stabilising, characterised by stress, frustration, depression and isolation. Their commitment to find a way t...|$|E
