5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing {{that he is the}} lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

He discovered it could be turned into something useful. He patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Zoo-keeping {{seems in}} fact, in the {{surviving}} evidence, {{the most common}} work performed by dwarfs. Royal zookeepers mostly {{took care of the}} king's pets such as hunting dogs, domestic cats and guenons. This may be because these animals were very easy to tame and would not become a danger to the dwarfs. A unique relief from the mastaba of the high official Nyankhnesw (6th Dynasty) shows a dwarf taking a leopard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk.</b> <b>In</b> another tomb (that of the high official Nofer, also of the 6th Dynasty), one relief shows a dwarf and his guenon while the little ape pilfers grapes from a fruit basket and plays with his cord. Further Old Kingdom reliefs suggest that guenons literally assisted their keepers: in the tomb of Kaaper a unique relief depicts a dwarf and his guenon, as they both specify the clock for a pair of musicians. In contrast, depictions of dwarfs working themselves as musicians are very rare.|$|E

500|$|Like {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, A Thousand Leaves {{also contains}} songs {{that deal with}} gender roles and stereotypes. The song [...] "Female Mechanic Now on Duty", sung by band member Kim Gordon, was a reaction to how journalists categorize female musicians. It was inspired by Meredith Brooks's hit [...] "Bitch". Similarly, in [...] "The Ineffable Me", Gordon expressed her opposition to such limitations. The song [...] "Karen Koltrane", sung by Ranaldo, is about a lover from his college days who had [...] "a far less extraordinary adulthood" [...] than he had first thought, while [...] "Hoarfrost", which was originally titled [...] "Woodland Ode", was inspired when Ranaldo and his wife Leah Singer went <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the snow during a visit they made to Singer's parents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The track [...] "Sunday" [...] is generally considered the album's most accessible song. It was originally recorded for Richard Linklater's 1997 film SubUrbia, but was later re-recorded for A Thousand Leaves.|$|E
500|$|Tolle recalls {{going out}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> London the next morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, {{and he began}} to feel a strong {{underlying}} sense of peace in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching the world go by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E
500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended {{to spend a few}} days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee told him that it would probably be the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, {{and that it would be}} hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and went <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> Phoenix Park.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 April, Yorke {{wrote on}} Radiohead's website: [...] "Yesterday we {{finished}} recording. I am free and happy and now I'm going <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the park." [...] Having completed over 20 songs, the band considered releasing {{them as a}} series of EPs or a double LP, but struggled to find a track listing that satisfied them. O'Brien felt the material was too dense for a double album and that listeners might skip tracks. Instead, Radiohead saved many songs for their next album, Amnesiac, released the following year. Yorke said Radiohead split the work into two albums because [...] "they cancel each other out as overall finished things. They come from two different places, I think... In some weird way I think Amnesiac gives another take on Kid A, a form of explanation." [...] Kid A was mastered by Chris Blair in Abbey Road Studios, London.|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately overwork, an {{addiction}} to laudanum, alcohol and poor financial management took their toll. But Colburn suffered from another flaw. Following his numerous visits to the 1867 Paris Exhibition on behalf of Engineering, where he contracted syphilis, he became increasingly delighted by London prostitutes whose pleasures he much enjoyed. In the divorce petition filed against him by his wife Elizabeth, Colburn is accused of infecting her with syphilis, physical abuse, and adultery with five different prostitutes. Colburn, sensing the impending shame offered by Fleet Street journalists and their diligence to seek out and publish the truth, became depressed and reckless, leading to {{his return to the}} U.S. - where he found himself disowned by his wife Adelaide Felicita Colburn and daughter Sarah Pearl - and eventual suicide at age 38.

2500|$|On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, {{saying to}} his {{geophysicist}} Chris Van Galder {{that he would}} return by 7:00 for supper. His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk {{in the snow and}} play hockey in the airport's hangar for a substitution, but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He went <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10m (32ft), many wolf tracks were visible around the body. [...] Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen glowing in the dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.|$|E
2500|$|The Astros had a coast-to-coast flight lasting {{six hours}} {{the night before}} game one of the NLCS and had to face Steve Carlton who had beaten the Astros six {{straight}} times.

The Astros went up 10 in the third and Astros pitcher Ken Borsch, who gave up four hits in the first three innings, settled down retiring the side 1-2-3 in the fourth and fifth innings. Pete Rose reached on an infield-hit inn the sixth, but Forsch went right back to work retiring the next two batters. [...] Then Greg Luzinski stepped up to the plate. [...] Luzinski worked Forsch to a full counted, fouled of the next pitch and then sent a bomb to 300 level seats of Veterans Stadium for a two-run homer. The Phillies added an insurance run in the next inning when Garry Maddox stole third and ex-Astro Greg Gross looped a single to left allowing Gross to score.

2500|$|At The Wigwam, Chief Flying Hawk {{could have}} rest and relaxation. Show touring {{schedules}} were grueling, each spring through fall, with performances twice daily.

He refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets. With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight. McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk’s grace and dignity: [...] "The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur. From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear’s oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions. His hair, now still reaching to his waist, was streaked with grey. In reply to how Indians were able to retain their hair in such perfect condition, he said they did always retain it, sometimes they got scalped, but they prided themselves in caring for their bodies.

2500|$|The Wigwam was Chief Flying Hawk’s {{second home}} for nearly thirty years. Traveling with Wild West shows, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health.

Of importance, Flying Hawk was an Oglala Lakota Chief and it was his duty to display his beautiful eagle feather “Chief’s Wand” during visits to The Wigwam. [...] “At sun-up the Chief was missing. [...] Breakfast was delayed. Presently, Chief Flying Hawk was seen coming from the forest which nearly surrounds The Wigwam. In his hand he carried a green switch six feet in length. [...] From his traveling bag he took a bundle which he carefully unfolded and laid out, a beautiful eagle feather streamer which he attached to the pole at either end. [...] After testing it in the breeze he handed it to McCreight with gentle admonishment to keep it in a place where it could always been seen. [...] It was the Chief’s “wand,” and he said it must always be kept where it could be seen, else people would not know who was Chief.
