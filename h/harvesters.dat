5|$|The 20th century {{saw many}} {{changes in farming}} on Shapinsay. Mechanised {{implements}} came to the island, particularly after the Second World War.

5|$|Butterflies {{are often}} polymorphic, and many species {{make use of}} camouflage, mimicry and aposematism to evade their predators. Some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances. Many {{butterflies}} are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants. Larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., <b>harvesters)</b> eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants. Culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the visual and literary arts.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume <b>harvesters</b> to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve.

40|$|Western <b>harvester</b> ants, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, are seed eaters {{that occur}} in short- and mid-grass prairies. <b>Harvester</b> ants are {{efficient}} seed predators but {{they may also be}} seed dispersers. We examined what ants collect to address that question. We also studied how different cattle grazing intensities affected <b>harvester</b> ant nest densities. Items collected by western <b>harvester</b> ant foragers returning to their nests were categorized as non-seeds, seeds, and nothing. <b>Harvester</b> ants collected large amounts of non-seeds (48 %), followed by seeds (33 %) and nothing (19 %). Western <b>harvester</b> ants tolerate some environmental stress caused by grazing because nest densities were highest in moderately grazed grasslands. Interestingly, other aboveground arthropods in Colorado grasslands are reported to decrease in response to grazing, especially moderate to heavy grazing regimes. <b>Harvester</b> ants prefer to collect seeds but do not collect them exclusively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigate}} experimentally {{the concept of}} energy harvesting from galloping oscillations {{with a focus on}} wake and turbulence effects. The <b>harvester</b> is composed of a unimorph piezoelectric cantilever beam with a square cross-section tip mass. In one case, the <b>harvester</b> is placed in the wake of another galloping <b>harvester</b> with the objective of determining the wake effects on the response of the <b>harvester.</b> In the second case, meshes were placed upstream of the <b>harvester</b> with the objective of investigating the effects of upstream turbulence on the response of the <b>harvester.</b> The results show that both wake effects and upstream turbulence significantly affect the response of the <b>harvester.</b> Depending on the spacing between the two squares and the opening size of the mesh, wake and upstream turbulence can positively enhance the level of the harvested power...|$|R
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle <b>harvesters.</b> These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
