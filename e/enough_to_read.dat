Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|E

For instance, he convinces her to fight back against a rival coffee shop that is spreading rumors about The Talon – the coffee shop that she joint owns with Lex. Unfortunately, that tough side is not seen in the first season. According to Kreuk, the character was never placed in situations where she could show her outgoing side, because she was left to communicate primarily with Whitney and Clark.

The {{decision was made to}} give Romanoff her own comic ahead of The Avengers because Marvel felt that she [...] "remains the most enigmatic of the Avengers" [...] despite appearing in previous films. Van Lente explained the relationship between Black Widow Strikes and the films by saying, [...] "This is on the same scale as the Marvel movies. We’re working closely with Marvel Studios to have it integrate seamlessly with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once this is over, they’re welcome to use any of my ideas here for a movie."

2500|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of Orthodox congregations, only men are called to the Torah, in keeping with a passage in the Talmud that, while women could potentially be called, [...] "we do not call a woman on account of Kevod Hatzibur” (the dignity of the congregation; Megillah 23a). This term is interpreted by traditional sources to mean that for a woman to read from the Torah it would slight the community because it would appear to others that the men in the community were not well educated <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> from the Torah because it was assumed that a community would not have a woman read from the Torah if there were men who could do so. Recent apologists have suggested that Kevod Hatzibur refers to the honor of the community for the Torah being read, i.e. that their attention should be focused solely on the reading. And, as men are unable to fully concentrate on the reading when it is being read by women, Kevod Hatzibur (for the Torah) is damaged when a woman leads. This clashes with the Rema, an authoritative source for Ashkenazi Jewish practice, who discusses this source (282:3) remarking that this ruling regarding women applies to male non-Jewish slaves as well. The Rema, in the same location, further distinguishes between honor to the community (Kevod HaTzibur) and honor to the Torah (Kevod HaTorah) on the prohibition of giving an aliyah to a rich respected unlearned man before a learned Torah scholar.|$|E

Cranston has said that Edwards' approach to the film and to its characterization is what drew him to the project. He stated, [...] "The {{most important thing about}} this version of Godzilla is the characterization. The characters in this are real, well drawn. [...] takes the time to really establish who these people are, that you root for them, that you invest in these characters, and that you care for them. That's the best part of it." [...] Cranston additionally added, [...] "I wouldn't be here if it was just, 'Look out, this monster is crushing everything!' Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the script and join the film.
