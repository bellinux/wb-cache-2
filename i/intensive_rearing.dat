40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Despite the widespread belief that leading retailers in the UK enjoy {{some sort of}} monopoly power over suppliers of food, the retailers themselves retort that in reality they have been the saviours of British farmers. The study aims to analyse the origins and developments of what are undoubtedly close commercial relations. Using archival evidence and interviews, the study focuses on the introduction of <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> technologies in British white meat farming after 1945, and, comparing with developments in the US and Australia, examines why food retailers intervened in the industry's organisation during its experimental phase, but then stopped short of acquiring ownership interests in the leading producers of intensively reared chicken and pork. Despite enormous controversy, <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> has {{had a profound impact}} on meat production and retailing. From negligible beginnings in the early 1950 s, poultry and pork meat rose to one third of all meat consumed in Britain by 1990. This will be the first project systematically to study the historical emergence of <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> technologies and their impact on the structure of the British agricultural sector and retailing. It therefore provides much needed historical context to the current concerns about retailer market power...|$|E

50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, Glamorgan was almost entirely agriculture based. With the industrialisation of the county, farming became of far less importance, with industrial areas encroaching into farming lands. In Glamorgan, from the late 19th century, there was a significant reduction away from arable land towards pasture land. There were two main factors behind this trend; firstly the increase in the population of the county required more milk and other dairy produce, in an age before refrigeration. Secondly there was an employment shortage in farming due to the call of better paid industrial work, and pastoral land was less work <b>intensive.</b> Stock <b>rearing</b> became prominent with breeds such as Hereford, Devon and Shorthorn cattle being bred in the Vale of Glamorgan, while the unenclosed wilds of the Gower saw Welsh Ponies bred on the commons.|$|R

40|$|In 1950 poultry {{was a rare}} luxury in Britain, {{only one}} per cent of the total meat {{consumption}}. But over the next thirty years chicken consumption grew at the remarkable (compound) rate of 10 per cent per annum, while the overall consumption of meat remained stagnant from the 1950 s to the 1980 s. By then poultry had become {{the single most important}} source of meat, with a quarter of the total share of the market, replacing former favourites like beef, mutton and bacon in the British diet. This transformation was made possible by the emergence of <b>intensive</b> <b>rearing</b> in poultry farming. This was a dramatic change in production, dependent on technological innovations across several otherwise unrelated sectors: in pharmaceuticals and feedstuffs production, in refrigeration, slaughtering and packaging. The widespread distribution of cheap chicken led to its mass adoption throughout the country. But such a transformation in meat eating habits was not without its controversies.
