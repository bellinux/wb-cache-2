5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations <b>Flight</b> <b>Crew</b> <b>Licensing</b> (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

The included Essential Requirements extended the competencies of EASA inter alia to Pilot Licensing and Flight Operations. The future aeromedical requirements will be included as Annex II in another Implementing Regulation on Personnel Licensing. The detailed provisions will be published as guidance material.

40|$|Abstract. When a <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> has {{situation}} awareness {{they have a}} complete and accurate understanding of the physical, temporal and emotional environments {{in which they are}} situated. This allows the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> to interpret and evaluate elements or events in the environment in which they are situated and determine the risks associated with these events and an appropriate strategy to minimize and manage these risks. This paper describes the architecture for an intelligent software agent which assesses a <b>flight</b> <b>crew’s</b> {{situation awareness}} through the observation of a pilot’s eye movements. The agent perceives pilot behavior using a proprietary eye tracking device. This behavior is compared to a behavior database to decide whether the behavior of the pilot is appropriate or inappropriate in terms of the safety of the <b>flight.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> is alerted if the behavior is judged to be consistent with the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> losing situation awareness...|$|R

5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> mismanagement of the airplane's descent during the visual approach, the pilot flying's unintended deactivation of automatic airspeed control, the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> inadequate monitoring of airspeed, and the <b>flight</b> <b>crew's</b> delayed execution of a go-around after they became aware that the airplane was below acceptable glidepath and airspeed tolerances.
