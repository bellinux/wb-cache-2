5|$|Brooding {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of <b>high</b> <b>current</b> or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as <b>high</b> <b>current</b> (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively <b>high</b> <b>current,</b> a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E

The electrochemical characterizations show the superior performances of GP 46 at <b>higher</b> <b>current</b> densities. For example, the specific capacitance of GP 46 at 1 A g− 1 was {{as high as}} 436  F g− 1 and obtained good cycle stability for 500  cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of GP 46 at <b>higher</b> <b>current</b> density was attributed to the good synergistic effect of the PANI nanowires and graphene sheets.|$|R
5000|$|Within each size group, certain [...] "lugs" [...] on {{the outside}} of the plugs of <b>higher</b> <b>current</b> rating prevent a plug rated for a <b>higher</b> <b>current</b> being {{installed}} into a socket outlet rated for a lower current. However, a plug rated for a lower current can be installed into a socket outlet of the same size group rated for a <b>higher</b> <b>current.</b> For example, a 32-A 4-pin plug without neutral can plug into a 50-A 5-pin socket with neutral available. However a 10-A 5-pin plug cannot fit a 32-A 5-pin socket, as the plugs are different diameters.|$|R
5|$|The iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a <b>high</b> <b>current</b> of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E

5|$|This iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery that {{can hold a}} charge of 11,560mAh. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology (40%). The iPad {{is designed to be}} charged with a relatively <b>high</b> <b>current</b> of 2amps using the included 12W USB power adapter and Lightning connector.

High-power USB ports found in newer computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities. Apple claims that the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, audio playback, or web surfing on Wi-Fi, 9hours of web surfing over a cellular connection, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee. During the battery replacement process, user data is not preserved/transferred, and repaired or refurbished units come with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
