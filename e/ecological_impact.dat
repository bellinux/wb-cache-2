This article has largely relied on field survey for vegetation analysis, wildlife survey, structured questionnaire for economic survey and secondary data collected from different government departments. It {{is interesting to note}} that number of camping and rafting agencies have increased from 27 in 2004 to 105 in 2008 - 09 and number of tourist have also increased from 17063 in 2004 to 76368 in 2009 - 10. Findings indicate some negative <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> of river rafting and camping and the positive impact on local economy. Negative <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> include damage to nearby forests and disturbance to wildlife, while improvements in local economy has come through income generation and employment opportunities to local people Key words: River rafting Camping <b>Ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> Econom...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFood {{and drink}} {{consumption}} {{was found to}} be responsible for around 20 – 30 % of environmental impacts. Environmental impacts occur during all stages of the food production chain. However, households influence these impacts with through their choice of diet and habits, thus directly affecting the environment through food-related energy consumption and waste generation. With the multiplication of local policies for sustainable consumption, it has become increasingly useful to gather information on the evolution of the <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> associated with household food consumption. Dealing with the indicators of household consumption of fruits and vegetables will enable changes in the population’s lifestyles and the effectiveness of local policies to be monitored. The aims of this article are twofold: to provide a conceptual framework on the purposes of ecological indicators of fruit and vegetable consumption (EIFVCs) and to provide a methodological approach for selecting and measuring the most relevant EIFVCs at a local scale. Considering the great diversity of <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts,</b> the large number of potential EIFVCs must be reduced to obtain fewer EIFVCs, butthat are relevant at local scale. To be relevant, the EIFVCs must provide information on the three phases of consumption (acquisition, use, and disposal) and on the upstream and downstream phases of the consumption process; they should evaluate the more problematic <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> at the local scale (level of concern); and they have to only point out the <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> that households can significantly reduce through their consumption rates. To measure relevant EIFVCs, three approaches must be combined: monitoring the <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts,</b> measuring the material and energy fluxes associated with household consumption, and analysing the consumer behaviours that result in the observed <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts.</b> As an illustration, the methodology is applied to the Bordeaux Metropolitan Area (France). In this area, eleven EIFVCs seem relevant. The use of surveys characterises all eleven of the EIFVCs, despite the difficulty of establishing quantified relationships between household behaviours and measured <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts.</b> The measuring of fluxes is possible for eight of them, whereas the monitoring of ecologicalimpacts is only feasible for two of them...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated {{contamination}} of habitats with debris has caused increased effort to determine <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts.</b> Strikingly, most work on organisms focuses on sublethal responses to plastic debris. This is controversial because (i) researchers have ignored medical insights about the mechanisms that link effects of debris across {{lower levels of}} biological organization to disease and mortality, and (ii) debris is considered non-hazardous by policy-makers, possibly because individuals can be injured or removed from populations and assemblages without <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts.</b> We reviewed the mechanisms that link effects of debris across lower levels of biological organization to assemblages and populations. Using plastic, we show microplastics reduce the ‘health’, feeding, growth and survival of ecosystem engineers. Larger debris alters assemblages because fishing-gear and tyres kill animals and damage habitat-forming plants, and because floating bottles facilitate recruitment and survival of novel taxa. Where ecological linkages are not known, we show how to establish hypothetical links by synthesizing studies to assess the likelihood of impacts. We also consider how population models examine ecological linkages and guide management of <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts.</b> We show that by focusing on linkages to <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> rather than the presence of debris and its sublethal impacts, we could reduce threats posed by debris...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic debris {{contaminates}} marine habitats globally, {{leading to}} several perceived <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts.</b> Here, we critically and systematically review the literature regarding impacts of debris from several scientific fields {{to understand the}} weight of evidence regarding the <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> of marine debris. We quantified perceived and demonstrated impacts across several levels of biological organization {{that make up the}} ecosystem and found 366 perceived threats of debris across all levels. Two hundred and ninety-six of these perceived threats were tested, 83 % of which were demonstrated. The majority (82 %) of demonstrated impacts were due to plastic, relative to other materials (e. g., metals, glass) and largely (89 %) at suborganismal levels (e. g., molecular, cellular, tissue). The remaining impacts, demonstrated at higher levels of organization (i. e., death to individual organisms, changes in assemblages), were largely due to plastic marine debris (> 1 mm; e. g., rope, straws, and fragments). Thus, we show evidence of <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> from marine debris, but conclude that {{the quantity and quality of}} research requires improvement to allow the risk of <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> of marine debris to be determined with precision. Still, our systematic review suggests that sufficient evidence exists for decision makers to begin to mitigate problematic plastic debris now, to avoid risk of irreversible harm. </p...|$|R
25|$|There are {{concerns}} about the <b>ecological</b> <b>impact</b> of introducing the wels catfish to non-native regions. These concerns {{take into account the}} situation in Lake Victoria in Africa, where Nile perch were introduced and rapidly caused the extinction of numerous indigenous species. This severely impacted the entire lake, destroying much of the original ecosystem. The introduction of foreign species is almost always a burden on the affected ecosystem. Following the introduction of wels catfish, some fishes' numbers are in clear and rapid decline. Since its introduction in the Mequinenza Reservoir in 1974, it has spread {{to other parts of the}} Ebro basin, including its tributaries, especially the Segre River. Some endemic species of Iberian barbels, genus Barbus in the Cyprinidae, were once abundant especially in the Ebro river but due to competition from and predation by wels catfish have since disappeared in the middle channel Ebro. The ecology of the river has also changed, as there is now a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae. Barbel species from mountain stream tributaries of the Ebro that wels catfish have not colonized are not affected.|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} input-output approach {{reveals the}} channels {{through which the}} environmental burdens of production activities are transmitted throughout the economy. This paper uses the input-output framework and analyses the changes in Spanish emission multipliers during the period 1995 - 2000. By decomposing the global changes in multipliers into different components, {{it is possible to}} evaluate separately the economic and <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> captured by the environmental input-output model. Specifically, in this study we distinguish between the effects on multipliers caused by changes in emission coefficients (the <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts)</b> and the effects on multipliers caused by changes in technical coefficients (the economic impacts). Our results show a significant improvement in the <b>ecological</b> <b>impacts</b> of production activities, which contributed negatively to changes in emission multipliers. They also show a deterioration in the economic impacts, which contributed positively to changes in emission multipliers. Together, these two effects lead to a small reduction in global multipliers during the period of analysis. Our results also show significant differences in the individual behaviour of different sectors in terms of their contribution to multiplier changes. Since there are considerable differences in the way individual sectors affect the changes in emission levels, and in the intensity of these effects, this means that the final effects will basically depend on the activity considered.
