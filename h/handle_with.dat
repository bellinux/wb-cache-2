5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{multiple}} handle arrangements is {{depending on the}} bit, control is easier with different configurations. For example, when shaping {{the edge of a}} fine table top, many users prefer a D <b>handle,</b> <b>with</b> variable speed, as it seems to permit better control and burning the wood can be minimized.|$|E

The free arm is used to pull line from the reel or to retrieve line from the water. If a fish strikes, the angler can pinch the line with the index finger against the rod handle and lift the rod tip, setting the hook.|$|E

25|$|The G36 is a selective-fire 5.56 mm assault rifle, firing from {{a closed}} rotary bolt. The G36 has a {{conventional}} layout and a modular component design. Common to all variants of the G36 family are: {{the receiver and}} buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group with bolt and the return mechanism and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, handguard and magazine socket.|$|E
25|$|Some pubs {{disguise}} keg beer {{by having}} an imitation pump {{handle on the}} bar. If the bar staff have merely turned on a tap, or are just resting their hand on a very small <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> no pump action, then this is a keg beer. Exceptions are some pubs (in the north and occasionally elsewhere) which use electric pumps or the pubs in Scotland that use traditional air-pressure founts on cask ale.|$|E
25|$|Peat {{is still}} cut as a fuel {{in many areas}} of Lewis. Peat is usually cut in late spring with a tool called a tairsgeir (that is, a peat iron, peat spade, peat knife or tosg; {{sometimes}} toirsgian) which has a long wooden <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> an angled blade on one end. The peat bank is first cleared of heather turfs. The peat, now exposed, is cut using the tairsgeir and the peats thrown out on the bank to dry. A good peat cutter can cut 1000 peats in a day.|$|E

25|$|The {{first patent}} for a {{toothbrush}} was granted to H.N. Wadsworth in 1857 (U.S.A. Patent No. 18,653) in the United States, but mass {{production in the}} United States did not start until 1885. The improved design had a bone <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> holes bored into it for the Siberian boar hair bristles. Unfortunately, animal bristle was not an ideal material as it retained bacteria, did not desiccate efficiently and the bristles were often extricated from their intended fixed insertions. In addition to bone, handles were made of wood or ivory. In the United States, brushing teeth did not become routine until after World War II, when American soldiers had to clean their teeth daily.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking some}} time off {{following}} her husband John's death, Florance returned to television with a small role as Esme in an episode of Winners (1985). Next came roles in two Paul Cox productions; Margaret's mother in <b>Handle</b> <b>With</b> Care (1985), and Martha in Cactus (1986). This was followed by two parts playing grandmothers; Roger Scholes' thriller The Tale of Ruby Rose (1987) featuring Melita Jurisic, Chris Haywood, Rod Zuanic and Martyn Sanderson; and Luigi Acquisto drama Hungry Heart (1987). Florance also took part in Kick Start (1987), a short comedy (34 min) with Tim Scally and directed by Charles Sandford. It won the Best Fiction (Greater Union) and Rouben Mamoulian Awards at the 1987 Sydney Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Tesla's patents {{state that}} the device was {{intended}} {{for the use of}} fluids as motive agents, as distinguished from the application of the same for the propulsion or compression of fluids (though the device can be used for those purposes as well). As of 2016, the Tesla turbine has not seen widespread commercial use since its invention. The Tesla pump, however, has been commercially available since 1982 and is used to pump fluids that are abrasive, viscous, shear sensitive, contain solids, or are otherwise difficult to <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> other pumps. Tesla himself did not procure a large contract for production. The main drawback in his time, as mentioned, was the poor knowledge of materials characteristics and behaviors at high temperatures. The best metallurgy of the day could not prevent the turbine disks from moving and warping unacceptably during operation.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} a Double Dog Collar match between The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) and Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge). Rock was {{connected}} to Sags, and Grunge {{was connected to}} Knobs. All four fought to the outside, and used several weapons on each other. Grunge performed a bulldog on Knobs on a steel chair. Rock performed a somersault legdrop on Sags and performed an axe handle to him through a table. All four eventually return to the ring, where The Public Enemy had the advantage. Rock went to the top turnbuckle, but Sags pulled the chain, and Rock fell onto the table. Knobs repeatedly attacked Grunge with the chain. Sags then hit an axe <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> the chain on Rock, who was on a table. Knobs hanged Grunge with the chain over the top rope as The Nasty Boys delivered a clothesline to Rock with the chain. Sags hit Rock with the chain, and pinned him for The Nasty Boys to win.|$|E
25|$|After the {{fireworks}} of the First Test the MCC team drove to Toowoomba with their reputation much enhanced by their performance and were welcomed as heroes. Rugby League was strong in Queensland's largest inland {{town and the}} genial John Bapty, who covered both rugby and cricket in the Yorkshire Evening Post, gave a speech of thanks after a dinner was given for the Lancastrians and Yorkshiremen in the team. The MCC belted 428/6 off 54.5 overs against light-hearted bowling with David Sheppard (72), Reg Simpson (98), Gilbert Parkhouse (57), acting captain Denis Compton (92) and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans (94) helping themselves, but Brian Close going for a duck. Compton declared {{in the afternoon and}} the Queensland Country XI were 88/3 by stumps and 220 all out the next day with captain Tom Allen hitting 2 sixes and 10 fours in his top-scoring 83 as Doug Wright (5/52) and Eric Hollies (3/33) served up old-fashioned leg-spin. Rather that enforce the follow on and going for a win Compton good-naturedly put on another batting display and the MCC hit 297/7 off the remaining 37 overs of the day. Sheppard made 42, Parkhouse 58 and even the stonewaller Trevor Bailey gave the bowling the long <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> 68 not out, but Close bagged a pair.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions, Lawrence Rubin {{states that}} while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his {{negative}} emotions. He comments that Naruto has a [...] attitude {{when dealing with}} intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more he puts his comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children {{growing up in the}} real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for acceptance, and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful shinobi, and a [...] "complete and mature person". Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development {{is similar to that of}} a modern American hero, the type who accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.|$|E
500|$|Standing 173cm (5ft 8in) and {{weighing}} , Craig was a lightly built and frail looking batsman. He had a neat and compact batting style. Craig {{was known for}} his leg side batting repertoire, in particular his ability to clip the ball from his pads. He had an unorthodox grip, low on the bat <b>handle</b> <b>with</b> the back of the top hand pointing to point. This caused him to have a tendency to close the face of his bat. Although Craig was small in stature, he was still able to hit the ball a long distance. During the testimonial match for Lindsay Hassett {{at the end of the}} 1953â€“54 season, Craig struck four sixes in five balls from the off spin of Johnson. During his first tour to England, Craig had difficulty with off cutters bowled by pacemen and eschwed the hook shot, but after his comeback from illness, he transformed himself into an opening batsman, earning praise for his performances against the express pace of Wes Hall and Ian Meckiff. Benaud felt that Craig was finally reaping the rewards of his early experience. On Australian pitches, Craig had a reputation for having difficulty with the left arm wrist spin of Kline and David Sincock. Craig's light build allowed him to move quickly while fielding, prompting Robinson to call him [...] "the Bambi of the fielding side." [...] In his early years, Craig was a non-smoker, but the pressure and tension brought on by the burden of captaincy resulted in him taking up the habit. He was known for being softly spoken, with his players often having to ask him to repeat his instructions. Craig had a reputation for being good-natured; he did not complain about his cricket career and said that he had [...] "no regrets." ...|$|E
