[...] The band was generally more worried about Kiedis's addiction, which was much more open and noticeable to the other members, while Slovak according to Kiedis was [...] "much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise." [...] During the tour in support of Freaky Styley, Slovak's health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate. [...] Kiedis commented on the situation: [...] "I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force {{that allows you to}} at least <b>defend</b> <b>yourself.</b> [...] It was a sad moment." [...] A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovak's health contacted his brother, James, who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{resolved}} {{that war}} was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position {{to that of}} a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. [...] "Would you be such a coward as not to <b>defend</b> <b>yourself</b> with your pocketknife?" [...] he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift pre-emptive strike. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy Conyngham Greene an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899. The start of the Second Boer War was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time.|$|E
500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr. When Gooden came to bat {{in the fifth}} inning, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball. Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money well spent. Sometimes you just have to <b>defend</b> <b>yourself</b> and your teammates." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people {{would want to do}} in order to survive. We explored different ideas, and one of them was fashioning weapons to <b>defend</b> <b>yourself.</b> That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E

Accordingly, Penyafort put <b>defending</b> <b>yourself</b> and offensive actions in juxtaposition, as defense concerned the immediate future and the present, and offense {{was an act of}} vengeance for actions which had already been committed.|$|R

50|$|The {{required}} {{balance of}} fear and efficacy levels {{has been the subject}} of much research, with some finding that moderate to high levels of fear are unnecessary in changing intentions. In fact, they argue, what is important is the ratio of these to each other. Gore and Bracken (2005)found that even with low levels of threat, they were able to take individuals who had started to exhibit defensive fear control reactions to move toward danger control (intention change) reactions. Another way of <b>defending</b> <b>yourself</b> against fear appeals is prior knowledge, according to one study, individuals are less likely to be influenced by a fear appeal if they have prior knowledge.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} of technology throughout the world, {{there has also}} been an equally rapid increases in its abuse. Currently, security professional made some attempts to learn about attacker, however these attempts were limited in effort and scope. They emphasis on the targeted vulnerability and how the exploit took advantage of that vulnerability. However, very little attention was focused on the attackers themselves. IT is necessary to study the black-hat communityâ€™s tools, tactics, and motive and then sharing any lessons learned. The more you know about your enemies, the better chance you have of <b>defending</b> <b>yourself</b> against them and defeating them. A honeynet is a network set up with intentional vulnerabilities; its purpose is to invite attack, so that an attackerâ€™s activities and methods can be studied and that information used to increase network security. This paper will collect and analyse the attackers activity, through the honeynet network and normal secured system and it will identify if there is new attackers activities, that are not detected by the current security tool are detected...|$|R

I suggest, therefore, that you consult with Admiral Porter freely, and get from him the part to be performed by each branch of the public service, so {{that there may be}} unity of action. It would be well to have the whole programme laid down in writing. I have served with Admiral Porter, and know that you can rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes. I would, therefore, defer to him as much as is consistent with your own responsibilities.
