2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him. The {{librettist}} Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: [...] "Farinelli has surprised me so much that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had hitherto heard {{only a small part}} of the human voice, and now have heard it all. He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...." [...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!" [...] and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth's [...] "A Rake's Progress" [...] (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series [...] "Marriage à la mode" [...] of 1745).|$|E
2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hide that!" [...] he whispered, [...] "hide that, lest {{it should}} bewitch me. Indeed, already <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were being bewitched. It is the Great Medicine itself." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. But I've {{heard so}} much about you from Harry that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we were old friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a blessed}} soul," [...] {{he heard her}} mutter, [...] "and yet <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> that devil Billy was {{creeping}} about after me. Ugh! {{it must be the}} horrors. I can see the look he gave me now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Parker, {{being an}} amateur botanist, {{was filled with}} delight of the {{thickening}} flowers. [...] "It is exactly {{as if we had}} begun in August and were moving backward towards spring. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> violets were near. It is positively enchanting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O gin I {{could see}} a {{mountain}} top again, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could lay me down and die content. What garred ye come daundering to these weary flats of France?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man will}} tell you what has happened. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was [...] mad. I do not know who to send to. Will you come to me, only for [...] a few minutes? ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{the clear}} dark holds up unblemished. The only warning is the {{electric}} skin-tension (<b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were a lace-maker's pillow) and an irritability which the gibbering of the General Communicator increases almost to hysteria.|$|E
6000|$|... "But (here again <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> preaching in the wilderness) {{it never}} occurs {{to you that}} there may exist some small {{difference}} between the wholly animal--ah--rumination of bovine minds and the discerning, well- apportioned leisure of the finer type of intellect?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{does not}} Ayesha come?" [...] asked Leo at length, pausing in his {{walk up and}} down the room. [...] "I want to see her again; I cannot bear to be apart from her. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were drawing me to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{have written}} to no one. I cannot write. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{if it were}} to bring him back again I could not write of it. My boy! my boy! my boy!" [...] But still there was not a tear in her eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "I like it very much; {{it is so}} restful, and I sleep sound {{upon that}} cartel. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should like to trek on {{for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can’t {{tell you}} any more," [...] ses Miss Gill, [...] "and I wouldn’t ’ave {{told you that}} only you asked me, and somehow <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> ’ave to tell you things, when you want me to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frank, I wrote you {{a letter}} and {{described}} it all. How I got {{the courage to do}} it I do not know. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could not bring myself to say it now. I wonder whether you would have the courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{believe the}} play {{will be a}} success. I have had a curious sense with me all day that {{something}} pleasant is going to happen. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> fortune had taken me by the hand. What does it mean, I wonder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in with me," [...] she begged. [...] "Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{cold and}} lonely to-night. It hasn't {{anything}} to do with what we were talking about, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> something were going to happen, that something were coming out of the shadows, something that threatens either you or me. I'm silly, but come." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{suppose the}} main {{difference}} between the two is that the first one was mostly focused on my voice, and there was more production in this one. They’re both very down-tempo, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the second one has a bit more of a kick to it. It was really an evolving process.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a life work," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Holt, proudly, [...] "and yet <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had not yet begun. Come, I will show you the peonies--they are at their best--before I go in and make myself respectable for breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur Boiset," [...] he said, {{when they}} reached the street, [...] "something has {{happened}} to me. I am quite changed. Not for all the world would I go near Madame Riennes again. Indeed, now <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wished to run away from her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nothing;--very little, that is. But Bella {{has spoken}} to me. Oh, mamma, I think {{we have been very}} wrong in this. That is, I have been wrong. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should disgrace myself, and turn the whole party here into a misfortune." ...|$|E
5000|$|Teen Vogue's Gloria Baume added," [...] It's {{a moment}} in time. It's like everytime I walk {{into one of the}} shows, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there's nothing quite like it. It's so {{pristine}} and so beautiful and those dresses, they were so amazing. All {{you want to do is}} wear them... It was just magnificent!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LYDIA. True. It is horrible. Said I [...] "Some wet"? [...] I meant, some drink. Why did I say [...] "Some wet"? [...] Am I ensorceled too? [...] "Some wet"! Fie! fie! [...] <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> some hateful {{thing had}} stained me. [...] Oh, Lucian, how could I have said [...] "Some wet"? ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were walking}} westward at the moment, past the golf-course, {{and a sense}} of uneasiness filled the girl's heart. She looked up at him with a grave face. [...] "I don't know why, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> an impulse to hurry. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we ought to get home as quickly as possible. They may be worried about us." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{now said}} Verona: [...] "Father! I {{was talking to}} a classmate of mine that's working for the Associated Charities--oh, Dad, there's the sweetest little babies that come to the milk-station there!--and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> ought to be doing {{something}} worth while like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not. This sort of {{life will}} not suit me at all. I {{do not trust}} my aunt. I am weary of strangers. Let us give it all up. Take me back to London with you. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were going into prison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] {{answered}} the Count. [...] "I pray you, forget my words. Name of God! what an accursed and ill-omened spot is this. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were standing {{by my own}} grave--it came upon me suddenly." [...] And he shivered and turned pale.|$|E
5000|$|Jim Halterman from TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 3.5/5 saying: [...] "While tonight’s episode wasn’t perfect {{by any means}} - and there was {{obviously}} plenty {{for me to be}} snarky about - I did enjoy it more than past outings mostly because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we’re finally heading somewhere and it could be really fun." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pope {{was quoted}} in 2001 as saying, [...] "Every time I pick that horn up there's always {{something}} that I discover I can do differently if I really seek. If you were on planet Earth for, like, 2 billion years, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there's always something new {{that you can find}} to do. There's no end." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I {{thought that}} no one in the world was more normal than I. I'm ashamed of myself. You're almost a {{stranger}} to me and by God, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the marrow of my bones were melting. I hear the East a-calling. I have such a pain in my heart. Oh, my pretty, my precious, I love you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. That's the odd part of it, for <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} you {{for years and}} years and knew {{everything}} about you that one human being can know of another. Of course, too, I do know a good lot of your life through George and Harût." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I am a baby," [...] she exclaimed, laughing, [...] "but to-night <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were {{beginning}} a new life! Tell me, mademoiselle, have you {{a place for}} me as a seamstress? Or will you have me for a model? My figure is good enough, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But what a prince! What a pasha!" [...] Felixstowe {{declared}} enthusiastically. [...] "He decked me out at Tiffany's till I {{feel like}} a walking jeweller's shop in the evening.

6000|$|... "Do {{these words}} and vows and ceremonies make any {{difference}} to you?" [...] she whispered as they walked side by side down the church, the observed of all observers. [...] "They do not to me. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> all the rites in the world would be quite powerless and without meaning in face of the fact of our eternal unity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderfully! She has {{amazed me}} by her {{strength}}. It frightens me; for I {{know that a}} relapse must come. She has never sunk for a moment beneath it. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were her strength that enables me to bear my share of it." [...] And then she described to the squire all {{that had taken place}} that morning.|$|R
