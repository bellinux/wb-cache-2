5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the <b>genitourinary</b> tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, <b>genitourinary</b> system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E

25|$|DMSO {{has been}} {{examined}} {{for the treatment}} of numerous conditions and ailments, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use only for the symptomatic relief of patients with interstitial cystitis. A 1978 study concluded that DMSO brought significant relief to the majority of the 213patients with inflammatory <b>genitourinary</b> disorders that were studied. The authors recommended DMSO for <b>genitourinary</b> inflammatory conditions not caused by infection or tumor in which symptoms were severe or patients failed to respond to conventional therapy.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} is an RF-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked arthritis often {{precipitated by}} <b>genitourinary</b> or gastrointestinal infections. The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (with Chlamydia trachomatis).|$|E
25|$|Steroids may be {{of benefit}} in peritonitis, miliary disease, {{tubercular}} osteomyelitis, TB osteomyelitis, laryngeal TB, lymphadenitis and <b>genitourinary</b> disease, but the evidence is scant and the routine use of steroids cannot be recommended.

25|$|Estradiol (a type of estrogen) isin {{the case}} of {{naturally}} menopausal womenonly recommended for use for the shortest {{period of time and}} at the lowest effective dose due to its adverse-effects profile. There is the potential for a range of adverse effects in breasts, skin, eyes, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, <b>genitourinary</b> or central nervous systems. These risks, however, are very low.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones {{are often}} used for <b>genitourinary</b> infections and are widely used in the {{treatment}} of hospital-acquired infections associated with urinary catheters. In community-acquired infections, they are recommended only when risk factors for multidrug resistance are present or after other antibiotic regimens have failed. However, for serious acute cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis where the patient may need to be hospitalised, fluoroquinolones are recommended as first-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, the American Heart Association {{no longer}} {{recommends}} antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis before certain procedures {{in patients with}} aortic insufficiency. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis before gastrointestinal or <b>genitourinary</b> procedures is no longer recommended for any patient with valvular disease. Cardiac stress test is useful in identifying individuals that may be best suited for surgical intervention. Radionuclide angiography is recommended and useful when the systolic wall stress is calculated and combined to the results.|$|E
25|$|Up to 10% {{of women}} with ectopic {{pregnancy}} have no symptoms, and one-third have no medical signs. In many cases the symptoms have low specificity, and can be {{similar to those of}} other <b>genitourinary</b> and gastrointestinal disorders, such as appendicitis, salpingitis, rupture of a corpus luteum cyst, miscarriage, ovarian torsion or urinary tract infection. Clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy occurs at a mean of 7.2 weeks after the last normal menstrual period, with a range of 4 to 8 weeks. Later presentations are more common in communities deprived of modern diagnostic ability.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the {{proposed}} {{mechanism by which}} cocaine harmed fetuses was as a stimulant—it was predicted that cocaine would disrupt normal development of {{parts of the brain}} that dealt with stimulation, resulting in problems like bipolar disorder and attention deficit disorder. Reports from the mid-1980s to early 90s raised concerns about links between PCE and slowed growth, deformed limbs, defects of the kidneys and <b>genitourinary</b> and gastrointestinal systems, neurological damage, small head size, atrophy or cysts in the cerebral cortex, bleeding into the brain's ventricles, and obstruction of blood supply in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{urethral}} valve (PUV) {{disorder is}} an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and <b>genitourinary</b> system of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra {{as a result}} of abnormal in utero development. It is {{the most common cause of}} bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases followed conservatively. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring. It occurs in about one in 8000 babies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism by}} which cocaine harms the fetus may be in part by interfering with blood supply to the uterus. Cocaine causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in both mother and fetus, which can cause hypoxia in the fetus. Constricting blood vessels causes tissues to receive insufficient blood flow, killing cells, but this effect is less pronounced with cocaine than with nicotine. The reduction in {{blood flow to the}} uterus limits the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Cocaine also constricts the blood vessels in the fetus, which is potentially linked to slowed fetal growth and abnormal development of the <b>genitourinary,</b> cardiovascular, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} often {{attributed to}} fibromyalgia {{that may be}} due to a comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, <b>genitourinary</b> symptoms and interstitial cystitis, dermatological disorders, headaches, myoclonic twitches, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Although fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 20–30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|The city's newest hospital, St. David's Hospital (built {{behind the}} former building) {{is located in}} the Canton area and {{provides}} services for the elderly and children. Cardiff Royal Infirmary is located on Newport Road, near the city centre. The majority of this hospital was closed in 1999 but with the West Wing remaining open for clinic services, <b>genitourinary</b> medicine and rehabilitation treatment. Rookwood Hospital and Whitchurch Hospital are also located within the city, along with Rookwood Hospital and Velindre Cancer Centre. All hospitals in Cardiff are administered by the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, {{with the exception of the}} Velindre site which is run by a separate trust. In addition Spire Healthcare has a private hospital in the city which is located in Pentwyn.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort {{in association with}} frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits. Symptoms usually are experienced as acute attacks that subside within one day, but recurrent attacks are likely. There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (tenesmus), bloating, or abdominal distension. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the <b>genitourinary</b> system, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. About a third {{of men and women}} who have IBS also report sexual dysfunction typically in the form of a reduction in libido.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} types of {{distributive}} shock. The most common, septic shock, is caused by an infection, most frequently by bacteria, but viruses, fungi and parasites have been implicated. Infection sites most {{likely to lead to}} septic shock are chest, abdomen and <b>genitourinary</b> tract. In septic shock the blood flow in the microvasculature is abnormal with some capillaries underperfused and others with normal to high blood flow. The endothelial cells lining the blood vessels become less responsive to vasocontrictive agents, lose their glycocalyx (normal coating) and negative ionic charge, become leaky and cause extensive over-expression of nitric oxide. The coagulation cascade is also disrupted. Tissue factor that initiates the clotting cascade is produced by activated monocytes and the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels while antithrombin and fibrinolysis are impaired. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) can result from the thrombin produced in the inflammatory response. The ability of red blood cells to change shape decreases and their tendency to clump together increases, inhibiting their flow through the microvasculature.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the <b>genitourinary</b> system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
500|$|In 15–20% {{of active}} cases, the {{infection}} spreads outside the lungs, causing {{other kinds of}} TB. These are collectively denoted as [...] "extrapulmonary tuberculosis". Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed persons and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases. Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), {{the central nervous system}} (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the <b>genitourinary</b> system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others.|$|E
500|$|Altered (typically elevated) {{expression}} of NEDD9 is {{strongly associated with}} cancer.

500|$|Within the <b>genitourinary</b> and {{gastrointestinal}} tracts, commensal flora {{serve as}} biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria {{for food and}} space and, in some cases, by changing the conditions in their environment, such as pH or available iron. As {{a result of the}} symbiotic relationship between commensals and the immune system, the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness is reduced. However, since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi, oral antibiotics can lead to an [...] "overgrowth" [...] of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection). There is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora, such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt, helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb {{published a}} paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an orthopaedic surgeon, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided {{a wide range of}} alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were <b>genitourinary</b> medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, [...] "doc", [...] "law", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds {{were more likely to be}} radiologists than dermatologists. Two separate studies by Krajick and Neimi in 2005, both analysing large samples of names of scientists, showed 1.35% of geologists having names referring to their field, and in political science, 1.26%.|$|E

2500|$|IgA has two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) {{and can be}} {{produced}} as a monomeric {{as well as a}} dimeric form. The IgA dimeric form is the most prevalent and is also called secretory IgA (sIgA). [...] sIgA is the main immunoglobulin found in mucous secretions, including tears, saliva, sweat, colostrum and secretions from the <b>genitourinary</b> tract, gastrointestinal tract, prostate and respiratory epithelium. It is also found in small amounts in blood. The secretory component of sIgA protects the immunoglobulin from being degraded by proteolytic enzymes, thus sIgA can survive in the harsh gastrointestinal tract environment and provide protection against microbes that multiply in body secretions. sIgA can also inhibit inflammatory effects of other immunoglobulins. IgA is a poor activator of the complement system, and opsonises only weakly.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{prostate}} cancer is generally a multifocal disease, the traditional prostatectomy eliminates all local lesions {{by removing the}} entire prostate. However, it has been hypothesized that an [...] "index lesion" [...] might be responsible for disease progression. Therefore, focal therapy targeted towards the index lesion might effectively treat {{prostate cancer}} while preserving {{the remainder of the}} gland. Interventional radiologists have started to treat prostate cancer with minimally invasive therapies such as cryoablation, HIFU, radiofrequency ablation, and photodynamic therapy that permit focal therapy by utilizing image guidance. [...] These therapies are still in beginning or experimental stages; however, because they preserve tissue, they can potentially reduce adverse treatment outcomes such as impotence and incontinence. [...] A small prospective study published in European Urology in February 2015 assessed the focal treatment of index lesions with HIFU in patients with multifocal prostate cancer and found that the majority of men returned to baseline <b>genitourinary</b> function and 86% of men were free of clinically significant prostate cancer at one year. Small, nonrandomized cohort studies with a median range follow-up 17–47 months have shown that cryoablation, HIFU, and phototherapy are associated with low rates of adverse effects and early disease control rates of 83%-100% based on negative biopsies.|$|E
