40|$|Mudrock-dominated channel fills {{are common}} {{features}} of the fluvial Palaeogene Willwood Formation of Wyoming. These fills are small, on average 30 m wide and 3 m deep, and they vary from simple plugs to more lithologically complex fills with <b>internal</b> <b>scour</b> surfaces. Some fills preserve plant material, and others show pedogenic modification. All fills are located within metre-thick intervals of weakly pedogenically modified mudstones that surround ribbon sandstones. The intervals have previously been attributed to channel avulsion; the fine-grained channel fills are interpreted as crevasse-splay feeder channels within these avulsion deposits. Variation in fill type, particularly the presence of pedogenic features, appears {{to be related to}} floodplain drainage. Possible factors that influenced drainage were basin position of the fills and Palaeogene climate fluctuations, although the role of either is not unequivocal. In general, channel fills with sombre colours and preserved plant detritus, indicating poorly drained conditions, dominat...|$|E
40|$|Detailed sedimentological logging of core, and {{interpretation}} of wireline logs from the Brent Oil Field, northern North Sea, have allowed for the identification of sedimentary facies and environments of the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation. The Statfjord Formation is interpreted to have been deposited within a diversity of sedimentary environments. These include delta plain, meandering rivers, braided rivers, tidally influenced fluvial systems and a shallow, high energy transgressive marine environment. Within the fluvially-dominated part, which {{is by far the}} most important volumetrically, two distinct facies associations were recognized: channel and overbank. The channel facies association is in turn divided into three discrete end members: low sinuosity, high sinuosity and minor/crevasse channel facies. Similarly, the overbank facies association comprises a variety of sedimentary facies including levee, crevasse splay, swamp, flood plain and rare lacustrine and lacustrine deltas. Low sinuosity channel facies are divided on the basis of their architectural style, into three different types. Type 1 low sinuosity channel facies dominates the northern part of the study area and resembles the sandy Platte River model of Miall (1977). Type 2 low sinuosity channel facies dominates the southern part of the study area and is characterized by numerous <b>internal</b> <b>scour</b> surfaces. This channel type is interpreted to have been deposited within a relatively proximal braided river system. Type 3 low sinuosity charmel facies is a transitional facies between the proceeding two low sinuosity channel types and is similar in character to the South Saskatchewan and the Battery Point River models of Cant and Walker (1978). Documented point bar sediments within the high sinuosity channel facies association indicate that channel bankfull depths may have reached as much as 4. 5 m. The lack of evidence of exposure of the in-channel sediments in addition to the thick, consistent bedforms suggest that the rivers were probably of a perennial nature. Palaeoflow indicators obtained form HDT log analysis reveal that the Statfjord Formation m the Brent Field has been deposited by a north to northwest flowing drainage systems. Thorium/potassium cross-plots from NGS logs indicate an upward reduction in sandstone mineralogical maturity which may imply an upward reduction in the degree of reworking of sediments and a least sediment transport. The overall spatial and temporal consistency of the palaeocurrent indicators coupled with the upward decrease of sandstone maturity further indicate that no flow reversal occurred throughout the geological evolution of the Statfjord Formation. Sequence stratigraphic concepts applied in conjunction with detailed facies analysis indicate that sedimentary facies of the Statfjord Formation are arranged within two successive depositional sequences. Although the sequences are incomplete they possess all the attributes of the depositional sequences described by Posamentier and Vail (1988) and Van Wagoner et al. (1990). The lower sequence comprises sediments deposited within a highstand systems tract. The lowermost part is characterised by low net/gross ratio and is interpreted to have been deposited within early highstand systems tract most likely in an upper delta plain setting. As the rate of additional subaerial accommodation space approaches zero during a stillstand and eventually reverses, high sinuosity rivers are thought to have migrated laterally during a late highstand combing the previously deposited fine-grained sediments. The upper sequence overlies a regional sequence boundary unconformity and comprises an early lowstand wedge systems tract which is characterised by braided river sediments deposited during a slightiy rising base level. As the rate of additional subaerial accommodation space increases isolated high sinuosity river sediments are interpreted to have been deposited during a late lowstand wedge systems tract. Cyclic rhythmites reflecting neap-spring-neap tidal cyclicity of a diurnal palaeotidal regime represent the first 'local' major marine flooding. These are probably equivalent to a condensed section in the coeval marine realm and mark the onset of a transgressive systems tract: Continued rnarine transgression is documented by the deposition of the overlying high-energy, transgressive marine sandstone which is probably separated from the underlying tidally influenced strata by the occurrence of a ravinement surface indicating a progressively landward migrating shore line. In. considering the relative tectonic quiescence of the area during the deposition of the formation which occurred during a post-rift thermal subsidence phase, the close link between variations m the stacking patterns of facies tracts and the eustatic curve reveal that the stratigraphy and deposition of the Statfjord Formation were largely controlled by processes of sea level fluctuations in a near-shore setting...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT — The Sonsela Sandstone bed in Petrified Forest National Park is here revised with {{specific}} lithologic criteria. It is raised in rank to Member status because of distinct lithologies {{that differ from}} {{other members of the}} Chinle Formation and regional distribution. Informal stratigraphic nomenclature of a tripartite subdivision of the Sonsela Member is proposed that closely mimics past accepted nomenclature to preserve utility of terms and usage. The lowermost subdivision is the Rainbow Forest beds, which comprise a sequence of closely spaced, laterally continuous, multistoried sandstone and conglomerate lenses and minor mudstone lenses. The Jim Camp Wash beds overlie the Rainbow Forest beds with a gradational and locally intertonguing contact. The Jim Camp Wash beds are recognized by their roughly equal percentages of sandstone and mudstone, variable mudstone features, and abundance of small ( 3 m) ribbon and thin (< 2 m) sheet sandstone bodies. The Jim Camp Wash beds grade into the overlying Flattops One bed composed of multistoried sandstone and conglomerate lenses forming a broad, sheet-like body with prevalent <b>internal</b> <b>scours.</b> The term “lower ” Petrified Forest Member is abandoned in the vicinity of PEFO in favor of the term Blue Mesa Member to reflect the distinct lithologies found below the Sonsela Member in a north-south outcrop belt from westernmost New Mexico and northeastern Arizona to just north of the Arizona-Utah border. The Petrified Forest Member is here restricted in the vicinity of PEFO to the red mudstone-dominated sequence found between the Sonsela Member and the Owl Rock Member...|$|R
40|$|The {{channels}} employing hydraulic diameters between 200 m and 3 mm {{are referred}} to as minichannels 1. Compared with conventional channels from the view of the heat transfer, narrow and microchannels have significant heat transfer enhancement characteristics 2, 3. With a smooth <b>internal</b> surface and <b>scouring</b> by flowing fluid, the dirt formed {{on the surface of the}} channel wall can be easily removed and the fouling problem is not as serious as the deformed channels. Moreover, heat transfer elements can be easily assembled to compact devices. Since the innovative work of Ishibashi et al. 2, narrow channels have been adopted extensively in engineering applications, e. g., microelectronic cooling 4, 5, advanced nuclear reactor 6, 7, cryogenic, aviation, and space technology. Because the bubble size has approached the dimension of the channel, the size of the flow channel plays a critical role on the flow boiling heat transfer. This results in that the bubble in the narrow channel acts very differently from those in the non-narrow channel...|$|R
