40|$|Abstract. Medical {{research}} {{would benefit from}} automatic methods that support eligibility evaluation for patient enrollment in clinical trials and design of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria.</b> In this study we addressed the problem of formalizing <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria.</b> By analyzing a large set of breast cancer clinical trials we derived a set of patterns, that capture typical structure of conditions, pertaining to syntax and semantics. We qualitatively analyzed their expressivity and evaluated coverage using regular expressions, running experiments on a few thousands of clinical trials also related to other diseases. Based on an early evaluation we conclude that derived patterns cover the language of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> {{to a large extent}} and may serve as a semi-formal representation. We expect that extending the presented method for pattern recognition with recognition of ontology concepts will facilitate generating computable queries and automated reasoning for various applications.

40|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{text processing}} requires accurate extraction and representation of temporal expressions. Multiple temporal information extraction models were developed but a similar need for extracting temporal expressions in <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> (e. g., for eligibility determination) remains. We identified the temporal knowledge representation requirements of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> by reviewing 100 temporal criteria. We developed EliXR-TIME, a frame-based representation designed to support semantic annotation for temporal expressions in <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> by reusing applicable classes from well-known clinical temporal knowledge representations.

5000|$|The {{eligibility}} {{system has}} also come under criticism. The argument {{has been made}} that many offences worthy only of a one-match suspension are caused by negligent play, rather than intentionally [...] "unfair" [...] play, and hence that suspension is not a reasonable measure of fairness. The break from tradition under the newer demerit points-based tribunal system (i.e. a player being ineligible despite not having served a suspension) has also been criticised as confusing. Prominent players, including dual-winner Chris Judd, have indicated a desire to have the <b>eligibility</b> <b>criterion</b> removed from the award (effectively eliminating the fairest component altogether); but this view is not universally held, and 1958 winner Neil Roberts stated in 1988 that he would hand back his medal if the fairness criterion were removed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{rule-based}} formalization of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> for clinical trials. The rule-based formalization is implemented {{by using the}} logic programming language Prolog.

Our rule-based formalisation {{is based on a}} general framework for <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> containting three types of knowledge: (1) trial-specific knowledge, (2) domain-specific knowledge and (3) common knowledge. This framework enables the reuse of several parts of the formalisation of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria.</b> We have implemented the proposed rule-based formalization in SemanticCT, a semantically-enabled system for clinical trials, showing the feasibility of using our rule-based formalization of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> for supporting patient recruitment in clinical trial systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Overview: Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is a {{rare and}} very {{aggressive}} type of cancer that tends to develop at a younger age, compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Because a distinct lump may not be noticeable, correct diagnosis takes longer and, therefore, successful treatment may hinder a patient’s prognostics. This study aims to conduct a systematic review of research articles on IBC. Methods: This is a systematic review of studies in the PubMed database to April 2013, which fit the <b>eligibility</b> <b>criterion</b> of “Inflammatory Breast Neoplasms ” (MeSH Terms), filtered by Languages (English OR Portuguese OR Spanish). Findings: Of the 119 studies identified, 25 complied with the <b>eligibility</b> <b>criterion</b> for the disease, diagnostics, treatment and prognostics. Conclusion: Despite methodological differences, findings evidence that although IBC presents particular features (lower survival rate and worse prognostics than most types of breast cancer), very few studies examine its epidemiology and specific risk factors in depth and use any other therapeutic approaches than those commonly used for other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, further investigation of the disease’s aggressiveness is still necessary. Key words: inflammatory breast neoplasms, medical oncology...|$|E
