40|$|Abstract [...] In {{metropolitan}} an {{area the}} ground water is the important resource of drinking water. To preserve the <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> several rain water harvesting techniques are implemented now a days. A neural network model has been developed for <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> prediction. Various models developed before for <b>ground</b> water er <b>level</b> prediction with artificial neural network methodology. Most of these models these models consider rainfall and current <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> as input parameter. This model considers rainfall-runoff runoff as an important factor which represents the performance of rain water harvesting techniques in urban area. So this model predicts the <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> with the effect of rain water harvesting techniques.

40|$|As basic {{research}} for the study on the seepage water control in the paddy field, the following topics are dealed: (1) Effect of the seepage rate from paddy field on the <b>ground</b> water <b>level.</b> (2) Effect of the <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> on the seepage rate from paddy field. In the first topic, <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> was obtained by the solution of Boussinesq 2 ̆ 7 s equation based on the Dupuit 2 ̆ 7 s assumption. This solution was compared with experiments and {{it was found that}} there are the cases in which the Dupuit 2 ̆ 7 s assumption is not valid. In these cases, problems may be analyzed by numerical method. In the second topic, experiments were carried out relating to the change of the seepage rate with the change of the <b>ground</b> water <b>level.</b> As a result, it was sought that the change of the <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> does not effect the seepage rate in low <b>ground</b> water <b>levels</b> and the seepage rate decreases as the <b>ground</b> water <b>level</b> rises. These phenomenon were considered qualitatively. 理想化された水田のモデルについて地下水位と浸透量の関係について取り扱つかってきた. この研究で得られた結果を要約すれば次のとおりである. (i) 地下水面の位置を求める際,Dupuitの仮定にもとづくBoussinesqの式は地下水面への浸透量が一様でない場合にはあまり有効でない. したがつて田畑輪換地帯のような所で地下水面の位置を求める際のDupuitの仮定の使用には注意を要する. (ii) 地下水位を下げると,常に水田からの浸透量が増加するとはかぎらない. ここで取り扱つたモデルのような水田では,田面タン水と地下水が水理学的に不連続になると,地下水位を下げても浸透量は増加しない. この現象に若干の理論的説明を加えた...|$|R

50|$|There is no {{substantive}} {{scientific evidence}} to suggest that energetic proton events are harmful to human health at <b>ground</b> <b>levels,</b> particularly at latitudes where most of the Earth's population resides. The Earth's magnetic field is exceptionally good at preventing the radiative effects of energetic particles from reaching <b>ground</b> <b>levels.</b> High altitude commercial transpolar aircraft flights have measured increases in radiation during energetic proton events, but a warning system is in place that limits these effects by alerting pilots to lower their cruising altitudes. Aircraft flights away from the polar regions are far less likely to see an impact from solar proton events.|$|R
5|$|Concourse D was {{constructed}} as a <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities. All American Eagle flights operated out of Concourse D until, as a cost-cutting measure after 9/11, all American Eagle flights {{were moved to}} Concourse C to share gates with American Airlines. For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand Concourse D with additional gates to increase capacity and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E

When an outflow {{boundary}} forms due to {{a shallow}} layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind shear can result {{at the leading edge}} of the three dimensional boundary.

5|$|Like the Colosseum, {{the three}} façades have a {{different}} order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> then Ionic on the piano nobile and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, {{the style of the}} building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{equipment}} was installed on floors four through seven, including 12transformers on the 5th floor. Several emergency generators {{installed in the}} building were used by the New York City Office of Emergency Management, Salomon Smith Barney, and other tenants. In order to supply the generators, 24,000gallons (91,000L) of diesel fuel were stored below <b>ground</b> <b>level.</b> Diesel fuel distribution components were located at <b>ground</b> <b>level,</b> up to the ninth floor. After the World Trade Center bombings of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized {{in light of the}} events of 9/11, the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building.|$|E
