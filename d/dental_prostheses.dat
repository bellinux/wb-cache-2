2500|$|Physiologically, teeth {{provide for}} greater chewing ability. [...] They {{allow us to}} {{masticate}} food thoroughly, increasing the surface area necessary {{to allow for the}} enzymes present in the saliva, {{as well as in the}} stomach and intestines, to digest our food. [...] Chewing also allows food to be prepared into small boli that are more readily swallowed than haphazard chunks of considerable size. [...] For those who are even partially endentulous, it may become extremely difficult to chew food efficiently enough to swallow comfortably, although this is entirely dependent upon which teeth are lost. [...] When an individual loses enough posterior teeth to make it difficult to chew, he or she may need to cut their food into very small pieces and learn how to make use of their anterior teeth to chew. [...] If enough posterior teeth are missing, this will not only affect their chewing abilities, but also their occlusion; posterior teeth, in a mutually protected occlusion, help to protect the anterior teeth and the vertical dimension of occlusion and, when missing, the anterior teeth begin to bear a greater amount of force for which they are structurally prepared. [...] Thus, loss of posterior teeth will cause the anterior teeth to splay. [...] This can be prevented by obtaining <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses,</b> such as removable partial dentures, bridges or implant-supported crowns.

40|$|PURPOSE. The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze the {{preference}} for treatment modality of dentists. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Data of 20, 038 patients was involved. Data analysis were done by distribution according to the various kinds of prosthesis, including complete denture, removable partial denture, fixed partial denture, implant-supported <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis</b> as well as distribution according to the professional titles of the dentists finishing the treatment, including resident and professors. RESULTS. The number of cases of <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis</b> increased year by year. 61. 06 % of the patients accepted fixed partial denture restoration. The number of patients who accepted implant supported restoration is also increasing year by year. The number of complete denture, implant-supported <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis</b> finished by professors was larger than that done by residents, while it was contrary for removable partial denture, fixed partial denture, and the difference was statistically significant (P<. 05).

40|$|Background: The {{stomatitis}} sub-prosthesis {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent changes in hard palate mucous membrane in patients with mucous-supported <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> It can be caused by multiple factors, which makes its study and prognosis more difficult. Objective : To describe the occurrence of stomatitis sub-prosthesis and its causes in patients with superior <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Method : Descriptive study including all the patients with superior <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis</b> examined in the odontology consultation “Barrio Adentro” in the state of Miranda, Venezuela, from November, 2005 to March, 2006. The analysed variables were: age, sex, stomatitis level, teeth brushing frequency, prosthesis condition and use, palate mucous condition and frequency of odontology consultations. Results : 89 patients were attended, more 50 % of them had superior <b>dental</b> <b>prosthesis</b> and presented stomatitis sub-prosthesis; the group between 35 and 59 years was the most affected, mainly females. Sub-prosthesis stomatitis type II was the most common and the main causes included constant use of the prosthesis and loose prosthesis. Buccal hygiene was not adequate in these patients. Most of them declared never attending to the dentist, or just when presenting some particular problem.

5000|$|A dental {{prosthesis}} is an intraoral (inside the mouth) prosthesis used to restore (reconstruct) intraoral defects such as missing teeth, missing parts of teeth, and missing soft or hard {{structures of the}} jaw and palate. Prosthodontics is the dental specialty that focuses on <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses.</b> Such prostheses are used to rehabilitate mastication (chewing), improve aesthetics, and aid speech. A {{dental prosthesis}} may be {{held in place by}} connecting to teeth or dental implants, by suction, or by being held passively by surrounding muscles. Like other types of prostheses, they can either be fixed permanently or removable; fixed prosthodontics and removable dentures are made in many variations. Permanently fixed <b>dental</b> <b>prostheses</b> use dental adhesive or screws, to attach to teeth or dental implants. Removal prostheses may use friction against parallel hard surfaces and undercuts of adjacent teeth or dental implants, suction using the mucous retention (with or without aid from denture adhesives), and by exploiting the surrounding muscles and anatomical contours of the jaw to passively hold in place.|$|E
