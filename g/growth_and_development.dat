40|$|Abstract: South Africa is characterised by {{widespread}} {{inequality and}} divided societies, which impede economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social <b>development.</b> Basic <b>and</b> social infrastructure investment {{can assist in}} addressing these challenges by promoting economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social <b>development.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to determine if basic and social infrastructure investment differently effect economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social <b>development</b> indicators of urban and rural municipalities respectively. We use a balanced panel data set containing infrastructure, economic, demographic and social indicators for rural and urban municipalities for the period from 1996 to 2012. To address the research question we construct synthetic indices of basic and social infrastructure, using principal component analysis, to be used in panel regression estimations. To estimate our economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social <b>development</b> functions we make use of restricted within LSDV estimation techniques. We use the results on the respective elasticities to evaluate whether the differences between urban and rural municipalities are statistically significant. Our results show that the elasticities of basic and social infrastructure investment generally are more pronounced for economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social <b>development</b> indicators in rural municipalities than in urban municipalities. These findings could potentially influence policy decisions in terms of infrastructure investment in favour of rural municipalities to increase economic <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> social <b>development</b> in these regions, which could contribute to the reduction of spatial inequalities in South Africa...|$|R

5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E
