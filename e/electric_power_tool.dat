Pneumatic tools can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. Pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain than their <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade pneumatic tools with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} GridSpice, a scalable open-source simulation {{framework for}} modeling, designing, and plan-ning of the smart grid. GridSpice seamlessly integrates existing <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> simulation <b>tools</b> to enable modeling of large electric networks that blur {{the boundaries between}} generation, transmis-sion, distribution, and markets. This is achieved via a cloud-based architecture that allows for parallelizing large simulation jobs across many virtual machines using a pay-as-you-go model. Grid-Spice simulations can be managed through a Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API), or through a Python library, allowing users to run simulations programmatically and interface with disparate data inputs, energy management systems (EMS), distribution management systems (DMS), and postprocessing tools. These capabilities make GridSpice an ideal tool for the development and testing of new grid control and optimization algorithms. GridSpice also provides an easy-to-use browser-based interface to allow novice users to begin without any setup or configuration on their local PC. A first implementation of the GridSpice framework integrates Gridlab-D and MATPOWER as simulation tools, and {{has been used for}} projects including optimizing the placement of distributed generation and developing optimal dispatch schedules for flexible loads. The GridSpice framework and Gridlab-D are freely available in open-source under the BSD license. Index Terms—Electric vehicles, multiagent systems, power system simulation. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} {{the problems associated with}} LiNiO 2, the solid solution series of lithium nickel-metal oxides, Li[Ni 1 -xMx]O- 2 (with M = Co, Mn, Al, Ti, Mg, etc.), have been investigated as favorable cathode materials for high-energy and high-power lithium-ion batteries. However, along with the improvement in the electrochemical properties in Ni-based cathode materials, the thermal stability has been a great concern, and thus violent reaction of the cathode with the electrolyte needs to be avoided. Here, we report a heterostructured Li[Ni 0. 54 Co 0. 12 Mn 0. 34]O- 2 cathode material which possesses both high energy and safety. The core of the particle is Li[Ni 0. 54 Co 0. 12 Mn 0. 34]O- 2 with a layered phase (R 3 -m) and the shell, with a thickness of < 0. 5 mu m, is a highly stable Li 1 +x[CoNixMn 2 -x](2) O- 4 spinel phase (Fd- 3 m). The material demonstrates reversible capacity of 200 mAhg- 1 and retains 95 % capacity retention under the most severe test condition of 60 degrees C. In addition, the amount of oxygen evolution from the lattice in the cathode with two heterostructures is reduced by 70 %, compared to the reference sample.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to trace the process in which the 9 -block plan, adopted in {{the reorganization of}} 1951, was formulated. In other words, that is to specify who the opinion leader of the reorganization of Japan's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry was. There were three candidates for the opinion leader: Nine Haiden Kaisha(electric distributing companies), the General Headquarters/Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers(GHQ/SCAP), and MATSUNAGA Yasuzaemon(the former president of the Toho <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Co.). Of the three, Nine Haiden Kaisha completely changed their reorganization plan in 1948 from state management in reality to private management. GHQ/SCAP which made so many plans as 5 -block, 7 -block, 9 -block and 10 -block, also could not keep its own opinion consistently. On the contrary, MATSUNAGA who was the chairman of the <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Industry Reorganization Council from November 1949 to February 1950, kept th 9 -block plan from the beginning to the end. Therefore, it may safely be said that MATSUNAGA was the opinion leader of the reorganization of Japan's <b>Electric</b> <b>Power</b> Industry of 1951, though the commonly accepted theory emphasizes the role of GHQ/SCAP.
