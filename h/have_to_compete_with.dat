5|$|While MLS {{has looked}} into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates.

5|$|In drug design it is {{important}} to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed. For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes. However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> the high concentrations of ATP in the cell. Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP. As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.|$|E

The total population in 2008 was less than 600, of which the mature specimens numbered within 250.

A study in the Nechisar National Park during 2009 and 2010 found a considerable increase in the livestock of the Oromos (49.9% and 56.5% increase during 2006 and 2010, respectively), illegal resource exploitation, and habitat loss as major threats to the Swayne's hartebeest populations there.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 the Bergen businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the Bergen mountains, electrification from Voss to Bergen, {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private financing would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a surcharge on tickets, equal to the reduction in fare induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around Bergen were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt financing would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built.

25|$|After {{many years}} of being held on Mondays at 9:00pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30pm Eastern/5:30pm Pacific. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast {{to go to bed}} earlier. For many years the film {{industry}} had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January or early-February ceremony held on a Sunday would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> National Football League playoff games such as the Super Bowl.|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} 1967 Tour de France, Simpson was {{determined}} to make an impact. He was in his eighth year as a professional cyclist and wanted to earn {{as much money as}} possible before retiring. He was optimistic that he could finish high in the general classification, securing [...] larger appearance fees from post-Tour criteriums. His plan was to either finish in the top three or wear the leader's yellow jersey; he had targeted three key stages, one of which included the thirteenth over Mont Ventoux, riding safe until the race reached the mountains. The 1967 Tour was contested by national teams rather than trade teams. Simpson was the undisputed leader of the British team, one of the weakest in the race. Four team members had experience in top-level racing and six were riding the Tour for the first time. This could have been seen as a handicap, but Simpson was not guaranteed the leadership of his trade team, Peugeot-BP-Michelin, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> Frenchman Roger Pingeon– the winner of the 1967 Tour.|$|E
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein, despite {{extraordinary}} early successes, such as Oklahoma!, Carousel and South Pacific, {{had suffered}} back-to-back Broadway flops {{in the mid-1950s}} with Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream.

[...] Rodgers and Hammerstein had made it their rule to begin work on their next musical {{as soon as the}} last opened on Broadway, but by the start of 1957, six months after Pipe Dream closed, the pair had no new stage musical in prospect. [...] They had, however, been working since 1956 on the popular television version of Cinderella, which was broadcast on CBS on March 31, 1957. [...] Rodgers was still recovering from an operation for cancer in a tooth socket, and he was drinking heavily and suffering from depression. [...] In June 1957, Rodgers checked himself into Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, and he remained there for twelve weeks. [...] According to his daughters, Mary and Linda, this did not put a stop to his drinking.|$|E

500|$|Once {{part of the}} supercontinent Gondwana, {{the island}} of Madagascar has been {{isolated}} since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160mya), Antarctica (~80–130mya), and India (~80–90mya). Since ancestral lemurs {{are thought to have}} originated in Africa around 62 to 65mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560km (350mi). In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers. This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years. In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term [...] "sweepstakes hypothesis" [...] for such random events. Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar, but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island. In , a report demonstrated that around 60mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650km (1,030mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different ocean gyre, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs {{and the rest of the}} terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa. Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels. They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.|$|E
