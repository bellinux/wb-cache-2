2500|$|Zeitgeist debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 145,000 {{copies in}} its first week. It also reached the top spots on Billboard's Internet Albums and Rock Albums charts {{in its first}} week, and hit the top 10 in Canada (#1), New Zealand (#1), the United Kingdom (#4), Germany (#7), Australia (#7), and other countries. The album was {{certified}} gold by the RIAA with 500,000 copies shipped as of February 1, 2008. Regarding the album's sales in 2010, Corgan stated that the album [...] "went gold. But people didn't listen to it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> people weren't listening to the album. In the past if you put out an album, people at least knew the first song. We {{would go out and}} play [...] "Doomsday Clock" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> they hadn't even listened to it. I don't view it as a gross disappointment. It's disappointing to me that what I was trying to communicate didn't get the chance to be communicated." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{becoming}} exhausted, {{they stopped}} trying to signal. [...] "The air behind the curtain grew worse, so I tried to lie {{as low as possible}} and take shallow breaths... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> it was gassy." [...] According to McCloy, Toler and Anderson tried to find a way out. [...] "The heavy smoke and fumes caused them to quickly return. There was just so much gas." [...] At that point the miners, despite their fears, [...] "began to accept our fate. Toler led us all in the Sinner's Prayer. We prayed a little longer, then someone suggested that we each write letters to our loved ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
60|$|By {{his manner}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> his {{statement}} was untrue.|$|R
6000|$|... "To-night! That's brave!" [...] exclaimed Beresteyn. [...] "You read my thoughts, sir, {{even before}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>that</b> delay in this affair would render it useless." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{little time}} was wasted in {{narration}} of our adventure. Tars Tarkas and Carthoris exchanged the dignified and formal greetings common upon Barsoom, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> intuitively <b>that</b> the Thark loved my boy and that Carthoris reciprocated his affection.|$|R
60|$|SHITE (In {{the form}} of an old priest) <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> priest a thing or two.|$|E
6000|$|... "You make a {{very good}} figure," [...] he said, [...] "and better, I can tell you, than I did at your age, for I was but weakly, while you are well grown and strong. Among your other {{exercises}} you have not neglected the use of your sword. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> {{as soon as my}} eyes fell upon you." ...|$|E
60|$|Ghak {{tried to}} dissuade me, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> {{his heart was}} with me in my wish to be away and really doing something. It was while we were arguing upon the subject that a stranger, with hands above his head, entered the village. He was {{immediately}} surrounded by warriors and conducted to Ghak's presence.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was myself {{bound for}} his presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me tell it all. Anton, and then, {{whatever}} they may say, {{whatever they}} may do, I shall not mind. I wish {{that they knew}} it, and then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand up against them. Then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> Ziska <b>that</b> which would make him hold his tongue for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, no!" [...] said Harry, who {{regarded}} Ethel's attainments {{as something}} contraband. [...] "D'ye think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell?</b> No, <b>that's</b> the only pity, that he can't hear it; but, after all, I don't care for anything he does, now I {{know he has}} shown up a girl's verses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{fought against}} the feeling. I told myself it was prejudice. But the more I {{reasoned}} against it the stronger it became. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that,</b> as the days went by, it would grow from dislike to loathing, from loathing to hate. And this was the woman I had deliberately selected as a life companion for Josiah! ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{began the}} voice {{of it in the}} {{dripping}} stillness, a tramping of weary feet, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> this advancing shadow was formed of men, millions of them moving all at one speed, very slowly, as if regulated by the march of the most tired among them. They had blotted out the road, now, from a few yards away to the horizon; and suddenly, in the dusk, a face showed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure enough, {{there in}} the {{distance}} war some horsemen coming across the plain; but they war straggling, and not many of them. I could not make head nor tail of it. They war Injins, sure enough, for even at that distance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> by their figures. Then I saw as there was more of them coming behind them; the idea suddenly struck me: 'Ride, Captain!' I shouted; 'ride with your men for your life, they are chasing some one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your eyes {{told me so}} today. I am not blind--I can see {{further than}} those dull fisher folks. Yes, I knew you would come. That is why I came here tonight--so that you would find me alone and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>that</b> you were not to come again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the truth, papa;--for she {{explained}} {{the whole thing}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> her <b>that</b> she was mistaken, and thus ask for her money." ...|$|R
6000|$|What was I to say? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> him <b>that</b> my {{relations}} {{with his son}} were decidedly inimical; so, after a moment's hesitation, I answered a little evasively: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders. 'You are too clever for me, young lady,' he broke out. 'I {{have nothing to}} say to you. But Lady Georgina, Mrs. Evelegh--you are human--let me go! Reflect; I have things <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> would make both of you look ridiculous. That journey to Malines, Lady Georgina! Those Indian charms, Mrs. Evelegh! Besides, you have spoiled my game. Let that suffice you! I can {{practise}} in Switzerland no longer. Allow me to go in peace, and I will try once more to be indifferent honest!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Above {{the roar}} and {{crackling}} of the unquenchable fire, my ear, quickened by the straits in which I lay, caught just once {{the sound of}} the words they were saying. I had learnt a fair amount of Hawaiian since my arrival, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> in their talk [...] "the anger of Pélé," [...] "victim" [...] and [...] "stranger," [...] occurred frequently. Could it be that they meant deliberately to leave me there unaided to die? Were they afraid to meddle with the prisoners of the goddess? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect he {{has gone}} off to sleep," [...] Cuthbert said, [...] "he {{has been in a}} lot of pain all night and half an hour ago they took off his {{bandages}} and put on fresh ones, and I fancy they must have hurt him amazingly. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> by his quick breathing, for he did not utter a moan. I am glad that {{he has gone}} off to sleep. I heard the doctor tell him that he thought he might get the use of his arm again, though it would probably be stiff for some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dor. Because, methought, {{he would}} have hurt me less, [...] Than he would her. [...] But if I knew you'd not be angry with me, [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you, sir, <b>that</b> he was much to blame.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear; the old gun {{burst and}} hurt my hands, {{but not a}} mite of harm was done to Joe. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> all <b>that</b> {{happened}} for a spell, being quite dazed with joy and surprise; {{but by the time}} mother came home I was as peart as a wren, and Joe was at the table eating and drinking every mortal thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find in the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't blame yourself, dear," [...] remonstrated the girl, [...] "when {{it was all}} my fault. I begged {{and begged}} and begged until you had to consent, and I'm not sorry either--if nothing happens to you because of our coming. I couldn't stay in New York another minute. Everyone was so snoopy, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> they were dying to ask {{questions}} about Billy and me." ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting to}} reload, {{or even to}} look if {{the main body of}} the Zulus had seen the death of their two scouts, I turned my horse and drove my heels into his sides. As soon as I was down the slope of the rise I pulled a little to the right in order to {{intercept}} the waggons before the Zulus saw them. I had not gone three hundred yards in this new direction when, to my utter astonishment, I struck a trail marked with waggon-wheels and the hoofs of oxen. Of waggons there must have been at least eight, and several hundred cattle. Moreover, they had passed within twelve hours; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> by the spoor. Then I understood; the Impi was following the track of the waggons, which, in all probability, belonged to a party of emigrant Boers.|$|E
60|$|I was in New York when I {{received}} {{the order to}} proceed immediately to Chicago. The man who gave me the order {{was one of the}} oligarchs, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> by his speech, though I did not know his name nor see his face. His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake. Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered, that we had been countermined. The explosion was ready for the flash of powder, and countless agents of the Iron Heel, including me, either on the ground or being sent there, were to supply that flash. I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch, but my heart was beating madly. I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final, cold-blooded instructions were given.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{quite know}} what I felt,' she said reluctantly, and with {{somewhat}} heightened colour. 'I know I felt ashamed of myself; I {{used to think that}} I was as strong in my way as men are in theirs, {{and it seemed to me}} disgraceful that I should have to be carried. Then I could not help thinking, where the road was very steep, and I could hear the guide in front telling Captain Armstrong where he should step, that he might slip, and we should be both killed together. Otherwise, I felt safe, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> he was walking firmly, and was not feeling my weight too much. I don't think I lost consciousness at all; my body felt quite warm, but my hands and my feet were as if they were dead. I should not have been at all surprised to find that I had lost them altogether.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{burst into}} a fit of laughter. [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> {{he was going to}} fall flat upon the ground and shout a million murders, when I fired {{straight}} into the air?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] the Story Girl {{looked at}} Cecily half reproachfully. [...] "Why couldn't you tell {{it better than}} that? If I had such a dream <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> it so <b>that</b> {{everybody}} else would {{feel as if they}} had dreamed it, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chris Marker has said: [...] "On a more matter-of-fact level, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>that</b> {{the film}} {{intended}} to be, and {{is nothing more}} than a home movie. I really think that my main talent has been to find people to pay for my home movies. Were I born rich, I guess I would have made more or less the same films, at least the traveling kind, but nobody would have heard of them except my friends and visitors." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{must have}} been walking for nearly an hour, when it came at last, and the rain fell in great sheets. I looked around for a cab, but there was none in sight. I {{had no idea where}} I was,--London is so vast and large,--and though, by the distant roar of wheels, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> I was not far from a great thoroughfare, the street in which I was seemed to be deserted. Just by my side was a dark tunnel, gloomy and vault-like in appearance; but in that downpour any refuge was welcome, and I stepped back {{underneath}} it. It was like going into the bowels of the earth; and, every now and then, there was a roar over my head which made me almost dizzy. But, from round the corner, I could see that it was only the sound of trains passing and repassing, so I decided to stay until I could see a cab.|$|E
60|$|Upon waking {{next morning}} about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over {{me in the}} most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan {{labyrinth}} of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade-- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times-- this same arm of his, I say, looked {{for all the world}} like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Queequeg was hugging me.|$|E
6000|$|He said it lightly, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> he {{felt the}} {{disappointment}} bitterly, while even I, who had expected nothing, wheeled the pack-horse around with an angry growl. It was toward dusk when we neared the creek we had crossed in the morning, {{but it was no}} longer shrunken. Evidently the dam of débris had given way, for it roared in full flood now, and it was with anxiety that we quickened our pace. The hillsides loomed black out of chilly mist that wrapped the serried ranks of climbing pines in their smoky folds. It was not yet dark in the valley, but the light was dying fast, and a bitter breeze swept down a darkening gorge, bringing with it the moan of an unseen forest until presently this was lost in the voice of the frothing torrent before us. There was neither fuel nor shelter on that side, and we determined to attempt the crossing, for, as Harry said, [...] "Hunger alone is bad, but hunger and cold together are worth an effort to avoid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you of <b>that</b> girl's mother, Mr. Tavernake," [...] he said, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{you what}} her history, our history, has been, {{it would seem}} to you so strange that you would {{probably}} regard me as a romancer. No, we have to carry our secrets with us." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{we shook}} hands, Jeanne {{asked me if}} I knew where her uncle was. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> her <b>that</b> he had left me at my own door. She made no remark; but {{she seemed to be}} uneasy on {{receiving}} that reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} {{see where}} the bungling comes in," [...] Littleson answered. [...] "I offered her a hundred thousand dollars for that paper. She took the tip and got it somehow. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> she had another scheme in her mind?" ...|$|R
