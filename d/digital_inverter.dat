40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effects of substrate noise on analog circuits in mixed-signal chips and techniques for minimizing these harmful effects on sensitive analog circuits. A microchip built in a 0. 25 um CMOS epitaxial process was designed, fabricated, and tested for this research. Through the use of an on-chip sampling scope, the effect of substrate noise generated by <b>digital</b> <b>inverters</b> with coupling capacitors to the substrate on analog circuits was characterized. Substrate noise coupled into a representative analog circuit, a switched capacitor delta-sigma modulator primarily through the asymmetrical parasitics of the input sampling circuit. Furthermore, since some of the parasitics are nonlinear with input voltage, substrate noise couples into the analog circuits producing an input signal dependent component and an input signal independent component. The substrate noise, with decay time constants of a few nanoseconds and ringing frequencies of few hundred megahertz, can decrease analog circuit performance. In the case of a delta-sigma modulator, substrate noise caused the signal to noise power ratio to decrease by more than 18 dB, 3 bits in terms of analog-to-digital converter metrics. In addition, two techniques of minimizing the substrate noise and its effects were explored. The first used a replica delta-sigma modulator on the same chip to subtract the effects of substrate noise from the original delta-sigma modulator. This method proved useful for removing input signal independent substrate noise, but not input signal dependent substrate noise which dominates in-band noise for large input signal magnitudes. The second technique involved an active substrate noise cancellation system. (cont.) A discrete time feedback loop senses the substrate noise, processes it through a filter, and uses an array of <b>digital</b> <b>inverters</b> to cancel the substrate noise. The principal advantages of this technique are the shaping of substrate noise through a designed filter without a significant power penalty and design independence from the analog and digital components. Measured data shows that this technique is capable of over 20 dB reduction in substrate noise on the substrate voltage itself. Measured data also shows over 10 dB improvement in SNDR of the delta-sigma modulator in certain cases. by Mark Shane Peng. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|Multi-rate signal {{processing}} {{is the key}} technology to realize the digital frequency converter. In a general communication system, {{the rate of the}} baseband signal is often much lower than that of the intermediate frequency (IF) signal; in order to match the sampling rate of both sides, {{there is no doubt that}} the sampling rate of the former increases, which is equivalent to the increase in the number of sampling points. While in the reception process, signals from an analog to digital converter (ADC) with a higher rate are difficult to provide directly to processors for processing; as a result, extraction is considered to decrease the sampling rate. In other words, the discrete sampled signal is resampled, and ultimately, the signal frequency will be down to the appropriate point for data recovery.

40|$|Future systems {{powered by}} energy scavenging, e. g., {{wireless}} sen-sor nodes, demand μW-range ADCs with no static bias currents {{in order to}} have a power dissipation proportional to the sample rate. An ADC that meets these requirements by using a charge-redistri-bution DAC, a dynamic 2 -stage comparator, and a delay-line-based controller is realized in CMOS. Figure 12. 4. 1 shows a DAC based on charge redistribution, with a binary-weighted capacitor array [1]. The left side of every capaci-tor can be switched between a low reference voltage, Vref-, and a high reference voltage, Vref+, using a simple <b>digital</b> <b>inverter.</b> If the left side of capacitor CMSB is switched from low to high, the step on output VDAC is ΔVDAC = (Vref+- Vref-) *CMSB/Ctot, where Ctot is the total capacitance at the output node. The effect of the charge-redistrib-ution is reversible: if the left side of CMSB is switched from high to low, the output returns to its original value. This does not con-tribute any noise to the output voltage as there is no sampling involved. The switch at the output of the DAC can be used to reset the DAC voltage to Vref- to prevent DC drift due to leakage. This reset gives a thermal-noise voltage of kT/Ctot. The matching of metal-plate capacitors in a modern CMOS process is very good. For a 10 b converter with a total DAC capacitance Ctot= 600 fF; the matching is better than 0. 5 LSB. For this DAC, mismatch is dominant over thermal noise if the output-voltage range is more than ~ 0. 2 V. The inverter charging or discharging CMSB of 300 fF only sees the equivalent capacitor Ceq of 150 fF. If Vref+- Vref- is 1 V it takes only 150 fJ to switch Ceq from Vref- to Vref+ and back to Vref-. Thus, the theoretical energy per conversion in the DAC can be less than a few hundred fJ. This energy can even be lower if the charging and discharging of Ceq is done in multiple steps. This is shown in Fig. 12. 4. 2 where the voltage over Ceq i...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{materials}} are currently considered to replace Si in diverse areas of solid-state electronics. One {{of these areas}} is power-switching. By increasing the efficiency of power-conversion systems, total energy consumption can be reduced. While on the system level, efficiency can be enhanced by improving passive components or circuits design, on the transistor level, it can be enhanced by new device designs {{or the use of}} new semiconductor materials. Among such materials, the group III nitrides (GaN, AlN, InN) are considered as suitable alternatives to Si. These materials feature inherent polarisation effects (spontaneous and piezoelectric). This polarisation can be engineered by changing the material composition, i. e. by mixing the compounds to alloys (e. g. GaN and AlN to AlGaN). By growing a nitride-based heterostructure in which a wider-bandgap material is deposited on top of a narrower-bandgap material, a polarisation difference is typically present at the material interface. This difference then leads to a fixed interface charge which is compensated by the formation of a 2 -D electron gas (2 DEG). Within this 2 DEG, very sheet high carrier densities (up to 6 × 10 ^ 13 cm^- 2) and large mobilities (above 2000 cm^ 2 /Vs) are achievable. Together with the high electrical breakdown strength of the material, the 2 DEG is the cornerstone of the superiority of GaN heterostructure FETs (HFETs) over Si MOSFETs in terms of power-switching performance. When it comes to fabricate circuits for power-switching, enhancement mode (e-mode) behaviour of the power transistor is a necessity to enable fail-safe operation and to allow for high efficiency of the circuit. However, due to the intrinsic presence of the 2 DEG, GaN devices are typically of depletion type. Although different approaches have been employed to render these devices e-mode, the single heterostructure limits the achievable threshold voltage (V_th) to below + 1 V. This value, however, is not expected to be sufficient in a real-world application. As solution for this fundamental problem, the single heterostructure is replaced in this thesis by a double heterostructure in which at the backside of the GaN channel another polarisation difference counteracts the one which is responsible for forming the 2 DEG. Moreover, a dielectric is used such that a metal-insulator-semiconductor double hetero-structure FET (MIS-DHFET) is formed. These two changes of the device structure allow for diverse approaches to be applied for achieving a high positive V_th. These different approaches are obtained on basis of a newly derived electrostatic equation and the most effective ones in terms of shifting V_th are analysed experimentally. The single steps to render GaN-based devices e-mode are discussed separately. Hence, it is possible to optimise the approaches individually. Impact on improved device performance and in particular on the V_th shift, as well as possible drawbacks are investigated. With the optimised parameters for each approach, a device which combines all of them is demonstrated, yielding a high positive V_th of + 2. 3 V. Despite the large effort to fabricate GaN-based devices for RF power amplification and power-switching applications, the technology based on this material system is limited to n-channel devices. p-Channel devices, on the contrary, have not been targeted. Prior to the work discussed in this thesis, only two reports on p-channel devices with very limited data have been published. Yet, by understanding the working principle and by developing well-performing p-channel devices, numerous fields of application not accessible to date would be materialised, thereunder digital logic and voltage amplification under harsh environment. Also, for power-switching applications, the gate driver could then be monolithically integrated on a single chip with the power transistors. In analogy with the n-channel part, for the first time, an electrostatic relation is derived for a complex GaN-based heterostructure involving the presence of a 2 -D hole gas (2 DHG). Based on the derived relation, means to form p-channel e-mode devices are obtained. Prior to applying these approaches, the p-channel HFET is subjected to optimisations of basic device properties. On basis of the optimised devices, concepts which have already been employed for n-channel transistors are analysed. The p-channel HFETs discussed demonstrate unprecedented performance. These devices also enable to gain a deeper insight into the proposed device structure and physics by employing various characterisation methods not used before for GaN-based p-channel HFETs. In a final chapter, n- and p-channel devices are monolithically integrated on a single wafer. By rendering both devices e-mode, the first demonstration of a GaN-based <b>digital</b> <b>inverter</b> is presented...|$|E
