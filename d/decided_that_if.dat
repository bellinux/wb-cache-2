5|$|A. Although the Montreal Victorias won the AHAC {{title in}} 1895, the Stanley Cup {{trustees}} had already accepted a challenge from the 1894 Cup champion Montreal HC and Queen's University. As a compromise, the trustees <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias {{would become the}} Stanley Cup champions. The Montreals eventually won the game, 5–1, and their crosstown rivals were awarded the Cup.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{his college}} degree in 1989, Sheridan {{returned to his}} home. He held various jobs, including substitute teaching, bartending, and working in his father's variety store. Sheridan eventually <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to establish a career, he had to relocate, so he moved to California in 1992. Sheridan stayed at a friend's house, and as he did not own a cell phone, he used a payphone located on Sunset Boulevard to call interested employers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E

50|$|In the end, {{after the}} {{confusion}} is sorted out, Marsha <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{she has to}} choose, being married to Peter would make her happier than her career. She comes home and finds Ginger and Darvac knocked out in the closet.|$|R
5|$|In 1895, Queen's University was {{the first}} {{official}} challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match was between the previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC won the match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned the champions. The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League. On February 14, 1896, the Winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2–0 {{and became the first}} team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> his career went nowhere {{he would still}} have a chance to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1952, {{when the}} {{mainland}} NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself a continuation of the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year. As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent a country, and both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team. After considerable deliberation, the IOC <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline. In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games. Brundage, president-elect when {{the decision was made to}} allow PRC athletes to compete, argued against the decision to allow mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.|$|E
50|$|Joshua Albers from Kaitlyn's season arrives, {{bringing}} a date card with him. Lauren likes Josh and <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he doesn't ask her, she will quit. He asks someone else so she leaves. She also {{admits that she}} is a mistress back home.|$|R
50|$|His plan foiled, Alexander <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he cannot {{create a}} perfect Earth, {{he will take}} this Earth by force and shape it as best he can. To that end, the Society meets in Metropolis to decimate the {{remaining}} heroes (with Doomsday as their champion).|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in prison, Lex {{tries to}} get Darkseid to break him out of prison. Darkseid refuses due to Lex's failure. As soon as he hangs up on Lex, Darkseid <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he wants to conquer the Earth, he will need help from an otherworldly being.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then <b>decided</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> he ever made a film about the afterlife, {{that was the way}} in which it would be filmed. Noé had been working on different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers {{back in the}} timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they felt, they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed {{one of the original}} battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Gjirokastër {{became part}} of the Pashalik of Yanina, then led by the Albanian-born Ali Pasha of Ioannina and was {{transformed}} into a semi-autonomous fiefdom in the southwestern Balkans until his death in 1822. After the fall of the pashalik in 1868, the city was the capital of the sanjak of Ergiri. On 23 July 1880, southern Albanian committees of the League of Prizren held a congress in the city, in which was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Albanian-populated areas of the Ottoman Empire were ceded to neighbouring countries, they would revolt. During the Albanian National Awakening (1831–1912), the city was a major centre of the movement, and some groups in the city were reported to carry portraits of Skanderbeg, the national hero of the Albanians during this period. Gjirokastër {{from the middle of the}} nineteenth century also prominently contributed to the wider Ottoman Empire through individuals that served as Kadıs (civil servants) and was an important centre of Islamic culture. The pro-Albanianists of the city during 1909-1912 were split between two groups: the urban liberals who wanted to cooperate with the Greeks and Albanian nationalists who formed guerilla bands operating in the countryside. During the 19th and early 20th century, Albanian speaking Muslims were the majority population of Gjirokastër, while only a few Greek-speaking families lived there.|$|E
60|$|Then next, being a philosopher, {{he would}} <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he was going}} to buy a great number of {{libraries}} in this way, {{he was going to}} make an absolutely new sort of demand for these books, and that he was entitled to a special sort of supply.|$|R
5000|$|Hnau {{is a word}} in the Old Solar {{language}} {{which refers}} to [...] "rational animals" [...] such as Humans. In the book, the Old Solar speaker specifies that God is not hnau, and is unsure whether Eldila (immortal angelic beings) can be termed [...] "hnau", <b>deciding</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they are hnau, they are {{a different kind of}} hnau than Humans or Martians.|$|R
50|$|Von Strohm, Gruber and Helga are {{discussing}} their situation. They <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a rescue attempt {{would be made}} on the British airmen, they had best look the other way, in order to preserve all of their secrets and so that the painting of the fallen Madonna will not be found. Helga is persuaded to distract captain Bertorelli, so that he will not sound the alarm.|$|R
25|$|Their dissension, however, merely induced them to {{postpone}} the verdict. Henry, they declared, must make reparation to Gregory VII and pledge himself to obedience; and they <b>decided</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if,</b> {{on the anniversary of}} his excommunication, he still lay under the ban, the throne should be considered vacant. At the same time they decided to invite Gregory VII to Augsburg to decide the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Lambert left ABC, {{spending}} a year working as the personal assistant to American television producer David Susskind at the independent production company Talent Associates in New York. Returning to England, she rejoined ABC with an ambition to direct, {{but she got}} stuck as a Production Assistant and <b>decided</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> she could not find advancement within a year, she would abandon television as a career.|$|E
25|$|In a 2011 New Yorker article, {{journalist}} Jane Mayer {{wrote that}} Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, {{on a level}} worse than what President Nixon had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he revealed unclassified information to a reporter, then {{the worst thing that}} would happen to him was probably that he would be fired.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{starts off}} with James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) noticing Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) {{with one of}} his magazines; he {{explains}} that [...] "they share things now."

25|$|When the First Wheeling Convention met, 425 {{delegates from}} 25 {{counties}} were present, but {{a division of}} sentiment soon arose. Some delegates favored the immediate {{formation of a new}} state, while others argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been ratified or become effective, such action would constitute revolution against the United States. It was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the ordinance were adopted (of which there was little doubt) another convention including the members-elect of the legislature should meet at Wheeling in June 1861.|$|E
25|$|Chris Jericho {{was granted}} a rematch for the United States Championship against Kevin Owens at Payback. He was then {{attacked}} backstage by Owens and Samoa Joe. Jericho was subsequently replaced in a tag team match by the returning Finn Bálor. On the April 11 episode of SmackDown, the Superstar Shake-up moved Owens to SmackDown, but it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Jericho won the United States Championship at Payback, he would also move to SmackDown. Also, Seth Rollins resumed his rivalry with Samoa Joe and the two were scheduled to fight at Payback.|$|E
25|$|When {{the monastic}} Elders {{living in the}} desert heard about Simeon, who had chosen a new and strange form of asceticism, they wanted to test him to {{determine}} whether his extreme feats were founded in humility or pride. They decided to order Simeon under obedience to {{come down from the}} pillar. They <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he disobeyed, they would forcibly drag him to the ground, but if he was willing to submit, they were to leave him on his pillar. St Simeon displayed complete obedience and humility, and the monks told him to stay where he was.|$|E
50|$|While {{they wait}} for João Carneiro at Rita's house, Damião tells jokes to the girls. In one of them, a slave named Lucrécia (Loo-kreh-see-a), is distracted from her work.

Barry visits Terry, who, to Barry's surprise, stays loyal to Simon.|$|R
25|$|On March 8, 1895, the Montreal Victorias won the 1895 AHAC {{title and}} thus the Stanley Cup, after {{finishing}} {{the season with a}} 6–2 record. However, a challenge game was scheduled earlier for the next day between the previous year's champion Montreal HC and the squad from Queen's University, which was then part of the Ontario Hockey Association. Thus, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC would eventually win the game, 5–1, and their crosstown rivals were crowned the champions.|$|E
25|$|Some delegates led by John S. Carlile {{favored the}} {{immediate}} {{formation of a}} new state, while others led by Waitman Willey argued that, as Virginia's secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum (as happened on May 23), such action would constitute revolution against the United States. The convention <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Virginians adopted the secession ordinance (of which there was little doubt), another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in Wheeling in June 1861. On May 23, 1861, secession was ratified by a large majority in Virginia as a whole, but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the Ordinance.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Inglis <b>decided</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> {{he was to}} {{encourage}} the young men of his village {{to sign up for}} the army, he would also have to volunteer.
