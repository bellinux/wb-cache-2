I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and {{it was clear to me}} that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Rousseau {{is named}} after French-Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Although Rousseau is French, actress Mira Furlan is Croatian, which led to {{speculation}} that Rousseau is not really from France. In one of the official Lost podcasts, producer Carlton Cuse joked, [...] "any French woman who speaks with a Croatian accent and {{has been living in}} the woods for sixteen years eating bugs ... has got some issues, and those issues need to be overcome before she can actually go and embrace Alex". Furlan understood Rousseau's decision to not meet her daughter, believing that no one can ever be prepared <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> Furlan met Raymonde for the first time just minutes before shooting their reunion scene in the season three finale. The actors believed the scene to be a [...] "huge moment" [...] for their characters, which Furlan described as a [...] "basic human moment." [...] Furlan was glad to have [...] "such a beautiful partner," [...] and noted their physical resemblance.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is presumed}} to be a fictionalized account, as Moe Howard wasn't present <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> in March 1928, having [...] "retired" [...] from show {{business}} in July 1925 to go into real estate with his mother. He {{did not return to}} performing and Ted's act until December 1928. [...] Fine's backstage visitors that day were Ted Healy, Shemp Howard and Bobby Pinkus.|$|E

2500|$|... "Marry Me" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} overall single off the album (second single in the U.S.). The song made its US radio premiere on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on August 26, 2013. It {{was released}} to all digital retailers on the same day. The song's accompanying music video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on September 23, 2013. The video also features Derulo's longtime girlfriend Jordin Sparks who appeares in the video due to Derulo writing the song about her. When speaking of the song Derulo said [...] "Marry Me {{is one of those}} very pulling heart strings kind of record, it’s very different than [...] "The Other Side" [...] … Basically it’s talking about getting ready <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> when I ask you to marry me". The song has since peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and number 8 on the ARIA top 40 singles.|$|E
2500|$|His {{family and}} entourage {{did not really}} approve his {{marriage}} to a French older woman, when he was promised to his cousin Zouiten. His brother Mahmoud, even though opposed to this union, helped him by inviting his family live {{with him in his}} house in Le Kram. Bourguiba settled with his wife and son into his brother's home while this one abandoned his wedding plans. That very year, their sister Nejia Bouzgarou lost her husband who died and joined her brothers temporarily with her four children. Even though he liked being surrounded by his family, Mathilde was not pleased with their situation and urged her husband to move out. So they did, settling in Tunis downtown once again, where they lived till 1933. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> Bourguiba was not interested in politics but rather work, lodging and family. One of his closest friends stated that his main ambition at the time was to [...] "settle down" [...] and that he acquired a certain maturity and autonomy since he was no more dependent on his brothers.|$|E
60|$|As {{she sounded}} the last {{notes of the}} accompaniment Juliet Bingham burst {{into the room with}} somehow the effect to Langbourne of having lain in wait outside <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} was never answered, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Marnham himself appeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{sentence}} was not concluded, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Dan came up at full speed.|$|R
60|$|Paul was right, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Captain Grady {{appeared}} at the stockade gate, gun in hand.|$|R
60|$|But <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> she {{had been}} moved. He was {{convinced}} of it, and his first feeling was of exultation as in an achievement. I don't {{know what you are}} doing just now, Lady Pippinworth, but my compliments to you, and T. Sandys is swelling.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} {{effect of this}} blood was that he said something more about the book, a promise, a definite promise. He could never recall his exact words, but their intention was binding. He conveyed his absolute acquiescence with Benham's wishes whatever they were. His life <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> was unreservedly at his friend's disposal....|$|E
60|$|The boy's {{eyes had}} lighted with {{pleasure}} as I spoke, and I saw him glance from his rusty trappings to the magnificence of my own. For {{a moment he}} stood in thought before he spoke, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> my heart fairly ceased beating--so much for me there was which hung upon the substance of his answer.|$|E
60|$|Sam ceased {{speaking}} very suddenly, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{the sound}} of distress came with great distinctness.|$|R
60|$|Honora did not reply. <b>For</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{they drew}} up at a carpet {{stretched}} across the pavement.|$|R
60|$|They hastily {{turned their}} eyes away, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{they could not}} bear to see each other.|$|R
60|$|But the Pawnee hesitated, only <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> Raising {{the other}} hand, like lightning, the {{tomahawk}} {{flashed in the}} air, and Weucha sunk to his feet, brained to the eye. Then cutting a way with the bloody weapon, he darted through the opening, left by the frightened women, and seemed to descend the declivity at a single bound.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Selingman sat quite {{still in}} his chair. Some signs of a change which came to him {{occasionally}} were visible in his face. He was <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> no longer the huge, overgrown schoolboy bubbling over with the joy and appetite of life. His face seemed to have resolved itself into sterner lines. It was {{the face of a}} thinker.|$|E
60|$|Slower {{and slower}} came his sentences, {{and as the}} last word died away he was heard to be asleep, {{breathing}} through a tiny hole left beneath the eave of his moustache. Hilary, who had waited <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> gently put the manuscript on the desk, and beckoned to the girl. He did not ask her to his study, but spoke {{to her in the}} hall.|$|E
60|$|Aziel made no reply, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Sakon {{turned to}} speak with him, {{and his face was}} anxious.|$|R
60|$|Matt got no farther, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> a loud cry {{upon the}} street drowned out every other sound.|$|R
60|$|I {{held him}} tighter, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> a great wave had broken over us. I dreaded nothing but separation.|$|R
60|$|Berenice was silent. Into {{her face}} there had come a sudden gravity. Mannering, glancing towards her, {{was at once}} {{conscious}} of the change. He saw the weariness so often and zealously repressed, the ageing of her face, the sudden triumph of the despair which in the quiet moments chilled her heart. It {{seemed to him that}} <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> they had come into some closer communion. He bent over towards her.|$|E
60|$|Bertha stood pale at {{the foot}} of the bed, quivering and helpless, despairing of devices, like a cunning animal whose hiding-places are {{surrounded}} by swift-advancing flame. Even Meunier looked paralysed; life <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> ceased to be a scientific problem to him. As for me, this scene seemed of one texture with the rest of my existence: horror was my familiar, and this new revelation was only like an old pain recurring with new circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|Nick {{looked at}} him with a moment's fixedness while he {{polished}} the palette; and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> he felt the temptation to reply: [...] "There's a way you could do that, to a considerable extent--I think you guess it--which wouldn't be intrinsically disagreeable." [...] But the impulse passed without expressing itself in speech, and he simply brought out; [...] "You can make this all clear to Biddy when she comes, and she'll make it clear to my mother." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped as}} if transfixed, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> she {{caught sight of}} Charlie and his mother through the open door.|$|R
60|$|He was {{checked in}} the {{utterance}} of a ferocious oath, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> he encountered the grave eye of Number 666.|$|R
60|$|Whether he recaptured {{it or not}} Lawrence {{never found}} out, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> a subject of greater {{interest}} claimed his attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} to Lockleigh again," [...] said Miss Molyneux, very sweetly, to Isabel, {{ignoring}} this remark of Isabel's friend. Isabel looked into her quiet eyes a moment, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> seemed to see in their grey depths the reflexion of everything she had rejected in rejecting Lord Warburton--the peace, the kindness, the honour, the possessions, a deep security and a great exclusion. She kissed Miss Molyneux and then she said: [...] "I'm afraid I can never come again." ...|$|E
60|$|How strangely Gale {{felt when}} he {{received}} into his hands a flat oblong box! Was it only {{the influence of the}} Yaqui, or was there a nameless and unseen presence beside that grave? Gale could not be sure. But he knew he had gone back to the old desert mood. He knew something hung in the balance. No accident, no luck, no debt-paying Indian could account wholly <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> Gale knew he held in his hands more than gold.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{ended the}} {{discourse}} <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment.</b> Peter was not fond of much talking, {{when he had}} not his great object in view, but rather kept his mind occupied in observation. For the next hour, every one in and about Castle Meal was engaged in the usual morning avocations, that of breaking their fasts included; {{and then it was}} understood that all were to go forth to meet the chiefs, that le Bourdon might give a specimen of his craft.|$|E
60|$|And Andor, who had paused <b>for</b> <b>that</b> brief <b>moment</b> in his voluble talk, went {{rambling}} on.|$|R
60|$|His remark was needless, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> the sleigh {{turned over}} a ledge {{of rock and}} pitched its {{occupants}} into a snow-drift.|$|R
60|$|The hunter did {{not finish}} his sentence, <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{he caught sight}} of the {{recumbent}} form of Wapaw in the camp.|$|R
