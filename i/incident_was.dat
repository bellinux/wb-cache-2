5|$|Ron Fournier {{from the}} National Journal said the <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> a {{reflection}} of how Veterans Affairs was failing soldiers suffering from PTSD. Fournier also commented on how {{media coverage of the}} <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> largely ignoring the fact that Gonzalez was a war veteran with mental health issues.

30|$|The {{prediction}} model must adopt incomplete information because when an <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> reported, {{only part of}} the information on the <b>incident</b> can <b>be</b> obtained for <b>incident</b> duration prediction and even until the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> cleared. Obtaining all the information that influences the traffic <b>incident</b> duration time <b>is</b> impossible. For example, if no traffic detector is present near the incident location, then obtaining the volume of traffic that passes through the <b>incident</b> location <b>is</b> almost impossible. Thus, the traffic incident duration {{prediction model}} to be developed should have the ability to consider incidents with incomplete information.|$|R
