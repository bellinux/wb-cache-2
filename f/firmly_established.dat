5|$|Coenwulf was {{the last}} of a series of Mercian kings, {{beginning}} with Penda in the early 7th century, to exercise dominance over most or all of southern England. In the years after his death, Mercia's position weakened, and the battle of Ellendun in 825 <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> Egbert of Wessex as the dominant king south of the Humber.|$|E

5|$|This period saw a {{significant}} expansion in Georgia Tech's postgraduate education programs, which received substantial {{support from the}} EES. Despite its slow start, with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became <b>firmly</b> <b>established.</b> In 1952 alone, around 80students earned graduate degrees while working at EES.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Roskilde became a market town but it was {{certainly}} enjoying trading privileges under King Eric II who reigned from 1134 to 1137. These privileges were <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> when the Roskilde City Council granted market town status to other towns on Zealand on 15 June 1268. By that time, {{it was probably the}} largest and most important town in Denmark. In 1370, the city owned 2,600 farms throughout Zealand.|$|E
5|$|La Peau de chagrin <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> Balzac as {{a writer}} of {{significance}} in France. His social circle widened significantly, and he was sought eagerly by publishers for future projects. The book served as the catalyst {{for a series of}} letters he exchanged with a Polish baroness named Ewelina Hańska, who later became his wife. It also inspired Giselher Klebe's opera Die tödlichen Wünsche.|$|E

5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is <b>firmly</b> <b>established,</b> especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Nothhelm {{oversaw the}} {{reorganisation}} of the Mercian dioceses {{which took place}} in 737. The archbishop consecrated Witta as Bishop of Lichfield and Totta as Bishop of Leicester. The diocese of Leicester was <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> by this action, although earlier attempts had been made to establish a bishopric there. In 738, Nothhelm was a witness on the charter of Eadberht I, the King of Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Denmark has {{its origins in}} the Viking period, richly revealed by archaeological finds. It became <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country.

5|$|While the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) of nodosaurids {{have not}} been <b>firmly</b> <b>established,</b> the genera Sauropelta, Silvisaurus and Pawpawsaurus are sometimes considered to be basal to geologically younger nodosaurids like Panoplosaurus, Edmontonia, and Animantarx. In a 2001 analysis, Carpenter included the former three genera in a sister clade to a group containing the latter three, although he found that Panoplosaurus could belong to either clade, depending which taxa and characters were chosen.|$|E
5|$|A {{formative}} {{experience for}} Ramsey {{during his first}} peacetime season was playing for Southampton against Manchester City in April 1947. Playing at full-back for City was the 38-year-old Sam Barkas, a former England international {{near the end of}} his last season. Ramsey was greatly impressed by Barkas's positional sense and accurate passing, and adopted him as a role model. The following season, 1947–48, Ramsey <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> himself ahead of Ellerington in the Southampton team, and was the only player at the club to appear in all 42 League matches.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became <b>firmly</b> <b>established.</b>|$|E

5|$|Belisarius {{returned}} to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer {{to enjoy a}} triumph, while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, {{and it was not}} until 548 that peace was restored and Roman government <b>firmly</b> <b>established.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been <b>firmly</b> <b>established</b> in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 13th century, royal {{authority}} over Suffolk had been <b>firmly</b> <b>established,</b> after Henry II crushed the Bigods in the revolt of 1173–1174, Orford being heavily garrisoned during the conflict, with 20 knights being based there. Upon the collapse of the rebellion, Henry ordered the permanent confiscation of Framlingham Castle. The political importance of Orford Castle diminished after Henry's death in 1189, although the port of Orford grew in importance, however, handling more trade than the more famous port of Ipswich {{by the beginning of the}} century.|$|E
