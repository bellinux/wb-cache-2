[...] "This [...] is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{for a very long}} time", he later wrote, describing the genesis of a method he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life. After graduating from Los Angeles High School, Bukowski attended Los Angeles City College for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of World War II. He then moved to New York to begin a career as a vagrant blue-collar worker with dreams of becoming a writer.|$|E

In addition, Moore participated in the All-Star Labor Classic. Hoop Scoop named him the 166th {{best player in the}} Class of 2007. On January9,2007, Moore committed to Temple University over the University of Nebraska. He said that he originally wanted {{to move out of the}} city, but Nebraska was simply too far. Ultimately, his relationship with Temple coach Fran Dunphy, who began recruiting Moore at a summer Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) event, proved to be the deciding factor. Moore said that he [...] "not only know what kind of coach 's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be, but he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> turn <b>me</b> into a man." ...|$|R

2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin told me that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> live with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get settled, and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|R

5000|$|Joel Taylor is a Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} racer from Australia.Enter 16-year-old Joel Taylor, who {{has earned}} a Moto125 wildcard into the 2010 Iveco Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at Phillip Island. Spending much of 2010 racing in Spain, the young New South Welshman believes his experience in the hotbed of MotoGP will prepare him for the challenge ahead. [...] "I did the a few rounds of the Spanish 125cc Championship last year and have been doing the entire Championship this year and it’s been a great experience," [...] he said. [...] "The whole time racing and staying over in Spain has been an eye-opener and a lot different from what I’m used to over here. [...] "They take it so much more serious over there, it’s very professional and fans really love it. [...] "The season has been really enjoyable and it’s made me a better rider." [...] The opportunity to race in the same format as Moto125 should give the young gun a leg-up over his opponents, an aspect Taylor believes will stand him in good stead for the three days on track. [...] "In Spain {{they have the same}} format as in the MotoGP championship so I’m used having the long practice sessions and the qualifying," [...] he said. [...] "The racing is very fast and a similar style, so the time I spent in Spain will give me a bit of an advantage."Beginning his road racing career as a 13-year-old in 2007, Taylor has progressed through the ranks at an amazing rate, which is testament to his skill and hard work. Moving to the 125cc class in 2009 was the biggest move of his short career, but strong performances in Spain and a solid showing at Phillip Island could see the whirlwind ride continue for Taylor. [...] "I’ve moved through the ranks fairly quickly, but I think <b>going</b> over <b>to</b> Spain <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> with adapting <b>to</b> the level of competition and overcoming difficulties," [...] he said. This maturity at his tender age is something Taylor prides himself on, but you can still hear his boyish enthusiasm shine through when he talks about his upcoming date at Phillip Island. [...] "It’s a dream come true to race in front of a home crowd," [...] he said. [...] "I’ve dreamed about this and aspired to race at a MotoGP. [...] "It’s a great opportunity to show my talents and perform {{to the best of my}} ability. [...] "Hopefully I can turn a few heads and make people take notice of the Aussie riders."Taylor has been earmarked for stardom for some time now and his involvement in the recent AIS/MA training camp in Canberra confirmed this. Enjoying the chance to train and live in an elite environment, Taylor said the camp gave him the motivation to take his riding and professionalism to the next level. [...] "I took a lot out of the camp and realised just how professional you have to be to make it at the highest level," [...] he said. With a supportive family and strong team behind him, the BRP Racing Team rider is set to make waves in Phillip Island.The 2010 Iveco Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix will be held at Phillip Island from 15-17 October.|$|R
