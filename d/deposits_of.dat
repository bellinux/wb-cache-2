5|$|Commercially viable natural <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> {{graphite}} {{occur in}} many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in China, India, Brazil and North Korea. Graphite deposits are of metamorphic origin, found in association with quartz, mica and feldspars in schists, gneisses and metamorphosed sandstones and limestone as lenses or veins, sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. <b>Deposits</b> <b>of</b> graphite in Borrowdale, Cumberland, England were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, pencils were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.|$|E

Two species, one living and one extinct, have been recovered from the Talara Tar Seeps in northern coastal Peru.

The tar seeps have been dated at 13,900 years old. The American white ibis is still found in Peru.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> {{the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines. Copper {{was the most}} {{important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. <b>Deposits</b> <b>of</b> decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty.

5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> red tholins.|$|E
