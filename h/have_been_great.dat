5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> if a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not think so. She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels she could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Krichell focused on Ivy League pitchers, saying he {{preferred}} signing pitchers who could think. From Harvard University, he signed Charlie Devens later saying he could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> had {{he continued to}} play baseball, and from Yale University, he scouted pitcher Johnny Broaca {{who seemed to be}} heading for stardom after winning 12 games in his first three seasons with the Yankees, but suddenly retired to become a professional boxer. In 1935, a local scout who worked with Krichell placed Long Island University pitcher Marius Russo in a semi-professional team. When Krichell deemed Russo ready, he signed with the Yankees for $750, twice becoming a 14-game winner and being an All-Star in 1941 before injuring his arm. Other Krichell signings from this period included Johnny Murphy, Hank Borowy and Johnny Allen. Murphy, a relief pitcher and four time saves leader, was signed while still in high school in the Bronx and at Krichell's behest, the Yankees followed Murphy's education at Fordham University, where he gained baseball experience. Krichell signed Borowy from Fordham University for $8,500 and the player later became the ace for the Yankees during the wartime era. Krichell supposedly discovered Allen by a chance encounter when Allen worked as a desk clerk at a Sanford hotel. The story said he recognized Krichell as a scout, told him that he was a pitcher, and that he wanted to try out. Krichell agreed, and impressed by Allen's ability, signed him to a minor league contract. However, in an interview with J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News, Krichell said while he signed Allen, he did not discover him.|$|E

Until {{the establishment of the}} Command, responsibility for the home front fell under the Civilian Defense’s Chief Officer Corps Command and under Regional Defense.

25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the vernier engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} 50 years there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> changes toward gender {{equality}} in industrialised {{nations such as}} the United States of America. With the feminist movement of the 1960s, women began to enter the workforce in great numbers. Women had also had high labor market participation during World War II as so many male soldiers were away, women had to take up jobs to support their family and keep their local economy on track. Many of these women dropped right {{back out of the}} labor force when the men returned home from war to raise children born in the generation of the baby boomers. In the late 1960s when women began entering the labor force in record numbers, they were entering in addition to all of the men, as opposed to substituting for men during the war. This dynamic shift from the one-earner household to the two-earner household dramatically changed the socioeconomic class system of industrialised nations in the post-war period.|$|E

[...] "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. [...] "I've never had a director do that for me." [...] Shyamalan wanted a [...] "singularity" [...] tone for the music. [...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, and it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great,</b> {{but there is something}} about the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked. [...] "It's definitely more misterioso." ...|$|E
500|$|Subsequent issues also {{performed}} well, requiring additional printings to satisfy demand. The series took a planned one-month hiatus after the fifth issue, which also needed a reprint, {{to release the}} first paperback collection. During the break, Image offered an extra 10% discount to retailers who increased their orders by 125% {{in an effort to}} bring orders in line with demand and eliminate the costs associated with additional printings. In January 2013, the Phantom group, retailers who commission exclusive covers to provide further attention to series they believe deserve more support, selected Revival {{to be part of the}} [...] project. Under the Phantom label, the first ten issues were reprinted with new interlocking cover art by Frison. They were only available at stores operated by the retail group. When asked about the book's success in a January 2014 interview, Seeley said [...] "We live and die by word-of-mouth, and so far, the readers and the comic press <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> about spreading the word about our very unusual and unique comic book." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>great</b> to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create.
