40|$|In this thesis, four {{fluid flow}} systems are studied {{in terms of}} their development, venting activity, and {{relation}} to past and current climate warming periods. The studies were accomplished by using a variety of geophysical methods, including 2 D and 3 D seismic, sidescan sonar, and sediment echosounder methods, as well as heat flow measurements, geochemical analyses, and numerical modelling. The first case study presents a <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> early in its development, located north of the Knipovich Ridge on the western Svalbard margin. Gas hydrates in this region are more widespread {{than anywhere else in the}} eastern North Atlantic, indicating a substantial gas reservoir. The origin of the gas is discussed, as are the source rock potential on the Svalbard margin and the role of the Knipovich Ridge with respect to thermogenic gas production. Case study 2 focuses on a more developed <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system,</b> the Giant Gjallar Vent in the Norwegian Sea. This vent system is one of the largest in the North Atlantic and is characterised by two prominent conduits that terminate beneath the seabed. Based on new seismic data, the activity history of the vent is re-interpreted and implications on the future development of this structure are discussed. Case study 3 deals with a deviation from the classic fluid flow system: on the upper continental margin offshore Svalbard, fluid venting occurs without fluid conduits being present, as the reservoir crops out at the seabed. Seepage is linked to dissociation of gas hydrates, which is caused by seasonal fluctuations of bottom-water temperatures. The onset of periodic gas hydrate formation and dissociation is constrained from carbonate samples and discussed with respect to ongoing decadal-scale global warming. The fourth case study looks at cold seeps on the Hikurangi Margin offshore New Zealand, which represent a fully developed <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system.</b> Seafloor expressions imaged with sidescan sonar fall into four distinct types of backscatter pattern.

During regional low- to medium-temperature metamorphism in which <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> is driven by broad thermal or mechanical gradients, <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> rates are (on average) < 10 − 8 m/s, and are limited by restricted permeabilities and gentle gradients in hydraulic head. In contrast, coseismic <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> rates in major fault zones may reach ≥ 10 ^− 2 m/s.

40|$|The recent {{progress}} in the chemical industry is now forcing engineers and physicists to get to deal with control-oriented modeling of material properties on microscopic scale inside reactors {{in order to build}} more efficient chemical plants. The control-oriented modeling provides a new way of thinking about the purposes of models in the chemical industry, the relationships between the material properties inside the chemical reactors, and the level of details needed for control designs. The main objective of this thesis is to offer the physics, chemical, and control communities a unified set of rules and conditions for the control-oriented microscopic modeling of fluid systems in the chemical industry. The work presented in this thesis includes not only the physics of fluid systems and first principle models, but also suggests requirements for developing causal input/output structures and spatially distributed control designs. The first part of this thesis concerns the problem of the microscopic modeling of a <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> and the requirements needed to obtain a control-oriented model of the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system.</b> The derivation of the control-oriented model can be a rather demanding task {{due to the fact that}} the dynamics of a particular flow regime have to be determined explicitly. In order to demonstrate the flow control, a single-phase flow system in simple geometry, such as a lid-driven cavity case, is considered. The complexity of the single-phase flow model is illustrated using the Navier-Stokes equations and different discretization methods. The conventional approach to the microscopic fluid flow model involves fine discretization of the microscopic model in order to obtain microstates which can be manipulated and measured. However, the microstates give a very detailed picture of the fluid flow that, in many cases, is not directly measurable. Therefore, different modeling scales have to be considered for designing spatially distributed control strategies for the single-phase flow. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the different modeling scales for the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system,</b> a macroscopic output regulation is studied on the lid-driven cavity case, which has a broad range of industrial applications. The second part of this thesis deals with the problem of deriving a control-oriented model of a two-phase <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system,</b> which is complementary to the single-phase flow model given in the first part of the thesis. In essence, the control-oriented two-phase flow modeling namely means deriving a simplified model that is available from the first principles and to examine the dominant dynamics. The control-oriented model of the two-phase flow investigates the possibility of identifying different flow regimes inside a bubble column reactor, where the fluid is injected at different locations of the reactor. Besides being useful for control, the control-oriented model of the two-phase flow inside the bubble column also suggest new reactor designs based on the most efficient actuation strategies. Following a wide range of possible actuation structures for the two-phase fluid flow, different spatially distributed control designs for the two-phase flow inside the bubble column reactor are suggested in this thesis. The spatially distributed control strategies can be successfully used to stabilize or destabilize the two-phase flow around a desired two-phase flow regime. In general, the stabilization or destabilization of the fluid flow plays a crucial role in designing efficient and sustainable processes that rely on the manipulation of hydrodynamics. The spatially distributed control designs of the single-phase and two-phase flow systems presented in this thesis suggest more efficient reactor designs and new developments in the process intensification in the chemical industry.

40|$|Within the Ionian zone, which {{belongs to}} the {{external}} Albanide fold and thrust belt, a surface reservoir analogue was studied {{with the aim of}} unravelling the processes which exert an effect on the dual porosity network. Matrix porosity preservation in the Cretaceous to Eocene carbonate turbidite beds relates to early cementation, where the presence of a mixture of micritic and mono-crystalline bioclasts (crinoids and rudists) controls the framework-stabilising development of cements. The presence of these cements explains why these lithologies have not been entirely compacted las happened for the overlying micrite-dominated lithologies). The underlying bioclast-rich layers also do not possess any porosity since they were entirely cemented. Present-day oil production is mainly fracture-related. Several vein generations have been recognised as well as other tectonic features such as conjugate high-angle or tension joints and stylolites. With respect to the latter, bed parallel (i,e. compactional) and bed perpendicular (i. e. layer parallel shortening or tectonic) stylolites have been differentiated. The spatial relationships between these stylolites and the veins allow differentiation of pre-, syn- and post-kinematic fluid fluxes, which have been characterised based on their petrographical (i. e. cathodoluminescence), geochemical (trace and stable isotope) and fluid inclusion features. This exercise shows that the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> was rock buffered until the folding and thrusting period. From then onwards the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> reflects the interaction with fluids which reacted with evaporites which occur as decollement horizons as well as fluid flow systems in relation to the maturation of hydrocarbons.

Methane gas flares have been recorded {{in the water column}} of SW Spitsbergen and on the continental margin of west Spitsbergen, indicating recent active seepage processes. Geochemical analysis of hydrocarbon anomalies in near-surface marine sediments around west Spitsbergen and Isfjorden have indicated a mixture of biogenic and thermogenic signatures. Isfjorden is the largest fjord system in west Spitsbergen, where pockmarks have been described earlier. However, the subsurface <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> processes and <b>systems</b> are not well understood. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} these <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> in Isfjorden, it is necessary to study the geological factors affecting the distribution of shallow gas in the marine sediments and occurrence of pockmarks. This study systematically maps the spatial distribution and morphometry of pockmarks on high-resolution bathymetric data from Isfjorden. It further presents an integrated geophysical study of high-resolution shallow acoustic data along with 2 D multichannel seismic data, magnetic data, borehole data, DEM from LiDAR scan, and geological maps, to investigate the geological controls on the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>systems</b> in selected areas. Pockmark depressions and pockmark-like features of various sizes and shapes, and submarine landforms related to glacial activities and other processes were identified across the whole study area. Subsurface seep-related acoustic features such as, enhanced reflections, acoustic blanking and turbidity zones were recorded on new high-resolution subbottom acoustic data; suggesting possible shallow gas occurrences in the marine sediments beneath the seep-related seafloor features. Mushroom shaped acoustic plumes were imaged in the water column in Nordfjorden, indicating suspected shallow gas escape from the seafloor.

These features occasionally form ridges at the seafloor where pockmarks in high-density and other seep-related acoustic features have been identified.

A popular measure of the fairness achieved by packet schedulers is the relative fairness bound (RFB) which captures the maximum possible difference between the normalized service received by any two flows. However, in the actions taken at packet transmission boundaries, currently known schedulers have generally used a goal other than explicitly reducing the RFB; for example, WFQ seeks to achieve the same order of packet transmissions as in an ideally fair <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system.</b> In this report, we present Greedy Fair Queueing (GrFQ), a novel scheduler that explicitly incorporates the goal of achieving a low RFB into the actions of the scheduler. We prove that the RFB achieved by GrFQ is extremely close to that of the best among known fair schedulers and also achieves a better bound on the normalized lag than other known schedulers. The per-packet dequeuing complexity of GrFQ is O(log N) with respect to the number of flows. We use the Gini index as the measure of instantaneous fairness and, using real video traffic traces and real gateway traffic traces, show that the GrFQ scheduler achieves better fairness than any other known scheduler at virtually all instants of time. We further propose a simplified version of the scheduler, called GrFQ-lite, which avoids the emulation of a <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> <b>system</b> and has a per-packet work complexity of O(1) in the computation of the timestamps.
