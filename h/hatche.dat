Having endured great cruelty towards himself and his mother, Memed finally escapes with his beloved, a girl named <b>Hatche.</b> Abdi Agha catches up with the young couple, but only manages to capture <b>Hatche,</b> while Memed is able to avoid his pursuers and runs into the mountains. There he joins a band of brigands and exacts revenge against his old adversary. <b>Hatche</b> was then imprisoned and later dies. When Memed returns to the town, Hatche's mother tells him he has a [...] "women's heart" [...] if he surrenders himself. He instead rides into town to find his enemy, on a horse {{given to him by}} the townspeople. He finds Agha in the south-east corner of his house and shoots him in the breast. The local authorities hear the gunshots, but Memed gets away. Before <b>Hatche</b> dies she gives birth to Memed's son, who is also named Memed. The protagonist then must take care of his son.|$|E

5000|$|Eucerotinae is a {{worldwide}} subfamily of the parasitic wasp family Ichneumonidae {{with only one}} genus, Euceros. [...] Euceros species are hyperparasitoids of Ichneumonoidea. First instar larvae <b>hatche</b> from eggs laid on leaf surfaces, attach to passing Lepidoptera or Symphyta larva and enter the body of an emerging primary endoparasitoid, such as a campoplegine or banchine or an attached ectoparasitoid. The genus has been variously placed in Tryphoninae and Ctenopelmatinae.|$|E
50|$|Chegworth mill is {{probably}} not the Domesday mill recorded at Ulcombe. The first reference to Chegworth occurs in 1200. The first definite reference to this mill was in 1317, when the mill was held by John de Cheggeworth. John de Chageworth was recorded at the mill in 1324. The mill was in the ownership of Sir Cheney Culpeper in 1657. It was then known as the Lower Mill. The previous owners were Thomas <b>Hatche</b> and Richard Austen, who had recently sold the mill at that date. John Pecke was the miller. Seventeenth century millers in Ulcombe include Willia Pettit (1612), Percival Austen (1669), Thomas Sylliborne (1673) and John Baker (1682). It is not known which mill each was at, there being two watermills and a windmill in Ulcombe during this period. William Taylor was the miller in the mid nineteenth century. In 1702, John Feverstone was the miller. The mill was known as Pendmill in 1745 when the miller was recorded as John Feverstour the Elder. John Feverstone the older was the miller in 1766, when the lease was renewed. Richard Tilbe being the owner at this time. Thomas Willett leased the mill in 1792 and in 1800 Chegworth Mill, otherwise Pendmill was mortgaged by Willett. The mill was recorded as Checqworth Mill on the 1801 Ordnance Survey map. John Taylor was the miller in 1847, followed by G Craddock in 1852, J Gilbert, William and Thomas Taylor in 1854, Mrs M Cradduck, J Gilbert and Thomas Taylor 1855 - 1861, Charles Wicks in 1874, Alfred Wick 1895 - 1907, Frederick James Potter 1930 - 1934. The last miller was Ted Uren, who started at the mill in 1961, and took over from Harold Potter. The mill was house converted c.1990.|$|E

The last miller was Ted Uren, who started at the mill in 1961, and took over from Harold Potter. The mill was house converted c.1990.The present mill was a corn mill and worked until the late 1960s. It has an overshot waterwheel of 10 ft diameter and 7 ft wide, made by Weeks of Maidstone. The axle is cast iron and 7+1/2 in square. The pit wheel is cast iron with 96 lignum vitae cogs. The cast iron upright shaft carries a cast iron wallower with 38 teeth and a cast iron Great Spur Wheel with 104 cogs. It powered three pairs of millstones. One pair are French Burr stones (by Hughes & Son of Dover and London) of 44 in diameter, one pair are Peak stones of 46 in diameter and the third pair have a Peak runner stone on a French Burr bedstone, both 42 in diameter. The Crown Wheel drove two layshafts, which powered various machines including a [...] "Ureka" [...] winnower and an oat crusher by Ganz & Co., of Budapest, Hungary. A saw bench outside the mill was also driven by belts & pulleys. The sack hoist is driven {{from the top of}} the upright shaft.|$|E

40|$|A simple model {{relating}} habitat {{features to}} a diapause egg bank Abstract—As {{a way to}} escape from adverse conditions, many zooplankton populations produce diapausing eggs that accumulate in the sediments and hatch when suitable environmental conditions are restored. While buried in the sediment, diapausing eggs may be affected by several processes (i. e., production, hatching, deterioration, and loss). We present a simple mathematical model for the dynamics of diapausing eggs in the sediment. We were mainly inspired by the model organism Brachionus plicatilis, a cyclical parthenogen rotifer, but the model is applicable to other zooplankters. Three diapausing egg categories are used as variables in our model: (1) healthy-looking eggs, assumed to represent the fraction of viable eggs; (2) deteriorated eggs, considered unviable; and (3) <b>hatche...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Author 2016. The Sacramento splittail (Pogonichthys macrolepidotus) is a minnow {{endemic to}} the highly {{modified}} San Francisco Estuary of California, USA {{and its associated}} rivers and tributaries. This species is composed of two genetically distinct populations, which, according to field observations and otolith strontium signatures, show largely allopatric distribution patterns as recently hatched juveniles. Juvenile Central Valley splittail are found primarily in the nearly fresh waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and their tributaries, whereas San Pablo juveniles {{are found in the}} typically higher-salinity waters (i. e. up to 10 ‰) of the Napa and Petaluma Rivers. As the large salinity differences between young-of-year habitats may indicate population-specific differences in salinity tolerance, we hypothesized that juvenile San Pablo and Central Valley splittail populations differ in their response to salinity. In <b>hatche</b> ry-born and wild-caught juvenile San Pablo splittail, we found upper salinity tolerances, where mortalities occurred within 336 h of exposure to 16 ‰ or higher, which was higher than the upper salinity tolerance of 14 ‰ for wild-caught juvenile Central Valley splittail. This, in conjunction with slower recovery of plasma osmolality, but not ion levels, muscle moisture or gill Na +,K + -ATPase activity, in Central Valley relative to San Pablo splittail during osmoregulatory disturbance provides some support for our hypothesis of inter-population variation in salinity tolerance and osmoregulation. The modestly improved salinity tolerance of San Pablo splittail is consistent with its use of highersalinity habitats. Although confirmation of the putative adaptive difference through further studies is recommended, this may highlight the need for population-specific management considerations...|$|E
