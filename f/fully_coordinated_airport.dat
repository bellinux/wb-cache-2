40|$|We study, on {{a square}} lattice, an {{extension}} to <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> percolation {{which we call}} iterated <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> percolation. In <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> percolation, sites become occupied if all four of its nearest neighbors are also occupied.

Our results show a substantial enhancement {{in the size of}} highly connected regions after each iteration (from ordinary to <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> and then to iterated <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> percolation). However, using Monte Carlo methods to determine the static critical exponents and normal mode analyses to determine the dynamic critical exponents, our results indicate that the ordinary, <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated,</b> and iterated <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> percolation models belong to the same universality class. This is in contrast to our previous results [*] wherein a different universality class dynamically (but not statically) for <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> percolation was indicated, though the differences in the dynamic exponents were small. A possible cause might be the different methods of generating clusters, i. e., in this work clusters were generated statically in square lattices while in our previous work clusters were grown dynamically, for studying the dynamic critical exponents. * E.

40|$|The {{importance}} of global and regional coordination in conservation is growing, although currently, {{the majority of}} conservation programs are applied at national and subnational scales. Nevertheless, multinational programs incur transaction costs and resources beyond what is required in national programs. Given the need to maximize returns on investment within limited conservation budgets, {{it is crucial to}} quantify how much more biodiversity can be protected by coordinating multinational conservation efforts when resources are fungible. Previous studies that compared different scales of conservation decision-making mostly ignored spatial variability in biodiversity threats and the cost of actions. Here, we developed a simple integrating metric, taking into account both the cost of conservation and threats to biodiversity. We examined the Mediterranean Basin biodiversity hotspot, which encompasses over 20 countries. We discovered that for vertebrates to achieve similar conservation benefits, one would need substantially more money and area if each country were to act independently as compared to <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> action across the Basin. A <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> conservation plan is expected to save approximately US$ 67 billion, 45 % of total cost, compared with the uncoordinated plan; and if implemented over a 10 -year period, the plan would cost ≈ 0. 1 % of the gross national income of all European Union (EU) countries annually. The initiative declared in the recent Paris Summit for the Mediterranean provides a political basis for such complex coordination. Surprisingly, because many conservation priority areas selected are located in EU countries, a partly coordinated solution incorporating only EU-Mediterranean countries is almost as efficient as the <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> scenario...|$|R

40|$|Free-energy {{landscape}} {{theory is}} often used to describe complex molecular systems. Here, a microscopic description of water structure and dynamics based on configuration-space-networks and molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP 4 P/ 2005 model is applied to investigate the free-energy landscape of water. The latter is built on top of a large set of water microstates describing the kinetic stability of local hydrogen-bond arrangements up to the second solvation shell. In temperature space, the landscape displays three different regimes. At around ambient conditions, the free-energy surface is characterized by many short-lived basins of attraction which are structurally well-defined (inhomogeneous regime). At lower temperatures instead, the liquid rapidly becomes homogeneous. In this regime, the free energy is funneled-like, with <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> water arrangements {{at the bottom of the}} funnel. Finally, a third regime develops below the temperature of maximal compressibility (Widom line) where the funnel becomes steeper with few interconversions between microstates other than the <b>fully</b> <b>coordinated</b> ones.

As a pertinent example of our approach we investigate four-connected SiO 2, a fundamentally important network-forming material used in many applications at the nanoscale. Using our method we predict that a structurally complex stability crossover from defective to FC nanoclusters occurs in SiO 2 at a size of ~ 100 atoms. At variance with previous works, based on constructing FC SiO 2 cagelike nanoclusters by hand, we also show that cagelike clusters are only favored for smaller cluster sizes with dense FC topologies becoming energetically favored with increasing system size.

40|$|Trade-credit is a seller's {{short-term}} loan to the buyer, allowing the buyer to delay payment of an invoice. It {{has been the}} largest source of working capital {{for a majority of}} business-to-business firms in the United States. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain trade-credit, mainly from finance perspectives. It has also been an important issue in supply chain management. Surprisingly, most literature in supply chain management has examined the retailer's stocking policies given a supplier's trade-credit. This paper attempts to shed light on trade-credit from a supplier's perspective, and presents it as a tool for supply chain coordination. Specifically, we explicitly assume firms' financial needs for inventory. Following a Newsvendor framework, we assume that the supplier grants trade-credit and markdown allowance. Given the supplier's offer, the retailer determines order quantity and the financing option for the inventory, either trade-credit or direct financing from a financial institution. Our result shows that the supplier's markdown allowance alone cannot <b>fully</b> <b>coordinate</b> the supply chain if the retailer employs direct financing. Positive financing costs call for trade-credit in order to subsidize the retailer's costs of inventory financing. Using trade-credit in addition to markdown allowance, the supplier <b>fully</b> <b>coordinates</b> the retailer's decisions for the largest joint profit, and extracts a greater portion of the maximized joint profit.
