5|$|<b>Glow</b> <b>discharge</b> plasmas: non-thermal plasmas {{generated}} by the application of DC or low frequency RF (<100 kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; {{this is the type}} of plasma generated within fluorescent light tubes.|$|E
5|$|Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): {{similar to}} <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> plasmas, but {{generated}} with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz. These differ from glow discharges {{in that the}} sheaths are much less intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> across the points. Such a <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The minimum voltage for a <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional {{simulations}} of self-organization in dc glow microdischarges are reported. The results describe a mode {{with a normal}} spot and modes with patterns of multiple spots, qualitatively similar to those observed in experiments with microdischarges in xenon. Index Terms—Glow discharge, self-organization, normal discharge. IMPORTANT advances have been achieved in self-consistent modeling of self-organization in gas discharges, such as patterns in DBDs and the normal current density effect in dc <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> (e. g., [1] and [2], respectively). The initial steps toward a self-consistent modeling of self-organization in dc <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> have been taken in [3] and [4]. It was shown that the simplest self-consistent model of <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> ad-mits multiple solutions which exist at the same value of the discharge current. Those of the solutions that are 2 -D (axiall...|$|R

Three independent power supplies were used to produce two <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> within the vacuum reactor. The generation of two <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> and the efficient utilization of the electric fields, by controlling the key process parameters, enabled the production of VACNTs.

25|$|Once {{the tube}} strikes, the {{impinging}} main discharge keeps the cathodes hot, permitting continued electron emission {{without the need}} for the filaments to continue to be heated.

25|$|The {{glass tube}} {{contains}} a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols. Applying power to one cathode surrounds {{it with an}} orange <b>glow</b> <b>discharge.</b> The tube is filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly neon and often a little mercury or argon, in a Penning mixture.|$|E
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> across the {{electrodes}} in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the <b>glow</b> <b>discharge,</b> extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> polymerization) uses plasma {{sources to}} generate a gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a vinyl group, in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{quantification}} of the heating induced by nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> on a lean premixed methane-air flame. The flame, obtained at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, has an M-shape morphology. The equivalence ratio is 0. 95 and the thermal power released by the flame is 113 W. The NRP <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> are produced by high voltage pulses of 10 ns duration, 7 kV amplitude, applied at a repetition frequency of 10 kHz. The average power of the plasma, determined from current and voltage measurements, is 1 W, i. e. about 0. 9 % of the thermal power of the flame. Broadband vibrational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy of nitrogen is {{used to determine the}} temperature of the flame with and without plasma enhancement. The temperature evolution in the flame area shows that the thermal impact of NRP <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> is in the uncertainty range of the technique, i. e., +/- 40 K...|$|R

40|$|Recibido: 18 de abril de 2011; Aceptado: 30 {{de enero}} de 2012) This work {{presents}} a study about {{the evolution of}} titanium oxide particles synthesized with <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> of water and Tetra Titanium Propoxide (TTP). The syntheses involved sequential changes of TTP from solid, liquid and vapor phases under resistive <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> at 13. 56 MHz, 0. 5 - 0. 8 mbar and 100 W with reaction times between 60 and 240 min.

25|$|The rate of {{polymerization}} {{depends on}} input power, until power saturation occurs {{and the rate}} becomes independent of it. A narrower electrode gap also tends to increase polymerization rates because a higher electron density per unit area is formed. Polymerization rates also depend {{on the type of}} apparatus used for the process. In general, increasing the frequency of alternating current <b>glow</b> <b>discharge</b> up to about 5kHz increases the rate due to the formation of more free radicals. After this frequency, inertial effects of colliding monomers inhibit polymerization. This forms the first plateau for polymerization frequencies. A second maximum in frequency occurs at 6MHz, where side reactions are overcome again and the reaction occurs through free radicals diffused from plasma to the electrodes, at which point a second plateau is obtained. These parameters differ slightly for each monomer and must be optimized in-situ.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, while others are not. Even for simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. <b>Glow</b> <b>discharge</b> is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically reactive species, which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The electric discharge process for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E
500|$|Helium has a valence of {{zero and}} is {{chemically}} unreactive under all normal conditions. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As {{with the other}} noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a <b>glow</b> <b>discharge,</b> to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe10, and WHe2, and the molecular ions , , , and [...] have been created this way. HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has {{a large number of}} band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation to}} the mechanism behind self-sustained oscillations of ions in direct current (DC) <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> is provided. Such description is {{distinguished from the}} one provided by the fluid models, where oscillations are attributed to the positive feedback mechanism associated with photoionization of particles and photoemission of electrons from the cathode. Here, oscillations arise as consequence of interaction between an ion and the surface charges induced by it at the bounding electrodes. Such mechanism provides an elegant explanation to why self-sustained oscillations occur only in the negative resistance region of the voltage-current characteristic curve in the DC <b>glow</b> <b>discharges.</b> Furthermore, this alternative description provides an elegant explanation {{to the formation of}} plasma fireballs in the laboratory plasma. It has been found that oscillation frequencies increase with ion's surface charge density, but at the rate which is significantly slower than it does with the electric field. The presented mechanism also describes self-sustained oscillations of ions in dusty plasmas, which demonstrates that self-sustained oscillations in dusty plasmas and DC <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> involve common physical processes.

2500|$|The highest {{possible}} vacuum is desired in a tube. Remaining gas atoms will ionize and conduct electricity between {{the elements in}} an undesired manner.

30|$|The microdischarge {{streamers}} can {{be characterized}} as non-equilibrium weakly ionized plasma channels with futures similar to those of transient high-pressure <b>glow</b> <b>discharges.</b> They initiate when the breakdown electric field is reached. The current flow at the streamer location is terminated within a few ns after breakdown thus the temperature of the ions and neutral species remains close to the room temperature. The individual streamer properties depend on the gas properties, the pressure and the gap spacing. For a given industrial application of DBD, the large spacing between the electrodes is favored because of treatment restrictions. The advantage of the current apparatus is treating the large samples close to the room temperature while the common dielectric barrier <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> suppress the streamers by reducing the electrode gap distances.|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{formation}} in the anode layer at a water electrode in atmospheric pressure <b>glow</b> <b>discharges</b> in air is studied. With increasing current a sequence of different anode spot structures occurs from a constricted homogeneous spot {{in the case of}} small currents to a pattern consisting of small distinct spots for larger currents. The dependence of the number of spots on the current is (18. 5 + 0. 4 N) mA with N the number of spots. The spots group together and form stripe patterns. Disappearance of the spots with increasing conductivity of the electrode seems to indicate that mechanisms of electrical nature govern the phenomenon.
