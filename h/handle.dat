5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide <b>handle</b> released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide <b>handle</b> and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action.

5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator <b>handle</b> could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the <b>handle,</b> the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the <b>handle</b> was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The <b>handle</b> was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{response}} {{describes the}} rate at which a predator consumes prey. <b>Handling</b> time, duration that a predator spends on a captured prey for the consumption, is one of the parameters of many functional response models. Although models typically assume that <b>handling</b> time is static, most empirical studies that directly quantified the relationship between <b>handling</b> time and prey density show that <b>handling</b> time decreases with prey density. In this study, I compare a community model that employs density-dependent <b>handling</b> time and a model with static <b>handling</b> time for their responses to enrichment. The density-dependent <b>handling</b> time is derived by assuming that predators adjust <b>handling</b> time to maximize their fitness. I show that the model with adaptive <b>handling</b> time is more robust to enrichment than the model with static <b>handling</b> time at realistic parameter values. Although community response to enrichment is used as an illustrative example, density-dependent <b>handling</b> time is a common empirical observation and would have general implications to ecological dynamics...|$|R

Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne's main airport was Essendon Airport which was officially {{designated}} an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport and the limitations of Essendon Airport were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to <b>handle</b> the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to <b>handle</b> the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the airport had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon Airport was not possible.|$|E

40|$|Signals are a {{lightweight}} form of interprocess communication in Unix. When a process receives a signal, the control flow is interrupted and a previously installed signal handler is run. Signal <b>handling</b> is reminiscent both of exception <b>handling</b> and concurrent interleaving of processes. In this paper, we investigate {{different approaches to}} formalizing signal <b>handling</b> in operational semantics, and compare them {{in a series of}} examples. We find the big-step style of operational semantics to be well suited to modelling signal <b>handling.</b> We integrate exception <b>handling</b> with our big-step semantics of signal <b>handling,</b> by adopting the exception convention as defined in the Definition of Standard ML. The semantics needs to capture the complex interactions between signal <b>handling</b> and exception <b>handling.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a positive <b>handling</b> had a stress reducing effect on beef cattle. Eight finishing bulls {{were randomly assigned}} to a <b>handling</b> group and a control group. The <b>handling</b> group received 10 times 4 minutes of positive <b>handling,</b> spread over 5 weeks before slaughter. After 5 weeks avoidance distance had decreased in the <b>handling</b> group, but not in the control group. No differences in behaviour were observed during trailer loading. <b>Handled</b> animals showed less stress-indicating behaviour when entering the stunning box. Blood samples were taken before <b>handling</b> sessions and one day before slaughter and during exsanguinations. Cortisol-, lactateand glucose concentrations were elevated in sting blood of all animals. Control animals showed higher lactate and glucose concentrations in sting blood than <b>handled</b> animals. In meat quality tests control animals showed higher cooking losses than <b>handled</b> animals. Those results imply that a calmative <b>handling</b> in the forefront of slaughter can decrease animals’ stress reactions at slaughter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Exception <b>handling</b> is a {{powerful}} mechanisms for dealing with failures at runtime. It simplifies the development of robust programs by allowing the programmer to implement recovery actions and tolerate non-fatal errors. Yet, exception <b>handling</b> is difficult to get right! The complexity of correct exception <b>handling</b> is a major cause for incorrect exception <b>handling.</b> It is therefore important to reduce the complexity of writing exception <b>handling</b> code while, at the same time, making sure it is correct. Our approach is to use atomic blocks for exception <b>handling</b> combined with optional compensation actions.
