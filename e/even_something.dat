25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Oceania, particularly the Outer Party members, {{have no real}} privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way telescreens {{so that they may}} be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, <b>even</b> <b>something</b> so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.|$|E
25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a building part. <b>Even</b> <b>something</b> as simple as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E
2500|$|The episode, usually {{known as}} [...] "of Inês de Castro", {{is one of}} the most famous of Os Lusíadas.

2500|$|In 1992, the United States Library of Congress {{deemed the}} film [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" [...] and {{selected}} it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Despite its controversial story, {{the film has}} been praised by film critics such as Ebert, who said: [...] "The Birth of a Nation {{is not a bad}} film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and <b>even</b> <b>something</b> about evil." [...] The website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% approval rating.|$|E
2500|$|This outlook {{needs to}} be seen within the {{historical}} context of eighteenth century Scotland. Here, the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability {{of a country that}} was deeply politically and religiously divided. Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he does write that a republic must produce laws, while [...] "monarchy, when absolute, contains <b>even</b> <b>something</b> repugnant to law." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the rabbis had {{to reassert}} their {{authority}} {{against those who}} sought to undermine it in general. The main theme underlying most of the lettres sent to Hamburg was not to contend with any specific components of the new worship style, but to deny the Israelite Temple and any attempt to emulate it legitimacy by reinforcing every feature of traditional conduct. The rulings often used arguments {{along the line of}} [...] "the Custom of Israel is Law", and lambasted those who meddled with received forms and sought to abandon the ways of their ancestors. Quotes like [...] "we cannot devise what our fathers did not contemplate", [...] "cursed are those who innovate" [...] and the like permeated the rulings. The most unremitting promulgator of this approach was Moses Sofer, who had long since declared that in an era of growing heresy, even the slightest minutiae of tradition had to be relentlessly upheld against those who sought to challenge rabbinic authority. In 1796, he protested that <b>even</b> <b>something</b> certainly known to be [...] "custom of ignoramuses", prevalent only due to a mistake by the unlearned masses, must not be abrogated.|$|E

2500|$|On April 14, 2012, former Guns N' Roses members Slash, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Steven Adler and Matt Sorum all reunited at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The group {{performed}} [...] "Mr. Brownstone", [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine", and [...] "Paradise City" [...] with Alter Bridge and Slash's band vocalist Myles Kennedy in Rose's absence. Slash {{mentioned in}} an interview that [...] "All things considered, I don't think any of us {{wanted to be a part}} of it initially, didn't think any of us were going to go. It was a thorn in everybody's—well, at least a thorn in my side—because I was busy doing other stuff. When it finally came down to the wire at the very, very, very last-minute—I'm talking about the 11 hours and 30 seconds mark—Axl had pulled out." [...] In the same interview, Slash mentioned the prospects of a reunion, stating [...] "It's not <b>even</b> <b>something</b> I like to dwell on. I don't even like to make comments because you end up with quotes that sometimes exacerbate the issue. I've got other things going on. I'm very, very proud—endlessly proud—of everything the band stood for and everything that's gone on with it." [...] Slash then stated in a July 2012 interview that [...] " [...] will 'never reunite'". In a later interview, former drummer Steven Adler stated that Matt Sorum would not take part in a potential reunion unless Adler was involved. Duff McKagan said in 2015, [...] " [...] could happen, and it could not. And I think it would be wonderful, one day, if we reconciled, first and foremost. That alone would be cool." ...|$|E

60|$|The laboured {{resistance}} which Lady Constantine's judgment {{had offered}} to her rebellious affection ere she learnt {{that she was a}} widow, now passed into a bashfulness that rendered her almost as unstable of mood as before.
