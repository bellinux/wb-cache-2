5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told {{him at the}} start of his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, {{threatened}} to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) {{estimated}} that 20.0 million adults (aged 18–64) gained healthcare coverage via ACA as of February 2016, a 2.4 million increase over September 2015. HHS {{estimated that}} this 20.0 million included: a) 17.7 {{million from the}} start of open enrollment in 2013-2016; and b) 2.3 million young adults aged 19–25 who initially gained insurance from 2010-2013, as they were allowed to remain on their parent's plans until age 26. Of the 20.0 million, an estimated 6.1 million were aged 19–25. Similarly, the Urban Institute issued a report in December 2016 that said that about 19.2 million non-elderly Americans had gained <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> from 2010 to 2015. In March 2016, the CBO reported that there were approximately 27 million people without insurance in 2016, a figure they expected would range from 26-28 million through 2026. CBO also estimated the percentage of insured among all U.S. residents would remain at 90% through that period, 92-93% excluding unauthorized immigrants.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to explore factors and {{contexts}} that influenced and motivated individuals to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, commonly called Obamacare, is also known as the New Mexico <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> Exchange (NMHIX). The study is specifically designed to examine the participants’ lived experiences and opinions regarding the acquisition, or opposition to <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage.</b> I have employed the hermeneutic phenomenological research methodology to conduct this study. Nine self-identified Hispanic residents of the San Miguel County (SMC) participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. The research site for the current study was the SMC located in northern New Mexico (NM). The major findings in this study revealed the following response patterns: (a) participant’s memory of having <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> while growing up was divided among those that had <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> and those who did not have <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> or those who had state supported <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> such as Medicaid; (b) Trusted sources such as family and friends are methods that were used to obtain and learn about the NMHIX; (c) Mandate and penalty assessments for not having the <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> was the number one motivational factor to enrolling in the NMHIX; (d) Participants had more negative experiences than positive in the enrollment process; (e) Nearly 90 % of the respondents felt they have benefited from having <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage,</b> and; (f) The findings revealed that if participants had the authority to change something with <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage,</b> participants would like co-payments and deductibles reduced or eliminated. The results of this research provide a venue to strengthen the implementation of the ACA. In addition, there may be the notion to rethink and systematize ideas that enable and support local communities to operate as health communication channels aiding citizens navigate the optimal use of <b>health</b> care <b>insurance.</b> Family StudiesDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Background: Interaction {{effects of}} poverty and <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> on overall {{survival}} rates of breast cancer among women of color and non-Hispanic white women were explored. Methods: We analyzed California registry data for 2, 024 women of color (black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or other ethnicity) and 4, 276 non-Hispanic white women (Anglo-European ancestries and no Hispanic-Latin ethnic backgrounds) {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} between the years 1996 and 2000 who were then followed until 2011. The 2000 US census categorized rates of neighborhood poverty. <b>Health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> was either private, Medicare, Medicaid, or none. Cox regression was used to model rates of survival. Results: A 3 -way interaction between ethnicity, <b>health</b> care <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage,</b> and poverty was observed. Women of color inadequately insured and living in poor or near-poor neighborhoods in California were the most disadvantaged. Women of color adequately insured and who lived in such neighborhoods in California were also disadvantaged. The incomes of such women of color were typically lower than the incomes of non-Hispanic white women. Conclusions: Women of color with or without <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> are disadvantaged in poor and near-poor neighborhoods of California. Such women may be less able to bare the indirect, direct, or uncovered costs of health care for breast cancer treatment...|$|R
25|$|<b>Health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>coverage</b> is {{provided}} by several public and private sources in the United States. During 2016, the U.S. population overall was approximately 325 million, with 53 million persons 65 {{years of age and}} over covered by the federal Medicare program. The 272 million non-institutional persons under age 65 either obtained their coverage from employer-based (155 million) or non-employer based (90 million) sources, or were uninsured (27 million). Approximately 15 million military personnel received coverage through the Veteran's Administration.
