5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} {{provides the}} benefits to each participating family through a <b>debit</b> <b>card,</b> which replaced the physical cheques in the early 2000s. The monthly benefit is deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a cash benefit. The EBT <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> system has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac that {{separate}} Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form {{the connection between}} Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, {{unlike the rest of}} the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas {{and said he had}} to get something in the trunk of his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake <b>debit</b> <b>card.</b> Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the legal}} frameworks governing consumer {{protection in the}} area of online payments made by <b>debit</b> and credit <b>cards</b> in the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and the United States. The relevant legal provisions of the European Union are analysed as well. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter deals with consumer protection {{in the area of}} online payments made by <b>debit</b> <b>cards.</b> This chapter focuses on the liability for any unauthorized payment transactions made by <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> and the cases of no consumer's liability, limited consumer's liability and unlimited consumer's liability are discussed there. It is also concerned with the issues of authorization of payment transactions made by <b>debit</b> <b>cards,</b> the limitations on the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards,</b> specific obligations of both the consumer and the payment provider concerning the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards,</b> the burden of proof and notification of unauthorized payment transactions made by <b>debit</b> <b>cards.</b> Finally, the legal frameworks of countries mentioned above dealing with consumer protection in the area of online payments made by <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> are compared.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of credit and <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> on the {{currency}} in circulation by using GMM estimation.

As expected from the theory, we find that an increase in the usage of credit and <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> leads to a decrease in the currency demand. Moreover, the usage of the <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> has a bigger effect on the money demand, compared to the usage of the credit cards. We also find that the effect of credit cards is mostly through purchases and the effect of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> is mostly through withdrawals...|$|R

5|$|On January 25, 2017, Baker {{proposed}} a $40.5 billion state budget {{for fiscal year}} 2018, and on March 9, 2017, legislative hearings began to review it. Tax changes proposed in Baker's 2018 budget proposal include extending the state sales tax to online retailers without physical storefronts or offices in-state, a requirement that credit card companies send a 1099 tax form to individuals earning more than $600 from credit and <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> transactions, extending the state's hotel tax to room-sharing services and individuals who rent out rooms for more than 150 days a year, and a $2,000-per-employee assessment on employers that do not offer health insurance to counter spending growth in the state Medicaid program, MassHealth. Spending increases to MassHealth, local government and local education aid, higher education (including $78 million towards repairs of the University of Massachusetts Boston underground parking garage), an anti-opioid trafficking program and substance abuse services, homelessness prevention, improvement in clinical services at Bridgewater State Hospital, the Department of Children and Families to hire more case workers, a job retraining fund, an MBTA subsidy, and increasing state tax credits to businesses that hire unemployed military veterans {{are included in the}} proposal.|$|E
5|$|The bank's origins {{date back}} to 1658 with the {{foundation}} of Smith's Bank of Nottingham. The creation of the modern bank was announced in 1968, and National Westminster Bank Limited commenced trading on 1 January 1970, after the statutory process of integration had been completed in 1969. The famous three arrowheads symbol was adopted as the new bank's logo; {{it is said to}} symbolise either the circulation of money in the financial system or the bank's three constituents, National Provincial Bank, Westminster Bank, and District Bank (established 1829): the latter had been taken over by National Provincial Bank in 1962 and was allowed to operate under its own name until the formation of National Westminster Bank. The District, National Provincial, and Westminster Banks were fully integrated in the new firm's structure, but Coutts & Co. private bankers (a 1920 National Provincial acquisition, established 1692), Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland (a 1917 Westminster acquisition, established 1836) and the Isle of Man Bank (a 1961 National Provincial acquisition, established 1865) continued as separate operations. Westminster Foreign Bank (established 1913) was restyled International Westminster Bank in 1973. Duncan Stirling, outgoing chairman of Westminster Bank, became first chairman of the fifth largest bank in the world. In 1969 David Robarts, former chairman of National Provincial, assumed Stirling's position. In 1975 {{it was one of the}} first London banks to open a representative office in Scotland. It was a founder member of the Joint Credit Card Company (with Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank and Williams & Glyn's Bank) which launched the Access credit card (now part of MasterCard) in 1972 and in 1976 it introduced the Servicetill cash machine. The same banks, excluding Lloyds, were later responsible for the introduction of the Switch <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> (later branded Maestro) in 1988.|$|E

40|$|<b>Debit</b> <b>cards</b> in Europe replace many medium value cash {{payments}} while stored value {{cards were}} designed to replace small value cash transac-tions.
