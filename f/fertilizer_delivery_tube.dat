The results show that all of melt <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> tip pressures are negative value in the atomization gas pressure range of 0. 4 ~ 0. 9 MPa, and they monotonously increase with increasing the atomizing pressure; when the atomizing pressure is higher than 0. 7 MPa, the negative pressure of the melt <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> tip is slowly increasing with continuously increasing the atomizing pressure; the atomized powder possesses higher effective atomizing efficiency, more uniform size distribution, better sphericity and smoother surface at the atomizing pressure of 0. 7 MPa and {{the pressure of the}} melt <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> tip of- 39. 44 kPa...|$|R

Results from the atomization of a modified 7075 aluminum alloy yielded up to 60 wt pct. powders that were finer than 45 microns in diameter. Two different atomizer designs were evaluated. The amount of fine powders produced was correlated to a calculated gas-power term. An optimal gas-power value existed for maximized fine powder production.

40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, two nozzle {{configurations}} {{are used for}} spray deposition, convergent nozzle (nozzle-A), and convergent nozzle with 2 mm parallel portion attached at its end (nozzle-C) without changing the exit area. First, the conditions for subambient aspiration pressure, i. e., pressure {{at the tip of}} the melt <b>delivery</b> <b>tube,</b> are established by varying the protrusion length of the melt <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> at different applied gas pressures for both of the nozzles. Using these conditions, spray deposits in a reproducible manner are successfully obtained for 7075 Al alloy. The effect of applied gas pressure, flight distance, and nozzle configuration on various characteristics of spray deposition, viz., yield, melt flow rate, and gas-to-metal ratio, is examined.

40|$|In spray deposition, the flowpattern of {{atomizing}} gas {{plays an}} important role in the atomization process. In the present investigation, gas flow inside and outside the nozzle is analyzed n 0 umerically using a commercial computational fluid dynamics software Fluent®. Analysis is carried out for various nozzle configurations, protrusion lengths of the melt <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> and applied gas pressures. Two types of nozzle configurations are considered, the first one is a convergent nozzle and in the second one, a small parallel portion of various lengths is attached at the end of the convergent nozzle. The analysis shows that pressure, velocity,temperature and density of atomizing gas at the nozzle exit does not change much for various nozzle configurations, whereas turbulent kinetic energy is drastically reduced when a parallel portion is attached at the end of the convergent nozzle. A protrusion length between 2 and 3 mm is found to be optimum for the nozzles with a parallel portion at the end of the nozzle as it gives rise to lowest aspiration pressure, which assists in melt flowing out of the <b>delivery</b> <b>tube.</b> A decrease in aspiration pressure with increase in protrusion length from 0 to 2 mm is experimentally verified...|$|R

This study aims to evaluate a new feasible and safe intracor-poreal anastomosis technique after laparoscopic left-sided colon or rectum resection in a pig model. Methods: The technique was evaluated in 5 pigs. The OrVil device (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was inserted into the anus and advanced proximally to the rectum. A 0. 5 -cm incision was made in the sigmoid colon, and the 2 sutures attached to its <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> were cut. After the <b>delivery</b> <b>tube</b> was evacuated through the anus, the tip of the anvil was removed through the perforation. The sigmoid colon was transected just distal to the perfo-ration with an endoscopic linear stapler. The rectosigmoid segment to be resected was removed through the anus with a grasper, and distal transection was performed. A 25 -mm circular stapler was inserted and combined with the anvil, and end-to-side intracorporeal anastomosis was then performed. Results: We performed the technique in 5 pigs. Anasto-mosis required an average of 12 minutes. We observed that the proximal and distal donuts were completely re-moved in all pigs. No anastomotic air leakage was ob-served in any of the animals. Conclusion: This study shows the efficacy and safety of intracorporeal anastomosis with the OrVil device after laparoscopic anterior resection...|$|R

Survival {{and growth of}} planted seedlings under vegetative competition typically increases with initial plant size. Increasing container size and fertilizer rate may produce larger seedlings, but high fertilization can lead to surface and groundwater pollution and relatively low fertilizer use efficiency. Subirrigation systems may help mitigate this problem. Our study objective was to evaluate koa seedling growth with overhead or subirrigation over a range of container volumes (50 to 656 mL) and fertilizer rates (0 to 9. 6 kg·m− 3). Increasing container volume from 50 to 656 mL yielded koa seedlings with 200 % more height and stem diameter growth.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years Malawi made {{remarkable}} progress toward increasing its national maize production and achieving food security owing to its long-running policy of subsidizing fertilizer. The implementation of these subsidy programs is continuously being improved upon as the country learns from past experiences. 1 Recent evaluations of the current Farm Input Subsidy Program by Dorward and Chirwa (2011, 2012) suggest that various components of the program have been redesigned over time. These include timeliness of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>delivery,</b> <b>fertilizer</b> coupon receipts, regional distribution, area targeting, allocation and distribution processes, and coupon use and re-demption. However, the issue of beneficiary identification and targeting remains a challenge for the program. Draw-ing on recent research by Houssou and Zeller (2010, 2011, 2012), this note proposes an alternative approach to effec-tively target the poor within the group of potential program beneficiaries. In our analysis we are mindful of the fact that targeting criteria for the current program are vague at best. One interpretation of these criteria is that the pro-gram intends to target the “productive poor”, and since poverty is widespread in Malawi, some would argue that the focus of the targeting mechanism should be on identifying farmers who would make best use of subsidized fertilizer (e. g., as measured by their marginal productivity per unit of fertilizer applied). Many evaluations, however, have criti-cized the program for not being pro-poor enough; hence aProject paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; MaSSPDSG...|$|R

40|$|A {{reversible}} solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (RSOFC) system could buffer intermittent electrical generation, e. g. wind, wave power by storing electrical energy as hydrogen and heat. RSOFC were fabricated by thermoplastic extrusion of (La₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂) ₀. ₉₅MnO[subscript(3 −δ) ] (LSM) ceramic support tubes, which were microstructurally stable with 55 % porosity at 1350 °C. A composite oxygen electrode of LSM-YSZ was applied, providing a homogeneous substrate for a 20 μm - 30 μm thick YSZ electrolyte. A dip-coated 8 YSZ slurry, and a painted commercial 3 YSZ ink gave sintered densities of 90 % and nearly 100 % at 1350 °C, respectively. A porous NiO/YSZ fuel electrode was also painted on. A Ag/Cu reactive air braze was unsuccessful at forming a void-free joint between the RSOFC and a 316 stainless steel gas <b>delivery</b> <b>tube,</b> as the braze did not penetrate the oxidation layer on the steel. Two alumina-based ceramic cements failed to fully seal the cell to an alumina gas <b>delivery</b> <b>tube,</b> due to {{thermal expansion coefficient}} mismatches and porosity after curing. Therefore, the maximum open circuit voltage (OCV) obtained during RSOFC testing was 0. 8 V at 440 °C. LSM-YSZ symmetrical cell performance measurements with oxygen pressure showed a diffusion polarisation, which was assigned to dissociative adsorption and surface diffusion of oxygen species. A collaborative RSOFC system software model showed ohmic and activation losses dominated the RSOFC, and diffusion losses were insignificant. Pressurisation from 1 to 70 bar increased the RSOFC Nernst voltage by 11 % at 900 °C, and reduced the entropy of the gases, reducing heat production and increasing electrical efficiency. A 500 kg Sn/Cu phase change heat store prevented the system overheating.

Within this project, critical experiments were conducted for graphite moderated LEU systems to determine core reactivity, flux and power profiles, reaction-rate ratios, the worth of control rods, both in-core and reflector based, the worth of burnable poisons, kinetic parameters, and the effects of moisture ingress on these parameters. One benchmark experiment was evaluated in this report: Core 4. Core 4 represents the only configuration with random pebble packing in the HTR-PROTEUS series of experiments, and has a moderator-to-fuel pebble ratio of 1 : 1. Three random configurations were performed. The initial configuration, Core 4. 1, was rejected because the method for pebble loading, separate <b>delivery</b> <b>tubes</b> for the moderator and fuel pebbles, may not have been completely random; this core loading was rejected by the experimenters. Cores 4. 2 and 4. 3 were loaded using a single <b>delivery</b> <b>tube,</b> eliminating the possibility for systematic ordering effects.
