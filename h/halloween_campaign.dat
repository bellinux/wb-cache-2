In the fall of 1990 the group helped organize a protest against a visiting televangelist who vowed to [...] "exorcise the demons" [...] from San Francisco on <b>Halloween.</b> In another <b>campaign,</b> they distributed their trademark neon stickers that read [...] "Trans Power/BI Power/Queer Nation". The organization was active through 1991; an attempt to revive the group in 1992 was unsuccessful. An offshoot, the San Francisco Street Patrol, was a neighborhood safety patrol in the Castro District; it outlived QN/SF itself by a year.|$|R

However, as was the case last year the streets will not be closed to traffic. As in every other community in the City, there will be zero tolerance for behavior which doesn’t respect the celebrated diversity of our communities. And again like last year, there will be zero tolerance for individuals and businesses that do not obey alcohol consumption and distribution regulations. The Home For Halloween website will help promote your events so please let us know about what you have planned in your community.The Castro is not appropriate for a party with 100,000 people.
