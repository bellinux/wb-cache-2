They are particularly useful in modeling clothes, facial expression, human and animal characters. A common method to render these objects is by tessellation.

A tessellation process is often used to convert a <b>deformable</b> <b>object</b> into polygons so that the hardware graphics accelerator may render them. Unfortunately, this tessellation process is computationally very expensive.
