40|$|SummaryThe {{downstream}} effector of PI 3 K, Akt, {{is frequently}} hyperactivated in human cancers. A critical downstream effector of Akt, which contributes to tumorigenesis, is mTOR. In the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway, Akt {{is flanked by}} two tumor suppressors: PTEN, <b>acting</b> as a <b>brake</b> upstream of Akt, and TSC 1 /TSC 2 heterodimer, <b>acting</b> as a <b>brake</b> downstream of Akt and upstream of mTOR. In {{the absence of the}} TSC 1 /TSC 2 brake, mTOR activity is unleashed to inhibit Akt via an inhibitory feedback mechanism. Two recent studies used mouse genetics to assess the roles of PTEN and TSC 2 in cancer, underscoring the importance of Akt-mTOR interplay for cancer progression and therapy...|$|R
40|$|Mixing {{across a}} stable density {{interface}} {{caused by a}} shear stress <b>externally</b> <b>acting</b> on a two-layer fluid initially at rest is modelled using the turbulent-diffusion concept. The influence of a (relatively weak) longitudinal pressure gradient is also considered. The central point of view developed is that the mixed layer can be only weakly stratified so that the buoyancy transport across the mixed layer, and not the processes near the interface, controls the entrainment rate. To model the turbulent transports of buoyancy and momentum, common expressions for gradient transport in turbulent Couette and channel flow are adopted. Using a similarity solution, results are given for small and large Ri, where Ri is the overall Richardson number based on the friction velocity. The entrainment rate obtained {{does not depend on}} Ri at small Ri, and is inversely proportional to Ri at large Ri. The latter result is derived without introducing the usual assumption that the increase in potential energy is proportional to the work done by the shear stress, which assumption leads to the same result. An adverse pressure gradient is found to decrease the entrainment rate. An estimate of the mean velocity of the mixed layer is given. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Mechanically {{stressed}} cells display {{increased levels}} of fos message and protein. Although the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for FOS induction have been extensively characterized, {{we still do not}} understand the nature of the primary cell mechanotransduction event responsible for converting an <b>externally</b> <b>acting</b> mechanical stressor into an intracellular signal cascade. We now report that plasma membrane disruption (PMD) is quantitatively correlated on a cell-by-cell basis with fos protein levels expressed in mechanically injured monolayers. When the population of PMD-affected cells in injured monolayers was selectively prevented from responding to the injury, the fos response was completely ablated, demonstrating that PMD is a requisite event. This PMD-dependent expression of fos protein did not require cell exposure to cues inherent in release from cell–cell contact inhibition or presented by denuded substratum, because it also occurred in subconfluent monolayers. Fos expression also could not be explained by factors released through PMD, because cell injury conditioned medium failed to elicit fos expression. Translocation of the transcription factor NF-�B into the nucleus may also be regulated by PMD, based on a quantitative correlation similar to that found with fos. We propose that PMD, by allowing a flux of normally impermeant molecules across the plasma membrane, mediates a previously unrecognized form of cell mechanotransduction. PMD may thereby lead to cell growth or hypertrophy responses such as those that are present normally in mechanically stressed skeletal muscle and pathologically in the cardiovascular system...|$|R

40|$|Recovery {{occurs in}} a complex, {{emergent}} manner. It is a worldly process, shot through with the nuances and imperatives of an equally complex, emergent and imperfect world. Encountering recovery, therefore, entails thinking through the complex, mutually informed relationship between recovery-oriented organisations and the contexts in which they arise. This thesis presents and compares different attempts to address the social problem of addiction in Sarajevo. At its heart, it is {{a study of the}} ways in which members of two primary fieldsites—a therapeutic community and an NGO—try to achieve recovery from addiction, which gives equal weight and attention to the roles and voices of the addicts whose recovery is at stake, and to the roles and voices of the professionals involved in recovery processes. Positioning my study within both the city of Sarajevo, and within historical and contemporary manifestations of addiction problems in the city, I pursue a comparative explication {{of the ways in which}} addicts and professionals come together to ‘make’ recovery. I trace and compare the manifestations of a productive tension in these contexts between idealised and programmatic recovery on the one hand, and the imperatives of sociality on the other. If recovery is ‘made’ through such tension, it can also be ‘unmade’ in this way. As such, I ground my observations of the ‘unmaking’ of recovery processes in a discussion of the factors inherent to, and <b>externally</b> <b>acting</b> upon these institutions which undermine both the recovered state and the recovery process. In so doing I seek to generate insight into the complex, emergent nature of change in these contexts, which will be discussed in terms of (ab) normality, capricious simultaneity and possibility...|$|R
