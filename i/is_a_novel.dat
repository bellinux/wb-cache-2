5|$|After World War II, various optical {{systems were}} tested. Kohler {{generators}} were installed in 1949 {{along with the}} stationary electric light system. A new rotating light system (EMV-3) was installed in 1963, making the lighthouse fully automated. It was in use until 1982, when an experimental EMV-930M system (made in Ukraine) was installed. The rotation mechanism of the optical system <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> solution– there are no electric motors; it uses a revolving magnetic field instead. The optics brought a six to eight hundredfold increase to {{the efficiency of the}} light radiated by a 1kW quartz lamp. The same light system is still in use.|$|E
