5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E

He was widowed in 1953 and died at Esperance Nursing Home in Eastbourne in May 1955, leaving a daughter.

5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E

A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E

5|$|According to the Venetian senator Andrea Suriano, Venice {{spent on}} average 60,000 ducats {{per year in}} this {{seemingly}} fruitless conflict, but the Venetians themselves were hesitant to commit their resources <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> Thessalonica; its proximity to the centre of Ottoman power made their ability to retain it doubtful in the long term, {{while at the same}} time, closer to home, Venice was pursuing a conflict with the Duchy of Milan over control of northern Italy. The Republic had long tried to avoid declaring war on the Ottomans, but now it had little choice: Dandolo's imprisonment, the increasing Ottoman naval threat (with the open assistance of the Genoese colonies at Chios and Lesbos), in conjunction with the end of their war with Hungary, made clear to the Venetians that the Sultan was preparing to settle the question of Thessalonica by force. As a result, on 29 March 1429, the Great Council voted an official declaration of war against the Sultan, and ordered more ships to be activated to join the fleet.|$|E

5|$|List's {{activities}} {{had made}} him a celebrity within the Austrian Pan-German movement, with {{the editors of the}} Ostdeutsche Rundschau convening a Guido List evening in April 1895 and South Vienna's Wieden Singers' Club holding a List festival in April 1897. Having divorced his previous wife, in August 1899 List married Anna Wittek, who was from Stecky in Bohemia. Despite List's modern Pagan faith, the wedding was held in an evangelical Protestant church, reflecting the growing popularity of Protestantism among Austria's Pan-German community, who perceived it as a more authentically German form of Christianity than the Catholicism that was popular among Austria-Hungary's other ethnic and linguistic communities. Wittek had previously appeared in a performance of List's Der Wala Erweckung and had publicly recited some of his poetry. Following their marriage, List devoted himself <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> drama, authoring the plays König Vannius ("King Vannius") in 1899, Sommer-Sonnwend-Feuerzauber ("Summer Solstice Fire Magic") in 1901 and Das Goldstück ("The Gold Coin") in 1903. He also authored a pamphlet titled Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum ("The Reconstruction of Carnuntum") in 1900, in which he called for the reconstruction of the ancient Roman amphitheatre at Carnuntum as an open-air stage through which Wotanism could be promoted.|$|E
5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{offensive}} {{operations for}} the summer of 1943 were planned to begin after {{the strength of the}} German forces had been dissipated by their Kursk offensive. As the German momentum in the north slowed, the Soviets launched Operation Kutusov on 12 July against Army Group Centre in the Orel salient, directly north of the Kursk salient. The Bryansk Front, under the command of Markian Popov, attacked the eastern face of the Orel salient while the Western Front, commanded by Vasily Sokolovsky, attacked from the north. The Western Front's assault was led by the 11th Guards Army, under Lieutenant General Hovhannes Bagramyan, and was supported by the 1st and 5th Tank Corps. The Soviet spearheads sustained heavy casualties, but pushed through and in some areas achieved significant penetrations. These thrusts endangered German supply routes and threatened the 9th Army with encirclement. With this threat, 9th Army was compelled to go over <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> the defensive.|$|E

5|$|Craig {{retired from}} {{first-class}} cricket at just 26years {{of age in}} 1962, but continued playing for Mosman in Sydney grade cricket on weekends until 1969. His marriage to Rosslyn Carroll in 1962 and his pharmaceutical career prevented him from applying himself <b>fully</b> <b>to</b> cricket. The couple had {{a boy and a}} girl, as well as an adopted son. Craig joined the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots, rising to the position of managing director. He later served {{on the board of directors}} of the Bradman Museum in Bowral and later became its chairman. He was a board member of the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA) for three years and served on the Trust of the Sydney Cricket Ground for varying periods from 1968 to 1996, totalling 18years. Upon first being appointed in 1968 to replace Stan McCabe, Craig was the youngest ever trustee of the SCG. One of the most controversial incidents during this time occurred in 1977–78 during the period of the breakaway World Series Cricket, which wanted to install floodlights at the SCG. The NSWCA opposed this, while the government sided with WSC. As a result of Craig's support of the NSWCA, the government dismissed him. Craig retired as the managing director of Boots' Australian subsidiaries. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his contributions to cricket as a player and administrator. He died in Bowral from cancer on 16 November 2014.|$|E
