5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía.

5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete.

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of <b>empty</b> holes on blasting vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are <b>empty</b> holes between monitoring point and blast hole is less than that without <b>empty</b> holes. The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of <b>empty</b> hole, the diameter of <b>empty</b> hole, the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole and the rows of <b>empty</b> hole, are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of <b>empty</b> hole has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect on blasting vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of <b>empty</b> hole and the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of <b>empty</b> hole can enhance the damping effect on blasting vibration as well. The results in the present study may provide a reference for the application of <b>empty</b> hole to reduce the blasting vibration in practical engineering...|$|R
