40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{representation}} of the procedure for <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> spatial planning. In the first part, there are described all procedures of planning <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> infrastructure with necessary equipment and buildings. Also the situation regarding <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and <b>waste</b> quantity in the Republic of Slovenia is shown. Furthermore, the table of the existing <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> and industrial <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> in Slovenia is included, because the locations of already existent <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> have to be considered when spatially planning the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> infrastructure in the environment. Then, the thesis deals with the determination of location with all necessary procedures description, i. e. from state to the municipal spatial plan. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, there is a report about environmental impacts of the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> Mala gora refurbishment and its expansion. There is also the detailed procedure of expanding <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> Mala gora and its spatial localization. All the necessary proposals and conditions presented that need to be taken into account when refurbishing the existent part of the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> and projecting new disposal fields of Mala gora <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> are also included. This thesis shows whether it is possible to expand this location from the point of view of spatial planning and technical standards for similar objects (enlarge or expand the existent <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> ground plan for new disposal fields) ...|$|R
40|$|As {{construction}} of final <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> is essential recently, a problem {{where we should}} build it becomes important issue. However, public opposition occurs for the construction because the final <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> has negative image such as pollution of various kinds, increase of traffic volume and noise by truck and bulldozer, and aggravation of living conditions. Public opposition is the most critical problem in constructing final <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site.</b> The source of public opposition has been characterized as NIMBY or not-in-my-yard. This paper presents {{a survey of the}} resident awareness on final <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site,</b> and attempts to find factors which affect the public opposition using logistic regression analysis and CART(classification and regression tree) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{research}} shown in {{this paper is to}} investigate the cause and effect relation of the Jakuševec-Prudinec <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> and the groundwater pollution. The recovery of the Jakuševec-Prudinec <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> by the end of 2003 did not have any significant impact on the pollution reduction in groundwater. Very high values of the pollution index defined in the area southeastern from the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> show spreading of the pollution toward Mičevec village. The analysis of the hydrogeochemical characteristics showed that in the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> area the local geochemical anomalies of the partial CO 2 pressure exist, indicating that the intensive carbonate dissolution processes and HCO 3 - enrichment dominate in this area. Near the border of the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> groundwater with high ammonium ion (NH 4 +) and chloride ion (Cl-) dominates. The high concentrations of the heavy metals and very strong geochemical bonds determined from the correlation coefficients show that in the reductive aquifer conditions heavy metals strongly release (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

40|$|In the Republic of Slovenia {{there are}} five larger sites {{polluted}} with heavy metals. The largest one is the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the lead and zinc mine {{in the northern part}} of the country, and the second one is the <b>waste</b> and tailings <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the world second largest mercury mine. Both mines are now closed. The other three sites are smaller from those described above and they are: the tailings <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the uranium mine, the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the ironworks and the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the aluminum processing plant. The article will present up-to-date data on the quantities of disposed wastes as well as measurements of some parameters connected with harmful effects on the environment and human health. Hazardous heavy metals from mines are monitored in the soil, flowing waters, groundwater and in the air. In some cases they are also monitored in some vegetables and human tissues and organs. The results of blood analysis for the content of heavy metals for mine workers and general population will be presented for two mining towns. On the largest sites, i. e. the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the lead and zinc mine and the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of the mercury mine, some remediation activities are being in progress.

40|$|Illegal <b>disposal</b> of <b>waste</b> is a {{significant}} management issue for contemporary governments with waste posing an economic, social, and environmental risk. An improved understanding {{of the distribution of}} illegal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> is critical to enhance the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of waste management efforts. Remotely sensed data has the potential to address this knowledge gap. However, the literature regarding the use of remote sensing to map illegal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> is incomplete. This paper aims to analyze existing remote sensing methods and sensors used to monitor and map illegal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to support the evaluation of existing remote sensing methods for mapping illegal domestic waste sites in Queensland, Australia. Recent advances in technology and the acquisition of very high-resolution remote sensing imagery provide an important opportunity to (1) revisit established analysis techniques for identifying illegal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites,</b> (2) examine the applicability of different remote sensors for illegal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> detection, and (3) identify opportunities for future research to increase the accuracy of any illegal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> mapping products. 17 page(s...|$|R

30|$|A {{major source}} of {{pollution}} and contamination of groundwater apart from industrial and agricultural activities is leachate from landfills and <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites,</b> especially if {{there is little or}} no monitoring of who dumps what into it, a situation akin to the Abloradjei solid <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site.</b> Open dump sites also represent a significant source of chemical constituents that may be transmitted from leachate into groundwater (Bretzel and Calderisi 2011; Rizo et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|Untreated {{landfill}} leachate produced typically at the unmanaged <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> may pose substantial contamination hazards {{not only to}} the nearby surface water but also to the groundwater system. This study attempts to focus on the potential risk arising with the spreading of contaminant generated at the solid <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> in the lake Kiyanja watershed which has usually been considered as the key source of supplying water to the surrounding community of the Masindi district of Uganda. A numerical model was developed with the help of FEMLAB to study the transport of the leached contaminants from the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> through the subsurface soil. The model shows that the contamination plume needs around 40 hours to infiltrate through the saturated groundwater after being released from the source. Further, it needs at least 183 hours to reach close to the nearby lake water. Although, the deep groundwater currently seems to be protected, but it needs adequate attention while installing deep wells through the clay layers to make it remained safe for the future. It can however be mentioned that to protect and preserve the groundwater resources, the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> should immediately be relocated elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} issues related to the mining industry in Canada and elsewhere, is the pollution from abandoned mine <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> The <b>wastes</b> containing sulphide minerals can oxidize and generate contaminants in the water drainage, a phenomenon called acid mine drainage (AMD). Different techniques are available to control the production of AMD. However, these techniques were mainly developed for the closure of operating sites, and are not as efficient for abandoned mine sites that were left exposed to natural conditions for years. The main differences between an operating and abandoned mine <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> are the quality of the interstitial water, the presence of well implemented acidophilic bacteria, {{and the quality of the}} retaining infrastructures. To avoid contamination of surrounding ecosystems, it is necessary to take into consideration these particularities at the reclamation stage. The experience at the Lorraine mine site shows a slight improvement of the water quality in the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> 10 years after reclamation even if the oxygen barrier is working as expected. The addition of a passive treatment system to treat the contaminated pore water that will eventually flow out of the site is then a critical component of the reclamation at any abandoned AMD mine <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> from {{non-ferrous}} metal industry constitute environments very hostile for life {{due to the}} presence of very specialized abiotic factors (pH, salt concentration, heavy metals content). In our experiments microflora of two <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> in Slovakia – brown mud <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> from aluminium production near Ziar nad Hronom and nickel sludge <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> near Sered - was analyzed for cultivable bacteria. Isolated bacteria were characterized by a combination of classical microbiological approaches and molecular methods and the most of isolated bacteria shown a poly-extremotolerant phenotype. The most frequently halotolerant (resistant to the high level of salt concentrations) and alkalitolerant (resistant to the high pH level) bacteria belonging to the Actinobacteria class were detected. The most of bacteria shown very high level of heavy metal resistance e. g. more than 500 μg/ml for Zn 2 + or Cu 2 +. Based on our data, <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> thus on one side represents an important environmental burden but on other side they are a source of new poly-extremotolerant bacterial strains and species possibly used in many biotechnology and bioremediation applications...|$|R

40|$|Stormwater {{falling on}} outdoor <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> areas becomes {{polluted}} via contact with waste materials. It contains various pollutants. On {{the basis of}} the present study, stormwater runoffs from five different types of <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> have been collected and characterized in two modern waste management centers where several waste management activities are carried out. Mean values and 90 % confidence intervals of nutrients, eight types of trace metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Zn, As, Cu), petroleum oils, BOD, TOC, PH, dissolved oxygen, Cl, and conductivity were all calculated. Of many investigated stormwater quality parameters, runoff from certain areas showed measured values above the limits for direct discharge into recipients at Löt waste management center. The pollutants transported by stormwater represent a significant threat to the environment and possible treatment methods were analyzed. A high variability of stormwater runoff quality was found not only among different <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites,</b> but also in data measured at the same <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> of different sampling events. Sampling experiences and analyzed results indicate that the frequent changes in activities carried out on <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites,</b> the sampling time in each sampling event, weather conditions, the amount of waste dust on sites surfaces, and waste characteristics all have impacts on the amount of pollutants transported by stormwater.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{application}} of geomorphology in planning. Since geomorphology is a science about the changes in land features and geomorphic planning is a science that helps us find the best solutions for present land use problems. Geomorphology uses different time scales for planning issues. Short term time scaling includes a 10 to 50 year period through which this science can {{play a significant role}} in issues such as site selection of many land uses. Urban site selection, urban morphology, industrial and <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> selection are among these land uses. We have carried out research for a solid <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> selection as a case study and the city of Bonab has been chosen as the study region. This city has located in the southern part of East Azerbaijan Province, at 46 ’: 52 ” eastern longitude and 37 ’: 20 ” northern latitude. The topographic situation of the region, ecologic and economic problems with the current location of the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> (such as its neighboring with faults, its proximity to surface waters and industrial establishments and the steep slope of the area) have been the reasons of study. These issues necessitate thorough investigations for <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> selection in this region. The focus of this research is on demonstrating the application and the importance of geomorphic studies in planning. We have considered geomorphic factors and sub-factors like rock, soil, slope, faults and unstable lands. In addition, ecologic and socio-economic factors and the element of hydro-climate have also been considered. Using digital maps of the region and GIS software (Arc View and ArcGIS), we have tried to determine the most appropriate <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> with the least ecological, social and economic threats. Using this method, we have selected 9 appropriate <b>sites</b> for <b>waste</b> <b>disposal.</b> The aim was choosing an optimum solid waste site.

40|$|Mapping {{of heavy}} metal {{contamination}} in mining and <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites</b> usually relies on geostatistical approaches and linear stochastic dynamics. The present paper aims to identify, using the Grassberger-Procaccia correlation dimension (CD) algorithm, {{the existence of}} a nonlinear deterministic and chaotic dynamic behaviour in the spatial pattern of arsenic, manganese and zinc concentration in a Russian coal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site.</b> The analysis carried out yielded embedding dimension values ranging between 7 and 8 suggesting thus from a chaotic dynamic perspective that arsenic, manganese and zinc concentration in space is a medium dimensional problem for the regionalized scale considered in this study. This alternative nonlinear dynamics approach may complement conventional geostatistical studies and may be also used for the estimation of risk and the subsequent screening and selection of a feasible remediation scheme in wider mining and <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>sites.</b> Finally, the synergistic effect of this study may be further elaborated if additional factors including among others presence of hot spots, density and depth of sampling, mineralogy of wastes and sensitivity of analytical techniques are taken into account.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in a young urban population in a developing country, with focus on potentially highly exposed children working informally as scrap scavengers at a large municipal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site.</b> We also set out {{to investigate}} whether hydroxylated metabolites, which not hitherto have been found retained in humans, could be detected. METHODS: We assessed PBDEs in pooled serum samples obtained in 2002 from children 11 – 15 years of age, working and sometimes also living at the municipal <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> in Managua, and in nonworking urban children. The influence of fish consumption was evaluated in the children and in groups of women 15 – 44 years of age who differed markedly in their fish consumption. Hydroxylated PBDEs were assessed as their methoxylated derivates. The chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, using authentic reference substances. RESULTS: The children living and working at the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>site</b> showed very high levels of medium brominated diphenyl ethers. The levels observed in the referent children were comparable to contemporary observations in the United States. The exposure pattern was consistent with dust being the dominating source. The children with the highest PBDE levels also had {{the highest levels of}} hydroxylated metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, very high levels of PBDEs were found in children from an urban area in a developing country. Also, for the first time, hydroxylated PBDE metabolites were found to bioaccumulate in human serum.
