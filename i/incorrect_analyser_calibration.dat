If the thresholds for platelet transfusion, currently set at 10 × 109 /l, are to be further reduced, it is vital that the limitations of current analysers are fully understood. The aim of this large multicentre {{study was to determine the}} accuracy of haematology analysers in current routine practice for platelet counts below 20 × 109 /l. Platelet counts estimated by analysers using optical, impedance and immunological methods were compared with the International Reference Method for platelet counting. The results demonstrated variation in platelet counting between different analysers and even the same type of analyser at different sites. Optical methods for platelet counting on the XE 2100, Advia 120, Cell-Dyn 4000 and H 3 * were not superior to impedance methods on the XE 2100, LH 750 and Pentra analysers. All analysers except one overestimated the platelet count, which would result in under transfusion of platelets. This study highlights the inaccuracies of haematology analysers in platelet counting in severe thrombocytopenia. It re-emphasizes the need for external quality control to improve <b>analyser</b> <b>calibration</b> for samples with low platelet counts, and suggests that the optimal thresholds for prophylactic platelet transfusions should be re-evaluated...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} intercomparison study of eddy covariance ozone flux measurements made using two fast response dry chemiluminescence analysers. Ozone deposition was measured over a well characterised managed grassland near Edinburgh, Scotland, during August 2007. A data quality control procedure specific to these analysers is introduced. Absolute ozone fluxes were calculated {{based on the}} relative signals of the dry chemiluminescence analysers using three different methods {{and the results are}} compared for both analysers. It is shown that the error in the fitted <b>analyser</b> <b>calibration</b> parameters required for the flux calculations provides a substantial source of uncertainty in the fluxes. The choice of the calculation method itself can also constitute an uncertainty in the flux as the calculated fluxes by the three methods do not agree within error at all times. This finding highlights the need for a consistent and rigorous approach for comparable datasets, such as e. g. in flux networks. Ozone fluxes calculated by one of the methods were then used to compare the two analysers in more detail. This systematic analyser comparison reveals half-hourly flux values differing by up to a factor of two at times with the difference in mean hourly flux ranging from 0 to 23 % with an error in the mean daily flux of &plusmn; 12 %. The comparison of analysers shows that the agreement in fluxes is excellent for some days but that there is an underlying uncertainty as a result of variable analyser performance and/or non-linear sensitivity...|$|R

In its first stage it will be situated at a temporary location and it will consist of two large chambers for cattle, two medium chambers for sheep and goats and two small chambers for smaller animals (piglets etc; not discussed in detail in this manual). It is planned to enlarge the metabolic centre to four chambers per size. Facility air flow is about 910 m 3 /h and temperature ranges from 20 °C to 26 °C without humidity control. The chamber casings are constructed with insulated sandwich panels. Windows are inserted into the casing {{on each side of}} the chamber. Chamber volume of the large and medium chambers is about 22. 4 m 3 and 9. 2 m 3, respectively. The chambers will be operated at a slight negative pressure (maximal 100 Pa below ambient pressure). Air flow through the chambers will be between 300 – 1000 L/min (large chamber) and 40 – 250 L/min (medium chamber). Each of the chambers forms an independent system with its own flow generator, air conditioning unit, animal welfare monitoring and data logging. The two large chambers share a common gas analysis and data acquisition system, so do the two medium chambers. From the flow generators a sub sample is directed to the analyser system by the means of a multiplexer at regular intervals. The duration of these intervals is not yet known.

40|$|URL] audienceThe {{purpose of}} the Continuous Contaminated Site Monitoring (CCSM) {{is to develop a}} real time {{management}} methodology for PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) contaminated aquifer resulting from coal activity. For full-scale experimentation, since June 2000 an old coking plant site has been instrumented (sensors, analysers, datalogger, programmable logic controller, etc [...] ). Its follow-up currently continues with remote supervision, via telecom connection. The Contaminated Sites Monitoring is a necessity to control the evolution of pollution and therefore the risk to human health or environment. With aromatic hydrocarbons contamination, one is generally satisfied with selective investigation, in fact incomplete and non-representative of the reality. Rarely a real time supervision of the natural evolution of PAHs pollution in the groundwater or in the ground combined with surrounding parameters (weather, rains,etc [...] .) is carried out. This experimental CCSM is able to highlight some correlation between pollution evolution and weather conditions. For the natural attenuation activity deduced from measurements of biogaz in unsaturated area, a strong activity has been observed in hot temperatures (consumption of oxygen and emission of carbon dioxide) and a low one in cold periods. For the daily rate PAH analysis of aquifer water, a field UVfluorometer is used. Calibrated with naphthalene (the most soluble PAH), the water fluorescence is equivalent to a concentration of naphthalene but a post-treatment of data is necessary in order to correct the drift of the <b>analyser</b> between <b>calibrations.</b> Subsequently the measured & treated data are restituted/exploited using an integrated tool consisting of a GIS (Geographic Information System), interconnected to a Database and a mass transport model.

In order to determine CO 2 concentration and to develop simulation models, it is necessary to carry out measurements which are accurate and comparable in time and space, i. e. SI-traceable. Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analysers are employed for CO 2 measurements, as they are precise and stable. In order to achieve traceability, such instruments have to be characterized and calibrated. At the Istituto di Metrologia "G.

The coefficient of determination (R(2)) and the standard error in cross validation (SECV) were 0. 74 (SECV= 875 RVU) for peak viscosity (PV), 0. 63 (SECV= 561 RVU) for trough (THR), 0. 80 (SECV= 173 RVU) for breakdown (BRK), 0. 74 (SECV= 126 RVU) for setback (STB), 0. 77 (SECV= 679 RVU) for final viscosity (FV), and 0. 73 (SECV= 0. 57 s) for time to peak (TTP). The RPD values (SD/SEP) from the validation indicated that only BRK can be accurately predicted (RPD= 4).

40|$|To measure pH in {{platelet}} concentrates, blood gas <b>analysers</b> {{with different}} <b>calibration</b> principles may be used.

These measurements were compared with a reference method. Especially for PAS-II, large variation in pH was observed between AVL 945, AVL OMNI and the reference method: 6. 91 +/- 0. 02, 7. 35 +/- 0. 02 and 7. 188 +/- 0. 010, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 12, P < 0. 0001, paired t-test). A significant difference in pH was also found for platelet concentrates in 65 % PAS/ 35 % plasma (6. 88 +/- 0. 09 on AVL 945 and 7. 02 +/- 0. 09 on AVL OMNI, n = 134, P < 0. 0001). Comparison with the reference method revealed minor differences with AVL 945, whereas AVL OMNI gave a mean difference in pH of + 0. 17.

40|$|Frequently, when free-space {{electromagnetic}} waves {{pass through a}} material, {{there will be some}} form of interaction between the wave and the material. Measuring this change forms the basis of free-space, dielectric material measurement, where the variations will be attenuation and a phase change relative to the wave when the material was not present and are typically recorded over a broadband range of frequencies. In this work a new technique is presented to accurately perform free-space broadband material measurement to calculate the dielectric response of materials of unknown electrical length. (In this thesis, the electrical length means that while the physical length of the path is known, the number of wavelengths in the material is unknown, due to the unknown permittivity. This unknown number of wavelengths is described as the electrical length both here and also in many other works.) The technique is eventually applied to a more difficult form of material to measure, which is material in the form of powders and liquids. Powders and liquids present a particularly difficult challenge in that they must also be contained in a container of uniform shape and sufficient cross-section to guarantee that the entire received wave has passed through the same amount of material. The technique presented works for containment vessels with no or some dielectric response (respectively being relatively easy analysis and very difficult for dielectric analysis). Much of the work is devoted {{to the development of a}} test infrastructure and also a new vector network <b>analyser</b> (VNA) <b>calibration</b> technique that would be more appropriate to this infrastructure and kind of measurement than existing techniques. In terms of the latter point, to minimise measurement errors a free-space, broadband Thru-Reflect-Line/Match (TRL/M) calibration technique was developed. The challenge of a test structure for materials with an unknown electric length was met by offering the ability to vary the thickness of material through which the probing wave passes. Moreover, the range over which the thickness could vary was quite large (3 mm up to 18 cm) to accommodate materials of unknown electrical length with dielectric constant values over a wide range (2 to 80). Two measurement techniques are presented based on horizontal and vertical probing wave propagation, both of which allow for a series of measurements to be taken where the varying parameter is thickness of material under test. However, the horizontal propagation measurements required an extra containment layer (to contain the powder/liquid on both sides normal to the propagation, rather like a large, slim fish tank), compared to the vertical propagation measurement, but had significant mechanical and also the computational difficulties mentioned earlier. The vertical propagation measurements on the other hand show more promise, both in terms of mechanical containment and also in the inversion of the measured S-parameters to arrive at the complex electric permittivity. The measurements were performed in a large hall and also in a Radio Frequency (RF) anechoic chamber (optimal test range of approximately 500 MHz – 18 GHz). Several diverse solid materials were tested initially in developing the test infrastructure including double glazed standard and low emissivity windows, common building materials, house insulation materials and automobile glass. Once the platform and calibration technique were competed to a satisfactory level, measurements intended for dielectric analysis were carried out on commercial glass panes, water and household plain flour. All measurements were subsequently published in various conferences and workshops, hosted by the IEEE, IEEE Communications Society, IET, the European Association on Antennas and Propagation (EurAAP) and the Royal Irish Academy’s research Colloquium on Communications and Radio Sciences workshop...|$|R
40|$|Saturn's E ring is {{remarkable}} {{not only for}} its huge size. Based on optical measurements the ring was surprisingly found to mainly consist of ice particles of uniform size (radii between 0. 3 and 2 microns) [Nicholson et al., 1996. Observations of Saturn's ring-plane crossing in August and November. Science 272, 509 – 516], though the source of the ring, the icy moon Enceladus, feeds the ring with grains having a much broader mass distribution [Spahn et al., 1999. Dynamics of dust ejected from enceladus: application to the cassini dust detector. J. Geophys. Res. 104, 24111 – 24120]. Because of this contradiction, the mass distribution of the ring must be closely connected to the dynamics of the ring particles which is governed by the competition of various disturbing forces acting on the grains. It was realised early that the dynamics of the charged ring particles is strongly affected by electromagnetic forces as well as by plasma drag. Understanding the implications on the ring dynamics thus requires knowledge of the electrostatic equilibrium potential of the dust grains. The charge-sensitive grid system of the cosmic dust analyser (CDA) on the Cassini spacecraft allows an in situ determination of the charge of grains bigger than 2 – 3 microns. Since the CDA detector determines the grain mass simultaneously with the dust charge the electrostatic potential φd can be estimated as well. Here we report the first measurement of the electrostatic potential of E ring particles. Particles detected inside the orbit of Saturn's moon Rhea were always found to be negatively charged, whereas grains outside Rhea's orbit were on a positive potential of about 3 V. Our results are in good agreement with measurements of the spacecraft potential by Cassini's radio and plasma wave science (RPWS) investigation [Wahlund et al., 2005. The inner magnetosphere of Saturn: Cassini RPWS cold plasma results from the first encounter. Geophys. Res. Lett. 32].

40|$|Abstract: Carbon budgets vary {{markedly}} {{within and}} between Tagus and Sado estuaries reflecting the human pressure. These estuaries seem to generate carbon within a total of 0. 13 MtC yr - 1 for Tagus and 0. 02 MtC yr - 1 for Sado. Anthropogenic inputs, autochthonous carbon production and primary production are indicated as the main responsible for the carbon production within the estuaries. Carbon exported to the ocean and to the atmosphere by both estuarine systems is higher during the non-productive period. Emissions for the atmosphere represent, in terms of cost, about € 375, 000 per year. This study is important for an efficient protection and preservation of Tagus and Sado estuarine ecosystems and is {{a contribution to the}} integration of coastal and global carbon cycles. 1. INTRODUCTION The coastal environment presents high levels of complexity, diverse habitats and sustains a high level of biodiversity. These provide goods and services that support different uses which should be undertaken in a sustainable way. However, these coastal environments are facing increasing and significant impacts, driven by economic and social pressures. In order to resolve these problems, policy-makers world-wide seek to develop strategies to protect, conserve and manage the coastal environment. To accomplish that is imperative a scientific knowledge of such environments, particularly their role in the carbon and nutrients cycles. Human activities associated with coastal environments, such as land-use change, bulkhead construction, wastewater discharge, wetland removal and dredging, are increasingly important factors that affect carbon sources, cycling and budgets. Climate warming and hydrologic “events” have also resulted in changes to continental shelf carbon cycling (Maher and Eyre, 2012; Bauer et al., 2013). Although future climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in river carbon fluxes, it is also likely to lead to increased uncertainties in predicting these fluxes. Therefore, in management and conservation of coastal waters, the detection and assessment of carbon budgets is an important environmental issue since they can optimize interventions by state agencies and local communities. For a detailed carbon budget calculation it is essential to quantify the air-sea exchange of carbon and also the fluxes of carbon across the land/ocean boundaries. An example of such land/ocean boundaries are estuaries, which are effective filters for terrestrial/riverine organic inputs and impose a by-pass of carbon towards the atmosphere for the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, recent research (Chen and Borges, 2009; Oliveira et al., 2012) points out that estuaries influence strongly how global coastal ocean acts as a source or sink for atmospheric CO 2. In order to characterise the role of two of the greatest Portuguese estuaries (Tagus and Sado) in terms of carbon impacts on the ocean, carbon budgets, integrating simultaneously both inorganic and organic carbon components and CO 2 air-water fluxes, were estimated over an annual cycle. 2. ESTUARIES The Portuguese Tagus and Sado estuaries (Figure 1) are important ecological systems subjected to considerable urban, industrial and agricultural pressures and considered to be moderately productive. These anthropogenic pressures, expressed as chemical oxygen demand (COD), reach values of 131, 743 t yr - 1 and 30, 385 t yr - 1, respectively for Tagus and Sado river basins (APA, 2014). Figure 1. Map of Portugal showing Tagus and Sado estuaries. The two well mixed mesotidal estuaries were selected as they are close geographically, vary in freshwater inputs, span a range of river to marine dominated systems and are geomorphically distinct (Table 1). 3. METHODOLOGY 3. 1. Data Carbon budgets are based predominantly on direct measured of carbon flows. Carbon seasonal measurements were conducted from 1999 to 2004 on Tagus and Sado estuaries. Additionally, physical, chemical and biological parameters were also determined, generating a multiparameter data base contributing to a better knowledge of water quality changes in the systems and therefore respond to the Water Framework Directive. 3. 2. Carbon Analytical Procedures Particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon determinations were made using a CHN Fissons NA 1500 <b>Analyser.</b> The <b>calibration</b> standard used was acetanilide. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis were performed by high temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO), using a commercial Shimadzu TOC- 5000 A analyser. Samples were acidified to pH 3 PO 4 acid and immediately frozen until analyses. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) in seawater were calculated from in situ temperature, total alkalinity (TA) and corrected pH using the carbonic acid dissociation constants given by Millero et al. (2006) and the CO 2 solubility coefficient of Weiss (1974). Errors associated with DIC and pCO 2 calculations were estimated to be, respectively, ± 6 µmol kg - 1 and ± 10 µatm (accumulated errors on TA and pH). The air-water CO 2 fluxes were computed according to the equation CO 2 Flux = kspCO 2, where k is the gas transfer velocity (given by Wanninkhof, 1992), s is the solubility coefficient of CO 2 and pCO 2 is the air-water gradient of pCO 2. 4. RESULTS Results revealed significant differences between both estuaries in terms of carbon inputs and outputs. Carbon fluxes are always higher in Tagus than in Sado. Carbon exported to the ocean by both estuarine systems is higher during the non-productive period, with values reaching 2258 tC d - 1 for Tagus and 41 tC d - 1 for Sado. Emissions for the atmosphere, are also higher during the non-productive period, attaining values of 220 tC d - 1 and 60 tC d - 1, respectively for Tagus and Sado estuaries. Pricing these emissions at the current tax (May 7, 2014), they represent in terms of cost about € 375, 000. Extrapolating for an annual basis, Tagus exports a total of 0. 52 MtC yr - 1, of which 90 % goes to the ocean and 10 % is emitted to the atmosphere, while Sado estuary exports 0. 04 MtC yr - 1, of which 40 % is exported to the ocean and 60 % is emitted to the atmosphere (Figure 2). Carbon balance indicates that 0. 13 MtC yr - 1 for Tagus and 0. 02 MtC yr - 1 for Sado (Figure 2) are generated inside the system suggesting other sources of carbon, besides the river inputs. Figure 2. Annual carbon inputs and outputs in Tagus and Sado estuaries. Values in MtC yr - 1. According to APA (2014), and converting COD to TOC, the total anthropogenic loading for Tagus and Sado river basins is of 0. 04 MtC yr - 1 and 0. 01 MtC yr - 1, respectively. Therefore, in both estuaries anthropogenic sources inputs of organic carbon are extremely high, although this fraction comprises only 15 % and 8 % of the total carbon pool, respectively for Tagus and Sado estuaries. The major contribution of carbon is both estuaries is in the inorganic form. Considering the population within these two river basins, it can be infrared that every year each inhabitant roughly releases 12. 6 and 29. 3 kg of carbon to Tagus and Sado superficial waters, respectively. 5. CONCLUSIONS The results presented illustrate that Tagus and Sado estuaries represent an important land/ocean boundary for carbon transformation and emission, and confirm the anthropogenic pressure that these estuaries are subject to. Carbon budgets vary markedly {{within and between}} these two estuaries reflecting the human pressure. Anthropogenic inputs, autochthonous carbon production and primary production are indicated as the main responsible for the carbon production within the estuaries. Both estuaries export carbon to the ocean and to the atmosphere. The inorganic carbon faction has {{a major role in the}} carbon budget, enriching the ocean in carbon dioxide, contributing this for the greenhouse effect. Our understanding of organic and inorganic carbon fluxes in Tagus and Sado estuaries is vital for an efficient protection and preservation of such ecosystems being helpful in limit human-caused damage and in restoring damaged estuarine/coastal ecosystems. In addition, the economic impact of the carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, estimated as € 375, 000 per year, creates the appropriate incentives to reduce emissions and shift them to higher-value uses. Suggesting, therefore, a coastal management re-oriented towards a more adaptive approach through the use of carbon market-based policies. This study is a contribution to the integration of coastal and global carbon cycles. However, additional efforts are required to fully merge other components subsystems, such as salt marshes, with these budgets. Moreover, a fully comprehension of the community metabolism in these estuaries will greatly improve this integration...|$|R
