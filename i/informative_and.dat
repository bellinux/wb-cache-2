5|$|Critics chastised Stewart for not {{conducting}} sufficiently hard-hitting {{interviews with}} his political guests, {{some of whom}} he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying {{that they do not}} have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting <b>informative</b> <b>and</b> current interviews on a news network.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to create {{opportunities}} for an efficient interchange of information between humans and technology, especially for the skilled user, and put the designprincipal for <b>informative</b> structures <b>and</b> features into practice. <b>Informative</b> structures <b>and</b> features in {{a large number of}} information items helps the peripheral visual system to automatically capture knowledge through logical patterns. A field experiment was done to evaluate if <b>informative</b> structures <b>and</b> features, implicate efficient human information-processing, even in a small study. The results was ambiguous because the quantitative part of the investigation didn’t show any significant differences, whereas the qualitative showed that people prefer a dynamic document {{with a high degree of}} <b>informative</b> structures <b>and</b> features over a dynamic document with a low degree of <b>informative</b> structures <b>and</b> features. Even if this study was inconsistent, probably because to few subjects where used, the implication of the research that’s behind it is solid. The field of application of <b>informative</b> structures <b>and</b> features are the design of user interfaces fit for skilled users...|$|R

25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed, Unomásunos reporters were not experienced in investigative journalism as other newspapers in Mexico City. However, as its reporters began {{to specialize in}} certain investigative topics, Unomásuno brought forward elements of readership diversity and professionalism that were not present in the Mexican press of the time. Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, Unomásuno built a reputation among Mexican readers for having an <b>informative</b> <b>and</b> fact-based character. Opinion-based sections, like editorial pages, were reduced while private advertisements grew. Unomásuno was categorized for having a center-left or left-wing orientation. Unomásuno {{was one of the}} leading independent leftist newspapers in Mexico. The newspaper tended to give a closer view of Mexico's daily life. It discussed the issues in rural sector and in unions, topics that were discussed with less frequency in other media outlets. Unomásuno also published articles about feminism, machismo, LBGT movements, and the rights of domestic workers. It did not shy away from using profanity and denouncing the government.|$|E

25|$|Breakfast Time was {{the first}} BBC breakfast programme, with Ron Neil as producer. It was {{conceived}} {{in response to the}} plans of the commercial television company TV-am to introduce a breakfast television show. Breakfast Times first broadcast was on 17 January 1983 and was presented by Frank Bough, Selina Scott, Nick Ross and Russell Grant. The atmosphere of the set was intended to encourage a relaxed informality; a set that mimicked a living-room rather than a studio, with red leather sofas, and Bough and Ross wearing jumpers and open-necked shirts. This allowed for an unconventional mix of authoritative and highbrow news and <b>informative</b> <b>and</b> entertainment features that made the show dominate the new genre and trounce the anticipated threat by the star-name commercial TV rival. So, a senior government minister might be subjected to intense questioning while sitting on the red sofa, to be then included in the presentation of a food cooking demonstration. Breakfast Time lasted 150 minutes, initially being transmitted between 6.30 am and 9 ammoving to a 6.50 am to 9.20 am slot on 18 February 1985.|$|E
25|$|Although Cather {{began her}} writing {{career as a}} journalist, she made a {{distinction}} between journalism, which she saw as being primarily <b>informative,</b> <b>and</b> literature, which she saw as an art form. Cather's work is often marked by its nostalgic tone, her subject matter and themes drawn from memories of her early years on the American plains. Some critics have charged Cather with being {{out of touch with}} her times and failing to use more experimental techniques, such as stream of consciousness, in her writing. However, others have pointed out that Cather could follow no other literary path but her own: She had formed and matured her ideas on art before she wrote a novel. She had no more reason to follow Gertrude Stein and James Joyce, whose work she respected, than they did to follow her. Her style solves the problems in which she was interested. She wanted to stand midway between the journalists whose omniscient objectivity accumulate more fact than any character could notice and the psychological novelist whose use of subjective point of view stories distorts objective reality. She developed her theory on a middle ground, selecting facts from experience on the basis of feeling and then presenting the experience in a lucid, objective style. Cather's style is not the accumulative cataloguing of the journalists, nor the fragmentary atomism of psychological associations.|$|E

Justin Chang, writing for Variety, said that the film [...] "restores a sense of wonder, terror and possibility {{to the big screen}} that should inspire awe among critics and audiences worldwide". Richard Corliss of Time praised Cuarón for playing [...] "daringly and dexterously with point-of-view: at one moment you're inside Ryan's helmet as she surveys the bleak silence, then in a subtle shift you're outside to gauge her reaction.

500|$|Yardley {{worked as}} a wine {{merchant}} outside cricket. After his retirement from playing he {{worked as a}} cricket journalist and served as an expert summariser on Test Match Special from 1956 until 1969, as well as in 1973. According to David Frith, the only time he was moved to express severe disapproval was when Brian Close was dismissed after a poor shot in the Fourth Test in 1961 at Old Trafford; this was part of a final-day England collapse that handed Australia the match and a 2–1 series win after the hosts had been on course for victory and the series lead. Trevor Bailey, who was a colleague in the commentary box for the later part of Yardley's time with Test Match Special, wrote: [...] "I always considered Norman Yardley to be an ideal summariser: accurate, <b>informative</b> <b>and</b> very sensible, and able to explain not only what happened but also the reasons why. His knowledge about pitches, tactics and the technicalities of the game was exceptional... Articulate, expert, and possessing considerable charge , I thought his interpretation of events on the field and his post-session summaries were sound, balanced and never less than fair." ...|$|E

French magazine Elle reviewer Natalie Aspesi pronounced it one of [...] "the most exhilarating and extraordinary novels in recent years". Aspesi, however, tagged the novel's title as [...] "most curious and least appealing". Praising the novel in his review for The Guardian, Ian Samson wrote that [...] "The Elegance of the Hedgehog aspires to be great and pretends to philosophy: it is, at least, charming." [...] In an earlier review in the same paper, Groskop opined that the novel is a [...] "profound but accessible book... which elegantly treads the line between literary and commercial fiction". She added that [...] "clever, <b>informative</b> <b>and</b> moving, it is essentially a crash course in philosophy interwoven with a platonic love story". A review in The Telegraph conjectured that [...] "f [...] a piece of furniture, it would be an Ikea bestseller: popular, but not likely to be passed down the generations". A review in The Times Literary Supplement went further, calling the book [...] "pretentious and cynical, with barely any story. It reads more like a tract than a novel, but lacks even a tract’s certainty of purpose. The characters are problematic: most are puppets, and those that aren’t are stereotypes".|$|E
