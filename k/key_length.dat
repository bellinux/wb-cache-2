25|$|According to {{professor}} Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process {{which started in}} 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a <b>key</b> <b>length</b> of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to be secure for at least 15 years. It is now believed that 128 bits would in fact also still be secure until the advent of quantum computing. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he {{was told by the}} British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a <b>key</b> <b>length</b> of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a <b>key</b> <b>length</b> of 54 bits.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the repetitions of VHVS is 18. Assuming that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, this implies that the key is 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. The {{distance between}} the repetitions of QUCE is 30 characters. This means that the <b>key</b> <b>length</b> could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. By taking the intersection of these sets one could safely conclude that the most likely <b>key</b> <b>length</b> is 6, since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{weakness}} of the Vigenère cipher is the repeating nature of its key. If a cryptanalyst correctly guesses the key's length, then the cipher text can be treated as interwoven Caesar ciphers, which individually are easily broken. The Kasiski examination and Friedman test can help determine the <b>key</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{improvement}} to the Kasiski examination, {{known as}} Kerckhoffs' method, matches each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies {{to discover the}} key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is known, the cryptanalyst can simply decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs' method is not applicable when the Vigenère table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still {{be used to determine}} <b>key</b> <b>length</b> in that case.|$|E

Use of rainbow tables reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some password recovery software {{can not only}} remove a password, but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the password strength.|$|E

40|$|A new {{generalised}} {{approach for}} multiple correlated sources over a wiretap network is investigated. A basic model {{consisting of two}} correlated sources where each produce {{a component of the}} common information is initially investigated. There are several cases that consider wiretapped syndromes on the transmission links and based on these cases a new quantity, the information leakage at the source/s is determined. An interesting feature of the models described in this paper is the information leakage quantification. Shannon's cipher system with eavesdroppers is incorporated into the two correlated sources model to minimize <b>key</b> <b>lengths.</b> These aspects of quantifying information leakage and reducing <b>key</b> <b>lengths</b> using Shannon's cipher system are also considered for a multiple correlated source network approach.

25|$|A GSM {{transmission}} is organised as sequences of bursts. In a typical channel {{and in one}} direction, one burst is sent every 4.615 milliseconds and contains 114 bits available for information. A5/1 is used to produce for each burst a 114 bit sequence of keystream which is XORed with the 114 bits prior to modulation. A5/1 is initialised using a 64-bit key together with a publicly known 22-bit frame number. Older fielded GSM implementations using Comp128v1 for key generation, had 10 of the key bits fixed at zero, resulting in an effective <b>key</b> <b>length</b> of 54 bits. This weakness was rectified {{with the introduction of}} Comp128v2 which yields proper 64 bits keys. When operating in GPRS / EDGE mode, higher bandwidth radio modulation allows for larger 348 bits frames, and A5/3 is then used in a stream cipher mode to maintain confidentiality.|$|E
