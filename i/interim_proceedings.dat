40|$|The {{following}} transcript contains submissions {{made before}} the Chief Justice of the High Court in proceedings between the Minister for the Arts (Applicant) and The Artful Interlocutor (Respondent) {{with respect to a}} proposed exhibition by the Respondent entitled ‘The Pensive Provocateur’. In <b>interim</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the Respondent averred that the proposed exhibition sought to ‘explore the potential for photomediated painting to antagonise normative constructions of state sovereignty’. The Applicant objected, arguing that the Respondent’s claim of a relationship between the proposed exhibition and any wider socio-political significance was specious and that the proposed exhibition was ipso facto of nugatory cultural value. An interim order was granted in favour of the Applicant requiring the Respondent to show cause. The Respondent bases its present submissions on a critical inquiry into the value of image-based art production within the broader context of contemporary image representation and reception. Referencing, in particular, Jacques Rancière’s elaboration of image-based artworks in the ‘aesthetic regime’, the Respondent hypothesises that ‘pensive’ imagery – including the photomediated painting in question – has the capacity to complicate vernacular modes of representation and reception that gird normative constructions of state sovereignty. Arguments in support contend that the Respondent’s work evinces a capacity to circulate multiple forms of indeterminacy – herein referred to as ontological, narrative, and operative – via the exploitation of processes of translation, montage and fictionalisation. Mr Brandis QC appears for himself, the Minister for the Arts. Mr Barnard appears for himself, The Artful Interlocutor. By order of the Court...|$|E

Konvencije za zaštitu ljudskih prava i temeljnih sloboda (pravo na pošteno suđenje). U presudi Micallef protiv Malte (2009.) Veliko vijeće ustanovilo je mjerila za ispitivanje suglasnosti prigovora o privremenim mjerama s člankom 6., stavkom 1. Konvencije ratione materiae. To se ispitivanje u praksi naziva provedbom testa Micallef. U radu se obrazlažu razlozi promjene sudske prakse Europskog suda u tom pitanju te se objašnjava način na koji se provodi test Micallef. In {{the case}} of Micallef v. Malta (judgment [GC], no. 17056 / 06, 15 October 2009) the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter {{referred}} to as “the Court”) no longer finds it justified to automatically characterise injunction proceedings as non-determinative of civil rights or obligations. Nor is the Court convinced that a defect in such proceedings would necessarily be remedied at a later stage, namely, in proceedings on the merits governed by Article 6 since any prejudice suffered in the meantime may by then have become irreversible and with little realistic opportunity to redress the damage caused, except perhaps {{for the possibility of}} pecuniary compensation. In the Micallef judgment the Court thus considered that the fact that interim decisions which also determine civil rights and obligations were not protected by Article 6 under the Convention calls for a new approach, and that a change in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s case law is necessary. However, not all interim measures determine “civil rights and obligations” for the purpose of Article 6. So, the applicability of Article 6 will depend on whether certain conditions are fulfilled. First, the right at stake in both the main and the injunction proceedings should be “civil” within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 of the Convention. Second, the nature of the interim measure, its object and purpose as well as its effects on the right in question should be scrutinised. Whenever an interim measure can be considered effectively to determine civil right or obligation at stake, notwithstanding the length of time it is in force, Article 6 will be applicable. However, in exceptional cases – where, for example, the effectiveness of the measure sought depends upon a rapid decision-making process – it may not be possible immediately to comply with all of the requirements of Article 6. Thus, in such specific cases, while the independence and impartiality of the tribunal or the judge concerned is an indispensable and inalienable safeguard in such proceedings, other procedural safeguards may apply only to the extent compatible with the nature and purpose of the <b>interim</b> <b>proceedings</b> at issue. In any subsequent proceedings before the Court, it will fall to the Government to establish that, in view of the purpose of the proceedings at issue in a given case, one or more specific procedural safeguards could not be applied without unduly prejudicing the attainment of the objectives sought by the interim measure in question...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{principles}} articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue and re-iterated in R. v. Ipeelee are being interpreted and implemented at the bail phase {{in a manner that}} exacerbates, rather than ameliorates the systemic failures {{of the criminal justice system}} in its dealings with Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people are grossly over-represented in Canadian prisons including those being detained in remand custody. It is now settled that the principles expressed in Gladue are applicable outside of the context of sentencing and in many jurisdictions have been found to be applicable to judicial <b>interim</b> release <b>proceedings.</b> Reviewing the existing bail jurisprudence involving Aboriginal accused persons, I uncover the ways that Gladue is being applied and misapplied. I also consider how the current crisis in the bail system in Canada disproportionately impacts Aboriginal people and how judicial consideration of Gladue and bail has not alleviated this crisis. The paper concludes with a proposal for a more robust framework for the interpretation of Gladue in judicial <b>interim</b> release <b>proceedings...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{follow-up}} to a {{survey conducted by the}} author in the framework of Euro-Comp-Aid, a networking programme co-funded by the European Commission, DG Competition, and directed by the author. Several experts, mainly from National Competition Authorities (NCAs) of the EU Member States, answered a questionnaire drafted by the author of the study. The study reflects on some of the most interesting results of the survey, as to the actual impact of cooperation tools provided for by Article 15 of Regulation 1 / 2003. It also addresses {{the ways in which the}} legal systems of Member States complement Article 15 cooperation tools especially as concerns NCAs. Such national mechanisms of cooperation between courts dealing with private enforcement cases and public enforcement authorities are assessed by taking into account their soundness in the framework of the modernization and decentralization of EU competition law and some concerns about possible inconsistencies with the system designed by Article 267 TFEU. Due account is also taken of the role played by NCA public enforcement findings before civil courts dealing with private enforcement follow-on actions. First of all, the article analyzes the effective role as amicus curiae role played by the German Bundeskartellamt before German courts, stressing on the other side the unsatisfactory consideration German Supreme Court gives to the preliminary ruling mechanism. Then, the French Autorité de la Concurrence position as an amicus curiae is considered, noting in particular the interesting French approach to disclosure of public enforcement files, strictly intertwined with the amicus curiae role of the Authority; another issue which gives interesting hints on a question of general interest in the field, is that of coordination between NCA and Commission's interventions before national Courts. The focus is then on British NCAs role as amici curiae, where the more general question is addressed of the relationship between general courts and specialized competition courts entrusted with judicial review over NCA acts, in light of the decentralized nature of the EU competition law enforcement system, and of the sincere cooperation principle of EU law. Again, as for the German approach, an unsatisfactory consideration of Art. 267 TFEU procedures is observed. The Italian model is then analyzed, based on a strict separation between administrative and judicial functions, which requires a strict reading of the res indicate effect of EC decisions and will eventually make the enactment of the enforcement directive a quite delicate issue. As for the French approach, the usefulness of resorting to general tools of the law of evidence is stressed, instead of relying too much on (not satisfactory) tools of direct cooperation. The position of the Spanish Comisión Nacional de la Competencia in the EU decentralized system of competition law enforcement is then taken into consideration, by stressing not only the active role public enforcement authorities can have before Spanish civil courts, but also the useful assistance they can provide to courts in damage assessment. The complementarity between special EU law cooperation tools, and general tools provided for by national law is then highlighted when it comes to the assessment of the Swedish legal system; at the same time, the analysis of Swedish practice shows the decisive role such cooperation might have in <b>interim</b> <b>proceedings,</b> as well as the risks inherent in such situations. Further, some other Member State legal systems are taken into account, that seem to have gone further than EU law itself in providing for cooperation between civil courts entrusted with private enforcement and public enforcement agencies, by setting some forms of reinforced and even structural connection between the two sides of competition law enforcement. This is the case of Malta, Latvia and Romania. In all of these Member States, a system is put in place, which goes to a certain extent beyond the model of smooth cooperation outlined by Article 15 Regulation 1 / 03. Such approaches might favor the effectiveness of EU competition law enforcement. In some cases, however, the risks arises of compromising the unitary character of EU competition law. The role of preliminary rulings proceedings under art. 267 TFEU remains therefore essential. Czech, Slovakian, Luxembourgish and Bulgarian systems are finally considered. Besides making apparent obvious differences existing among various Member States, the study shows the need for a more comprehensive and coherent approach to cooperation between courts dealing with private enforcement cases and administrative authorities entrusted with public enforcement powers. It also shows the need to preserve the European Court of Justice’s role in ensuring the uniform interpretation of EU competition law, which some national approaches risk jeopardizing...|$|E
