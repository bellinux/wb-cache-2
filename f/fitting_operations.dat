Current solutions to the indoor localization problem are either both highly unreliable and inaccurate (like GPS based systems), or hugely expensive (such as the iGPS system).

The idea of the fast MEEMD is very simple.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new, robust, curvature estimator. It is based on ”fitting ” circular segments to a curve using a generalised Radon transform. The key step in the approach is that the <b>fitting</b> <b>operation</b> is not done in the original image, but in a transformed version, called Orientation Space. The original curve is transformed into another curve in Orientation Space. Apart from the original spatial dimensions, Orientation Space has one extra dimension: orientation. A given point on the curve in Orientation Space contains information both about the original position of the point, {{but also about the}} orientation of that point. This explicit representation of orientation allows us to incorporate it as a contraint in the fitting stage, where curves corresponding to circular segments in the original image are fitted to the data. The estimated curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of the best fitting segment. The method performs well on noisy (synthetic) data and should work correctly on intersecting curves as well. The performance of the estimator has not yet been compared to existing approaches in the litature.

40|$|An {{important}} yet challenging {{problem in}} understanding indoor scene is recovering indoor frame structure from a monocular image. It {{is more difficult}} when occlusions and illumination vary, and object boundaries are weak. To overcome these difficulties, a new approach based on line segment refinement with two constraints is proposed. First, the line segments are refined by four consecutive operations, i. e., reclassifying, connecting, fitting, and voting. Specifically, misclassified line segments are revised by the reclassifying operation, some short line segments are joined by the connecting operation, the undetected key line segments are recovered by the <b>fitting</b> <b>operation</b> {{with the help of}} the vanishing points, the line segments converging on the frame are selected by the voting operation. Second, we construct four frame models according to four classes of possible shooting angles of the monocular image, the natures of all frame models are introduced via enforcing the cross ratio and depth constraints. The indoor frame is then constructed by fitting those refined line segments with related frame model under the two constraints, which jointly advance the accuracy of the frame. Experimental results on a collection of over 300 indoor images indicate that our algorithm has the capability of recovering the frame from complex indoor scenes. Comment: 39 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
30|$|After {{modeling}} the driving distance estimation {{as shown in}} Eqs. (7) and (16), it is indispensable to estimate {{the parameters of the}} model.

We selected the experimental data on 65 discharge processes, which were applied to implement the <b>fitting</b> <b>operation</b> of parameter k and driving speed, as shown in Fig.  3, to estimate the parameters. The driving speed can be directly obtained through the data. The corresponding parameter k can be used to determine the driving distance through Eq. (6) and fixed SOCt. According to Eq.

Based on the values of parameter k in the transformed experimental data on 65 discharge processes, fixed SOCt, Eqs.

30|$|To {{study the}} {{decreasing}} trend in monthly 137 Cs atmospheric deposition {{caused by the}} FDNPP accident and to make future projections, a curve was fitted on the temporal trends using multiple components. A drawing software was employed, and the <b>fitting</b> <b>operation</b> was put through 100 iterations, each time changing the initial value so that the calculation results would converge, as shown in Fig.  6. A trinomial exponential function of the form a[*]×[*](e−k×t) was applied to fit the data (where a is a constant and k is an inverted time scale; Ln 2 /T 1 / 2), and the individual half-times (T 1, T 2, and T 3 in Fig.  6) were approximately 5.9 (± 11  %) days, 16 (± 18  %) days, and 1.1 (± 32  %) years, respectively. The relative uncertainty is shown in parentheses. These appear to correspond to the time scale of (1) {{the reduction in the}} original FDNPP accident surge (primary emission source), (2) the tropospheric transportation and diffusion of the radioactive plume (equivalent to the removal of radioactive aerosols from the atmosphere), and (3) the emission intensity of re-suspension (secondary emission sources). We posit that some primary radiological release to the atmosphere continues because the FDNPP is not isolated from the neighboring environment (Hirose 2013; TEPCO 2012). The results, then, cannot be assumed to be completely free of primary release. However, the first and second terms can be reasonable estimates corresponding to the primary emission and tropospheric aerosol residence, respectively.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to foreground removal for CMB maps. Rather than relying on prior knowledge about the foreground components, we first extract the necessary information about them directly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature maps at different frequencies. These difference maps, which we refer to as internal templates, consist only of linear combinations of Galactic foregrounds and noise, with no CMB component. We obtain the foreground-cleaned maps by fitting these internal templates to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriately scaled contributions of them from, the CMB-dominated channels. The <b>fitting</b> <b>operation</b> is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at high resolution with only a minor loss of precision. Applying this procedure to the WMAP data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by the WMAP team at the signal-dominated scales. The fact that we obtain basically identical results without using any external templates has considerable relevance for future observations of the CMB polarization, where very {{little is known about the}} Galactic foregrounds. Finally, we have revisited previous claims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales and confirm that these remain unchanged with this completely different approach to foreground separation. This also holds when fitting the foreground contribution independently to the northern and southern hemisphere, indicating that the asymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties of the hemispheres.

We present a robust computerized scheme to automatically segment freehand sketches into a series of components with specific geometric meaning regardless of whether these are generated online or offline. This task is a necessary first step toward sketch understanding. By exploiting the interpolation / extrapolation characteristic of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs), a greedy algorithm consisting of forward and backward operations is proposed for finding the minimum set of segmentation points {{that can be used to}} reconstruct with high fitting accuracy freehand sketches in the form of implicit functions. To obtain segmentation points, a simple angle based rule is used to remove “bridging ” points that provide a smooth transition between consecutive sketch components. Feasibility of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by a preliminary performance assessment study using ten computer generated drawings. These experiments show that in this dataset sensitivity of the segmentation was higher than 97. 5 % with a false positive (FP) rate of approximately 25 %. The majority of false positive identifications are located on arc regions where a larger number of segmentation points are needed for reconstruction purposes. The primary contribution of this algorithm is that it transforms an ambiguous problem namely, freehand sketch segmentation, into an implicit function <b>fitting</b> <b>operation.</b> Therefore, this proposed approach has several advantages including independence of the actual sketching activity, and the ability for a satisfactory detection of the transition point between a line and an arc or between two arcs.
