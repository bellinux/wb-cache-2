Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he <b>drove</b> <b>home,</b> he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{war ended}} in 1411 with the Peace of Thorn, in which neither Poland nor Lithuania <b>drove</b> <b>home</b> their {{negotiating}} {{advantage to the}} full, much to the discontent of the Polish nobles. Poland regained Dobrzyń Land, Lithuania regained Samogitia, and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the Wkra river. Most of the Teutonic Order's territory, however, including towns that had surrendered, remained intact. Władysław then proceeded to release many high-ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms. The cumulative expense of the ransoms, however, proved a drain on the Order's resources. This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław's regime after 1411, further fuelled by the granting of Podolia, disputed between Poland and Lithuania, to Vytautas, and by the king's two-year absence in Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} series, Grand Rapids swept Kalamazoo {{in the best}} of three game set, by the scores of 5–2 and 4–1. In Game 1, Studnicka started for Grand Rapids and allowed only two runs in eight innings of work. With the score tied 2–2 going into the fourth inning, the Chicks scored three runs off Lassies’ pitcher Gloria Cordes. With the bases loaded, Ziegler <b>drove</b> <b>home</b> one run with a {{sacrifice}} fly to put the score in favor of Grand Rapids, 3–2. Another sacrifice fly by Inez Voyce and a RBI single by Joyce Ricketts extended the lead to 5–2. When the Lassies first two batters reached base in the final inning, manager English brought Eleanor Moore to the rescue. She promptly retired the next three batters in order, striking out Isabel Alvarez, retiring Dorothy Schroeder with a pop fly to shortstop Ziegler, and inducing June Peppas on a sharp grounder to the mound throwing to Voyce at first base for the final out of the game.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to ride in}} Canada, Kelly {{rode the}} 1976 Tour of Britain {{and then went to}} Metz, in France, after a London enthusiast, Johnny Morris, had {{arranged}} an invitation. The club offered him £25 a week, free accommodation and four francs a kilometre for every race he won. Kelly won 18 of the 25 races he started in France and won the amateur Giro di Lombardia in Italy. That impressed two French team managers, Jean de Gribaldy and Cyrille Guimard. De Gribaldy went to Ireland unannounced to discuss a contract with the Flandria professional team. He didn't know where Kelly lived and wasn't sure he would recognise him. He took with him another cyclist, to point out Kelly and translate the conversation. Kelly was out driving a tractor and de Gribaldy set out again in the taxi that had brought him from Dublin, hoping to find Kelly as he <b>drove</b> <b>home.</b> They found him and went to Kelly's stepbrother's house. De Gribaldy offered £4,000 a year plus bonuses. A week later Kelly asked for £6,000 and got it. He signed for de Gribaldy with misgivings about going back on his promise to return to Metz, where the club had offered him better terms than before.|$|E

500|$|One of Walker's tasks was {{to rewrite}} the {{bombardment}} text. He felt it was flawed because it failed to drive home {{what he saw as}} the most important fact, that [...] "bombardment aviation is the basic arm of the air force". Following the views of air power theorists Billy Mitchell, Hugh Trenchard, and Giulio Douhet, Walker enunciated two fundamental principles: that bombardment would take the form of daylight precision bombing; and that it should be directed against critical industrial targets. In his article [...] "Driving Home the Bombardment Attack", published in the Coast Artillery Journal in October 1930, he argued that fighters could not prevent a bombing attack and that [...] "the most efficacious method of stopping a bombardment attack would appear to be an offensive against the bombardment airdrome." [...] The Bomber Mafia argued that bombers flew too high and too fast to be intercepted by fighters, that even if they were intercepted, the bombers had enough firepower to drive off their attackers, and enough armor and resilience to absorb any damage their attackers might attempt to inflict. The Air Corps Tactical School developed a doctrine that became known as industrial web theory, which called for precision attacks against carefully selected critical industrial targets. [...] Walker <b>drove</b> <b>home</b> his belief in bombardment with a famous dictum from his lectures: [...] "A well-organized, well-planned, and well-flown air force attack will constitute an offensive that can not be stopped." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later {{newspaper}} account {{described him as}} an outstanding outfielder who was [...] "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was [...] "the first centerfielder to {{take his eyes off}} a fly ball, run to the spot where it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of [...]253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was [...]284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that <b>drove</b> <b>home</b> Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics.|$|E
500|$|Preparation for All Hope Is Gone {{began in}} 2007. Drummer Joey Jordison explained, [...] "I've {{told them to}} demo {{whatever}} they can so we've got as much material to choose from as possible." [...] In February 2008, Slipknot entered the Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa with producer Dave Fortman. All Hope Is Gone is the band's first album written and recorded in their home state of Iowa. Bassist Paul Gray explained that the band decided to record in Iowa because {{there were too many}} distractions in Los Angeles, where production of their previous albums had taken place. The band also stated that being close to home was good for their mindset; vocalist Corey Taylor <b>drove</b> <b>home</b> every night to see his son. Unlike Slipknot's previous releases, the album's writing process involved all nine band members, who wrote over 30songs. Jordison commented, [...] "I {{have to say that the}} band is at its peak; everyone—I mean everyone—is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing." [...] Taylor felt the writing process had some problems, but also noted that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it after realizing that the conflict helps to bring out their creativity. Taylor and guitarist Jim Root paired up with Sid Wilson, performing on keyboards, and percussionist Shawn Crahan to work on [...] "oblique, arty pieces". Taylor also experimented with tracking in an old well, stating, [...] "There was this natural reverb to it that was just intense." [...] According to Crahan none of the experimental tracks made it onto the album. However, one of them, [...] "Til We Die", appears as a bonus track on the album's special edition along with [...] "Child Of Burning Time" [...] and the similarly experimental Bloodstone Mix of [...] "Vermillion Pt. 2". The track [...] "Sulfur" [...] was the first combined effort of Jordison and Root, who wrote the song in one evening.|$|E
