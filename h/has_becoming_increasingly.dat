Hence, we proposed to utilize a stereo vision sensor as an indoor positioning system for our UAVs.

To address the limitations of bio-medical models of chronic pain, more comprehensive biopsychosocial con-ceptualizations were developed {{to take into account}} a variety of factors (eg, physical, social, cognitive, affective, behavioral, and sociocultural) that can contribute to chronic pain problems [3]. Since the development of these models, research on the psychologic factors associated with chronic pain has flourished, and several psychologically based treatments for pain man-agement have been developed [4].

Klebsiella pneumoniae presents significant clinical challenges, as they are frequently misclassified and highly resistant to all commonly available antimicrobials, leading to delay in treatment and rapid spread in the hospital. With its high sensitivity and significantly reduced price, whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been considered a viable approach to help facilitate the identification of KPC-positive K. pneumonia from patient isolates from gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, evidence for its cost-effectiveness is lacking, which is of high public health significance. Objective: to compare the cost-effectiveness of WGS and the standard of care (SOC, high-level disinfection), in the detection and prevention of KPC-positive K. pneumonia. Methods: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients was simulated for ten years using a four-state Markov model. KPC-positive K. pneumoniae-caused infection-related healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for both the WGS strategy and the SOC strategy.

40|$|Under {{continuous}} {{application of}} high electrical stresses, the insulation system of an underground power cable {{is subjected to}} long-term degradation that can eventually cause premature breakdown of the cable.

These charges will then interact with polymer molecules; causing even more charges to accumulate within the vicinity of the material and thus further deterioration. The interaction of the charges can lead to the dissipation of energy in the form of photons; a process known as electroluminescence (EL). In addition to space charge probing, the measurement of EL <b>has</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>increasingly</b> prominent in understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the early electrical ageing of an insulating material.
