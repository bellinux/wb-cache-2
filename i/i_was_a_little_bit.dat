25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... So I think that they figured that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.|$|E
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E

Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight {{for the first time and}} cut too much weight, weighing in at 201lbs, 4lbs under the 205lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion; [...] "Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter.

[...] However, he admitted firing the gun [...] "frightened" [...] him because [...] "they pack the kick of an elephant" [...] and that he was [...] "terrified" [...] of the dog in the scene. Dean Norris said Plummer used this fear in his performance. The film had a $13 million budget.|$|E
2500|$|The 1984 {{production}} of The Pope's Wedding {{had been seen}} by director Alex Cox, who offered Oldman the part of ill-fated rocker Sid Vicious in the 1986 film Sid and Nancy. He twice turned down the role before accepting it, because, in his own words: [...] "I wasn't really that interested in Sid Vicious and the punk movement. I'd never followed it. It wasn't something that interested me. The script I felt was banal and 'who cares' and 'why bother' and all of that. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> sort-of with my nose {{in the air and}} sort-of thinking 'well the theatre – so much more superior' and all of that." [...] He reconsidered based on the salary and the urging of his agent. In 1987, Oldman gained his third starring film role as Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears, for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor. That same year, he appeared in the plays The Country Wife (William Wycherley) and Serious Money (Caryl Churchill). Director Luc Besson told how, on the set of The Fifth Element (1997), Oldman could recite any scene from Hamlet (William Shakespeare), in which he had starred a decade earlier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{role was}} recast with Jacob Young, {{who had left}} his role as Rick Forrester on The Bold and the Beautiful. Angela Shapiro, at the time President of ABC Daytime, stated: [...] "It is {{challenging}} to cast a character as intense and compelling as Lucky Spencer. We are fortunate to find a young actor with Jacob's charisma and talent." [...] Young assumed the role on February 25, 2000, almost a year after Jackson's last appearance, speculated to {{be an attempt to}} ease the transition between characters due to Jackson's popularity. Young commented: [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> insecure about (taking the role after Jackson). But now that I've started to think about it, Lucky was such a great character, and Jonathan did such a great job that (fans) wanted him to come back. (Lucky) being in such demand, I think it was great that it opened up and allowed someone else to come in and give this character a shot." [...] In November 2000, Young guest starred on the FOX network sketch comedy series MADtv, making a small cameo appearance as the character. That December, Young announced he would not be renewing his contract, and last appeared on February 10, 2003. He cited a desire to pursue music and film work at the time, later admitting monetary contract disagreements as the reason he left.|$|E
