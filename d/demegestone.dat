50|$|Trimegestone {{is closely}} related {{structurally}} to the 19-norprogesterone and 17α-methylprogesterone derivatives <b>demegestone</b> and promegestone and {{is also known as}} 21-hydroxypromegestone. It is also related to the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate and to the 17α-methylprogesterone derivative medrogestone.|$|E
5000|$|... 19-Norpregnane, {{also known}} as 13β-methyl-17β-ethylgonane, is a norsteroid and the 19-demethyl {{analogue}} of pregnane. It is the parent compound of 19-norprogesterone (19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione) and derivatives of it such as the progestins <b>demegestone,</b> gestonorone caproate (gestronol hexanoate), nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, promegestone, segesterone acetate (nestorone), and trimegestone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Demegestone</b> (INN) (brand name Lutionex), {{also known}} as 17α-methyl-Δ9-19-norprogesterone or 17α-methyl-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3,20-dione, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 19-norprogesterone group which was introduced by Roussel in France in 1974. Like other 19-norprogesterone derivatives, it has relatively high affinity for the progesterone receptor and shows little or no activity at other steroid hormone receptors.|$|E
5000|$|... 19-Norprogesterone is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of medically used progestins, which includes nomegestrol acetate, promegestone, trimegestone, <b>demegestone,</b> gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), and norgestomet (veterinary). In addition, the testosterone analogue of 19-norprogesterone, 19-nortestosterone (also known as nandrolone), is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and progestogen, and is the parent compound of a large group of AAS and progestins that includes norethisterone.|$|E
50|$|Gestonorone caproate, {{also known}} as norhydroxyprogesterone caproate, 17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone 17α-hexanoate, or 17α-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione 17α-hexanoate, is a {{synthetic}} norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with a hexanoate (caproate) ester at the C17α position. Analogues of gestonorone caproate include algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), <b>demegestone,</b> hydroxyprogesterone caproate, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate (nestorone).|$|E
50|$|Gestadienol acetate, {{also known}} as norhydroxy-δ6-progesterone acetate, 6-dehydro-17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone 17α-acetate, or 17α-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4,6-diene-3,20-dione 17α-acetate, is a {{synthetic}} norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with an acetate ester at the C17α position and a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions. Analogues of gestadienol acetate include algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), <b>demegestone,</b> gestonorone caproate (norhydroxyprogesterone caproate), hydroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate (nestorone).|$|E
50|$|The {{observation}} of two-fold improved potency of 17α-MP relative to progesterone led to {{renewed interest in}} 17α-substituted derivatives of progesterone. Subsequently, hydroxyprogesterone acetate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate were synthesized in 1953 and introduced in 1956 and 1957, respectively, and medroxyprogesterone acetate was discovered in 1956 and introduced in 1959. In addition, though 17α-MP itself was never introduced for medical use, progestogen derivatives of the compound, including medrogestone (1966) and the 19-norprogesterone derivatives <b>demegestone</b> (1974), promegestone (1983), and trimegestone (2001), have been marketed.|$|E
