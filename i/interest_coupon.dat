5000|$|The Court {{reasoned}} that the power to dispose of income {{is the equivalent of}} ownership. Because he was able to separate the interest coupons from the bonds and procure payment of the interest to his son, Paul Horst enjoyed the economic benefits of the income. The court stated “the taxpayer has equally enjoyed the fruits of his labor or investment and obtained the satisfaction of his desires whether he collects and uses the income [...] [...] [...] or whether he disposes of his right to collect it[...] [...] [...]” The taxpayer cannot attribute the fruit (the <b>interest</b> <b>coupon)</b> to a different tree from that on which it grew (the bond itself). If Horst had given both the bond and the interest coupons to his son, the interest would have been taxable to his son.|$|E

50|$|A swap is a {{derivative}} {{in which two}} counterparties exchange cash flows of one party's financial instrument for {{those of the other}} party's financial instrument. The benefits in question depend on the type of financial instruments involved. For example, {{in the case of a}} swap involving two bonds, the benefits in question can be the periodic <b>interest</b> (<b>coupon)</b> payments associated with such bonds. Specifically, two counterparties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows against another stream. These streams are called the legs of the swap. The swap agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way they are accrued and calculated. Usually at the time when the contract is initiated, at least one of these series of cash flows is determined by an uncertain variable such as a floating interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity price, or commodity price.|$|E

The society perception is an interpretation based on environment data collected that absorbed by human sense as initiative taking of communication process, while obligation is a medium – long term debenture that can be sell and buy in which the obligation contain promise of the issuer to pay the compensation such as <b>interest</b> (<b>coupon)</b> in certain period. The method of analysis applied in this research is a descriptive analysis and simple linier regression method. This research use the secondary data that collected in documentation study and processed statistically by SPSS program for windonws. The result of research indicates that the society perception has a negative influence and is not significant to the obligation in Indonesia.

50|$|The {{modified}} Dietz {{method is}} a measure of the ex post (i.e. historical) performance of an investment portfolio in the presence of external flows. (External flows are movements of value such as transfers of cash, securities or other instruments in or out of the portfolio, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as <b>interest,</b> <b>coupons</b> or dividends.) To calculate the modified Dietz return, divide the gain or loss in value, net of external flows, by the average capital over the period of measurement. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage return over the holding period. The average capital weights individual cash flows by the amount of time from when those cash flows occur until the end of the period.|$|R

40|$|When an {{underwriting}} syndicate submits {{a bid for}} a {{new issue}} of municipal bonds, {{one of the important}} decisions that it must make involves the scheduling of <b>interest</b> <b>coupons</b> to be placed on the bonds. Given the bid specifications stated by the issuing municipality and some prior decisions of the underwriters, it is shown that the determination of the optimal coupon schedule can be expressed as a linear programming problem. Since this LP problem has a special structure, a simple computational algorithm requiring less computation than the simplex method is derived. This paper goes beyond previous contributions to the literature in three important ways. First, simple formulas for obtaining the dual evaluators are developed; the marginal effect of shifts in the yield curve is also presented. Second, it is shown that in the non-integer year case both the conclusions of previous writers and the conventional heuristics of the market may be erroneous, whereas the general solution techniques developed in this paper remain valid. Finally, a direct analogy between the coupon schedule problem and the microeconomic theory of the firm is used in obtaining the special computational algorithm for this LP problem. ...|$|R

The three annual 2 1 / 4 % <b>interest</b> <b>coupons</b> of the Winterthur Insurance {{convertible}} bond (face value Chf 4 700) {{will only be}} paid out if during their corresponding observation periods no major storm or hail storm on one single day damages at least 6 000 motor vehicles insured with Winterthur Insurance.

Using a constant-parameter model, the estimated discounted value of the three Wincat coupons together is Chf 263. 29. A conservative evaluation, which accounts for the standard deviation of the estimate, gives a coupon value of Chf 238. 25. However, fitting models which admit a trend or a change-point, leads to substantially higher knock-out probabilities of the coupons. The estimated discounted values of the coupons can drop below the above conservative value; a conservative evaluation as above leads to substantially lower values. Hence, already the model uncertainty is higher than the standard deviations of the used estimators. This shows the dominance of the model risk.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the term {{structure}} of interest rates. We show that the term structure of interest rates is a static function that relates the term to maturity to the yield to maturity for a sam- ple of bonds at a given point of time. We also short describe four mainstream theories attempt to explain {{the shape of the}} yield curve. The yield curve is a basic instrument for understanding the relationship between the interest rate of bonds and the maturity of a financial instrument. It has the same relevance for all economic subjects in the form of interest rates determination. Estimation of the term structure discussed in the paper involves obtaining zero <b>coupon</b> <b>interest</b> rates, or discount functions from a set of coupon bond prices. The bootstrapping method is used here to determinate the particular zero <b>coupon</b> <b>interest</b> rates of bonds, where the method consists of iteratively extracting zero <b>coupon</b> <b>interest</b> rates using a sequence of increasing maturity coupon bond prices. Using these rates it becomes possible to derive interest rates for all maturities by making a few assumptions including linear in- terpolation as we discuss in conclusion of this paper. The particular spot and forward zero <b>coupon</b> <b>interest</b> rates resulting from the bootstrapping method can be used as input in different economic categories like financial management, portfolio management, actuary science, company valuation, management of firm value, financial risk management, etc. The matrix approach derived and described in this paper can be used instead of solving the zero coupon rates sequentially for obtaining a direct solution with particular zero coupon rates. This helps us to diminish the computing severity related to the sequential determination of interest rates using an iterative approach. Fortunately, however, the application of matrix theory helps us to solve this issue very well...|$|R

The study delves into the cause and effect of a double bind communication transaction and presents the view that double binds are not the result of a paradoxical injunction inherent in the message conveying the double bind, but in the context surrounding the communication transaction.
