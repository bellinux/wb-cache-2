40|$|Processing {{speed is}} an {{important}} contributor to working memory performance and fluid intelligence in young children. Myelinated white matter plays {{a central role in}} brain messaging, and likely mediates processing speed, but {{little is known about the}} relationship between myelination and processing speed in young children. In the present study, processing speed was measured through <b>inspection</b> <b>times,</b> and myelin volume fraction (VFM) was quantified using a multicomponent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach in 2 - to 5 -years of age. Both <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> and VFM were found to increase with age. Greater VFM in the right and left occipital lobes, the body of the corpus callosum, and the right cerebellum was significantly associated with shorter <b>inspection</b> <b>times,</b> after controlling for age. A hierarchical regression showed that VFM in the left occipital lobe predicted <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> over and beyond the effects of age and the VFM in the other brain regions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that myelin supports processing speed in early childhood...|$|R

Short German texts were presented incrementally for self-paced reading, and <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> were recorded for every single word.

Service is provided at a low or high rate, which can be adapted at exponential <b>inspection</b> <b>times.</b> When the number of customers in the system is above a given threshold, the service rate is upgraded to the high rate, otherwise, it is downgraded to the low rate.

We determine the Laplace transform of the stationary sojourn time and describe a procedure to compute all moments as well. First we analyze the special case of continuous inspection, where the service rate immediately changes once the threshold is crossed. Then we extend the analysis to random <b>inspection</b> <b>times.</b> This extension requires {{the development of a new}} methodological tool, that is, matrix generating functions.

The asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of qth quantile at the design stress is derived as an optimality criterion with equally spaced <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> and the optimal allocation of units for two stress levels are determined. Optimality results show that the asymptotic variance of qth quantile at the design stress is insensitive to the number of <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> and to misspecifications of guessed failure probabilities at design and high test stresses.

[...] In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) argues not for increased <b>inspection</b> <b>time,</b> but elimination of the school screenings altogether, with parents being educated and encouraged to inspect their own children at home. [...] This attitude, coupled with the AAP's opposition to the no-nit policy, would essentially absolve school administrators of responsibility to directly manage pediculosis in their student body.|$|E
40|$|As {{aircraft}} structures {{begin to}} age (that is, as flight hours accumulate), existing subcritical cracks or new cracks can grow in some high-stress {{points of the}} structural components. The usual approach is to inspect the structures periodically at certain intervals. Thus, a catastrophic accident during flight can be avoided. The problem then arises of choosing a sequence of <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> which avoids both too many inspections, which may be costly, and too few inspections, which may also be costly due to a crack in aircraft structure component not being detected for a long period. In this paper, a simple approach is proposed, where after each inspection (if crack is not detected) we choose the next inspection point so that a crack may occur within an interval between successive <b>inspection</b> <b>times</b> with a given probability. It allows one to find the inspection policies for detection of initial cracks in critical structural components of aircraft under the assumptions that the parameter values of the underlying distributions are unknown; this constraint is often met in practice. Furthermore, obtaining inspection schedules under crack propagation is considered. To illustrate the proposed technique based on ancillary statistics, numerical examples are given...|$|R
