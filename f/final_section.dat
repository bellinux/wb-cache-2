While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the <b>final</b> <b>section</b> ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, {{the highway}} west of Hessel was shifted to follow an {{alignment}} closer to Lake Huron; the MSHD transferred the former routing of M-134 to local control at that time. In October 1963, the <b>final</b> <b>section</b> of I-75/US2 freeway {{opened in the}} UP; M-134's western terminus was truncated slightly to end at the new freeway instead of the former routing of US2 along Mackinac Trail.

5|$|The bulk of {{the route}} runs through forested areas, {{especially}} near the Učka range and near Pazin, with agricultural land in between those areas– most of it located between the Ivoli and Lupoglav interchanges.

The route crosses no major watercourses, although creeks adjacent to or spanned by the route drain into the Pazinčica and Boljunčica rivers, or directly into the Adriatic Sea {{in the case of}} watercourses flowing down Učka's eastern slopes. The Učka Tunnel contains a spring discovered during its construction and used for the water supply of Opatija ever since.|$|E
