5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized <b>iatrogenic</b> traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle {{occupants}} {{who wear}} seat belts {{have a lower}} incidence of TBI after a motor vehicle accident. However, if the strap is situated {{across the front of}} the neck (instead of the chest), this increases the risk of tracheal injury. Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent <b>iatrogenic</b> TBI, and medical practitioners can use techniques that reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as tracheotomy.|$|E
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most <b>iatrogenic</b> injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the incidence of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true incidence. However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The incidence is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an incidence of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The incidence of <b>iatrogenic</b> TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the incidence may be as high as 15%.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{an adverse}} event, an <b>iatrogenic</b> effect {{is not always}} harmful. For example, a scar created by surgery {{is said to be}} <b>iatrogenic</b> even though it does not {{represent}} improper care and may not be troublesome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Iatrogenic</b> {{conditions}} do {{not necessarily}} result from medical errors, such as mistakes made in surgery, or the prescription or dispensing of the wrong therapy, such as a drug. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes adverse effects of a medical treatment are <b>iatrogenic.</b> For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy — necessarily aggressive for therapeutic effect — frequently produce such <b>iatrogenic</b> effects as hair loss, hemolytic anemia, diabetes insipidus, vomiting, nausea, brain damage, lymphedema, infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is <b>iatrogenic,</b> {{as in the case}} of diabetes consequential to the removal of all or part of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|Chest trauma {{leading to}} aortic {{dissection}} {{can be divided}} into two groups based on cause: blunt chest trauma (commonly seen in car accidents) and <b>iatrogenic.</b> <b>Iatrogenic</b> causes include trauma during cardiac catheterization or due to an intra-aortic balloon pump.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of scientific medicine in the 20th century, it could be expected that <b>iatrogenic</b> illness or death would be more easily avoided. Antiseptics, anesthesia, antibiotics, better surgical techniques, evidence-based protocols and best practices continue to be developed to decrease <b>iatrogenic</b> side effects and mortality.|$|E
25|$|A {{very common}} <b>iatrogenic</b> effect {{is caused by}} drug interaction, i.e., when pharmacotherapists fail to check for all {{medications}} a patient is taking and prescribe new ones that interact agonistically or antagonistically (potentiate or attenuate the intended therapeutic effect). Such situations can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions to drugs, even when unexpected by pharmacotherapists, are also classified as <b>iatrogenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is <b>iatrogenic</b> as well. Bacteria strains resistant to antibiotics have evolved {{in response to}} the overprescription of antibiotic drugs.|$|E
25|$|Dysphagia may {{manifest}} as {{the result}} of autonomic nervous system pathologies including stroke and ALS, or due to rapid <b>iatrogenic</b> correction of an electrolyte imbalance.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} figures, iatrogenesis may cause 225,000 deaths {{per year in}} the United States (excluding {{recognizable}} error). An earlier Institute of Medicine report estimated 230,000 to 284,000 <b>iatrogenic</b> deaths annually.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>iatrogenic</b> {{effects are}} clearly defined and easily recognized, {{such as a}} {{complication}} following a surgical procedure (e.g., lymphedema {{as a result of}} breast cancer surgery). Less obvious ones, such as complex drug interactions, may require significant investigation to identify.|$|E
25|$|In mid-April, Manon {{gave her}} mother and {{stepfather}} a private performance in their home. Then, over Holy Week, she suffered breathing problems and organ failure. She had been receiving an aggressive form of diathermy that employed X-ray machines, which can induce <b>iatrogenic</b> complications.|$|E
25|$|It is an <b>iatrogenic</b> disease—an {{adverse effect}} {{resulting}} from medical treatment—that is often underdiagnosed. In general, {{the symptoms of}} the syndrome are a combination of decreased cardiac output, loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling, loss of total peripheral resistance response, and nonphysiologic pressure waves.|$|E
25|$|According to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, {{pressure}} ulcers {{are one of}} {{the eight}} preventable <b>iatrogenic</b> illnesses. If a pressure ulcer is acquired in the hospital the hospital will no longer receive reimbursement for the person's care. Hospitals spend about $5 billion annually for treatment of pressure ulcers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Iatrogenic</b> Cushing's {{syndrome}} (caused by {{treatment with}} corticosteroids) {{is the most}} common form of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's disease is rare; a Danish study found an incidence of less than one case per million people per year. However, asymptomatic microadenomas (less than 10mm in size) of the pituitary are found in about one in six individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of iatrogenesis may be misleading in some cases. For example, ruptured aortic aneurysm is fatal in most cases; the survival rate for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is under 25%. Patients who die {{during or after}} an operation will still be considered as <b>iatrogenic</b> deaths, but the procedure itself remains a better bet than the 100% probability of death if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a slow}} to {{moderate}} rate of disease progression but the patient may have periods of rapid progression ("bursts of destruction"). Chronic periodontitis {{can be associated with}} local predisposing factors(e.g. tooth-related or <b>iatrogenic</b> factors). The disease may be modified by and be associated with systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, HIV infection) It can also be modified by factors other than systemic disease such as smoking and emotional stress.|$|E
25|$|Since {{dry socket}} occurs {{exclusively}} following a dental extraction, {{it could be}} considered both a complication and an <b>iatrogenic</b> condition, {{but this does not}} take into account both the reason why the tooth required extraction (i.e., extraction may have been unavoidable due to significant pain and infection) and also the fact that many dry sockets are the result of poor compliance with postoperative instructions, notably refraining from smoking in the days immediately after the procedure.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2002 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report, about 7,000 {{people were}} {{estimated}} to {{die each year}} from medication errors - about 16 percent more deaths than the number attributable to work-related injuries (6,000 deaths). Medical errors affect one in 10 patients worldwide. One extrapolation suggests that 180,000 people die each year {{partly as a result}} of <b>iatrogenic</b> injury. One in five Americans (22%) report that they or a family member have experienced a medical error of some kind.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{empirical}} days of vaccination, before Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Lister's on antisepsis and asepsis, {{there was considerable}} cross-infection. William Woodville, {{one of the early}} vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter—the vaccine—with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle. In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or <b>iatrogenic</b> illness.|$|E
25|$|The nasal {{lining of}} the distal two-thirds of the nose can be covered with {{anteriorly}} based septal mucosal flaps; however, if bilateral septal-flaps are used, the septal cartilage does become devascularized, possibly from <b>iatrogenic</b> septal perforation. Furthermore, if the nasal defect is beyond the wound-correction scope of a septal mucosal flap, the alternative techniques are either an inferiorly based pericranial-flap (harvested from the frontal bone) or a free flap of temporoparietal fascia (harvested from the head), either {{of which can be}} lined with free grafts of mucosa to achieve the nasal reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the force systems generated by the cantilever, is their high degree of constancy over time and deactivation. In other words, the forces at its two ends, maintain their direction and decrease in a linear manner, proportionally to the cantilever deactivation. In addition, {{there is also a}} high degree of constancy of the MOMENT/FORCE ratio (with respect to the bracket). This means also a homogeneous dental movement. The force system being always directed towards the treatment goal, this is rapidly achievable, with a minimum of round tripping and <b>iatrogenic</b> damage.|$|E
25|$|One review {{warned of}} {{detrimental}} <b>iatrogenic</b> effects of twelve-step philosophy and labeled the organizations as cults, while another review asserts that these programs bore little semblance to religious cults {{and that the}} techniques used appeared beneficial to some. Another study found that a twelve-step program's focus on self-admission of having a problem increases deviant stigma and strips members of their previous cultural identity, replacing it with the deviant identity. Another study asserts that the prior cultural identity may not be replaced entirely, but rather members found adapted a bicultural identity.|$|E
25|$|In his Medical Nemesis, first {{published}} in 1975, also known as Limits to Medicine, Illich subjected contemporary Western medicine to detailed attack. He argued that the medicalization in recent decades {{of so many of}} life's vicissitudes—birth and death, for example—frequently caused more harm than good and rendered many people in effect lifelong patients. He marshalled a body of statistics to show what he considered the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects and drug-induced illness in advanced industrial society. He introduced to a wider public the notion of <b>iatrogenic</b> disease, which had been scientifically established a century earlier by British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820–1910). Others have since voiced similar views.|$|E
25|$|The {{first report}} of {{suspected}} <b>iatrogenic</b> CJD {{was published in}} 1974. Animal experiments showed that corneas of infected animals could transmit CJD, and the causative agent spreads along visual pathways. A second case of CJD associated with a corneal transplant was reported without details. In 1977, CJD transmission caused by silver electrodes previously used in the brain of a person with CJD was first reported. Transmission occurred despite decontamination of the electrodes with ethanol and formaldehyde. Retrospective studies identified four other cases likely of similar cause. The rate of transmission from a single contaminated instrument is unknown, {{although it is not}} 100%. In some cases, the exposure occurred weeks after the instruments were used on a person with CJD.|$|E
25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury). <b>Iatrogenic</b> ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E
25|$|A woman {{develops}} large breasts usually during thelarche (the pubertal breast-development stage), but large breasts {{can also}} develop postpartum, after gaining weight, at menopause, and at any age. Whereas macromastia usually develops in consequence to the hypertrophy (overdevelopment) of adipose fat, {{rather than to}} milk-gland hypertrophy. Moreover, many women are genetically predisposed to developing large breasts, the size and weight of which often are increased either by pregnancy or by weight gain, or by both conditions; there also exist <b>iatrogenic</b> (physician-caused) conditions such as post–mastectomy and post–lumpectomy asymmetry. Nonetheless, it is statistically rare for a young woman to experience virginal mammary hypertrophy that results in massive, oversized breasts, and recurrent breast hypertrophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of Cushing's {{syndrome}} is the taking of glucocorticoids prescribed by a health care practitioner to treat other diseases (called <b>iatrogenic</b> Cushing's syndrome). This can be an effect of corticosteroid treatment of a variety of disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, or in immunosuppression after an organ transplant. Administration of synthetic ACTH is also possible, but ACTH is less often prescribed due to cost and lesser utility. Although rare, Cushing's syndrome can also be due to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. In this form of Cushing's, the adrenal glands atrophy due to lack of stimulation by ACTH, since glucocorticoids downregulate production of ACTH. Cushing's syndrome in childhood usually results from use of glucocorticoid medication.|$|E
25|$|The two parotid glands {{are major}} salivary glands {{wrapped around the}} mandibular ramus in humans. The largest of the salivary glands, they secrete saliva to {{facilitate}} mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes the ptyalin. It enters the oral cavity via the parotid duct or Stensen duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular ramus and anterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any <b>iatrogenic</b> lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity. Mumps, a virus infection, is caused due to infection in parotid salivary gland.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the more}} {{technically}} demanding sex reassignment surgery female-to-male was also offered at Kandang Kerbau Hospital and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic {{were set up}} at the National University Hospital two decades later. It was headed by Prof. S Shan Ratnam {{until his retirement in}} 1995, after which leadership passed to his nephew, Dr. Anandakumar. In fact, for 30 years, Singapore was one of the world leaders in SRS, performing more than 500 such operations. This gave {{a new lease on life}} to the many transgender individuals whose bodies did not match their gender identity. As one consequence of this, Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of transgender people from transvestites to <b>iatrogenic</b> intersex individuals to fully transformed women.|$|E
25|$|Prions, the {{infectious}} agent of CJD, {{may not be}} inactivated by means of routine surgical instrument sterilization procedures. The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, {{it is recommended that}} heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of <b>iatrogenic</b> transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976. Copper-hydrogen peroxide has been suggested {{as an alternative to the}} current recommendation of sodium hydroxide or sodium hypochlorite. Thermal depolymerization also destroys prions in infected organic and inorganic matter, since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.|$|E
25|$|As Singaporean {{surgeons}} {{became more}} skilful, some like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform male-to-female sex-reassignment surgery at Kandang Kerbau Hospital from 1971 onwards. However, before hopeful transsexuals-to-be could {{go under the}} knife, they first had to subject themselves to a battery of psychological tests by psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo. Later, the more technically demanding female-to-male variety was also offered there and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the National University Hospital two decades later. In fact, for thirty years, Singapore {{was one of the}} world leaders in gender-reassignment surgery. Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of genders from transvestites to <b>iatrogenic</b> intersex individuals to fully transformed women. Local hospitals and clinics also attracted transgender clients from other countries in the region, especially Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
500|$|... 1872: The {{similarity}} between decompression sickness and <b>iatrogenic</b> air embolism {{as well as}} the relationship between inadequate decompression and decompression sickness was noted by Friedburg. He suggested that intravascular gas was released by rapid decompression and recommended: slow compression and decompression; four-hour working shifts; limit to maximum pressure of 44.1 psig (4 atm); using only healthy workers; and recompression treatment for severe cases.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{precipitants}} of HRS {{have been}} identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. [...] Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is the infection of ascites fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. [...] HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: <b>iatrogenic</b> precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid by paracentesis from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.|$|E
