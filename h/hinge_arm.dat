40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} case study of production monitoring on an aerospace composite component: the <b>hinge</b> <b>arm</b> of the droop nose mechanism on the Airbus A 380 wing leading edge. A sensor network composed of Fibre Bragg Gratings, capacitive sensors for cure monitoring and thermocouples was embedded in its fibre reinforced lay-up and measurements were acquired throughout its Resin Transfer Moulding production process. Two main challenges had to be overcome: first, the integration of the sensor lines in the existing Resin Transfer Moulding mould without modifying it; second, the demoulding of the component without damaging the sensor lines. The proposed embedding solution has proved successful. The wavelength shifts of the Fibre Bragg Gratings were observed from the initial production stages, over the resin injection, the complete curing of the resin and the cooling-down prior to demoulding. The sensors proved to be sensitive to detecting the resin flow front, vacuum and pressure increase into the mould and the temperature increase caused by the resin curing. Measurements were also acquired during the post-curing cycle. Residual strains during all steps of the process were derived from the sensors’ wavelength shift, showing values up to 0. 2 % in compression. Moreover, the capacitive sensors were able to follow-up the curing degree during the production process. The sensors proved able to detect the resin flow front, whereas thermocouples could not measure an appreciable increase of temperature {{due to the fact that}} the resin had the same temperature as the mould...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the internal deformations occurring in real-life composite components is a very challenging task, especially for those components that are rather difficult to access. Optical fiber sensors can overcome such a problem, since they can be embedded in the composite materials and serve as in situ sensors. In this article, embedded optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are {{used to analyze the}} vibration characteristics of two real-life composite components. The first component is a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer automotive control arm; the second is a glass fiber-reinforced polymer aeronautic <b>hinge</b> <b>arm.</b> The modal parameters of both components were estimated by processing the FBG signals with two interrogation techniques: the maximum detection and fast phase correlation algorithms were employed for the demodulation of the FBG signals; the Peak-Picking and PolyMax techniques were instead used for the parameter estimation. To validate the FBG outcomes, reference measurements were performed by means of a laser Doppler vibrometer. Sensors 2015, 15 27175 The analysis of the results showed that the FBG sensing capabilities were enhanced when the recently-introduced fast phase correlation algorithm was combined with the state-of-the-art PolyMax estimator curve fitting method. In this case, the FBGs provided the most accurate results, i. e. it was possible to fully characterize the vibration behavior of both composite components. When using more traditional interrogation algorithms (maximum detection) and modal parameter estimation techniques (Peak-Picking), some of the modes were not successfully identified...|$|E

Instead, monitors had been placed throughout the Olympic Park showing the public live footage of the flame.|$|R
5000|$|A rare but {{interesting}} mechanical escapement is John Harrison's grasshopper escapement {{invented in}} 1722. In this escapement, the pendulum {{is driven by}} two <b>hinged</b> <b>arms</b> (pallets). As the pendulum swings, {{the end of one}} arm catches on the escape wheel and drives it slightly backwards; this releases the other arm which moves out of the way to allow the escape wheel to pass. When the pendulum swings back again, the other arm catches the wheel, pushes it back and releases the first arm and so on. The grasshopper escapement has been used in very few clocks since Harrison's time. Grasshopper escapements made by Harrison in the 18th century are still operating. Most escapements wear far more quickly, and waste far more energy. The lack of friction is the basis of its accuracy. It's used in the Burgess Clock B that Guinness World Records cited in 2015 as the most accurate open-air mechanical clock, deviating [...] of a second during 100 days. It continues to run and oscillate ±0.5 seconds around 0.00 seconds of error after 2 years after a barometric correction was applied.|$|R

The first successful model was made in 2003 by Stanely in co-ordination with Rashid Ali Ibrahim from the Qatar Scientific Club. At the end of 2003, the design, with a revised analysis, was tendered to Swiss robotics firm K-Team. Initial problems faced by the design team, led by Alexandre Colot, included the fact that the camels were conditioned to the use of human jockeys. Early designs confused or frightened the camels. The designs were modified to include more human-like features, including a mannequin-like face, sunglasses, hats, racing silks and even traditional perfumes used by human jockeys. Other technical issues included the conditions that the robots and the computers would be put under: the high temperatures of a dusty desert environment along with a fast-moving and uneven ride. The first successful official race featuring robotic jockeys was conducted in Qatar by 2005.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} in a drum centrifuge {{with the aim of}} investigating the performance of typical offshore foundations on soft normally consolidated clay. The foundations consisted of spudcan footings and suction caissons. These types of foundations are being considered for use in various offshore applications including as foundations for mobile drilling rigs (jack-ups) and offshore wind turbines. A special loading device was designed so that combined loading could be applied to the footing. This device could apply the same ratio of horizontal to moment loading as that applied to the foundations of mobile drilling units. The main aim of the investigation was to compare how the performance changes as the foundation is varied. This is important when considering the use of a jack-up rig for a permanent facility, a concept that is increasingly being considered. In such a case there are concerns about the long-term suitability of the spudcan footing, with the amount of sustainable rotational fruity being of particular interest. A total of 64 experiments were carried out investigating areas that include a) comparing the vertical loading response in both compression and tension, b) using a fixed ann to apply predominantly horizontal loading, and c) using a <b>hinged</b> <b>arm</b> to apply a distinct ratio of horizontal to moment loading. Interestingly {{in the case of the}} spudcan footing considerable back-flow of the soil was observed during the installation phase.

Research studies report different conclusions than the manufacturer of the BPS stating that the equipment requires more effort than a standard bike crank arm.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare available options for those with range of motion limitations to determine which allowed the most effective use of force. Subjects pedaled a stationary bicycle at a casual speed and cadence and at an accelerated speed and cadence using a fixed shortened crank <b>arm,</b> a <b>hinged</b> crank <b>arm,</b> and a standard crank arm on their dominant side with no contribution from their affected limb. A previous study of the BPS reports less effectiveness, but the study involved only able-bodied subjects with no physical limitations.

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} to determine the damage to samples of composite material when a current carrying wire is shorted {{to the surface of}} the composite material, and to determine whether enough current can flow through the material to blow a fuse before damage can occur. Fault current tests {{were performed}} on samples of graphite epoxy materials. Samples consisted of six layers of IM 7 graphite fiber mat in Hercules 8552 epoxy resin. A variable power supply provided up to 35 amps of current. The high voltage side of the power supply was attached to a wire at the end of a <b>hinged</b> <b>arm,</b> and the low side was attached to the edge of the sample. To test joints, the return was connected to the edge of one sample, and the high side was shorted to the top of the other sample. Tests show that when current exceeds approximately 5 amps, the graphite glows, and the epoxy melts out at the shorted contact. At higher current levels the epoxy burns. At voltages above 15 volts the epoxy outer coat is easily broken, and fire, flame, and a rise in current occur suddenly. When joints are introduced, resistance is increased, and the maximum current resulting from a short circuit to the graphite epoxy is reduced. This condition can easily result in fault current lower than the circuit breaker limit and higher than the 5 amp ignition level. The shorting contact and the joint become hot spots with melting epoxy, smoke, and fire...|$|R

50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large tensioning pulley (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an <b>arm</b> <b>hinged</b> to the mast.

Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} a passive rider on the lateral dynamics of a Whipple-like bicycle model. In the original Whipple [8] model the rider is assumed to be rigidly connected to the rear frame of the bicycle and there are no hands on the handlebar. Contrary, in normal bicycling the arms of a rider are connected to the handlebar and the rider can use both steering and upper body rotations for control. From observations [2, 6] two distinct rider postures can be identified. The first posture is where the upper body leans forward with the arms stretched to the handlebar, and the upper body twists while steering. The second rider posture is an upright one where the upper body stays fixed with respect to the rear frame and where the <b>arms,</b> <b>hinging</b> at the shoulders and the elbows, exert the control force on the steering. Models can be made where neither posture adds any degrees of freedom to the original Whipple-like bicycle model. For both posture cases the open loop, or uncontrolled, dynamics of the bicycle-rider system is investigated and compared to the rigid rider model by examining the eigenvalues and eigenmotions in the 0 to 10 m/s forward speed range. It is shown that such a passive rider can dramatically change the eigenvalues and its structure with respect to those of the rigid rider model...|$|R

The mast assembly consisted of a vertical 30 feet long, 3 inch by 3 inch, vertical steel mast and a cantilevered <b>arm</b> <b>hinged</b> {{at the bottom of the}} mast and lowered by cable to align the attached sampler to the wall. The sampler and mast assembly were raised and lowered through an opening in the tank tops, called a riser. The sampler is constructed of a mounting plate, a drill, springs to provide a drive force to the drill, a removable sampler head to collect the sample, a vacuum pump to draw the sample from the drill to a filter, and controls to operate the system. Once the sampler was positioned near the wall, electromagnets attached it to the wall, and the control system was operated to turn on the drill and vacuum to remove and collect a sample from the wall. Samples were collected on filters in removable sampler heads, which were readily transported for further laboratory testing...|$|R
