5|$|After Milrow was conducted, {{there was}} {{continued}} {{pressure on the}} part of <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> against going forward with the larger Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete. In May 1971, Gravel sent a letter to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage, in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking.|$|E

5|$|Long term {{proposals}} by {{the province}} call for Highway 404 {{to be extended}} to Highway12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway48. It has drawn criticism from various <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> who claim it will only serve to accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both sides}} of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. <b>Environmental</b> <b>groups</b> undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed to fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. <b>Environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a {{crossing}} {{arose in}} the 1960s; and until the 1990s proposals were for a pontoon bridge further north. The Stord Bridge was conceived after the decision to combine the crossing with the Bømlafjord Tunnel. The project was resisted both by local <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the latter because the new plans would delay completion. Construction was undertaken by a joint venue between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Construction started in 1999 {{and was the first}} bridge in Norway to have the cables spun on-site. The bridge cost 442 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and was taken into use on 27 December 2000.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{explanation}} for voluntary overcompliance, the phenomenon in which firms voluntarily choose to overcomply with environmental regulations. In our model, a polluting firm faces a rent-seeking contest with an <b>environmental</b> <b>group.</b> By making a small concession beforehand, i. e. by overcomplying voluntary, the firm lowers the stake the <b>environmental</b> <b>group</b> has in the rent seeking contest, which lowers the group's lobbying effort in that contest. Voluntary overcompliance increases social welfare, yet the firm undersupplies overcompliance from a welfare point of view. An increase in the effectiveness of lobbying of the <b>environmental</b> <b>group,</b> increases the level of overcompliance...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} market in which a monopolistic firm {{supplies}} a good. The production of the good causes damage to the environment. Consumers are heterogeneous {{with respect to their}} disutility of the environmental damage. An <b>environmental</b> <b>group</b> can enter the market and set up a campaign in order to influence consumers' preferences. We characterize the equilibrium of the resulting entry-deterrence game and investigate its properties. It turns out that the aggregated environmental damage is lowest if the firm is able to deter entry of the <b>environmental</b> <b>group</b> and, moreover, the fixed entry cost of the <b>environmental</b> <b>group</b> is small enough...|$|R

5|$|Several groups {{specifically}} {{concerned with}} nuclear issues {{were established in}} the mid-1970s, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE), cooperating with other <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> such as Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected Labor Government failed to implement its stated policy of stopping uranium mining. But by the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case; CANE was disbanded in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The Sierra Club and the San Diego National Audubon Society, {{as well as}} {{some other}} groups, sued the FHWA, USACE, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to block the {{construction}} of the toll road over alleged breaches of the Endangered Species Act in October 2001; however, a San Diego judge sided with the contractor and the federal government in March 2003. The environmental concerns were resolved by the developer for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year; in return, the <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community groups also opposed the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main {{concern is that the}} lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E

5|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> {{that had}} filed the {{injunction}} appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|The years 1976 and 1977 saw {{uranium mining}} {{become a major}} {{political}} issue, with the Ranger Inquiry (Fox) report opening up a public debate about uranium mining. Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining (founded in 1976) and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (formed in South Australia in 1976), cooperating with other <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> such as Friends of the Earth (which came to Australia in 1975) and the Australian Conservation Foundation (formed in 1975).|$|E
5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other <b>environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on {{limiting}} {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E

5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of long delays, many <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> from France, Italy and Switzerland have worked {{together}} under the umbrella organisation, proMONT BLANC, to jointly raise concerns and {{to put pressure on}} national governments and the European Union to support and make quicker progress with World Heritage classification. In 2012 the organisation published a detailed assessment and supportive rationale into the state of the Mont Blanc application to be a World Heritage Site. ProMont Blanc also undertakes reviews of a suite of 24 environmental, 24 economic and 10 social indicators across 15 towns around the massif (seven French, five Italian and three Swiss), and monitors and reports on the effectiveness of measures intended to deliver sustainable development across the region.|$|E
