5|$|Zinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, {{diamagnetic}} metal, {{though most}} common commercial grades {{of the metal}} have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packing,</b> in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150°C. Above 210°C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5°C) and boiling points (907°C). The melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium; for this, among other reasons, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often {{not considered to be}} transition metals {{like the rest of the}} d-block metals are.|$|E

2500|$|The {{approach}} that Fejes Tóth suggested in that work, which translates as [...] "packing [...] in a plane, on a sphere {{and in a}} space", provided [...] Thomas Hales a basis for a proof of the Kepler conjecture in 1998.

2500|$|Experiment {{shows that}} {{dropping}} the spheres in randomly will achieve a density of around 65%.

Start with a layer of spheres in a hexagonal lattice, then put the next layer of spheres in the lowest points you can find above the first layer, and so on. At each step there are two choices of where to put the next layer, so this natural method of stacking the spheres creates an uncountably infinite number of equally dense packings, the best known of which are [...] called cubic close packing and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packing.</b> Each of these [...] arrangements has an average density of ...|$|E
