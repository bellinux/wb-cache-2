5|$|The +3 saw the {{addition}} of two more 16KB ROMs. One was home to {{the second part of}} the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> This was a modified version of Amstrad's PCWDOS (the disk access code used in LocoScript), called +3DOS. These two new 16KB ROMs and the original two 16KB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32KB chips. To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16KB of RAM.|$|E
5|$|DOS (<b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System)</b> was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E
25|$|CP/M-68K, {{already running}} on the Motorola EXORmacs systems, was {{initially}} {{to be used in}} the Atari ST computer, but Atari decided to go with a newer <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> called GEMDOS. CP/M-68K was also used on the SORD M68 and M68MX computers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> were {{available}} for mainframes, microprocessors and home computers and were usually loaded from the disks themselves {{as part of the}} boot process.|$|R
25|$|The MSX-DOS <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> had {{internal}} software mechanisms {{much like}} CP/M (so CP/M software could be ported reasonably easily), {{but had a}} file system compatible with MS-DOS, and its user commands were also similar to early MS-DOS versions. In this way, Microsoft could promote MSX for home use while promoting MS-DOS based personal computers in office environments.|$|E
25|$|The Basic <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System,</b> or BDOS, {{provided}} {{access to}} such operations as opening a file, output to the console, or printing. Application programs would load processor registers with a function code for the operation, and addresses for parameters or memory buffers, and call a fixed address in memory. Since the address was the same independent {{of the amount of}} memory in the system, application programs would run the same way for any type or configuration of hardware.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} CP-67 {{system for}} the S/360-67 started a whole line of IBM operating systems focused {{on the concept of}} virtual machines. Other operating systems used on IBM S/360 series mainframes included systems developed by IBM: COS/360 (Compatibility Operating System), DOS/360 (<b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System),</b> TSS/360 (Time Sharing System), TOS/360 (Tape Operating System), BOS/360 (Basic Operating System), and ACP (Airline Control Program), as well as a few non-IBM systems: MTS (Michigan Terminal System), MUSIC (Multi-User System for Interactive Computing), and ORVYL (Stanford Timesharing System).|$|E

25|$|As {{is common}} for home {{computers}} of the early 1980s, the C64 incorporates a BASIC ROM and interpreter. The kernal and I/O operations such as disk drive operations are accessed via BASIC commands. The disk drive has its own microprocessor, much like the earlier CBM/PET systems and the Atari 400 and Atari 800. This means that no memory space is dedicated to running a <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system,</b> {{as was the case}} with earlier systems such as the AppleII and TRS-80.|$|E
25|$|The first {{microcomputers}} did {{not have}} the capacity or need for the elaborate operating systems that had been developed for mainframes and minis; minimalistic operating systems were developed, often loaded from ROM and known as monitors. One notable early <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> was CP/M, which was supported on many early microcomputers and was closely imitated by Microsoft's MS-DOS, which became widely popular as the operating system chosen for the IBM PC (IBM's version of it was called IBM DOS or PC DOS). In the 1980s, Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc.) abandoned its popular Apple II series of microcomputers to introduce the Apple Macintosh computer with an innovative graphical user interface (GUI) to the Mac OS.|$|E
500|$|The S-100 bus {{was used}} {{throughout}} the 1980s until it was overtaken by the IBM PC ISA bus. Seattle Computer Products (SCP) was a manufacturer of S-100 memory boards. The company's engineer, Tim Paterson, designed an Intel 8086 CPU system on two S-100 boards in 1979. Microsoft, then in nearby Bellevue, Washington, used the prototype machine to test their 8086 version of BASIC. Digital Research had promised to deliver an 8086 version of their CP/M operating system by December 1979 but missed that date. SCP needed a <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> to sell its 8086 products so Patterson wrote QDOS, a [...] "Quick and Dirty Operating System" [...] in three months. Microsoft would later purchase QDOS from SCP for $50,000 {{and use it as}} the basis for the IBM PC DOS.|$|E
50|$|Optimized Systems Software (OSS) was a {{small company}} that {{produced}} <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> and programming languages for primarily the Atari 8-bit computers. OSS {{is best known for}} their enhanced versions of Atari BASIC, the MAC/65 assembler (which is much faster than Atari's products), and the Action! programming language.|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> for the Amstrad range {{included}} CP/M (which {{was also}} bundled with an external disk drive, or built-in on ROM depending on model), RAMDOS, which allowed the full (800K) capacity of single-density 3 ½" [...] disks {{to be used}} providing a suitable drive was connected and SymbOS.|$|R
5000|$|DOS [...] is {{a family}} of <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> {{primarily}} consisting of MS-DOS and a rebranded version under the name IBM PC DOS which were introduced in 1981, {{as well as some}} later compatible systems from other manufacturers: DR-DOS (1988), ROM-DOS (1989), PTS-DOS (1993), and FreeDOS (1998). MS-DOS dominated the x86-based IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995.|$|R
500|$|The game {{features}} two characters: the player-controlled silent protagonist named Chell, and GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System),</b> {{a computer}} artificial intelligence that monitors and directs the player. In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by Ellen McLain, though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell {{is given by}} GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS is a liar by her own admission. In the [...] "Lab Rat" [...] comic created by Valve {{to bridge the gap}} between Portal and Portal 2, Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having [...] "too much tenacity"—the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test queue.|$|E
500|$|Portal {{consists}} {{primarily of}} a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using [...] "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System)</b> to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows momentum to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal, making it a spiritual successor to the game.|$|E
500|$|In Albuquerque, New Mexico, Paul Allen {{with his}} friend Bill Gates, in 1975, began {{marketing}} a BASIC programming language interpreter. Allen {{came up with the}} original name of [...] "Micro-Soft," [...] as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article. In 1980, after promising to deliver IBM a <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System</b> (DOS) they had not yet developed for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC, Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a Quick and Dirty Operating System (QDOS) which was written by Tim Paterson who, at the time, was employed at Seattle Computer Products. As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen's and Gates' wealth and success. Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 due to serious illness. Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors in November 2000 but was asked to consult as a senior strategy advisor to the company's executives and still owns a reported 100 million shares.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> {{and the ability to}} record large data files, core dumps were paper printouts [...] of the {{contents}} of memory, typically arranged in columns of octal or hexadecimal numbers (a [...] "hex dump"), sometimes accompanied by their interpretations as machine language instructions, text strings, or decimal or floating-point numbers (cf. disassembler).|$|R
5000|$|For <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> that do use index sync, {{a second}} index hole window {{has to be}} punched in {{both sides of the}} jacket, and for hard-sectored formats, an {{additional}} window must be punched for the sector holes. While cutting a second notch is relatively safe, cutting an additional window into the jacket is a great peril to the disk itself.|$|R

2500|$|MS-DOS ( [...] {{acronym for}} Microsoft <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System)</b> is a {{discontinued}} operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to {{be compatible with}} MS-DOS, are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "DOS" [...] (which is also the generic acronym for <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system).</b> MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Systems</b> {{that do not}} use {{the index}} hole in the disk to mark the {{beginnings}} of tracks, the [...] "flippy" [...] modification required only a new write-enable notch to be cut if the disk {{was designed to be}} written to. For this purpose, specially designed single-rectangular-hole punchers, commonly known as disk doublers, were produced and sold by third-party computer accessory manufacturers. Many users, however, made do with a standard (round) hole puncher and/or an ordinary pair of scissors for this job.|$|R

2500|$|GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and <b>Disk</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>System)</b> is {{a fictional}} artificially {{intelligent}} computer {{system from the}} video game series Portal. GLaDOS later appeared in The Lab and Lego Dimensions. The character was created by Erik Wolpaw and Kim Swift and voiced by Ellen McLain. GLaDOS is responsible for testing and maintenance in the Aperture Science research facility in all titles. While GLaDOS initially appears {{in the first game}} to simply be a voice that guides the player, her words and actions become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. The second game, as well as the Valve created comic Lab Rat, reveals that she was mistreated by the scientists [...] and used a neurotoxin to kill the scientists in the laboratory before the events of Portal. She is ostensibly destroyed {{at the end of the}} first game but returns in the sequel, in which she is comically supplanted and temporarily stuck on a potato battery.|$|E
2500|$|For much of Portal, GLaDOS serves solely as the narrator, guiding players {{through the}} test chambers. Her voice is robotic, but {{distinctly}} female. Over time, players learn {{that she is}} in fact leading the player-character Chell to her death. [...] As Chell escapes her control, GLaDOS's announcements get increasingly personal and farcical. [...] Her personality {{has been described as}} passive-aggressive, witty, narcissistic, and sinister. She has a number of system personality cores installed into her, partly in order to prevent her from killing anyone. At the climax of the game, Chell enters GLaDOS' chambers, where it is revealed that she's actually a complex artificial intelligence system composed of robotic parts hanging from a larger device. Once the player removes the first personality core, the morality core, GLaDOS' voice becomes less robotic and more sensual. Originally, GLaDOS was designed as an artificial intelligence and research assistant meant to aid Aperture Science in competing with the Black Mesa Research Facility on the creation of portal technology. Later proposed uses for GLaDOS included implementation as a fuel line ice inhibitor and <b>disk</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system.</b> GLaDOS is installed to serve as the Enrichment Center's central control computer, mounted in a large, sealed chamber alongside several control consoles and an incinerator, the latter being her eventual demise.|$|E

Prior to the release of Apple DOS 3.1, Apple users had to rely on audio cassette tapes for data storage and retrieval, but that method was notoriously slow, inconvenient, and unreliable.|$|R
