50|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} the image from the paper to the substrate, it requires a heat press process that {{is a combination of}} time, temperature and pressure. The heat press applies this special combination, which can change depending on the substrate, to “transfer” the <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> at the molecular level into the substrate. The most common <b>dyes</b> used for <b>sublimation</b> activate at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. However, a range of 380 to 420 degrees Fahrenheit is normally recommended for optimal color.|$|R
5000|$|Dye-sublimation {{can also}} be used as an {{indirect}} printing process. Standard black and white laser printers are capable of printing on plain paper using a special [...] "transfer toner" [...] containing <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> which can then be permanently heat transferred to T-shirts, hats, mugs, metals, puzzles and other surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{decoration}} used on T-shirts include airbrush, applique, embroidery, impressing or embossing, and the ironing on of either flock lettering, heat transfers, or dye-sublimation transfers. Laser printers {{are capable of}} printing on plain paper using a special toner containing <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> which can then be permanently heat-transferred to T-shirts.|$|R

50|$|In {{sublimation}} printing, unique <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> {{are transferred}} to sheets of “transfer” paper via liquid gel ink through a piezoelectric print head. The ink is deposited on these high-release inkjet papers, {{which are used}} for the next step of the sublimation printing process. After the digital design is printed onto sublimation transfer sheets, it is placed on a heat press along with the substrate to be sublimated.|$|R
50|$|Photo-quality {{images and}} {{graphics}} in vivid color may be printed into the unsealed porous oxide layer using color <b>dyes</b> via silkscreen, <b>sublimation</b> transfer or digital printer. Line-art-quality graphics {{can be achieved}} by use of a printer. Color graphics may also be directly applied by hand using an airbrush, sponge or paintbrush. Printed anodizing is sealed to prevent or reduce dye bleed-out. Uses include baseball bats, signs, furniture, surgical trays, motorcycle components, and architectural moulding.|$|R
40|$|Plasma polymer {{thin films}} with {{embedded}} dye molecules were deposited by alternating or simultaneous plasma polymerization and <b>dye</b> molecule <b>sublimation.</b> From films with different amounts of embedded dye molecules, fluorescence spectra {{as well as}} excitation spectra were recorded. At samples with very low amounts of embedded dye molecules, the fluoresces band was found at lambda(fl) = 550 [...] . 560 nm. At higher dye amounts, the flourescence band shifts to lambda(fl) = 590 [...] . 600 nm. This was interpreted as the change from embedded isolated dye molecules at low concentrations to dye molecule clusters or nanocrystallites at higher concentrations. The appearance of a second fluorenscence band at lambda(fl) = 680 [...] . 700 nm was interpreted {{as a result of}} a chemical modification of the Rhodamine 6 G molecules during plasma polymer deposition...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{cyanoacrylate}} (CA) as a fuming {{technique for}} the development of latent friction ridge skin impressions has been widespread for decades within the forensic lab {{as well as in the}} field at crime scenes. Important features of processing latent print impressions using this method include that it makes visible latent print impressions that for the most part cannot be seen with the unaided eye and it preserves latent print impressions for future processing/examination. The superglue fumes "fix" the latent print impression to the substrate making it difficult to wipe away, thereby decreasing the chances of destruction during packaging at the scene, transportation, and processing in the lab. One of the disadvantages to this technique is the lack of contrast between the white polymers that are formed on the latent print impression residue and light colored backgrounds on which the latent print impression may be present. Attempts were made to develop a one-step cyanoacrylate fuming method that would enhance visualization of latent print impressions on light colored backgrounds without the need for an alternative light source, dye staining, or powdering. Latent print impressions were applied to black and white ceramic tiles, white painted wood and white/translucent textured plastic. Protein and hemoglobin stains, commercial colorants, <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes,</b> hair dye, and printer ink were added to ethyl-CA in an attempt to create a co-polymerization process of the vaporized cyanoacrylate monomers and colorant molecules on latent print residue. Fuming was also attempted using pre-colored commercial glues with the assumption that the attached CA polymers on the latent print impression residue would retain their original color properties. None of these methods proved successful. The practical use of a new fluorescent CA, Lumicyano^TM, was also examined. Following fuming, an ALS is utilized for the excitation of the developed latent print impressions using this technique. Strong fluorescence could not be observed on all substrates. In this particular study, fuming with traditional CA followed by the application of powder or dye stains to latent print impressions currently appears to be the most efficient technique for latent print enhancement on the white or light colored substrates used in this study...|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to technologies like thermal wax, <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation,</b> and laser printing, inkjets {{have the advantage}} of practically no warm up time, and often lower cost per page. However, low-cost laser printers can have lower per-page costs, at least for black-and-white printing, and possibly for color.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> heat transfer imprinting printers, which use special inks to create transfers designed to be imprinted on textiles, and in which the dyes do indeed sublimate. These are done at lower temperatures but higher pressures, particularly in all-over print processes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dye</b> <b>{{sublimation}}</b> inks: These inks contain special sublimation dyes and {{are used}} to print directly or indirectly on to fabrics which consist of {{a high percentage of}} polyester fibres. A heating step causes the dyes to sublimate into the fibers and create an image with strong color and good durability.|$|E
50|$|In summer 2008 Polaroid {{released}} the PoGo, an instant photo printer producing 2 x 3 in prints. It uses the Zink ("zero ink") technology {{which is similar}} to <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> but has the dye crystals embedded in the photo paper itself.

50|$|For <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> {{transfer}} paper, fabrics historically had to {{be white}} or light in color. 100% polyester, poly/cotton mix (the garment {{should be at least}} 50% poly) microfibre and nylon can all be used. This printing process turns solid ink into a gas, avoiding a liquid stage. This process can be used on ceramic, wood, glass, or metal {{as long as they have}} a polymer coating.|$|E
50|$|Colored toner became {{available}} in the 1950s, although full-color copiers were not commercially available until 3M released the Color-in-Color copier in 1968, which used a <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> process rather than conventional electrostatic technology. The first electrostatic color copier was released by Xerox (the 6500) in 1973. Color photocopying is a concern to governments, as it facilitates counterfeiting currency and other documents: for more information, see Counterfeiting section.|$|E
50|$|Custom-printed tile murals can be {{produced}} using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses {{a variety of techniques}} including <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> and ceramic-type laser toners.

50|$|Instant Print Stations - This type of photo kiosk uses {{internal}} printers to instantly create photographic prints for a self serve paying customer. Often {{located in}} public locations (hotels, schools, airports), Instant Print Stations handle payments. Often such systems will only print 4x6 inch prints, although popular <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> photo printers as of 2008 allow for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8x12. It's {{more a matter}} of resupply labor economics and chassis size.|$|E
50|$|MicroDry is a {{computer}} printing system developed by the ALPS corporation of Japan. It is a wax/resin-transfer system using individual colored thermal ribbon cartridges, and can print in process color using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black cartridges, as well as such spot-color cartridges as white, metallic silver, and metallic gold, {{on a wide variety}} of paper and transparency stock. Certain MicroDry printers can also operate in <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> mode, using special cartridges and paper.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> {{offers some}} {{advantages}} over inkjet printing. For one, the prints are dry {{and ready to}} handle {{as soon as they}} exit the printer. Since the thermal head doesn't have to sweep {{back and forth over the}} print media, there are fewer moving parts that can break down. The whole printing cycle is extremely clean as there are no liquid inks to clean up. These factors make dye-sublimation generally a more reliable technology over inkjet printing.|$|E

5000|$|Printing {{techniques}} and digital manipulation {{of art and}} photography are used in {{what is known as}} [...] "custom tile printing". <b>Dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> printers, inkjet printers and ceramic inks and toners permit printing on a variety of tile types yielding photographic-quality reproduction. Using digital image capture via scanning or digital cameras, bitmap/raster images can be prepared in photo editing software programs. Specialized custom-tile printing techniques permit transfer under heat and pressure or the use of high temperature kilns to fuse the picture to the tile substrate. This has become a method of producing custom tile murals for kitchens, showers, and commercial decoration in restaurants, hotels, and corporate lobbies.|$|E
50|$|A typical MicroDry printer {{includes}} a moving carriage containing the print head, which {{is capable of}} picking up cartridges from a rack on the front cover of the machine, printing with them, and returning them to the rack, without human intervention. Printing is normally done one color at a time, printing the entire cyan portion of the page, then retracting the page to print the entire magenta portion, then yellow, then black (or yellow, magenta, cyan, and a protective overcoat, in <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> mode). When multiple spot colors are used in addition to CMYK, the printer can be manually directed to retract the page {{at the end of}} the printing cycle, instead of ejecting it, thus assuring that the spot colors remain in registration.|$|E
5000|$|The dye-sublimation {{printing}} process {{is used to}} print on polyester or other synthetic fabrics. It is used for applications such as T-shirts, banners, table covers, id cards, sportswear and flags. The original printers were an electrostatic technology using toners but now are generally large format inkjet printers using specially formulated inks. The <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> inks are a disperse dye suspended in a liquid solvent, like water. The images are initially printed on coated heat-resistant transfer paper as a reverse image of the final design, which is then transferred onto polyester fabric in a heat press operating at a temperature around 180 to 210 C (375 F). Under high temperature and pressure, the dye turns into a gas and permeates the fabric and then solidifies into its fibers. The fabric is permanently dyed {{so it can be}} washed without damaging the quality of the image. Shelfies and Blue Notes are two such companies that use this method.|$|E
