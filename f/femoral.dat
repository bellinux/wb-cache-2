5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically the medial <b>femoral</b> condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the <b>femoral</b> head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the iliac and <b>femoral</b> veins. The leg is usually painful, tinged blue in color, and swollen, which may result in venous gangrene.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{simplified}} technique called compression ultrasonography {{which can be}} used for quick DVT diagnosis, mainly for the common <b>femoral</b> vein and the popliteal vein. It is very useful in an emergency situation and is performed just by vein compression using transducer pressure.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for the {{following}} eponyms: Murphy’s button (a mechanical device used for intestinal anastomosis), Murphy’s punch (a punch tenderness at the costo-vertebral angle in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy's sign (a sign of inflammation of the gallbladder), Murphy’s test (a test for deep-seated tenderness and muscular rigidity in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy drip for administration of fluids by proctoclysis in patients with peritonitis, and Murphy-Lane bone skid (a common commercial steel instrument used for <b>femoral</b> head procedures).|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the <b>Femoral</b> Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the <b>femoral</b> condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The <b>femoral</b> tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Femoral</b> hernias occur {{just below}} the {{inguinal}} ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the <b>femoral</b> canal. They {{can be hard to}} distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in <b>femoral</b> hernias. The incidence of strangulation in <b>femoral</b> hernias is high. Repair techniques are similar for <b>femoral</b> and inguinal hernia.|$|E
25|$|A Cooper's hernia is a <b>femoral</b> hernia {{with two}} sacs, the first {{being in the}} <b>femoral</b> canal, and the second passing through a defect in the {{superficial}} fascia and appearing almost immediately beneath the skin.|$|E
25|$|One such {{previously}} suspected complication was coxa magna, {{which is}} an overgrowth of the <b>femoral</b> head and broadening of the <b>femoral</b> neck, accompanied by changes in the acetabulum, which may lead to subluxation of the femur. There was also some controversy about whether continuous high intra-articular pressure in transient synovitis could cause avascular necrosis of the <b>femoral</b> head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), but further studies did not confirm any link between the two conditions.|$|E
25|$|The groin (<b>femoral</b> artery).|$|E
25|$|Hip-knee-shaft angle (HKS), {{an angle}} formed between a {{line through the}} {{longitudinal}} axis of the <b>femoral</b> shaft and its mechanical axis, which is {{a line from the}} center of the <b>femoral</b> head to the intercondylar notch of the distal femur.|$|E
25|$|X-rays {{of the hip}} {{may suggest}} and/or verify the diagnosis. X-rays usually {{demonstrate}} a flattened, and later fragmented, <b>femoral</b> head. A bone scan or MRI {{may be useful in}} making the diagnosis in those cases where X-rays are inconclusive. Usually, plain radiographic changes are delayed 6 weeks or more from clinical onset, so bone scintigraphy and MRI are done for early diagnosis. MRI results are more accurate, i.e. 97 to 99% against 88 to 93% in plain radiography. If MRI or bone scans are necessary, a positive diagnosis relies upon patchy areas of vascularity to the capital <b>femoral</b> epiphysis (the developing <b>femoral</b> head).|$|E
25|$|The {{prosthetic}} implant used in {{hip replacement}} {{consists of three}} parts: the acetabular cup, the <b>femoral</b> component, and the articular interface. Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence {{for a number of}} newer devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular <b>femoral</b> necks, and uncemented monoblock cups. Correct selection of the prosthesis is important.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{invasive}} procedures {{completed by}} the cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellows include {{but are not limited}} to arterial line placement (<b>femoral,</b> axillary, brachial, radial), central venous cannulation (internal juggular, <b>femoral,</b> subclavian), pulmonary artery catheter placement, transvenous pacemaker placement, thoracic epidural analgesia, fiberoptic endotracheal tube placement, 2D/3D transesophageal echocardiography, intraspinal drainage placement, and advanced ultrasound guidance of vascular access.|$|E
25|$|The oblique {{ligament}} groove on {{the posterior}} {{surface of the}} <b>femoral</b> head is shallow.|$|E
25|$|Taylor had {{extensive}} blood loss through a severed <b>femoral</b> artery {{and he died}} on November 27.|$|E
25|$|<b>Femoral</b> osteotomies, as {{the name}} indicates, {{involves}} adjustments made to the femur head and/or the femur.|$|E
25|$|The <b>femoral</b> {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} <b>femoral</b> stem with attached prosthetic <b>femoral</b> head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. <b>Femoral</b> heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of <b>femoral</b> heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E
25|$|Traction is {{contraindicated}} in <b>femoral</b> neck fractures due to it affecting {{blood flow}} {{to the head of the}} femur.|$|E
25|$|Hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), {{which is}} an angle between the <b>femoral</b> {{mechanical}} axis {{and the center of}} the ankle joint.|$|E
25|$|If {{the joint}} is fully dislocated a false {{acetabulum}} often forms (often higher {{up on the}} pelvis) opposite the dislocated <b>femoral</b> head position.|$|E
25|$|Displaced {{fractures}} of the trochanter or <b>femoral</b> neck will typically cause external {{rotation and}} shortening {{of the leg}} when the patient is laying supine.|$|E
25|$|X-ray imaging {{of the hip}} is {{most often}} unremarkable. Subtle {{radiographic}} signs include an accentuated pericapsular shadow, widening of the medial joint space, lateral displacement of the <b>femoral</b> epiphyses with surface flattening (Waldenström sign), prominent obturator shadow, diminution of soft tissue planes around the hip joint or slight demineralisation of the proximal femur. The main reason for radiographic examination is to exclude bony lesions such as occult fractures, slipped upper <b>femoral</b> epiphysis or bone tumours (such as osteoid osteoma). An anteroposterior and frog lateral (Lauenstein) view of the pelvis and both hips is advisable.|$|E
25|$|The {{angle of}} {{inclination}} formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the <b>femoral</b> neck superimposed on a line drawn through the <b>femoral</b> condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which {{makes it possible for}} flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the <b>femoral</b> head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E
25|$|The {{catheter}} {{is inserted}} through the <b>femoral</b> vein and can have several electrodes along its length {{to record the}} direction of electrical activity from within the heart.|$|E
25|$|The genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) leaves psoas major {{below the}} two former nerves, {{immediately}} divides into two branches that descends along the muscle's anterior side. The sensory <b>femoral</b> branch supplies the skin below the inguinal ligament, while the mixed genital branch supplies {{the skin and}} muscles around the sex organ. The lateral <b>femoral</b> cutaneous nerve (L2, L3) leaves psoas major laterally below the previous nerve, runs obliquely and laterally downward above the iliacus, exits the pelvic area near the iliac spine, and supplies {{the skin of the}} anterior thigh.|$|E
25|$|After {{a median}} sternotomy, a {{surgical}} retractor is placed by the surgeon to optimize {{exposure of the}} heart. At this time, heparin is given to thin the blood to prevent thrombus from forming while on CPB. The surgeon places a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or <b>femoral</b> vein to withdraw blood from the venous circulation. The perfusionist uses gravity to drain the venous blood into the CPB machine, and a separate cannula, usually placed in the aorta or <b>femoral</b> artery, is used to return blood to the arterial circulation.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{fracture}}s, {{such as a}} toddler's fracture (spiral {{fracture of}} the shin bone), can also cause pain and limp, but are uncommon around the hip joint. Soft tissue injuries can be evident when bruises are present. Muscle or ligament injuries can be contracted during heavy physical activity —however, {{it is important not}} to miss a slipped upper <b>femoral</b> epiphysis. Avascular necrosis of the <b>femoral</b> head (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease) typically occurs in children aged 4–8, and is also more common in boys. There may be an effusion on ultrasound, similar to transient synovitis.|$|E
25|$|Squamous lesions tend {{to arise}} {{in a single}} site and occur most {{commonly}} in the vestibule. They grow by local extension and spread via the local lymph system. The lymphatics of the labia drain to the upper vulva and mons, then to both superficial and deep inguinal and <b>femoral</b> lymph nodes. The last deep <b>femoral</b> node is called the Cloquet’s node. Spread beyond this node reaches the lymph nodes of the pelvis. The tumor may also invade nearby organs such as the vagina, urethra, and rectum and spread via their lymphatics.|$|E
25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral <b>femoral</b> cutaneous, <b>femoral,</b> and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve stimulator is used to locate it.|$|E
25|$|All {{species of}} Cyclura are sexually dimorphic; males {{are larger than}} females, and have more {{prominent}} dorsal crests as well as larger <b>femoral</b> pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones.|$|E
25|$|Bernese periacetabular {{osteotomy}} {{resulted in}} major nerve deficits in the sciatic or <b>femoral</b> nerves in 2.1% of 1760 patients, of whom approximately half experienced complete recovery within {{a mean of}} 5.5 months.|$|E
25|$|Legg-Calvé-Perthes syndrome, {{also known}} as Perthes disease or {{avascular}} necrosis of the <b>femoral</b> head, {{is characterized by a}} deformity of the head of the femur and hip pain. It occurs in small breed puppies.|$|E
25|$|The TFL flap {{reconstruction}} {{includes the}} tensor fasciae latae muscle and is nourished by the ascending {{branch of the}} lateral circumflex <b>femoral</b> artery. The tensor fasciae latae muscle {{is located at the}} lateral upper leg.|$|E
25|$|David {{died at the}} age of 14 after {{attempting}} to climb the spiked fence at his stepfather's parents' home and puncturing his <b>femoral</b> artery in the process. Schneider began drinking alcohol excessively after the death of David.|$|E
