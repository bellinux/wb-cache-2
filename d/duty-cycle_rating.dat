5000|$|The {{control channel}} {{can also be}} set to cycle, so each channel in turn becomes a control channel, say every ten minutes it will change. The {{advantage}} {{of this is that}} the base {{does not have to be}} rated at 100% duty cycle and does not get so hot. However, this can cause problems with queuing, affects registration and control channel acquisition times. Most base stations have a 100% <b>duty-cycle</b> <b>rating,</b> but this function can be useful if local Regulatory rules do not permit Continuous CCH operation. In countries where dedicated channels for trunked systems are not possible or availability is limited it is also possible to actively manage the use of traffic channels based on co-channel use, i.e. to avoid interfering with other users by using [...] "friendly" [...] channel acquisition protocols.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a narrowband transmitter and antenna system that achieves an average power consumption of 78 pW when operating at a <b>duty-cycled</b> data <b>rate</b> of 1 bps. Fabricated in a 0. 18 μm CMOS process, the transmitter employs a direct-RF power oscillator topology where a loop antenna acts as a both a radiative and resonant element. The low-complexity single-stage architecture, in combination with aggressive power gating techniques and sizing optimizations, limited the standby power of the transmitter to only 39. 7 pW at 0. 8 V. Supporting both OOK and FSK modulations at 2. 4 GHz, the transmitter consumed as low as 38 pJ/bit at an active-mode data rate of 5 Mbps. The loop antenna and integrated diodes were also used as part of a wireless power transfer receiver in order to kick-start the system power supply prior to energy harvesting operation.

40|$|Abstract—The {{feasibility}} of a multi-carrier system for data-transmission over copper wires at gigabit rates is analyzed. More specific, {{we look at}} the effects of jitter and duty-cycle deviations on the SNR and error rate using Matlab simulations. Jitter causes crosstalk between the inphase and quadrature channels of a given tone frequency. Given a certain rms jitter variance, low frequency tones can carry more bits than higher frequency tones for the same error <b>rate.</b> <b>Duty-cycle</b> deviations cause crosstalk both from other carrier frequencies and from quadrature channels. These problems seem so big that a PAM system {{is likely to be the}} better choice for gigabit transmission...|$|R
40|$|Pulse-shape {{analysis}} of the ionization signals from germanium gamma-ray spectrometers is a method for obtaining information that can characterize an event beyond just the total energy deposited in the crystal. However, as typically employed, this method is data-intensive requiring the digitization, transfer, and recording of electronic signals from the spectrometer. A hardware realization of a real-time digital signal processor for implementing a parametric pulse shape is presented. Specifically, a previously developed method for distinguishing between single-site and multi-site gamma-ray interactions is demonstrated in an on-line digital signal processor, compared with the original off-line pulse-shape analysis routine, and shown to have no significant difference. Reduction {{of the amount of}} the recorded information per event is shown to translate into higher <b>duty-cycle</b> data acquisition <b>rates</b> while retaining the benefits of additional event characterization from pulse-shape analysis.

40|$|LC-QTOF tandem mass spectrometers behave {{according}} to user controlled switching parameters, <b>duty-cycle</b> and repetition <b>rate,</b> which guide {{the selection of}} peptides and the timing of their fragmentation. Using a novel algorithm which analyses all spectra simultaneously, {{it has been found}} that the majority of available peptides are not fragmented with the current switching scheme. Unfortunately, it is not practical to experiment with the mass spectrometer to determine optimal switching parameters. In this study, simulation coupled with intensity surface analysis was used as a method of evaluating mass spectrometer performance. Algorithms that mimic the mass spectrometer were created in order to simulate its response to various data sets. The simulations resulted in operating curves displaying the trade-off between quality and quantity of fragment spectra. The optimal operating curve demonstrated that the current switching scheme is sub-optimal, and that new switching parameters with fewer duty cycles and fewer repetitions should be selected...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} many leading {{technologies}} {{in the field}} of medical sensor systems is on low power consumption and robust data transmission. For example, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which is used to maintain the heart in a healthy state, requires a reliable wireless communication scheme with an extremely low <b>duty-cycle,</b> high bit <b>rate,</b> and energy-efficient media access protocols. Because such devices must be sustained for over 5 years without access to battery replacement, they must be designed to have extremely low power consumption in sleep mode. Here, an on-time, energy-efficient scheduling scheme is proposed that performs power adjustments to minimize the sleep-mode current. The novelty of this scheduler is that it increases the determinacy of power adjustment and the predictability of scheduling by employing non-pre-emptible dual priority scheduling. This predictable scheduling also guarantees the punctuality of important periodic tasks based on their serialization, by using their worst case execution time) and the power consumption optimization. The scheduler was embedded into a system on chip (SoC) developed to support the wireless body area network&# 8212;a wakeup-radio and wakeup-timer for implantable medical devices. This scheduling system is validated by the experimental results of its performance when used with life-time extensions of ICD devices...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] and deployment strategies for remote passive acoustic sensing of marine environments must balance memory capacity, power requirements, sampling <b>rate,</b> <b>duty-cycle,</b> deployment duration, instrument size, and environmental concerns. The impact of different parameters on the data and applicability of the data to the specific questions being asked should be considered before deployment. Here we explore the effect of recording and detection parameters on marine mammal acoustic data across two platforms. Daily classifications of marine mammal vocalizations from two passive acoustic monitors with different subsampling parameters, an AURAL and a Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), collocated in the Bering Sea were compared. The AURAL subsampled on a preset schedule, whereas the PAL sampled via an adaptive protocol. Detected signals of interest were manually classified in each dataset independently. The daily classification rates of vocalizations were similar. Detections from the higher duty-cycle but lower sample rate AURAL were limited to species and vocalizations with energy below 4 kHz precluding detection of echolocation signals. Temporal coverage from the PAL audio files was limited by the adaptive sub-sampling protocol. A method for classifying ribbon (Histriophoca fasciata) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) vocalizations from the sparse spectral time histories of the PAL was developed. Although application of the acoustic entropy as a rapid assessment of biodiversity was not reflective of the number of species detected, acoustic entropy was robust to changes in sample rate and window length...|$|R
