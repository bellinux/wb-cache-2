40|$|Breakage {{phenomenon}} in rocks {{is fundamental to}} mineral processing in comminution processes, and its understanding will facilitate the further development of improved energy efficiency of these unit processes. A significant amount of literature exists in both mineral processing and physics, but unresolved issues still remain. New developments are required in the mathematical descriptions of breakage processes to enable some of the developments required for improved comminution processes. This thesis develops the necessary mathematical models, and the numerical solutions, to investigate “how rocks usually fail”, including: mechanical behaviour, fracture mechanism and failure modes. Experimental results are used to validate the mathematical models and the numerical solutions or results. These new mathematical models are built by using discrete element methods (DEM) having six degrees of freedom, which include three relating to the centre of mass, so called translational motions and three more relating to rotation about the centre of mass, so called rotational motions. The DEM particles in two dimensional DEM models are positioned into a regular triangular lattice with each centre DEM particle surrounding by its six neighbours, and these DEM particles are allowed to undergo elastic deformation in both translational and rotational motions according to tensile force, shear force and flexure torque. The three dimensional DEM models are more complicated as their DEM particles are placed into a hexagonal close packed (HCP) or <b>faced</b> <b>centred</b> <b>cubic</b> (FCC) lattices with each centre DEM particle having twelve nearest neighbours. For the three dimensional cases, the DEM particles undergo elastic deformations into both translational and rotational motions, resulting in joints exhibiting tensile force, both shear forces, torsional torque and both flexure torques. The internal body forces and torques of these DEM models are elastic and their stiffness constants {{are directly related to}} the material elastic properties of macroscopic continuum scales, such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Collectively, the basic concepts described above, were used to build DEM models, to study the complex mechanical behaviour and fracture mechanism of rocks and rocklike materials. The incorporation of the rotational motions, including torsion, flexure and single particle rotation in shear directions into these DEM models improves the accuracy of the numerical solutions and thus it also produces more realistic results. The relation between the bulk properties and the DEM simulations has also been examined by assessing the behaviour of the unit cell used in both DEM modelling concepts and DEM particle simulations. The derived formulae allow the joint properties used in the DEM models to be determined, so that the DEM particle simulations automatically match the bulk properties of the real materials in macroscopic continuum scales. The experimental results from the actual rock tests are used to calibrate the stiffness constants of DEM bonds, and they are later used in the DEM particle simulations. Practical experiments are also used to study rock failure, including: mechanical behaviour, crack initiation and propagation, failure modes and fracture mechanisms. The practical experiments, including rock fragmentation under uniaxial compression, indentation, and X-ray computed tomography techniques, provide results which are used to validate these two and three dimensional DEM models. The numerical solutions after validation provide the required mathematical tools to study rock failure via numerical methods, particularly DEM methods. The numerical solutions from these DEM models provide: 1. The full picture of rock failure, in which rock particles are allowed to undergo elastic deformation in both translational and rotational motions according to tensile force, both shear force, torsional torque and both flexural torque components, will improve the knowledge of understanding the mechanical behaviour of rock failure. 2. The knowledge of understanding rocks, which the numerical solutions obtain from these DEM models, will explain how rocks usually fail according to rock mechanics and rock testing experiments that rocks fail under tensile, shear, torsion and flexure modes...|$|R

40|$|Many natural {{phenomena}} may be modelled using systems of differential equations that possess symmetry. Often the modelling process introduces additional symmetries {{that are only}} approximately present in the real physical system. This thesis investigates how the inclusion of small symmetry breaking effects changes the behaviour of the original solutions, such a process is called forced symmetry breaking. Part I introduces the general equivariant bifurcation theory required {{for the rest of}} this work. In particular, we generalise previous techniques used to study forced symmetry breaking to a certain class of Euclidean invariant problems. This allows the study of the effects of forced symmetry breaking on spatially periodic solutions to differential equations. Part II considers spatially periodic solutions in two dimensions that are supported by the square or hexagonal lattices. The methods of Part I are applied to investigate how the translation free solutions, supported by these lattices, are altered when the perturbation term possesses certain symmetries. This leads to a partial classification theorem, describing the behaviour of these solutions. This classification is extended in Part III to three-dimensional solutions. In particular, the <b>cubic</b> lattices: simple, <b>face</b> <b>centred,</b> and body <b>centred</b> <b>cubic,</b> are considered. The analysis follows the same lines as Part II, but is necessarily more complex. This complexity is also present in the results, there are much richer dynamical possibilities. Parts II and III lead to a partial classification of the behaviour of spatially periodic solutions to differential equations in two and three dimensions. Finally in Part IV the results of Part III, concerning the body <b>centred</b> <b>cubic</b> lattice, are applied to the black-eye Turing instability. In particular, the model of Gomes [39] is cast in a new light where forced symmetry breaking is present, leading to several qualitative predictions.
