5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A <b>heavy</b> <b>element</b> with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E

While theoretical studies already predicted existence of islands of super <b>heavy</b> <b>elements</b> stability back in the 1960s, Marinov’s work and announcements of what he believed to be the discovery of Element 112 significantly fueled the experimental research for Super <b>Heavy</b> <b>Elements.</b> Furthermore, Marinov pioneered with experimental methods based on secondary reactions.

25|$|The first direct {{proof that}} {{nucleosynthesis}} occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it {{late in the}} galaxy, formed with much higher initial <b>heavy</b> <b>element</b> abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of technetium in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952, by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because technetium is radioactive, with a half-life {{much less than the}} age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements, is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20-50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the s-process within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the isotopic compositions of stardust, solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of cosmic dust, and is frequently called presolar grains. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star's late-life mass-loss episodes.|$|E
25|$|Supernova {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurs in}} the energetic environment in supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are synthesized in quasiequilibrium established during fast fusion that attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to 28Si. Quasiequilibrium {{can be thought of}} as almost equilibrium except for a high abundance of the 28Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle's 1954 paper because it provided an overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements between silicon (A=28) and nickel (A=60). It replaced the incorrect although much cited alpha process of the B2FH paper, which inadvertently obscured Hoyle's better 1954 theory. Further nucleosynthesis processes can occur, in particular the r-process (rapid process) described by the B2FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton, in which the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced by rapid absorption of free neutrons. The creation of free neutrons by electron capture during the rapid compression of the supernova core along with assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a primary process, and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He. This is in contrast to the B2FH designation of the process as a secondary process. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a totally satisfactory calculation of r-process abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who have observed old stars born when galactic metallicity was still small, that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each <b>heavy</b> <b>element.</b>|$|E
500|$|An {{early use}} of the term [...] "heavy metal" [...] dates from 1817, when the German chemist Leopold Gmelin divided the {{elements}} into nonmetals, light metals, and heavy metals. Light metals had densities of 0.860–5.0g/cm3; heavy metals 5.308–22.000. The term later became associated with elements of high atomic weight or high atomic number. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term <b>heavy</b> <b>element.</b> For example, in discussing the history of nuclear chemistry, Magee notes that the actinides were once thought to represent a new <b>heavy</b> <b>element</b> transition group whereas Seaborg and co-workers, [...] "favoured... a heavy metal rare-earth like series...".

The system has also been found to approximately every 3 days brighten by around 3.5 K-band magnitudes, possibly due {{to the presence of}} a synchrotron jet.

500|$|The {{chemical}} composition {{of a star}} provides important clues to its evolutionary history, including {{the age at which}} it formed. The interstellar medium of dust and gas from which stars form is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of heavier elements. As nearby stars continually evolve and die, they seed the interstellar medium with an increasing portion of heavier elements. Thus younger stars will tend to have a higher portion of heavy elements in their atmospheres than do the older stars. These heavy elements are termed metals by astronomers and the portion of heavy elements is the metallicity. The amount of metallicity in a star is given in terms of the ratio of iron (Fe), an easily observed <b>heavy</b> <b>element,</b> to hydrogen.

The interior model of Jupiter is calculated from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, mass and energy conservation, and energy transport. The mass of the core and <b>heavy</b> <b>elements</b> is adjusted to match Jupiter's observational constrains radius and gravitational moments. We show that the determination of Jupiter interior structure is tied to the estimation of its gravitational moments and the accuracy of equations of state of hydrogen, helium and <b>heavy</b> <b>elements.</b> The location of the region where Helium rain occurs as well as its timescale are important to determine the distribution of <b>heavy</b> <b>elements</b> and helium in the interior of Jupiter. We show that differences find when modeling Jupiter's interior with recent EOS are more likely due to differences in the internal energy and entropy calculation. The consequent changes in the thermal profile lead to different estimations of the mass of the core and <b>heavy</b> <b>elements,</b> explaining differences in recently published Jupiter interior models.

They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling.

Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch.
