25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting linear motion to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} <b>gear's</b> <b>rim.</b> As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its linear motion would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|R
40|$|Reduced {{weight is}} a major design goal in {{aircraft}} power transmissions. Some gear designs incorporate thin rims to help meet this goal. Thin rims, however, may lead to bending fatigue cracks. These cracks may propagate through a gear tooth or into the <b>gear</b> <b>rim.</b> A crack that propagates through a tooth would probably not be catastrophic, and ample warning of a failure could be possible. On the other hand, a crack that propagates through the rim would be catastrophic. Such cracks could lead to disengagement of a rotor or propeller from an engine, loss of an aircraft, and fatalities. To help create and validate tools for the gear designer, the NASA Lewis Research Center performed in-house analytical and experimental studies to investigate the effect of rim thickness on gear-tooth crack propagation. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} cracks grew through gear teeth (benign failure mode) or through gear rims (catastrophic failure mode) for various rim thicknesses. In addition, we investigated the effect of rim thickness on crack propagation life. A finite-element-based computer program simulated gear-tooth crack propagation. The analysis used principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, and quarter-point, triangular elements were used at the crack tip to represent the stress singularity. The program had an automated crack propagation option in which cracks were grown numerically via an automated remeshing scheme. Crack-tip stress-intensity factors were estimated to determine crack-propagation direction. Also, various fatigue crack growth models were used to estimate crack-propagation life. Experiments were performed in Lewis' Spur Gear Fatigue Rig to validate predicted crack propagation results. Gears with various backup ratios were tested to validate crack-path predictions. Also, test gears were installed with special crack-propagation gages in the tooth fillet region to measure bending-fatigue crack growth. From both predictions and tests, gears with backup ratios (rim thickness divided by tooth height) of 3. 3 and 1. 0 produced tooth fractures, whereas a backup ratio of 0. 3 produced rim fractures. For a backup ratio of 0. 5, the experiments produced rim fractures and the predictions produced both rim and tooth fractures, depending on the initial geometry of the crack. Good correlation between predicted and measured crack growth was achieved when the fatigue crack-closure concept was introduced into the analysis. As the <b>gear</b> <b>rim</b> thickness decreased, the compressive cyclic stress in the gear-tooth fillet region increased.

40|$|Thin-rim gears {{are often}} used in {{applications}} where light weight and compact design are demanded. Since the <b>gear</b> <b>rim</b> is more rigid {{in the area of}} the gear web, this influences the load as well as the contact stress distribution along the tooth face width.

The system consists of a handheld laser scanning sensor and a position sensor. The laser scanning sensor is used to acquire the surface and geometry information, and the position sensor is utilized to unify the scanning sensors into a global coordinate system. The measurement process includes data collection, multi-sensor data fusion and surface reconstruction. With the multi-sensor data fusion, errors accumulated during the image alignment and registration process are minimized, and the measuring precision is significantly improved. After the dense accurate acquisition of the three-dimensional (3 -D) coordinates, the surface is reconstructed using a commercial software piece, based on the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surface. The system has been evaluated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using reference measurements provided by a commercial laser scanning sensor.

40|$|Results {{of using}} vibration-based methods to detect gear tooth fatigue cracks are presented. An {{experimental}} test rig {{was used to}} fail a number of spur gear specimens through bending fatigue. The gear tooth fatigue crack in each test was initiated through a small notch in the fillet area of a tooth on the gear. The primary purpose of these tests was to verify analytical predictions of fatigue crack propagation direction and rate {{as a function of}} <b>gear</b> <b>rim</b> thickness. The vibration signal from a total of three tests was monitored and recorded for gear fault detection research. The damage consisted of complete rim fracture on the two thin rim gears and single tooth fracture on the standard full rim test gear.

The objectives of this effort were to identify methods capable of detecting the fatigue crack and to determine how far in advance of total failure positive detection was given. Results show that the fault detection methods failed to respond to the fatigue crack prior to complete rim fracture in the thin rim gear tests.

Resonance vibrations can create serious problems of malfunctions and even catastrophic failures. A reliable numerical model is surely a convenient means to perform preliminary simulations {{to identify the}} most critical resonance conditions and evaluate the effect of structural modifications on the dynamic behaviour of the component in the design development phase. Most numerical investigations {{found in the literature}} are carried out on simplified models of the rotating bodies likened to discs to reduce the computational effort. In this work a novel approach based on the application of Duhamel’s integral for the determination of the dynamic behaviour of a rotating gear subject to meshing forces has been developed to obtain more reliable results with a realistic model at an affordable computational cost. The gear response to dynamic excitation is obtained by the determination of its response to impulse using a single 3 D finite element transient analysis taking afterwards into account the effect of the gear rotation. Subsequently, the Duhamel’s integral is applied using the tooth load time history in order to simulate as realistically as possible the gear load conditions.

In order to bring the excellent properties of worm gear transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of worm gear made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of worm gear with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 worm gear is radial fracture in <b>gear</b> <b>rim.</b> Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of worm gear of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes worm gear has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth worm gear of ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation of worm gear.

Two kinds of experiments were done using twenty-eight steel internal gears (standard spur gear, operating pressure angle 20 °) which had different number of teeth, module, rim thickness and radius of center line of rim. On the one hand we took the effect that the teeth increased the stiffness of its rim from measuring the natural frequency of the internal gear in its own plane, on the other we took it from the relationship between the magnitude of the force and deflection when static force was applied to the radial direction of the internal gear. So the internal gears were replaced by rings of equivalent stiffness. Therefore the stiffness of the rim section in the internal gear including the teeth was described as the equivalent ring thickness with stiffness.

50|$|Two early {{improvements}} were suspension {{wheels and}} <b>rim</b> <b>gearing.</b> Suspension wheels are {{constructed in the}} same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by William Fairburn can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the Portland Basin Canal Warehouse.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject is}} the {{aircraft}} bevel gears, which {{are part of}} the drive systems of gas turbine engines and helicopter transmissions. The article deals with defect specifics of the aircraft conical gears with a circular tooth as compared to the conical gear wheels of general engineering. The finite element method has been used to find by calculation that the main reason for destruction of aircraft bevel gears is a resonant vibration excitation of the <b>gear</b> wheel <b>rim</b> due to its nodal diameter eigenvibrations happened to be within the operating range of the transmission rotation frequencies. A parametric finite element model has been developed. It allows us to investigate the impact of modification parameters of the drive side of gear wheels on the function of the kinematic transmission error at different values of transmitted torque. Using the method of main coordinates, a reduced dynamic model of the bevel gear has been developed to allow simulating the vibration intensity of bevel gears with various parameters of the working profile modification. Within the framework of evaluation test of the dynamic model, amplitude-frequency characteristics have been constructed for the main parameters of transmission oscillations, including vibrational stresses in the teeth space. It is found that modification parameters of the transmission drive side {{have a significant effect on}} the vibration intensity of the bevel gears in the entire operating range. The main factor affecting the vibration stress amplitude in the gear wheel is the amplitude of the kinematic error function with the corresponding torque transmitted. The obtained research results can be used when designing the new aircraft drives and modernizing the existing ones. As part of the further development, it is expected to create a technique for recording the damage accumulation in the conical gears, taking into account the typical flight profile of a gas turbine engine or a helicopter. </p...|$|R
