25|$|Following the 1875-76 Royal Commission {{into the}} Volunteer Forces, the Victorian Government invited the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> and Fortifications in London, Lieutenant General Sir William Jervois, to Victoria to further advise on Victoria's defences. He arrived in 1877 {{accompanied}} by the now Colonel Scratchley. Their joint report recommended that the basic defences for the Colony should be concentrated on the Heads, and consist of fortifications {{at the entrance to}} the Bay and on the shoals between the main shipping channels. Between 1879 and 1886 their recommendations were substantially actioned and the Bay defences were progressively developed.|$|E
500|$|Air Marshal Sir Valston Eldridge (Val) Hancock, [...] (31 May 1907– 29September 1998) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He served as Chief of the Air Staff from 1961 to 1965. A graduate of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Hancock transferred to the RAAF in 1929 and qualified as a pilot. His administrative training at Duntroon saw him primarily occupy staff posts, including Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence at RAAF Headquarters from 1931 to 1935, and <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> and Buildings from 1937 to 1939. During {{the early years of}} World WarII, he commanded No.1 Bombing and Gunnery School, and held senior planning and administrative positions. He eventually saw combat in the Aitape–Wewak campaign of the Pacific War during 1945. Flying Bristol Beaufort light bombers, he led first No.100 Squadron, and later No.71 Wing. His actions earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
500|$|Hancock's initial postings after {{qualifying}} {{as a pilot}} were to Nos.1 and 3 Squadrons. It was, however, {{common practice}} for Duntroon graduates to be given staff positions in the Air Force because of their training in administration, and Hancock was no exception. He {{spent most of the}} 1930s in a succession of posts at RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. From 1931 to 1935, he served as Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence. He married Joan Butler on 26May 1932; the couple had two sons and a daughter. By 1935, Hancock had been promoted to flight lieutenant and appointed Staff Officer to the Chief of the Air Staff. In 1937 he was posted to Britain to attend the RAF Staff College, Andover. Like other Commonwealth air forces, the RAAF maintained close technological and educational ties with the Royal Air Force, and Hancock was one of 30 Australian officers to pass through Andover before the outbreak of World WarII. Returning to Australia in 1938, he was promoted to squadron leader and became <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> and Buildings, commonly known as [...] "Works and Bricks", at RAAF Headquarters.|$|E

2500|$|The work of {{creating}} parks, squares and promenades during the Belle Époque {{continued in the}} Second Empire style. The projects were managed at first by Jean-Charles Alphand, {{who had been the}} head of department of parks and promenades under Haussmann and was elevated to the post of Director of Public Works of Paris, a position he held until his death in 1891. He was also the <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> of the 1889 Universal Exposition, responsible for building the exposition's gardens and pavilions. Alphand finished several of the projects begun under Haussmann: [...] the Parc Montsouris (1869–78), the Square Boucicaut (1873), and the Square Popincourt (later renamed Parmentier, and still later Maurice-Gardette), which replaced a demolished slaughterhouse and opened in 1872. Alphand's first major project of the Belle Époque was the Jardins du Trocadéro, the site of the Universal Exposition of 1878 that surrounded the enormous Palais de Trocadéro, which served as the main building for the exposition. He filled the park with a grotto, fountains, gardens and statues (the statues can now be seen on the parvis of the Musée d'Orsay). The park also displayed the full-sized head of the Statue of Liberty before the statue was completed and shipped to New York City. The grotto and much of the park are still preserved as they were. It was used again for the Universal Exposition of 1889 Exposition, and with new fountains and a new palace added, it was also used for the Universal Exposition of 1937.|$|E
