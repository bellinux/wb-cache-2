40|$|A {{new model}} for the {{evaluation}} of antifungal compounds against oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal mucosal colonization by Candida albicans was developed. To simulate the immune deficiency observed in AIDS patients, mice were depleted of CD 4 + T lymphocytes by the injection of either GK 1. 5 hybridoma cells or purified anti-CD 4 + T lymphocytes by the injection of either GK 1. 5 hybridoma cells or purified anti-CD 4 + monoclonal antibody derived from GK 1. 5 <b>hybridoma</b> cells in <b>tissue</b> <b>culture.</b> Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of splenic lymphocytes confirmed the elimination of the CD 4 + T-cell population. Gentamicin, a broad-spectrum, nonabsorbable aminoglycoside antibiotic, was given via the drinking water to reduce the normal gastrointestinal microflora, allowing less competition for colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by the C. albicans isolates. Mice were challenged by gavage and swabbing their oral mucosae with a pure culture of C. albicans. Gentamicin was withdrawn 3 days postchallenge, and antifungal compounds were administered via the drinking water ad libitum at concentrations ranging from 25 to 400 micrograms/ml. L- 693989, a water-soluble phosphorylated cyclic lipopeptide prodrug of pneumocandin Bo, and L- 733560, a semisynthetic derivative of pneumocandin Bo, are inhibitors of 1, 3 -beta-D-glucan synthesis that exhibit potent in vivo anti-Candida spp. and anti-Pneumocystis carinii activities. The efficacies of L- 693989, L- 733560, fluconazole, ketoconazole, and nystatin were evaluated in this new oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal model of mucosal colonization. L- 693989, L- 733560, fluconazole, and ketoconazole showed superior efficacies in reducing the numbers of C. albicans CFU per gram of feces and the numbers of oral CFU relative to those in sham-treated controls in this model, while nystatin was moderately effective in reducing oral and fecal colonization by C. albicans in this model...|$|R

The findings on the growth zone of the cultued tissue in the fixed and stained specimens show the picture specific to monocytio leukemia, and promonocytes and monocytes present the picture of these cells in actual motion. Although the each finding is somewhat inferior to that of smeared-stained specimens, it is, nevertheless a fair picture. 3.
