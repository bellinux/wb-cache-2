5|$|On July 14, 2004, {{four people}} {{were struck by}} flying debris while riding the coaster. Reports {{indicated}} that a metal cable frayed during launch, shearing off shards of metal that struck the riders. The injuries were mainly arm abrasions, with one passenger experiencing cuts to the face. They were treated at the park's <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>station,</b> and two later sought further medical attention.|$|E

500|$|Portable {{toilets and}} <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>stations</b> were also provided. Because the rally was held {{the day before}} the {{previously}} scheduled Marine Corps Marathon, the rally planners originally requested to share the portable toilets planned for the marathon runners. The marathon organizers refused, so a second set of portable toilets was ordered.|$|R

50|$|The resort {{maintains}} its own private fire department, called the Disneyland Resort Fire Department (DFD). DFD has several fire trucks stationed throughout the resort property {{and has the}} capability to put out minor structural fires; however, its primary purpose is fire prevention and investigation. Most of the department's operations are behind the scenes; the Main Street Fire House and other emergency-response-themed facades at the Resort are for show only and are not actual operations of the DFD. The resort also maintains a staff of nurses 24 {{hours a day to}} operate <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>stations</b> situated in each park and hotel, as well as to act as first responders to emergency situations that occur away from the <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>stations.</b> Fire and rescue services beyond the capability of the DFD and/or the nursing staff are handled by the Anaheim Fire Department (AFD), which has a station just east of the Resort property. AFD also maintains a constant paramedic presence at the Resort.|$|R
25|$|Lacking {{in beauty}} and social graces, Alexandra avoided court functions, instead {{dividing}} her time between her charitable activities and farm {{work on the}} family's summer residence, Znamenka Palace, near Peterhof, which {{had been given to}} them as a wedding present. During the summer months at Znamenka, Nicholas and Alexandra entertained guests there. Grand Duchess Alexandra was also a gifted artist. She adorned the walls of Znamenka with her paintings.

25|$|On June 18, {{several weeks}} after the {{original}} lockout, between 900-1100 dockers and their supporters marched through Vancouver towards Ballantyne Pier where non-union workers were unloading ships. The strikers were met at the pier by several hundred armed policemen. Attempting to force their way through, the dockers soon found themselves under attack from the police lines. Many marchers were clubbed {{as they tried to}} run to safety, while many others tried hopelessly to fight back, using whatever weapons they could find. Aided by Mounties who had been posted nearby, the police continued to attack the strikers. The VDWWA union hall was attacked, with tear gas being used against members of the women's auxiliary who had set up a <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>station</b> inside. The battle continued for three hours, and ended with several hospitalizations, including that of a fleeing striker who {{had been shot in the}} back of his legs.|$|E
25|$|In July, the Permanente Foundation {{formed to}} operate Northern California {{hospitals}} {{that would be}} linked to the outpatient health plans, followed shortly thereafter by the creation of Northern Permanente Foundation for Oregon and Washington and Southern Permanente Foundation for California. The name Permanente came from Permanente Creek, which flowed past Henry Kaiser's first cement plant on Black Mountain in Cupertino, California. Kaiser's first wife, Bess Fosburgh, liked the name. An abandoned Oakland facility was modernized as the 170-bed Permanente Hospital opened on August 1, 1942. Three weeks later, the 71-bed Richmond Field Hospital opened. Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat industrial accidents and minor illness. Each <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>station</b> had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required. Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care. The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver, Washington. Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage; and within a year the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month. These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers. In 1944, Kaiser decided to continue the program after the war and to open it up to the general public.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday, March 21, 1965 {{more than}} 3,000 people began the third march, {{including}} blacks, whites, doctors, nurses, working-class people, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many famous people participated, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Ralph Bunche, Coretta Scott King, Ralph Abernathy, and Andrew Young. It took five {{days for the}} protesters to reach their goal. Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. On Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end, where a “Night of the Stars” celebration was held the City of St. Jude with performances by many popular entertainers of the day, including Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis, Jr., Joan Baez, and Dick Gregory. Liuzzo helped at the <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>station.</b> On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, with a Confederate flag flying above it. Martin Luther King addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march, a [...] "shining moment in American history." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the assault}} on Blanc Mont, which started on 3 October, March [...] "left a shelter to rescue wounded". The next day, [...] "during a counterattack, the enemy having {{advanced}} to within 300 meters of the <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>station,</b> he immediately entered the engagement and though wounded refused to be evacuated until the Germans were thrown back". As {{a result of his}} actions, March received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm and the Army Distinguished Service Cross for valor (the Distinguished Service Cross is the second highest Army decoration, next only to the Medal of Honor). A curious detail emerges from the account of his war experiences that would find its way into his fiction: though it appears he was never gassed badly enough to be hospitalized for it, upon his return from the war he told people that he was and that he only had a short time to live; a number of characters in Company K suffer and die after mustard gas attacks. Roy Simmonds, March's biographer, locates what he calls the [...] "two worlds of William March" [...] (the title of his biography) in this period: throughout his life, March appears to have mixed reality with imagined memory, telling supposedly historical anecdotes that may not have been true. An experience March told a number of times included his jumping into a bomb crater to take shelter and coming {{face to face with a}} young German soldier, whom he instantly bayoneted; this anecdote also found its way into Company K.|$|E

5000|$|Notes: Ted Nugent joined Aerosmith {{on stage}} for a rousing {{rendition}} of [...] "Milk Cow Blues". For comic relief, Cheech & Chong entertained the crowd between a couple of acts. The temperature reached 104 degrees that day (over 120 degrees on the field). To protect the Cotton Bowl, they covered the surface with black tarps. Over 100,000 people were in attendance on the hottest day of the decade. The concert had hose sprinklers around the field edge to cool people off, and they hosed the crowd down with firehoses from the stage. <b>First</b> <b>aid</b> <b>stations</b> were busy.|$|R
2500|$|College Health is a {{field of}} {{medicine}} that exclusively deals with the medical care of college age students (from age 18 through 28 years). [...] Many colleges and universities campuses offer some sort of student health service, but there is wide variability in the healthcare resources available from campus to campus, with models of student health ranging from <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>stations</b> employing a single nurse to large multi-specialty clinics with hundreds of employees. [...] The vast majority of college health services are set up as service units rather than academic departments. The educational aspect of college health is sometimes referred to Health Promotion in Higher Education.|$|R
50|$|A {{military}} {{vehicle is}} a type of vehicle that includes all land combat and transportation vehicles, which are designed for or are significantly used by military forces. Many military vehicles have vehicle armour plate or off-road capabilities or both. Under the Geneva Conventions, all non-combatant military vehicles such as field ambulances and mobile <b>first</b> <b>aid</b> <b>stations</b> must be properly and clearly marked as such. In theory under the conventions, such vehicles are then legally immune from deliberate attack by all combatants. A subtype that has become increasingly prominent since the late 20th Century is the improvised fighting vehicle, and is often seen in irregular warfare.|$|R
