5|$|MacLaren {{had many}} jobs as he {{attempted}} {{to find ways to}} support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various time, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became involved in his employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.|$|E
25|$|Boelcke won {{his first}} {{individual}} aerial combat while flying in E.3/15 on 19 August 1915. Just nine days later, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> on the ground. He dived into a canal near his aerodrome, fully clothed, and rescued a drowning French boy, Albert DePlace. The child's parents wanted Boelcke to be awarded the French Legion d'Honneur; instead, he received the Prussian Lifesaving Medal.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his history}} of brutal acts and savagery, there was enough in his undoubted courage, his many fights against heavy odds, his {{occasional}} acts of mercy and charity, his conventional piety and calculated courting of publicity to ensure that Lampião entered Brazilian folk-history as a hero. One of the more dispassionate analyses of Lampião concluded that, if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> he was an anarchist hero who forged a prominent place for himself in a society and political environment where people put their own interests above all other considerations.|$|E

50|$|Titan {{has many}} powers that are {{commonly}} found in superheroes, including the powers of flight, super-strength, and a heightened ability to withstand pain. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in the mold of such archetypal characters as DC's Superman and Astro City's Samaritan.|$|R
25|$|Rosecrans {{once again}} found that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in the Northern press. On October 24, {{he was given}} command of XIV Corps (which, because he was also given command of the Department of the Cumberland, would soon be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), {{replacing}} the ineffectual Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who had just fought the inconclusive Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, against Gen. Braxton Bragg, but was accused of moving too cautiously. Rosecrans was promoted {{to the rank of}} major general (of volunteers, as opposed to his brigadier rank in the regular army). The promotion was applied retroactive to March 21, 1862, so that he would outrank fellow Maj. Gen. Thomas; Thomas had earlier been offered Buell's command, but turned down the opportunity {{out of a sense of}} personal loyalty. Grant was not unhappy that Rosecrans was leaving his command.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton {{was made}} a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) by [...] King Edward, who later conferred a knighthood on him. The RGS {{presented}} him with a gold medal, although apparently with reservations—"We do not propose to make the Medal so large as that which was awarded to Captain Scott", recorded an official. Although {{in the eyes of}} the public <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> the riches that Shackleton had anticipated failed to materialise. The soaring costs of the expedition and the need to meet loan guarantees meant that he was saved from financial embarrassment only by a belated government grant of £20,000.|$|E
500|$|Arnada was {{released}} in June 2011, after the Supreme Court agreed with his defense that a journalist's professional acts should be tried under the Press Code and not Criminal Code. Numerous commentators, including Arnada, {{described it as a}} victory for the country's freedom of press. However, responding to calls that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> Arnada stated [...] "I’m not a hero, nor a victim. I’m just another version of history"; he considered his experience less drastic than that of journalists elsewhere in the country. In a 2013 interview Arnada stated that his incarceration had [...] "muted his 'insane ambitions'"; Arnada's friends stated that he had been deeply changed by the term.|$|E
5000|$|Damage Control {{creates a}} new {{division}} called, [...] "Search and Rescue" [...] that focuses on finding survivors in wreckage.

500|$|George {{warned in}} the Senate, [...] "I {{do not want}} a {{president}} of the U.S. to conclude an executive agreement which will make it unlawful for me to kill a cat in the back alley of my lot at night and I do not want the President of the U.S. to make a treaty with India which would preclude me from butchering a cow in my own pasture." [...] Senator George was ideal as an opponent as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to conservatives of both parties for his opposition to the New Deal and his survival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unsuccessful effort to purge him when he sought re-election in 1938. [...] "Democrats and Republicans alike respected him and recognized his influence." ...|$|E
500|$|After winning {{his second}} world title, he {{embarked}} on a European tour which took him all over the Continent. Robinson traveled with his flamingo-pink Cadillac, which caused quite a stir in Paris, and an entourage of 13 people, some included [...] "just for laughs". <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in France due to his recent defeat of LaMotta—the French hated LaMotta for defeating Marcel Cerdan in 1949 and taking his championship belt (Cerdan {{died in a plane}} crash en route to a rematch with LaMotta). Robinson met President of France Vincent Auriol at a ceremony attended by France's social upper crust. During his fight in Berlin against Gerhard Hecht, Robinson was disqualified when he knocked his opponent with a punch to the kidney: a punch legal in the US, but not Europe. The fight was later declared a no-contest. In London, Robinson lost the world middleweight title to British boxer Randolph Turpin in a sensational bout. Three months later in a rematch in front of 60,000 fans at the Polo Grounds, he knocked Turpin out in ten rounds to recover the title. In that bout Robinson was leading on the cards but was cut by Turpin. With the fight in jeopardy, Robinson let loose on Turpin, knocking him down, then getting him to the ropes and unleashing a series of punches that caused the referee to stop the bout. Following Robinson's victory, residents of Harlem danced in the streets. In 1951, Robinson was named Ring Magazine's [...] "Fighter of the Year" [...] for the second time.|$|E
2500|$|Although Tarleton {{gained the}} {{reputation}} among Americans as a butcher for {{his involvement in}} the Waxhaw massacre in South Carolina, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in Liverpool, England.

Gail and Ena reveal that they usually do not have enough money to buy food as they use it to buy equipment; it is they reason they lose all the time.|$|R
2500|$|Sidney had a {{significant}} effect on the American conception of liberty. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> of John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, [...] "the best-read and most widely regarded pamphleteers of prerevolutionary times." [...] Their [...] "Cato's Letters (after which the modern libertarian think tank the Cato Institute is named)" [...] adopted Sidney's argument that [...] "free men always have the right to resist tyrannical government". Thomas Jefferson believed Sidney and Locke to be the two primary sources for the Founding Fathers' view of liberty.|$|E
2500|$|Archbishop John R. Roach, {{president}} of the US Catholic bishops, called Sands's death [...] "a useless sacrifice". The Ledger of 5 May 1981 under the headline [...] "To some <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> to others a terrorist" [...] claims that the hunger strike made Sands [...] "a hero among Irish Republicans or Nationalists seeking the reunion of Protestant-dominated and British-ruled Northern Ireland with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic to the south". The Ledger cited Sands as telling his friends: [...] "If I die, God will understand" [...] {{and one of his}} last messages was [...] "Tell everyone I'll see them somewhere, sometime".|$|E
2500|$|Grant wrote disgustedly, [...] "Two {{or three}} hours of pursuit {{on the day of}} the battle without {{anything}} except what the men carried on their persons, would have been worth more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possibly been." [...] Rosecrans returned to Corinth to find that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in the Northern press. He was soon ordered to Cincinnati, where he was given command of the Army of the Ohio (soon to be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), replacing Don Carlos Buell, who had similarly failed to pursue retreating Confederates from the Battle of Perryville.|$|E

He {{believed}} in human equality and freedom for people not only for African people, for all people around the world. for his holy goal, he sacrificed many things. He was jailed and banished.

2500|$|Quantrill and his partisans staged {{numerous}} raids into Kansas {{during the}} early part of the Civil War. He was quickly labeled as an outlaw by the Union for his attacks. He was involved in several skirmishes with Jayhawkers and eventually was made a Captain in the Confederate Army. Quantrill's men regularly yelled out the phrase 'Osceola'. This referred to the sacking of Osceola, Missouri where Federal Officer James Henry Lane had his men burn and loot both Loyal and Confederate sympathizers indiscriminately. Quantrill was later shot in an ambush by Union militia on May 10, 1865 during a raid in Kentucky, and died in a Louisville prison on June 6. However, he quickly became an admired figure of the Civil War from a southern perspective. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to his supporters in Missouri, and his fame actually assisted several other outlaw figures of the old west. As such, in August 1864, a clash occurred by Fort Gibson between Federal troops and remnants of Quantrill's Raiders. During this skirmish, American outlaw Jesse James was deliberately shot in the right lung while attempting to surrender to Union militia. [...] Between 1888 and 1929, members of Quantrill's Raiders gathered to recount their war efforts. Today, there is the [...] "William Clarke Quantrill Society" [...] which was established to dedicate the study of Quantrill, his followers, and their involvement in the Civil War era border wars. Director Lee summarized that Ride with the Devil was [...] "not simply a war movie. It's more about the love and friendships that take place during a war. The film is both big and small, both epic and domestic." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{film critic}} Pauline Kael, [...] "Brando {{represented}} {{a reaction against}} the post-war mania for security. As a protagonist, the Brando of the early fifties had no code, only his instincts. He was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw. He was antisocial because he knew society was crap; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to youth because he was strong enough {{not to take the}} crap... Brando represented a contemporary version of the free American... Brando is still the most exciting American actor on the screen." [...] Sociologist Dr. Suzanne Mcdonald-Walker states: [...] "Marlon Brando, sporting leather jacket, jeans, and moody glare, became a cultural icon summing up 'the road' in all its maverick glory." [...] His portrayal of the gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One has become an iconic image, used both as a symbol of rebelliousness and a fashion accessory that includes a Perfecto style motorcycle jacket, a tilted cap, jeans and sunglasses. Johnny's haircut inspired a craze for sideburns, followed by James Dean and Elvis Presley, among others. Dean copied Brando's acting style extensively and Presley used Brando's image as a model for his role in Jailhouse Rock. The [...] "I coulda been a contender" [...] scene from On the Waterfront, according to the author of Brooklyn Boomer, Martin H. Levinson, is [...] "one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history, and the line itself has become part of America's cultural lexicon." [...] Brando's powerful [...] "Wild One" [...] image was still, as of 2011, being marketed by the makers of his Triumph Thunderbird motorcycle, in a range of clothing inspired by his character from the film and licensed by Brando's estate.|$|E

2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E
