2500|$|Shanties {{have also}} been {{well-documented}} in use for tasks other {{than those of the}} deep-water sailor. The working of cargo was performed by stevedores to the accompaniment of shanties, for example {{in the tradition of the}} Georgia Sea Island Singers of St. Simons Island, Georgia. They used such shanties as [...] "Knock a Man Down" [...] (a variation of [...] "Blow the Man Down") to load heavy timber. The category of menhaden chanties refers to work songs used on menhaden fishing boats, sung while pulling up the purse-seine nets. The musical forms, and consequently the repertoire, of menhaden chanties differ significantly from the deep-water shanties, most noticeably in the fact that the workers [...] "pull" [...] in between rather than concurrently with certain words of the songs. Common examples are [...] "The Johnson Girls" [...] and [...] "Won't You <b>Help</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Raise 'Em Boys." [...] Off-shore whalermen in parts of the Caribbean sang shanties whilst rowing their whaleboats and when hauling their catch onto land.|$|E
