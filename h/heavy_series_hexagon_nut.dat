40|$|Corrosion of the {{metallic}} film in cylindrical metallized film capacitors generally progresses {{from the end}} caps {{toward the center of}} the film. Promoted by the penetration of moisture from outside, the corrosion is usually more advanced in the outer layers where the windings are less compressed. This progression can result in increasing lengths of metallization being disconnected from direct connection to the zinc-sprayed end caps (schooping), resulting in long serial connection back to some point deeper in the spiral winding of the capacitor where contact to schooping still exists. In addition, vestigial remnants of metal, more resistant to corrosion, may remain at various points, bridging the gap between the schooping and the metallization. Theoretical analysis indicates that <b>heavy</b> <b>series</b> current at the still-connected end of the metal film and excessive current density in the vestigial links can result in localized heating that exceed the tolerance of the dielectric, resulting in catastrophic failure. Such heating and probable fusing of remnant links are prime suspects in the catastrophic failure of metallized polypropylene capacitors...|$|R

50|$|Following {{its opening}} salvo on 4 May, the FLNC {{launched}} another <b>heavy</b> <b>series</b> of bomb attacks across the island on 20 May. The series of attacks {{and the emergence}} of the FLNC coincided with the trial of ten members of the recently outlawed Action Régionaliste Corse. The prosecutors claimed that the men had been involved in the shooting dead of two French police officers that summer. During the summer the FLNC became more active, and on the night of 17 July it carried out a fresh wave of attacks which included a rocket and mortar attack on the gendarmerie in Aghione which employed the use of an American M79 grenade launcher. This increased speculation that the FLNC were being supplied by Libya, who were at the time supplying other revolutionary groups in Europe, including the Provisional IRA. By September 1976 the FLNC were attempting assassinations of high-ranking French military officials. In separate incidents in the town of Corte, a general narrowly missed assassination when his car was riddled with bullets; his driver lost an ear in the attack. Meanwhile, the home of another senior officer in the town was targeted in a bomb attack. On 7 September, seven masked militiamen hijacked and bombed a Boeing 707 parked at Ajaccio's airport.|$|R
