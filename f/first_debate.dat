5|$|Holmboe's {{significant}} impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools.

5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools.

Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the <b>first</b> <b>debate</b> on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 470s, Daoists fleeing from the Northern Wei court had {{transformed}} Louguan into an important religious center. According to legend, Louguan {{used to be}} the home of Yin Xi, the first recipient of the Dao de jing. At this time, the center's buildings were greatly expanded, and many Daoist scriptures were collected, including materials from the Lingbao and Shangqing schools. During the 7th century, the school had a prominent role in a series of debates that examined whether Buddhism or Daoism would be better suited to bring stability to the realm. The <b>first</b> <b>debate</b> surrounded Fuyi, a scholar and Daoist who proposed that Buddhism be abolished in China. Naturally, the Buddhists were not happy with his suggestions and countered his arguments in several treatises. The second debate concerned Lu Zhongqing, a friend of Fu Yi, who wrote about Buddhism's inferiority to Daoism. The Tang emperors were in support of the Daoists, and in 637 issued an edict that secured the precedence of Daoism over Buddhism. This edict remained in place until 674, when Empress Wu Zetian came to power. At the same time, Louguan also served as a refuge for Daoists fleeing the persecution of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty to the south. The final Northern Celestial Master, Yin Wencao arrived at Louguan in 636 and later achieved the favor of the Gaozong Emperor. After Yin's death in 688, Louguan remained an important place of Daoist learning, but ceased to be considered part of a distinct school.|$|E
