5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E

25|$|Despite an 11th {{fatality}} from {{a training}} crash in Wyoming on March 17, the Army resumed the program again on March 19, 1934, in better weather, using only nine routes, limited schedules, and hurried improvements in instrument flying. The O-38E, {{which had been}} involved in two fatal accidents at Cheyenne, Wyoming, was withdrawn completely from the operation despite its enclosed cockpit because of its propensity to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> unrecoverable spin in the mountainous terrain. In early April the Air Corps removed all pilots with less than two years' experience from the operation.|$|E

However, during 1940, the potential termination of all {{production of the}} type was considered in response to aerodynamic performance problems that had caused the loss of multiple aircraft; the type was retained after changes {{were made to the}} wing to rectify a tendency to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> uncontrollable spin that could occur during turns.|$|E

500|$|Let Go {{has earned}} mostly {{positive}} responses from critics, earning 68 points on Metacritic {{based on the}} collated reviews from 7 publications. Rolling Stone magazine's music critic Pat Blashill wrote that the album [...] "comes fully loaded with another dozen infectious hymns of Total Request angst". Blashill complimented Lavigne on having a [...] "great voice", adding she crafted the album with [...] "a qualified staff of hitmakers". [...] Christina Saraceno of AllMusic noted that Lavigne [...] "handles {{a variety of styles}} deftly", while also complimenting her as [...] "a capable songwriter with vocal chops". Nonetheless, Saraceno opined that [...] "at her age, one imagines, she is still finding her feet, borrowing from the music she's grown up listening to". John Perry of Blender magazine summarized Let <b>Go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> [...] "outstanding guitar-pop debut". A review in Q magazine praised Lavigne for displaying [...] "a musical guile way beyond her years". Kaj Roth of Melodic felt that Lavigne [...] "sings lovely and some of the songs goes in the Alanis Morissette [...] vein." [...] For Jon Caramanica of Entertainment Weekly magazine (who gave the album a B−), [...] "Lavigne's monochromatic debut set of unimaginative guitar rock is saved only by the earnestness of her songs." ...|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{shot at the}} Hospital {{maternity}} {{ward and}} the warehouse were shot at a new studio called [...] "The Coca-Cola Factory" [...] which was formerly a Coke bottling plant. The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot. The hospital segment's location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons. While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to {{give the appearance of}} night time, which allowed the crew to film {{at any time during the}} day. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days often losing track of the time of day. After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This led to having the last scene be one long five-minute scene of action to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during the scene when two characters <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> elevator to talk for twenty seconds, the crew changes the scene entirely and sets up the explosions for the scene to continue seamlessly. An accident occurred while filming the hospital sequence. Real glass was used and pieces of it flew toward Tony Leung and got into his eyes. Leung was sent to the hospital and after a week's rest, he returned to the set. Woo changed the ending of Hard Boiled after many members of the crew of the film felt that Leung's character should survive at the film's end.|$|E

500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

2500|$|The University of Chicago {{developed}} the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even {{gave them a}} hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, {{a third of all}} sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago was very good at not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class room than studying the society around them. [...] This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual’s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small {{was the head of the}} sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology. [...] Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program’s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology program’s textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E. Du Bois, Robert Park, Charles S. Johnson, William Ogburn, Hebert Blumer and many others have significant ties to the University of Chicago.|$|E
