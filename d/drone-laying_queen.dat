40|$|Instrumental {{insemination}} {{honey bee}} queen is in Czech Republic only possibility, how make controlled mating bees. Main significance lies in expanding desirable {{feature in the}} bee colony. Instrumental inseminations are thus obtained the required feature, that are the mildness of bees, sitting on the comb, or resistance to disease. Insemination must precede controlled breeding drones and controlled breeding queens. That drones were sexually mature {{at the time of}} insemination must be breeding drones initiated about 40 days before breeding queens. Hatched queens are inseminated 5 th - 7 th day after hatching by sperm of several drones because they are polyandrous. For the insemination of one queen is necessary 8 - 12 mm 3 of sperm. This volume corresponds 10 - 12 drones. Sperm is collected drones about 30 minutes before insemination. Sucks into the inseminated needle, after that injects a sperm into the queen's genital tract of queen. The most difficult task is eliminate of vaginal valve that prevents the injection of sperm. The queen bee is fertilized 1 × for a life. The obtained sperm are stored in the spermatheca of queen. The quantity of sperm in the spermatheca determines the length of stay queen in the bee colony. After emptying the sperm from the spermatheca queen lays unfertilized eggs, from which develops a drones.

40|$|Queen pheromones {{interfere}} with worker reproduction in social insects. However, {{there is still}} an unresolved {{question as to whether}} this pheromone acts as an “honest” signal for workers, giving a reliable indication of the queen’s reproductive value, or as a suppressive agent, inhibiting worker reproduction independent of the queen’s reproductive capacity. In honeybees (Apis mellifera), the queen’s mandibular gland secretion, a mix of fatty acids and some aromatic compounds, is crucial for regulating the reproductive division of labor in the colony inhibiting ovary development in workers. We quantified the mandibular gland secretions of virgin, drone-laying, and naturally mated queens using gas chromatography to test whether the queens’ mating, ovary activation, or the reproductive value for workers correlated with the composition of the secretion. Although the absolute amounts of the “queen substance” 9 -oxo- 2 (E) -decenoic acid (9 -ODA) were similar among the three groups, the proportions of 9 -ODA decreased with increasing reproductive quality. Furthermore, the ratios of queen to worker compounds were similar in all three treatment groups, irrespective of the reproductive capacity. A multivariate analysis including all six compounds could not separate <b>drone-laying</b> <b>queens</b> from naturally mated ones, both with active ovaries but only the latter ensuring colony survival. We suggest that the mandibular gland pheromones are unlikely to function as reliable indicators of queen reproductive value and rather operate as an agent to suppress worker reproduction. This does not exclude the possibility that other “honest” pheromone signals exist in the honeybee colony, but these would have to arise from other semiochemicals, which could be produced by both the queen and the brood...|$|R
