5|$|Males {{and females}} {{of all ages}} can be {{distinguished}} by {{the position of the}} two round genital openings or gonopores. In females, they are at the bases of the third pair of pereiopods, while in males they are {{at the base of the}} fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and the closest to the abdomen. Mature females have a small claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.|$|E
5|$|C. c. perplexus, {{the western}} subspecies, occurs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its {{northern}} limits are Shark Bay and the mulga-eucalypt boundary line. It is less specialised in its habitat, {{as it does}} not share its distribution with the little raven, and {{does not appear to}} correlate with the range of sheep. The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies, with similarities to calls of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise no difference in plumage. Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia.|$|E

5|$|Following record attendances at State of Origin {{fixtures}} in Melbourne of 87,161 in 1994 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground), the Australian Rugby League (ARL) {{had planned}} to establish a Melbourne-based team in the Premiership by 1998. However, the disruption caused by the Super League war caused great change to the game in Australia. By May 1997, Super League boss John Ribot pushed for a Melbourne-based club for his competition, which was the rival of the ARL. Former Brisbane Broncos centre Chris Johns became the CEO of the club and Ribot stepped down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of Super League {{to set up the}} club. In September 1997, Melbourne announced that Chris Anderson would be their foundation coach, and then Super League announced that the new team would be named the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years {{by members of the}} Hopewell culture.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response, the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. Collingwood was the eighteenth ship <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the battle line after the Grand Fleet deployed for battle.|$|E

5|$|Lance Armstrong {{was removed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{of the list}} after having all seven of his Tour {{victories}} stripped when he {{was found guilty of}} repeated doping offences. Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would have joined the list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO have decided not to reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic doping problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a doping violation. Ullrich, therefore, has a single Tour victory to his name.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, {{it would provide}} a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country.

5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma.

Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
