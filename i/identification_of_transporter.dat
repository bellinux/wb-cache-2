The recent movement towards systems biology approaches has increased mechanistic knowledge, revealing a need for understanding how all the genes and mechanisms integrate to create a response to any given biotic interaction. This begins with evidence that diverse molecular patterns converge, suggesting that the plant perceives signals not the interacting species. These signals then coordinate across regulatory networks via molecular interactions and cause non-cell autonomous responses in neighboring and systemic cells.

40|$|The {{concept of}} plasma {{membrane}} transport of thyroid hormones (TH) was first approached in the 1970 s by Go-vind Rao and Heinz Breuer in Germany [1] and Georg Hennemann in the Netherlands [2], followed by Jack Robbins, Jacques Blondeau and several others. The un-specific association of radiolabeled TH with cells always represented an issue, but several laboratories showed sat-urable and stereo-specific uptake indicative <b>of</b> plasma membrane <b>transporter</b> action. Initially only few trans-porters, and none <b>of</b> them TH <b>transporters,</b> were cloned (e. g. LacY, the Escherichia coli lactose permease). It con-stantly remained {{an issue in}} the field whether TH uptake into cells was energy dependent, could be competed with bile acids and amino acids, or had K m values in the nano-mole or micromole range. From the 1990 s, expression cloning <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> led to the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> several <b>transporter</b> gene families and subsequent screening <b>of</b> cloned <b>transporters</b> for TH uptake led to the identi-fication of several additional TH <b>transporters</b> [3]. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> monocarboxylate <b>transporter</b> 8 (MCT 8, SLC 16 A 2) as a specific and very active TH transporter [4] paved the way to the finding that mutations in the MCT 8 gene cause a syndrome of psychomotor retardation in hu-mans [5, 6].

30|$|The {{biological}} function <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> {{has been investigated}} using multiple approaches. Among them, metabolomic studies have been quite valuable for substrate <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> systemically, which identify the alterations of many metabolites or their substrates directly. Alternatively, the uptake of substrate candidates can be evaluated by radio-tracer or radio-free LC/MS quantification. This method was used to identify thiamine and ergothioneine as the physiological substrates of OCT 1 (SLC 22 A 1) and OCTN 1 (SLC 22 A 4) respectively (Chen et al., 2014; Gründemann et al., 2005). Clinically, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have proved a powerful method for identifying disease susceptibility genes. GWASs indicate that genes coding for a variety <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> are susceptibility genes for many diseases (Gottesman and Ambudkar, 2001; Stefková et al., 2004; Grisanzio et al., 2012; Suhre et al., 2011; Diabetes Genetics Initiative et al., 2007), suggesting that transporters have important physiological/pathophysiological roles in disease. The function <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> in drug ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) has been intensively studied {{during the past two}} decades but their physiological roles have been much under studied. There is emerging evidence that understanding the physiological roles <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> in normal as well as pathophysiological conditions is of great value for the development of new drugs and therapies (the International Transporter Consortium et al., 2010; Mizuno et al., 2003). In this review, we summarize recent progress in the study of physiological roles <b>of</b> <b>transporters,</b> including new methodology in transporter biology, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and drug-endogenous substrate interaction.

40|$|Amino acids are the {{building}} blocks of proteins and key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically important molecules, as well as energy sources, neurotransmitters, regulators of cellular metabolism, etc. The efficient recovery of amino acids from the primary filtrate is a well-conserved key role of the kidney proximal tubule. Additionally, renal metabolism participates in the whole body disposition of amino acids. Therefore, a wide array of axially heterogeneously expressed transporters is localized on both epithelial membranes. For transepithelial transport, luminal uptake, which is carried out mainly by active symporters, is coupled with a mostly passive basolateral efflux. Many transporters require partner proteins for appropriate localization, or to modulate transporter activity, and/or increase substrate supply. Interacting proteins include cell surface antigens (CD 98), endoplasmic reticulum proteins (GTRAP 3 - 18 or 41), or enzymes (ACE 2 and aminopeptidase N).

Raltegravir transport by ABCB 1 was studied with CEM, CEMVBL 100, and Caco- 2 cells. Transport by uptake transporters was assessed by using a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and primary renal cells. The kinetics of raltegravir transport and competition between raltegravir and tenofovir were also investigated using SLC 22 A 6 -expressing oocytes. Raltegravir was confirmed to be an ABCB 1 substrate in CEM, CEMVBL 100, and Caco- 2 cells. Raltegravir was also transported by SLC 22 A 6 and SLC 15 A 1 in oocyte expression systems but not by other transporters studied. The Km and Vmax for SLC 22 A 6 transport were 150 μM and 36 pmol/oocyte/h, respectively. Tenofovir and raltegravir competed for SLC 22 A 6 transport in a concentration-dependent manner. Raltegravir inhibited 1 μM tenofovir with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 14. 0 μM, and tenofovir inhibited 1 μM raltegravir with an IC 50 of 27. 3 μM. Raltegravir concentrations were not altered by transporter inhibitors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or primary renal cells. Raltegravir is a substrate for SLC 22 A 6 and SLC 15 A 1 in the oocyte expression system.

It includes a large paralogous expansion of insect-specific genes, with seven genes from the genome of the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. One of the An. gambiae NATs, AgNAT 8, was cloned, functionally expressed and characterized in X. laevis oocytes as a cation-coupled symporter of aromatic amino acids, preferably l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine and l-DOPA. To explore an evolutionary trend of NAT-SLC 6 phenotypes, we have cloned and characterized AgNAT 6, which represents a counterpart of AgNAT 8 descending from a recent gene duplication (53. 1 % pairwise sequence identity). In contrast to AgNAT 8, which preferably mediates the absorption of phenol-branched substrates, AgNAT 6 mediates the absorption of indole-branched substrates with highest apparent affinity to tryptophan (K 0. 5 Trp= 1. 3 μmol l– 1 vs K 0. 5 Phe= 430 μmol l– 1) and [2 or 1 Na+ or K+]:[aromatic substrate] stoichiometry. AgNAT 6 is highly transcribed in absorptive and secretory regions of the alimentary canal and specific neuronal structures, including the neuropile of ventral ganglia and sensory afferents. The alignment of AgNATs and LeuTAa, a bacterial NAT with a resolved 3 D structure, reveals three amino acid differences in the substrate-binding pocket that may be responsible for the indole- vs phenol-branch selectivity of AgNAT 6 vs AgNAT 8. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> with a narrow selectivity for essential amino acids suggests that basal expansions in the SLC 6 family involved duplication and retention of NATs, improving the absorption and distribution of under-represented essential amino acids and related metabolites.

ABC <b>transporters</b> are one <b>of</b> the large groups <b>of</b> <b>transporter</b> proteins found both in plants and in fungi. The crucial role <b>of</b> plant ABC <b>transporters</b> in the formation of the mycorrhizal symbiosis has been demonstrated recently. Some of the fungal ABC transporter-encoding genes are also induced during the mycorrhiza formation. However, no experimental evidences of the direct involvement <b>of</b> fungal ABC <b>transporters</b> in this process are available so far. To facilitate the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> fungal ABC proteins with a potential role in the establishment of the mycorrhizal symbiosis, we have performed an inventory of the ABC protein-encoding genes in the genomes of 25 species of mycorrhiza-forming fungi. Results We have identified, manually annotated and curated more than 1300 gene models of putative ABC protein-encoding genes. Out of those, more than 1000 models are predicted to encode functional proteins, whereas about 300 models represent gene fragments or putative pseudogenes. We have also performed the phylogenetic analysis of the identified sequences. The sets of ABC proteins in the mycorrhiza-forming species were compared to the related saprotrophic or plant-pathogenic fungal species. Our results demonstrate the high diversity of ABC genes in the genomes of mycorrhiza-forming fungi. Via comparison of transcriptomics data from different species, we have identified candidate groups <b>of</b> ABC <b>transporters</b> that might have a role in the process of the mycorrhiza formation. Conclusions Results of our inventory will facilitate the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> fungal <b>transporters</b> with a role in the mycorrhiza formation. We also provide the first data on ABC protein-coding genes for the phylum Glomeromycota and for orders Pezizales, Atheliales, Cantharellales and Sebacinales, contributing to the better knowledge of the diversity of this protein family within the fungal kingdom...|$|R
30|$|Recently, we have {{identified}} a transporter gene involved in phloem Cd transport (Uraguchi et al. 2011). This rice gene, named OsLCT 1, is the homolog of wheat Low-affinity Cation Transporter 1 (Clemens et al. 1998), and encodes a Cd-efflux transporter on the plasma-membrane. OsLCT 1 expression was higher in leaf blades and nodes during reproductive stages. Especially in node I, the uppermost node, OsLCT 1 was mainly expressed in diffuse vascular bundles which connected to panicles. In the Nipponbare background, Cd levels in grains and phloem exudate from leaf blades were substantially reduced in RNAi plants compared to control plants, although Cd concentration in xylem sap did not differ. These results suggest that OsLCT 1 in leaf blades functions in Cd remobilization by phloem, and in node I, OsLCT 1 is likely to {{play a part in}} intervascular Cd transfer from enlarged large vascular bundles to diffuse vascular bundles, which connect to the panicle. This is the first <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> a <b>transporter</b> for phloem Cd transport in plants.|$|R
40|$|Biosilicification is {{widespread}} across the eukaryotes and requires concentration of silicon in intracellular vesicles. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remains limited, with unrelated silicon-transporting proteins {{found in the}} eukaryotic clades previously studied. Here, we report the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> silicon <b>transporter</b> (SIT) -type genes from the siliceous loricate choanoflagellates Stephanoeca diplocostata and Diaphanoeca grandis. Until now, the SIT gene family has been identified only in diatoms and other siliceous stramenopiles, which are distantly related to choanoflagellates among the eukaryotes. This is the first evidence of similarity between SITs from different eukaryotic supergroups. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that choanoflagellate and stramenopile SITs form distinct monophyletic groups. The absence of putative SIT genes in any other eukaryotic groups, including non-siliceous choanoflagellates, leads us to propose that SIT genes underwent a lateral gene transfer event between stramenopiles and loricate choanoflagellates. We suggest that the incorporation of a foreign SIT gene into the stramenopile or choanoflagellate genome resulted in a major metabolic change: the acquisition of biomineralized silica structures. This hypothesis implies that biosilicification has evolved multiple times independently in the eukaryotes, and paves {{the way for a}} better understanding of the biochemical basis of silicon transport through <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> conserved sequence motifs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Membrane {{transport}} proteins (transporters) move hydrophilic substrates across hydrophobic membranes {{and play}} vital roles in most cellular functions. Transporters represent {{a diverse group of}} proteins that differ in topology, energy coupling mechanism, and substrate specificity as well as sequence similarity. Among the functional annotations <b>of</b> <b>transporters,</b> information about their transporting substrates is especially important. The experimental <b>identification</b> and characterization <b>of</b> <b>transporters</b> is currently costly and time-consuming. The development of robust bioinformatics-based methods for the prediction of membrane transport proteins and their substrate specificities is therefore an important and urgent task. Results: Support vector machine (SVM) -based computational models, which comprehensively utilize integrative protein sequence features such as amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, physico-chemical composition, biochemical composition, and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM), were developed to predict the substrate specificity <b>of</b> seven <b>transporter</b> classes: amino acid, anion, cation, electron, protein/mRNA, sugar, and other transporters. An additional model to differentiate transporters from non-transporters was also developed. Among the developed models, the biochemical composition and PSSM hybrid model outperformed other models and achieved an overall average prediction accuracy of 76. 69 % with a Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0. 49 and a receiver operating characteristic area under the curv...|$|R
40|$|The ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) protein superfamily constitutes one of {{the largest}} protein families known in plants. In this report, we performed a complete inventory of ABC protein genes in Vitis vinifera, the whole genome of which has been sequenced. By comparison with ABC protein members of Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified 135 putative ABC proteins with 1 or 2 NBDs in V. vinifera. Of these, 120 encode intrinsic membrane proteins, and 15 encode proteins missing TMDs. V. vinifera ABC proteins can be divided into 13 subfamilies with 79 "full-size," 41 "half-size," and 15 "soluble" putative ABC proteins. The main feature of the Vitis ABC superfamily is the presence of 2 large subfamilies, ABCG (pleiotropic drug resistance and white-brown complex homolog) and ABCC (multidrug resistance-associated protein). We identified orthologs of V. vinifera putative ABC transporters in different species. This work represents the first complete inventory <b>of</b> ABC <b>transporters</b> in V. vinifera. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> Vitis ABC <b>transporters</b> and their comparative analysis with the Arabidopsis counterparts revealed a strong conservation between the 2 species. This inventory could help elucidate the biological and physiological functions <b>of</b> these <b>transporters</b> in V. vinifera...|$|R
40|$|Ocular drug {{delivery}} {{has been a}} major challenge to pharmacologists and {{drug delivery}} scientists due to its unique anatomy and physiology. Static barriers (different layers of cornea, sclera, and retina including blood aqueous and blood–retinal barriers), dynamic barriers (choroidal and conjunctival blood flow, lymphatic clearance, and tear dilution), and efflux pumps in conjunction pose a significant challenge for delivery of a drug alone or in a dosage form, especially to the posterior segment. <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> influx <b>transporters</b> on various ocular tissues and designing a transporter-targeted delivery of a parent drug has gathered momentum in recent years. Parallelly, colloidal dosage forms such as nanoparticles, nanomicelles, liposomes, and microemulsions have been widely explored to overcome various static and dynamic barriers. Novel drug delivery strategies such as bioadhesive gels and fibrin sealant-based approaches were developed to sustain drug levels at the target site. Designing noninvasive sustained drug delivery systems and exploring the feasibility of topical application to deliver drugs to the posterior segment may drastically improve drug delivery in the years to come. Current developments in the field of ophthalmic drug delivery promise a significant improvement in overcoming the challenges posed by various anterior and posterior segment diseases...|$|R
