5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> as in the original Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The game also includes moving platforms and teleporters that Keen can respectively jump on and interact with. In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, or by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given a password that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever a password is entered.|$|E

5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his good form into 2002, where his run-scoring earned him {{an invitation to}} play for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Sri Lankans. He scored 77 in a drawn match, and would later that season make his Test match debut against India. However, following his Test debut, he only passed 50 on one further occasion that year. He would maintain his place in the Test side against Zimbabwe the following year, despite only scoring one innings of note129 against the Cambridge students. However, after being dropped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> Key's form seemed to improve: he scored 140 against Nottinghamshire to set up a Kent victory, and consistently scored around 40runs per innings {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E

5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|The {{galaxy is}} {{inclined}} an estimated 77° {{relative to the}} Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side).</b> Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.|$|E
5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking {{a piece of the}} maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is dark purplish brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 7.5–9.5 by 5.5–6.5 by 4.5–5.5μm, averaging 8.7 by 6.0 by 5.3μm. Its shape in face view is ovate (egg-shaped) to roughly rhomboid, while viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> it appears elliptical. The spore wall is brown, smooth, about 0.8–1μm thick, {{and has a}} germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and somewhat club-shaped, tapering slightly to the base; they are clamped, and measure 25–31 by 7–8.5μm.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> reaction described above. On the other hand, if the capping step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the capping step. The capping mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the capping step.|$|E
