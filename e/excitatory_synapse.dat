25|$|In general, if an <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse</b> {{is strong}} enough, an action {{potential}} in the presynaptic neuron will trigger an action {{potential in the}} postsynaptic cell. In many cases the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} high pass filter for neurons.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the family of {{neuronal}} petraxins, synaptic proteins that are related to C-reactive protein. This protein is involved in <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse</b> formation. It also plays a role in clustering of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors at established synapses, resulting in non-apoptotic cell death of dopaminergic nerve cells.|$|E
50|$|Although the receptors at an <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse</b> {{strive to}} bring the {{membrane}} potential towards their own specific Erev, {{the probability that the}} single stimulation of an <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse</b> will raise the membrane potential past threshold and produce an action potential is not very high. Therefore, in order to achieve threshold and generate an action potential, the postsynaptic neuron has the capacity to add up all of the incoming EPSPs based on the mechanism of summation, which can occur in time and space. Temporal summation occurs when a particular synapse is stimulated at a high frequency, which causes the postsynaptic neuron to sum the incoming EPSPs and thus increases the chance of the neuron firing an action potential. In a similar way, the postsynaptic neuron can sum together EPSPs from multiple synapses with other neurons in a process called spatial summation.|$|E

40|$|SummarySynaptic cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) {{are known to}} play key roles in various aspects of synaptic structures and functions, including early differentiation, maintenance, and plasticity. We herein report the identification {{of a family of}} {{cell adhesion}}-like molecules termed SALM that interacts with the abundant postsynaptic density (PSD) protein PSD- 95. SALM 2, a SALM isoform, distributes to excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic sites. Overexpression of SALM 2 increases the number of <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses</b> and dendritic spines. Mislocalized expression of SALM 2 disrupts <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses</b> and dendritic spines. Bead-induced direct aggregation of SALM 2 results in coclustering of PSD- 95 and other postsynaptic proteins, including GKAP and AMPA receptors. Knockdown of SALM 2 by RNA interference reduces the number of <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses</b> and dendritic spines and the frequency, but not amplitude, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that SALM 2 is an important regulator of the differentiation of <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIndividual GABAergic interneurons in {{hippocampus}} can powerfully inhibit {{more than}} a thousand excitatory pyramidal neurons. Therefore, control of interneuron excitability provides control over hippocampal networks. We have identified a novel mechanism in hippocampus that weakens <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses</b> onto GABAergic interneurons. Following stimulation that elicits long-term potentiation at neighboring <b>synapses</b> onto <b>excitatory</b> cells, <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses</b> onto inhibitory interneurons undergo a long-term synaptic depression (interneuron LTD; iLTD). Unlike most other forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, iLTD is not synapse specific: stimulation of an afferent pathway triggers depression not only of activated synapses but also of inactive <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapses</b> onto the same interneuron. These results suggest that high frequency afferent activity increases hippocampal excitability through a dual mechanism, simultaneously potentiating <b>synapses</b> onto <b>excitatory</b> neurons and depressing synapses onto inhibitory neurons...|$|R
50|$|An <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse</b> is a synapse {{in which}} an action {{potential}} in a presynaptic neuron increases the probability of an action potential occurring in a postsynaptic cell. Neurons form networks through which nerve impulses travel, each neuron often making numerous connections with other cells. These electrical signals may be excitatory or inhibitory, and, if the total of excitatory influences exceeds that of the inhibitory influences, the neuron will generate a new action potential at its axon hillock, thus transmitting the information to yet another cell.|$|E
50|$|Lack of synapsins {{altogether}} in neurons, {{leads to}} behavioral alterations {{as well as}} epileptic-type seizures. The lack affects nervous signal transduction across excitatory and inhibitory synapses of neurons differently and {{is believed to be}} synapse-specific. Initial signal transduction appears to be unaffected by the lack of synapsins, but repeated stimulation of cultured synapsinless hippocampal neurons subsequently showed depressed responses at the <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse.</b> At the inhibitory synapse, base signal transduction is reduced in neurons lacking pre-existing synapsins, but the reduced level of transduction is less affected by progressive stimulation.|$|E

40|$|Although {{pyramidal}} {{cells are}} the main excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex, it has recently been reported that they can evoke inhibitory postsynaptic currents in neighboring pyramidal neurons.

Levels of parvalbumin protein and mRNA were also found to be lower in patient brains in various regions in the brain. Actual numbers of parvalbumin interneurons {{have been found to}} be unchanged in these studies, however, except for a single study showing a decrease in parvalbumin interneurons in the hippocampus. Finally, <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse</b> density is lower selectively on parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia and predicts the activity-dependent down-regulation of parvalbumin and GAD67.

There is, however, a reduced amount of receptors that remain internalized when receptor cycling is modified by application of AMPA-1. The ratio returns to normal when constitutive recycling is allowed to happen, suggesting that the stabilization of intracellular receptors is critical only under AMPA-induced internalization.|$|E

Metabotropic receptors, which are also called G-protein-coupled receptors, act on an ion channel through the intracellular signaling of a molecule called a G protein.

[...] If a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor with a reversal potential that is higher than the threshold potential for the postsynaptic neuron, the postsynaptic cell {{will be more likely to}} generate an action potential and an excitatory postsynaptic potential will occur (EPSP).

40|$|The {{neurotoxic}} effect of amyloid- peptide (Aβ) over the central synapses {{has been described}} and {{is reflected in the}} decrease of some postsynaptic excitatory proteins, the alteration in the number and morphology of the dendritic spines and a decrease in long- term potentiation (LTP). Many studies has been carried out to identify the putative Aβ receptors in neurons, however is still no clear why the Aβ oligomers affect only the <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse.</b> Aβ oligomers bind to neurite and preferentially to the postsynaptic region, where the postsynaptic protein- 95 (PSD- 95) is present in the glutamatergic synapse. This protein through its PDZ domain interacts directly with the NMDA receptor and the adhesion protein neuroligin (NL). Neuroligin is a postsynaptic protein which binds to the presynaptic protein, neurexin (NRX) to form a heterophilic adhesion complex, involved in the establishment of pre- and postsynaptic regions. Therefore, the disruption of this interaction affects the integrity of the synaptic contact. NL- 1, 3 and 4 are enriched to the <b>excitatory</b> <b>synapse,</b> while the NL- 2 is found mainly in the inhibitory synapse. Structurally, NL has an extracellular domain homolog to acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the first synaptic protein that was found to interact with Aβ.
