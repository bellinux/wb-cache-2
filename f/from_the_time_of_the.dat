The trapping of rabbits and auctioning of their skins in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area's economy during this time.|$|E

30|$|We {{considered}} {{randomized controlled}} trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, and case–control studies that directly compared late (> 6  h <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> injury) with early (< 6  h <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> injury) surgical debridement of pediatric open fractures and reported {{the rate of}} infection. An open fracture {{was defined as a}} fracture with bone exposed to the environment and communicating with the skin. The delay in surgical debridement was classified into late surgical debridement (> 6  h <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> injury) or early surgical debridement (< 6  h <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> injury).|$|R

5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. These works attempted to list major world events <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biblical Genesis until their present {{time in a}} universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography. There are also chronological and genealogical lists of rulers and Orthodox Church patriarchs that include some elements of historical narrative.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.

5|$|Continuing southwards, {{the river}} passes the gallops which {{are part of}} Coombelands Racing Stables, {{situated}} on the eastern bank, and Park Mount, a motte and bailey dating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norman conquest. It {{is one of the}} best-preserved monuments of this type in south east England. The river is crossed by Stopham Bridge, a fine medieval stone bridge built in 1422-23. The centre arch was raised as part of the improvements made to the navigation in 1822. It is a Grade I listed structure, and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was damaged by army lorries in the Second World War, but has been repaired, and the heavy traffic on the A283 road was diverted onto a new bridge just upstream of it in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Umayyad {{conquest of}} Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon. Early marriages, {{such as that of}} Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa and Egilona {{at the turn of the}} 8th century, was thought to help establish the legitimacy of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. Later instances of intermarriage were often made to seal trade treaties between Christian kings and Muslim caliphs.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a barbed wire and electric fence across {{the length of the}} border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Further RAN {{involvement}} included HMAS Yarra and HMAS Torrens {{who were}} both {{also involved in}} the Black Sea area, being the first two destroyers on station at Novorossiisk and Batum. HMAS Parramatta carried despatches and mail between Constantinople and Sebastopol <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Turkish surrender until early January 1919. Parramatta also escorted a group of Russian warships, which were {{handed over to the}} anti-Bolshevik forces at Sebastopol in late November 1918. All these operations appear to have been free of incident.|$|E
5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred a heavier, more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E
5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as possible. He studied authentic costumes and armaments <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uprising, visited Takovo and sketched {{the church and}} large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris {{over the course of}} several months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace. The exhibition coincided with the uprising's 80th anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Tang Dynasty {{when it was}} described in pharmacopoeia.

Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E

5|$|Sources <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates {{considered by}} the cardinals, but {{the only ones that}} were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici.

Baronius was the favourite candidate. His odds of being elected were 10:100 according to Roman bookmakers, who took bets on the election despite prohibition of the practice by Gregory XIV. Baronius received 23 votes during the first scrutiny, which was considered good because many electors who supported him had cast their first ballots for friends. Baronius was the candidate favoured by France, and had the backing of the French cardinals. He was also the first choice candidate of Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, who sought to elect a cardinal who was created by his uncle such as Baronius.|$|E
