5|$|The {{reputation}} of Seric iron of South India (wootz steel) amongst {{the rest of}} the world grew considerably. Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant Avāram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel</b> alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

25|$|These {{processes}} are {{most commonly used}} on low-carbon, low-alloy steels, however they are also used on medium and <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> Common applications include spindles, cams, gears, dies, hydraulic piston rods, and powdered metal components.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{structural}} transformations of high-carbon austenite is investigated. The effects of thermal {{conditions on the}} ductile iron structure transformation are evaluated by metallographic analyses, TEM, X-ray and mechanical testing.

5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of high carbon steel in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E

25|$|High-speed steel (HSS) {{is a form}} of tool steel; HSS bits {{are hard}} and much more {{resistant}} to heat than <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> They can be used to drill metal, hardwood, and most other materials at greater cutting speeds than carbon-steel bits, and have largely replaced carbon steels.|$|E
40|$|The classic {{problem of}} hydrogen-assisted {{cracking}} (HAC) is revisited {{in the present}} work aiming at clarification of damage mechanisms leading to failure of hydrogen charged <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> under load.

AE features corresponding to these major mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Stainless steel: An alloy of iron, {{approximately}} 10-15% of chromium, nickel, or molybdenum, {{with only}} a small amount of carbon. Lower grades of stainless steel cannot take as sharp an edge as good-quality <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> but are resistant to corrosion, and are inexpensive. Higher grade and 'exotic' stainless steels (mostly from Japan) are extremely sharp with excellent edge retention, and equal or outperform carbon steel blades.|$|R
5000|$|Nitriding is a heat {{treating}} process that diffuses nitrogen into {{the surface of}} a metal to create a case-hardened surface. These processes are most commonly used on low-carbon, low-alloy steels. They are also used on medium and <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> titanium, aluminium and molybdenum. In 2015, nitriding was used to generate unique duplex microstructure (Martensite-Austenite, Austenite-ferrite), known to be associated with strongly enhanced mechanical properties ...|$|R
25|$|Bits {{made from}} <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel</b> are more durable than {{low-carbon}} steel bits {{due to the}} properties conferred by hardening and tempering the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by frictional heating while drilling) they lose their temper, resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits {{can be used on}} wood or metal.|$|E
25|$|Hooks for {{saltwater}} flies {{must also}} be extremely durable and corrosion resistant. Most saltwater hooks are made of stainless steel, but the strongest (though less corrosion resistant) hooks are of <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> Typically, these hooks vary from size #8 to #2 for bonefish and smaller nearshore species, to size #3/0 to #5/0 for the larger offshore species.|$|E
25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many ductile metals, {{especially}} {{materials with}} high purity, can sustain very large deformation of 50-100% or more strain before fracture under favorable loading condition and environmental condition. The strain {{at which the}} fracture happens {{is controlled by the}} purity of the materials. At room temperature, pure iron can undergo deformation up to 100% strain before breaking, while cast iron or <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> can barely sustain 3% of strain.|$|R
50|$|Acid {{cleaning}} has {{limitations in}} {{that it is difficult to}} handle because of its corrosiveness, and it is not applicable to all steels. Hydrogen embrittlement becomes a problem for some alloys and <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> The hydrogen from the acid reacts with the surface and makes it brittle and causes cracks. Because of its high reactance to treatable steels, acid concentrations and solution temperatures must be kept under control to assure desired pickling rates.|$|R
50|$|Some metals {{are easier}} to solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy. Iron, mild steel and nickel are next in difficulty. Because of their thin, strong oxide films, {{stainless}} steel and some aluminium alloys are {{even more difficult to}} solder. Titanium, magnesium, cast irons, some <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels,</b> ceramics, and graphite can be soldered but it involves a process similar to joining carbides: they are first plated with a suitable metallic element that induces interfacial bonding.|$|R
25|$|Contemporary hooks are {{manufactured}} from either <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> steel alloyed with Vanadium, or stainless steel, depending on application. Most quality fish hooks {{are covered with}} some form of corrosion-resistant surface coating. Corrosion resistance is required not only when hooks are used, especially in saltwater, but while they are stored. Additionally, coatings are applied to color and/or provide aesthetic value to the hook. At a minimum, hooks designed for freshwater use are coated with a clear lacquer, but hooks are also coated with gold, nickel, Teflon, tin and different colors.|$|E

25|$|Oxy-acetylene can cut only low- to medium-carbon steels and wrought iron. <b>High-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> are {{difficult}} to cut because the melting point of the slag {{is closer to the}} melting point of the parent metal, so that the slag from the cutting action does not eject as sparks but rather mixes with the clean melt near the cut.

30|$|The {{influence}} of the surface mechanical-pulse treatment based on high-speed friction with a rapid cooling by the technological environment on the wear resistance of medium- and <b>high-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> was considered. The treatment due to a severe plastic deformation enabled obtaining the nanocrystalline structure with a grain size of 14 – 40  nm. A high positive effect of this treatment was obtained {{not only because of}} metal nanocrystallization but also thanks to other factors, namely, structural-phase transformations, carbon saturation of the surface due to decomposition of the coolant and the friction coefficient decrease. Higher carbon content leads to better strengthening of the surface, and its microhardness can reach 12  GPa.|$|R

50|$|Forge welding {{grew from}} a {{trial-and-error}} method, becoming more refined over the centuries.

This method of pattern welding first appeared around 700 BC, and was primarily used for making weapons such as swords, with the most widely known examples being from Damascus, Japanese, and Merovingian swords. This process was also common {{in the manufacture of}} tools, from wrought-iron plows with steel edges to iron chisels with steel cutting surfaces.|$|R
