5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} path {{by which}} A.sesquipedale could have evolved that differed with Darwin and Wallace's explanation was proposed by Lutz Thilo Wasserthal in 1997. According to Wasserthal, hawk moths could have evolved long proboscises as a predatory avoidance strategy from heteropodid spiders. Since such spiders {{have been known}} to jump at hovering moths in an attempt at eating them, hawk moths would be at risk when visiting flowers if such a spider was nearby. Based on this reasoning moths with longer tongues would be less at risk when pollinating flowers since they would be farther away and thus a more challenging target for jumping spiders. [...] As a result, nature would select for hawk moths with longer and longer probosces. The flowers of A.sesquipedale on the other hand would be evolving longer spurs since flowers with longer spurs are more likely to become fertilized by long tongued moths. In other words, the flowers evolve long spurs to fit the pollinators and not the reverse. It has also been observed that the moths will swing side to side when feeding, presumably to evade jumping spiders. Possible problems with this hypothesis is that active predation by spiders on hawk moths visiting flowers has not been observed. It has also been suggested that flying predators such as bats and birds are the more likely predators to hawk moths. Whether or not the pollinator shift model or the coevolution model, or <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of both are correct is currently the subject of debate.|$|E

50|$|The exact {{cause of}} her death remains a subject of debate. Some claim that her refusal to eat came from her desire to express some form of {{solidarity}} toward {{the victims of the}} war. Others think that Weil's self-starvation occurred after her study of Schopenhauer. (In his chapters on Christian saintly asceticism and salvation, Schopenhauer had described self-starvation as a preferred method of self-denial). However, Simone Pétrement, one of Weil's first and most significant biographers, regards the coroner's report as simply mistaken. Basing her opinion on letters written by the personnel of the sanatorium at which Simone Weil was treated, Pétrement affirms that Weil asked for food on different occasions while she was hospitalized and <b>even</b> ate <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>a</b> few days before her death; according to her, it is in fact Weil's poor health condition that eventually made her unable to eat.|$|R

40|$|Environment and Development Agency Trust From plough {{to policy}} Some {{organisation}}s seem to evolve {{in line with}} time, some of them <b>even</b> running <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> ahead of the wind. The South African organisation EDA is one such. Now known as the Environmental and Development Agency Trust, EDA started life in the 1970 s as a practitioner of such so-called appropriate technologies as hand-held agricultural equipment, methane gas digesters and wind turbines. Today, it keeps its feet firmly on the ground, but draws on its experience and reputation to make solid policy recommendations to government. Among its programme activities are Community Based Land Management (CBLM), and Land use planning and Catchment Management. The first, with a pilot focus, seeks to blend local/ traditional knowledge with new or refined, proven technologies and approaches to managing natural resources, and increasing agricultural production and rural incomes before replication. Another project area is Field Crop Production comprising irrigation management; crop development in grain and fodder production; orchard development; agro-processing; and institutional development. In the area of livestock production and marketing, {{the focus is on}} sheep, cattle, goats, pigs and poultry. Having made its name with the People s Workbook of practical technologies, first published more than 20 years ago, and now with its offspring the People s Farming Workbook (available from CTA, number 622, 20 credit points), the EDA has expanded its publications to include audio-visual materials, the quarterly New Ground, and the Land & Rural Digest, a co-publication with two partners. EDA has also produced a range of policy papers, aimed straight at government. Recent topics include the challenge of transforming agricultural extension; support to small-scale farmers; natural resource conservation, and land management and tenure reform, in communal areas; the issues of tribal authorities and traditional leaders and land management; and women and land. EDA was born as a networking organisation, and having survived some very difficult days during the twilight years of the apartheid era, it understands the value of cooperation and exchange. Here lies its strength for other Spore readers: its willingness to share the story of its evolution with others.
