40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{functional}} prognosis of accessory nerve injury after nerve repair and non-surgical treatment, 27 of our cases with accessory nerve injury were studied. 20 cases were followed up for more than 8 months. In ten cases treated conservatively, the dull feeling and <b>hypaesthesia</b> did not improve. However, pain and dysfunction of the shoulder improved in half of these cases. In ten cases treated surgically, nerve suture was performed in two cases, nerve graft in five cases and neurolysis in three cases. In the surgically treated group, subjective complaints disappeared in all cases, but <b>hypaesthesia</b> or contracture of the shoulder persisted in three cases. Surgical treatment of the accessory nerve is recommended in fresh cases with complete paralysis and in cases {{in which there is}} no sign of nerve recovery within one year after the original injury. Journal of Hand Surgery (British Volume, 1991) 16 B: 531 - 536 The accessory nerve follows a superficial course in the posterior cervical triangle.

30|$|It {{was asked}} for normal oral diet as countercheck which {{reflects}} {{the satisfaction of}} patients not wishing for CRS. Scarring of the face and neck is the main trigger (F =  33, 779; p <  0.001) of wishes for further CRS. Therefrom, impairments of the facial muscles lead to dropped mouth corners, and hence, dripping of saliva or drinks is the most important. If facial muscles are unaffected (F =  48, 026 in control group), the wish for CRS is much more seldom. <b>Hypaesthesia</b> of the lower lip is also meaningful emphasized by the control group with significantly lower numbers of wish for CRS (p <  0.001).

40|$|Background. Severe {{cases of}} cubital tunnel {{syndrome}} {{do not always}} result in functional recovery after surgical decompression of the ulnar nerve. A combined operation of tendon transfer to restore index finger abduction and decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed for patients with severe cubital tunnel syndrome who required powerful pinch strength and whose preoperative compound muscle action potential of the abductor digiti minimi muscle was not recordable or almost non-recordable. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the efficacy of tendon transfer to restore index finger abduction for severe cubital tunnel syndrome. Methods. Sixteen hands in 15 patients with severe cubital tunnel syndrome were operated on with extensor pollicis brevis tendon transfer to the first dorsal interosseous muscle to restore index finger abduction and ulnar nerve decompression. They were reviewed after a mean follow-up of 16 months. All 16 hands had preoperatively severe lesions with paralysis of ulnar intrinsics, marked anaesthesia, or <b>hypaesthesia.</b> Results. Postoperative results were excellent in 2 hands, good in 10, fair in 4, and no cases with poor results according to Akahori’s criteria. Four hands with fair results had a residual Froment sign or annoying <b>hypaesthesia</b> in the ring and little fingers. All patients were relieved of preoperative discomfort and showed recovery of motor and sensory function. The mean pre- and postoperative pinch strength was 3. 3 kg and 5. 6 kg, respectively, which showed a significant difference (PB 0. 01). Mean time of showing a negative Froment sign after surgery was 5 months in 13 cases. Conclusions. The extensor pollicis brevis tendon transfer is simple and useful to restore index finger abduction and pinch strength for severe cubital tunnel syndrome.

40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential {{channels are}} important mediators of thermal and mechanical stimuli and {{play an important}} role in neuropathic pain. The contribution of hereditary variants in the genes of transient receptor potential channels to neuropathic pain is unknown. We investigated the frequency of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, transient receptor potential melastin 8 and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and their impact on somatosensory abnormalities in neuropathic pain patients. Within the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (Deutscher Forscbungsverbund Neuropathischer Schmerz) 371 neuropathic pain patients were phenotypically characterized using standardized quantitative sensory testing. Pyrosequencing was employed to determine a total of eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms in transient receptor potential channel genes of the neuropathic pain patients and a cohort of 253 German healthy volunteers. Associations of quantitative sensory testing parameters and single nucleotide polymorphisms between and within groups and subgroups, based on sensory phenotypes, were analyzed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms frequencies did not differ between both the cohorts. However, in neuropathic pain patients transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 710 G>A (rs 920829, E 179 K) was associated with the presence of paradoxical heat sensation (p =  0. 03), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 1911 A>G (rs 8065080, I 585 V) with cold hypoalgesia (p =  0. 0035). Two main subgroups characterized by preserved (1) and impaired (2) sensory function were identified. In subgroup 1 transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 1911 A>G led to significantly less heat hyperalgesia, pinprick hyperalgesia and mechanical <b>hypaesthesia</b> (p =  0. 006, p =  0. 005 and p G (rs 222747, M 315 I) to cold <b>hypaesthesia</b> (p =  0. 002), but there was absence of associations in subgroup 2. In this study we found no evidence that genetic variants of transient receptor potential channels are involved in the expression of neuropathic pain, but transient receptor potential channel polymorphisms contributed significantly to the somatosensory abnormalities of neuropathic pain patients. ...|$|E
30|$|Among psychosocial variables, {{the age of}} {{patients}} {{is important for the}} wish for CRS. Younger ones more often longed for CRS [56], and additionally, the chance of survival is higher as Goldenberg et al. confirmed in 2009 [57]. After pension, the need for CRS is decreasing, unless it is a premature pension due to the diagnosis of cancer. In this last named case, there was a very strong wish for CRS. Furthermore, patients without partner more often wished for CRS. Some literature describes the coherence of wish for CRS and impairments as, for example, nutrition. Liquid diet increases the wish for further CRS [58, 59]. Equally, pain and <b>hypaesthesia</b> are important for the wish for CRS. Both strongly influence the description of the emotional and functional situation by the patient, yet {{we were not able to}} prove a relation to the wish for CRS.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a female patient who {{underwent}} an arthroscopy of the right knee and was given a continuous femoral nerve block catheter.

Colour duplex sonography of the femoral artery and computed tomography of the lumbar spine and pelvis yielded no pathological findings.

40|$|Ten {{recruited}} soldiers developed acute {{left wrist}} drop and numbness {{on the back}} of the thumb after a three hour military shooting training. Neurological examination disclosed decreased muscle power (0 - 2 / 5) of left wrist dorsiflexion, hypalgesia and <b>hypaesthesia</b> on the radial side of the left hand, and diminished brachioradialis reflex. Electrophysiological studies showed prolonged distal latency, reduced amplitude and slowness of left radial nerve motor conduction velocity between the axilla and elbow. Electromyography (EMG) revealed fibrillation potentials at rest, polyphasic motor unit and an incomplete interference pattern at volition over the extensor digitorum communis and brachioradialis. Nine patients recovered completely clinically and electrophysiologically between nine and 12 weeks after the onset of the palsy. Sensation recovered faster than the weakness. One patient failed to recover after three months, possibly because of the longer duration of nerve compression. Longer nerve compression time and sustained, decreased muscle power with signs of active denervation in EMG are indicators of poor prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most {{pain and}} {{disability}} variance {{in patients with}} low back pain still remains unexplained. The {{aim of this study}} was to enhance the degree of explained variance by including measures of pain and tactile sensitivity as well as pain-related endurance and fear-avoidance responses. Thirty-six post lumbar disc surgery patients completed psychomet-ric questionnaires (Avoidance-Endurance Questionnaire, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inven-tory) and underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST) with measures of pain (pressure (PPT) and mechanical pain threshold) and tactile sensitivity (MDT). Bivariate correlations and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were com-puted. In addition to the contribution of fear-avoidance responses, pressure pain sensitivity and endurance behavior sig-nificantly contributed to explanations of pain variance, whereas disability was primarily predicted by fear-avoidance. While all psychological variables and MDT were positively related to pain or disability, PPT was negatively related to pain. The regression model accounted for 69 % of the variance in back pain intensity and 68 % of the variance in disabil-ity. Tactile <b>hypaesthesia</b> was related to increased clinical pain. Pain-related endurance responses and pressure pain hyper-algesia were significant additional predictors for pain, but not for disability. These findings are compatible with general...|$|E
40|$|In {{a patient}} with a {{unilateral}} embolic infarct in the left posterior thalamo-subthalamic paramedian artery territory, neuropathological studies showed involvement of the intralaminar, dorsomedial, and internal part of the ventral posterior nuclei of the thalamus, of the rostral part of the mesencephalic reticular formation, and of the posterior commissure. The patient showed upgaze palsy for voluntary saccades, smooth pursuit and vestibulo-ocular movements, sustained downgaze, right-sided motor hemineglect and facio-brachial <b>hypaesthesia,</b> motor transcortical aphasia and anterograde amnesia. This case confirms that unilateral destruction of the posterior commissure, rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF and interstitial nucleus of Cajal produces a non-dissociated upgaze palsy. Involvement of the nucleus of Cajal probably produced the sustained downward deviation of the eye, by causing predominance of downward vestibulo-ocular inputs. This case also shows that thalamic aphasia and anterograde amnesia {{may be related to}} a paramedian lesion of the thalamus, with special reference to involvement of the dorsomedial nucleus, in the absence of lesion of the pulvinar and mamillo-thalamic tract and of conspicuous involvement of the ventral lateral nucleus. Selective hemineglect for motor tasks may occur in infarction of the dominant thalamus, involving the intralaminar nuclei...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prevalence of {{cobalamin}} deficiency is high {{especially in}} older patients and an immediate therapy start {{is necessary to}} prevent irreversible neurological damages. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency is difficult and at present, {{there is no consensus}} for diagnosis of this deficiency. Therefore, we aim to elucidate a meaningful diagnostic pathway by a case report with an initially misleading medical history. Case presentation A 570 year-old Caucasian man suffering from dramatic myelosis of the cervical posterior columns. Apart from associated neurological symptoms (tactile <b>hypaesthesia,</b> reduced vibration sensation, loss of stereognosis and of two-point-discrimination) there were no further complaints; especially no gastrointestinal, haematological or psychiatric disorders were provable. Cobalamin (vitamin B 12) serum level was normal. The diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord was confirmed by an elevated methylmalonic acid, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Cobalamin deficiency was caused by asymptomatic chronic atrophic inflammation of the stomach with a lack of intrinsic factor producing gland cells. This was revealed by increased gastrin and parietal cell antibodies and finally confirmed by gastroscopy. Parenteral substitution of cobalamin rapidly initiated regeneration. Conclusions This case demonstrates that normal cobalamin serum levels do not rule out a cobalamin deficiency. In contrast, path-breaking results can be achieved by determining homocysteine, holotranscobalamin, and methylmalonic acid...|$|E

40|$|Intradural spinal {{arachnoid}} cysts with cord compression are rare. When becoming symptomatic {{they cause}} variable symptoms involving gait disturbance, paraparesis or tetraparesis and neuropathic pain, decreasing significantly the patients’ life quality. The extension of such cysts averages 3. 7 vertebral bodies. The diagnosis is clinical and radiological {{with the use}} of MRI, CT myelography or a combination of both. The best treatment option is complete removal of the cyst. However, even when paresis is regressing there is no good recovery from neuropathic pain. Laminectomy approach can cause postoperative complications especially when the cyst(s) expand(s) in more than one level. Alternatively, a cyst fenestration can be performed, including the levels of the maximal spinal cord compression. The clinical outcome is as good as after the cyst resection enabling the patient to walk again. The neuropathic pain may persist and require medication. A clinical case is presented, and the literature is reviewed. In the present case we report a patient with intradural arachnoid cysts extending from T 6 to L 2 and causing severe gait ataxia as well as neuropathic pain and <b>hypaesthesia.</b> The spinal-cord was compressed at T 8 and T 12.

The {{objective of this}} study was to describe the technique for screws in S 1 and S 2 using conventional C-arm and to evaluate perioperative complications. METHODS: Thirty-eight consecutive patients after percutaneous pelvic ring fixation with cannulated screws in S 1 and S 2 using conventional C-arm fluoroscopy were analysed. Accuracy of screw placement, nerval lesions, need for second surgery, operation time, and time to full weight bearing were assessed postoperatively and during regular follow-up examinations. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent unilateral screw fixation and 17 patients underwent bilateral screw fixation. In total, 83 screws were placed. Mean age of the patients was 52  ±  19  years. Mean operation time was 16  ±  7  min/screw. Mean follow-up was 5  ±  3  months. Time to full weight bearing in 28 patients was 9  ±  4  weeks. Eight patients were still not able to support full weight bearing, partially due to concomitant injuries. Patients without concomitant injuries that affected walking were able to bear full weight after 8  ±  4  weeks (n =  17). Two patients had persistent postoperative <b>hypaesthesia.</b> No motor weakness was apparent and no postoperative bleeding was observed. Secondary surgery due to screw malpositioning or loosening had to be performed in four patients. The presence of a screw in S 2 was not indicated for perioperative complications.

The amount of 68 000 dalton neurofilament protein was two times higher in giant axonal neuropathy nerve than in the control nerve.

40|$|Introduction: Hip {{arthroscopy}} is a comparably young {{but meanwhile}} established procedure for minimal invasive treatment of intra- and extrarticular pathologies. There are many possible complications in {{any type of}} surgery. A reduced rate of complications is the greatest advantage of minimal invasive surgery. In hip arthroscopies {{there is a risk}} in the appearance of perineal nerve palsy and soft tissue lesions due to patient positioning. To reach central compartment of the hip, it is necessary to distract the joint by using a perineal post and traction. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the perineal pressure during hip arthroscopy in relationship to soft tissue lesion or nerve palsy. Methods: The study included 102 hip arthroscopies on 101 patients. A matched gelplate such is used in pedobarographic measurement (which was fixed on the pernieal post) in combination with a special software was used to get a real time pressure measurement. Afterwards the results were analysed statistically and the relationship between pressure and parameters as sex, age, BMI, LCE-angle and traction time were studied. Additionally a survey was done to dedicate the occurance of perineal complications. Results: There were two cases of soft tissue lesions respectively perineal nerve palsy in this study. One female patient reported a temporary <b>hypaesthesia</b> at the labia majora on the side of surgery. One male patient stated an erectile dysfunction lasting about two weeks. To make a statistically significant statement, the number of complications that occured was too low. Correlations were found between the perineal pressure and the age well as the BMI. Furthermore an area of high pressure was found in all patients, so called spot. Conclusion: In this study perineal pressure was measured during 102 hip arthroscopies. The number of complications was not high enough to specificate a normal range of pressure or pressure limits to prevent perineal sensations. However, correlations between age, BMI, and perineal pressure as well as between pressure in relationship to gender, LCE-angle and traction time were found...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: A {{modified}} {{surgical technique}} is described {{to perform a}} one, two, or three wall orbital decompression in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. METHODS: The lateral wall was approached ab interno through a "swinging eyelid" approach (lateral canthotomy and lower fornix incision) and an extended periosteum incision along the inferior and lateral orbital margin. In addition, the orbital floor and medial wall were removed when indicated. To minimise the incidence of iatrogenic diplopia, the lateral and medial walls were used as the first surfaces of decompression, leaving the "medial orbital strut" intact. During 1998, this technique was used in a consecutive series of 19 patients (35 orbits) with compressive optic neuropathy (six patients), severe exposure keratopathy (one patient), or disfiguring/congestive Graves' ophthalmopathy (12 patients). RESULTS: The preoperative Hertel value (35 eyes) was on average 25 mm (range 19 - 31 mm). The mean proptosis reduction at 2 months after surgery was 5. 5 mm (range 3 - 7 mm). Of the total group of 19 patients, iatrogenic diplopia occurred in two (12. 5 %) of 16 patients who had no preoperative diplopia or only when tired. The three other patients with continuous preoperative diplopia showed no improvement of double vision after orbital decompression, even when the ocular motility (ductions) had improved. In the total group, {{there was no significant}} change of ductions in any direction at 2 months after surgery. All six patients with recent onset compressive optic neuropathy showed improvement of visual acuity after surgery. No visual deterioration related to surgery was observed in this study. A high satisfaction score (mean 8. 2 on a scale of 1 to 10) was noted following the operation. CONCLUSION: This versatile procedure is safe and efficacious, patient and cost friendly. Advantages are the low incidence of induced diplopia and periorbital <b>hypaesthesia,</b> the hidden and small incision, the minimal surgical trauma to the temporalis muscle, and fast patient recovery. The main disadvantage is the limited exposure of the posterior medial and lateral wall...|$|E
