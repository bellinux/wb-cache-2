So <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{production}} from Sayers, the Bears {{as a whole}} struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers' main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East's attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season's game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the [...] "back of the game", an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. [...] "The Pro Bowl {{is the time to}} prove how good you are, playing against the best of your peers," [...] recalled Sayers. [...] "I took it as a challenge. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the game in shape, came to play." ...|$|E

[...] Black Zag X from 1969, {{in the collection of}} the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's all-black assemblages incorporating the plastic, Formica. [...] In the fall of 1969, she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture. After completion of her first outdoor sculptures, Nevelson stated: [...] "Remember, I was in my early seventies when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> monumental outdoor sculpture... I had been through the enclosures of wood. I had been through the shadows. I had been through the enclosures and come out into the open." [...] Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor-ten steel, which she described as a [...] "blessing". She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size. These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry. Nevelson's public art commissions were a monetary success, but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport states that these pieces were not Nevelson's strongest works, and that Nevelson's [...] "intuitive gesture" [...] is not evident in the large steel works.|$|E
500|$|Wade {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} magazine articles and publications. In 2005, he was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People, and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ Magazine. In 2007, Esquire named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year. Wade has endorsement deals with companies such as Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials feature him paired with NBA legend Charles Barkley), and Topps. He had his own line of shoes with Converse named [...] "The Wade" [...] and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile. During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand. Wade noted that the partnership ended on good terms, stating, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the NBA, I didn't have a lot of exposure and Converse gave me an opportunity to head a brand and be the face of a brand. I'm really thankful for six long, good years. I've gotten five shoes out of the deal and my dream came true at the Converse brand because they put my name on a pair of sneakers." [...] Wade was hand-chosen by Michael Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA Playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining fellow players Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, who have their own signature shoes for the brand. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.|$|E

[...] "And {{there was no way}} that I could ever change the way that we started last season where <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time.

2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you."

2500|$|To {{signify the}} character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was {{required}} to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, [...] "It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it." [...] After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained {{the reason for the}} change in 2004: [...] "The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. It's not something that's going to fit in {{for a long period of}} time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life." ...|$|E

[...] Actor Irrfan Khan stated in an interview, [...] "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality." [...] The trend of wearing guru kurtas and belts on shirts became famous in the seventies and eighties because of Khanna. Javed Akhthar, in an interview, told about his experience with Khanna's stardom: [...] "Bangalore used to have a state lottery and the government asked him to draw the lucky number.
