She states of this: [...] "Shakespeare <b>keeps</b> <b>coming</b> my way. I love the fact that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I'll ever be". Ayola has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola. She explains: [...] "The role of Viola didn't sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense." [...] She has also appeared in modern performances, assuming the title role of Dido, Queen of Carthage at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003, which she described as [...] "a dream of a part". She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure, as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1992, when {{living in}} Los Angeles, Kelly {{recorded}} ten tracks {{for his next}} album, Wanted Man, at three studios: Stagg St, Clearlake and O'Henry. Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and had a book collection of lyrics published, aptly titled Lyrics. In Melbourne he recorded three more tracks at the Metropolis Studio. The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of [...] Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake's 1991 self-titled album). Jacobs and Kelly co-wrote [...] "Ball and Chain". The first track, [...] "Summer Rain", deals with a man's yearning for his girlfriend, Kelly thought the sentiment would translate well but found a curious Belgian interviewer asked, [...] "But why would anybody long for rain in summer? ... We get enough rain in winter. We don't want the summer rain. We want the sunshine". The lead single, [...] "Songs from the Sixteenth Floor" [...] was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard. The next single, [...] "Love Never Runs on Time" [...] was written by Kelly. The lyrics describe a truck driver struggling to meet his commitments to work and family. [...] Kelly uses the same protagonist from [...] "To Her Door" [...] on 1987's Under the Sun and then again in 1996's [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] from the extended play How to Make Gravy. In the first song, the man moves from being newly married to having children and problems with a drug addiction and undergoing rehab to returning to the family home. By the time of [...] "How to Make Gravy", the man is in prison for assault and is writing {{a letter to his}} brother for Christmas. In 2002 Debbie Kruger of Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) interviewed Kelly and found, [...] "Kelly’s attraction to the theatrical, however unconscious, has meant occasionally a song’s character will pop up again, sometimes unintentionally". Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, [...] "'I’ve got a feeling it’s the same guy. He <b>keeps</b> <b>coming</b> back'. Maybe he’ll be in a happier place next time? 'Yeah, he’s a bit of a fuck-up, that guy', Kelly laughs".|$|E
2500|$|The American scholar Alistair Duckworth {{noted that}} a {{recurring}} theme in Austen’s novels is {{the condition of the}} estates mirror those of their owners, with the fine condition of Pemberley being a testament to Mr. Darcy’s good character for example. In this regard, Duckworth noted the subject of improving the landscape <b>keeps</b> <b>coming</b> up in Mansfield Park with the landscape improver Humphry Repton being mocked for his theories, and Henry Crawford being a keen enthusiast for improving the landscape. Duckworth argued Austen took the motif of landscaping {{as a symbol of the}} human condition from Edmund Burke’s 1790 book The Reflections of the Revolution in France, where the condition of the estate is often a metaphor for society. Burke made a distinction between beneficial [...] "improvements" [...] to society, writing [...] "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation", and malign [...] "innovations" [...] and [...] "alterations" [...] to society, which were to be abhorred as they meant the destruction of all that had come before. Austen believed that estates, like society were in need of improvements from time to time, but the sort of changes advocated by Repton were [...] "innovations" [...] and [...] "alterations" [...] that would destroy the [...] "whole original fabric" [...] of the estate as she has Price say, just as the French Revolution was in Austen’s view an entirely destructive force that sought to wipe out all that had come before. Austen's sister-in-law was Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband, the Comte de Feullide, had been guillotined in Paris and who fled to Britain, where she married Henry Austen in 1797. The account of the execution of the Comte de Feullide as related by her sister-in-law left Austen with an intense dread and horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life. The run-down condition of Sotherton Court exposes the danger of atrophy as Rushworth had neglected his estate, leading Price to complain [...] "There is nothing awful here, nothing melancholy, nothing grand" [...] as there should be. Later, when Henry Crawford suggests destroying the grounds of Thornton Lacy to create something new, his plans are rejected by Edmund Bertram who insists the estate needs some improvements here and there, but he wishes to preserve in the main what has been created over the centuries. In Austen’s world, the true mark of a man worth marrying is a man who keeps his estate well maintained with a respect for tradition, and so Bertram’s reformist conservatism marks him out as a hero.|$|E
