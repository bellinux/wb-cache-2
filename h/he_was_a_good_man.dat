5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> {{in every}} sense of the word; a {{strongly}} religious man, a pleasant companion, broad minded, exceedingly tolerant of the weaknesses of others, gentle and lovable and a rare example of a man without a single enemy.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new {{captain in}} 1958. Not an {{accomplished}} player, {{though he had}} previously captained the club's Second XI, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get {{the best out of}} what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons. Yorkshire finished 11th in the County Championship after losing 24 full days to the weather. Regular team members now included Burnet, Close, Trueman, Illingworth, Vic Wilson, Padgett, Ken Taylor, Stott, Jimmy Binks, Brian Bolus, Phil Sharpe and Don Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was taking shape. Trueman played in 30 first-class matches in 1958, taking 106 wickets at a very low 13.33 with best figures of 6–23, one of six 5-wicket hauls. He held 22 catches in the season and it was about this time that he began to prove himself a more reliable batsman, eventually being able to rise from number 11 to about 8 or 9 in batting orders. He scored 453 runs in 1958 with 3 half-centuries and a highest score of 61.|$|E
50|$|He {{played as}} <b>a</b> small forward. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> rebounder, using his 205 cm height and his long arms. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> defender, and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> free throw shooter.|$|R

500|$|Maple {{published}} a 1960 paper on Murrell in the Folklore Society's journal, Folklore, {{which was based}} both on the earlier textual sources and on oral traditions that he had obtained from elderly residents of the district. These included one of his descendants, a Mrs Murrell of Westcliff-on-Sea. Troubled by the mixed reception that Murrell had, she expressed the view that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man.</b> She also commented that Murrell's power to control mechanical objects had remained within the family, characterising them as [...] "natural mechanics".|$|E
500|$|Paul and Naomi {{eventually}} {{embarked on}} a relationship, but faced problems early on when she interfered in his family business by contacting his estranged daughter Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). Paul confronted Naomi in public, but with Sheila supporting her, Naomi refused to apologise and threatened to quit her job and their relationship. Paul later apologised to Naomi, as he bonded with Amy. O'Reilly believed Paul and Naomi's relationship would [...] "stand the test of time" [...] and joked that their pairing {{would be part of}} Neighbours history. Paul and Naomi's romance was tested when Naomi learned of Paul's involvement in her brother's crime, and when Paul questioned whether she was still in love with Toadie, following an accident that was her fault. Naomi told him that she admired Toadie as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> something that Paul was not. Paul promised to be a better man and later proposed to Naomi.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

500|$|Melodically, [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] {{is written}} in the key of F minor, and {{is set in the}} common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Underwood's voice spans from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted that the lyrics of the song push [...] "the {{normally}} plucky country superstar to the edge of evil. It's as far as she can go without falling off the cliff of believability." [...] Dukes also described the song as a [...] "mini-movie", in which Underwood sings: [...] "And the preacher said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry / Bye, bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He's {{not the only one who}} had a secret to hide / Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye." [...] The country pop instrumentation includes piano, brooding strings and a guitar, and has been compared to [...] "Goodbye Earl" [...] by the Dixie Chicks and [...] "Gunpowder and Lead" [...] by Miranda Lambert.|$|E
2500|$|Thayer visited Anlong Veng {{again on}} April 16, 1998, {{only a day}} after Pol Pot had died. After photographing the corpse he briefly interviewed Ta Mok and Pol Pot's second wife Muon, who told Thayer, [...] "What I would like {{the world to know}} is that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> a patriot, a good father." [...] Thayer was then asked to {{transport}} Pol Pot's body in his pickup truck to the site a short distance away where it was later cremated.|$|E
2500|$|By 1923, the Lolomi {{plan was}} progressing. Chester told the Daily Oklahoman {{that he wanted}} the Keetoowah some day to be [...] "in a {{position}} where they can work for the common good and build up a surplus {{for the good of the}} community." [...] However, shortly thereafter, the bank at Gore failed. The cattle herd was taken by creditors and those who had mortgaged their allotments lost their land. In the post War War I depression of the early 1920s, many sound banks and businesses failed, and the circumstances appear to have been beyond Kellogg's diligence. George Smith, fifth son of Redbird Smith, recalled, [...] "C.P. was awful smart. You couldn't get ahead of him. The white people was scared of him all the time, watching what he was doing with the Keetoowahs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but the white people were against him, and we had some bad luck." [...] After the collapse of the Lolomi Plan, some Keetoowahs believed that Cornelius cheated them and he was dismissed as spokesman for the Ketoowah Society [...] In 1925, Cornelius was raised as a chief of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and continued to reside in Gore, Oklahoma, and play a role with his sister in national Indian affairs.|$|E

2500|$|... "Buffalo Chips was {{standing}} opposite me. [...] He {{was one of}} those long-haired scouts, and claimed to be a partner of Buffalo Bill’s. [...] He {{thought it was a good}} place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he was going to have one of the Indians’ scalps. [...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a [...] "good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill’s Don Quixote." [...] Gen. [...] Charles King said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Sam Smith, one of {{the sons}} of Redbird Smith, became chief of the Nighthawk Keetoowah Society, while Cornelius {{continued}} as spokesman and legal counsel. [...] Restrictions were removed from several allotments and they were mortgaged to fund and establish a bank in Gore with Cornelius as president. In 1920, Kellogg published a book titled [...] "Our Democracy in the American Indian", where she proposed a Lolomai Plan, later spelled Lolomi, which means [...] "good, beautiful, wise" [...] in the Hopi language. [...] Her book was [...] "lovingly dedicated" [...] {{to the memory of}} Chief Redbird Smith, spiritual leader of the Nighthawk Keetoowah, [...] "who preserved his people from demoralization, and was the first to accept the Lolomi." [...] In 1921, a hundred Cherokees from 35 families moved together to the southeastern corner of Cherokee County, Oklahoma, to create a traditional community. By 1923, the Lolomi plan was progressing, and Kellogg told the Daily Oklahoman that he wanted the Keetoowah some day to be [...] "in a position where they can work for the common good and build up a surplus {{for the good of the}} community."
