500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
2500|$|Press {{photographer}} Peter Molloy, {{who arrived}} at the scene after the first explosion, came close to being shot by an angry paratrooper who saw him taking photographs {{of the dead and}} dying instead of offering to help the wounded. The soldier was tackled by his comrades. Molloy said, [...] "I was shouted at and called all sorts of things but <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why.</b> I had trespassed on the worst day of these fellas' lives and taken pictures of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Walter Phillips, who {{was present}} at two of the {{meetings}} in Jinzhou, wrote: [...] "It was at Chinchow that I first {{came into contact with}} the Revival. Meetings had been going on there for a week, hence, I was ushered into the heart of things unprepared, and in candour, I must add, with a strong temperamental prejudice against 'revival hysterics' in every form, so that mine is at least an unbiased witness. At once, on entering the church, one was conscious of something unusual. The place was crowded to the door, and tense, reverent attention sat on every face. The very singing was vibrant with new joy and vigour [...] [...] [...] The people knelt for prayer, silent at first, but soon one here and another there began to pray aloud. The voices grew and gathered volume and blended into a great wave of united supplication that swelled till it was almost a roar, and died down again into an undertone of weeping. Now <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> the floor was so wet - [...] it was wet with pools of tears! The very air seemed electric -- I speak in all seriousness [...] - and strange thrills coursed up and down one's body. Then above the sobbing, in strained, choking tones, a man began to make public confession. Words of mine will fail to describe the awe and terror and pity of these confessions. It was not so much the enormity of the sins disclosed, or the depths of iniquity sounded, that shocked one[...] [...] [...] It was the agony of the penitent, his groans and cries, and voice shaken with sobs; it was the sight of men forced to their feet, and, in spite of their struggles, impelled, as it seemed, to lay bare their hearts that moved one and brought the smarting tears to one's own eyes. Never have I experienced anything more heart breaking, more nerve racking than the spectacle of those souls stripped naked before their fellows. So for hour after hour it went on, till the strain was almost more than the onlooker could bear. Now it was a big, strong farmer groveling on the floor, smiting his head on the bare boards as he wailed unceasingly, 'Lord! Lord!' Now a shrinking woman in a voice scarce above a whisper, now a wee laddie from the school, with the tears streaking his piteous grimy little face, as he sobbed out: 'I cannot love my enemies. Last week I stole a farthing from my teacher. I am always fighting and cursing. I beseech the pastor, elders and deacons to pray for me.' And then again would swell that wonderful deep organ tone of united prayer. And ever as the prayer sank again the ear caught a dull undertone of quiet sobbing, of desperate entreaty from men and women, who, lost to their surroundings, were wrestling for peace." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Our {{belief is}} that we have to hold up the {{standard}} of abstinence, and we do that in all of our teaching about sexuality by saying that sexual activity outside of marriage is wrong. Now that's a very high bar to set and <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that. And <b>I</b> don't regret that - I subscribe to it and I teach it. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> people find it difficult and disagree with it. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> they do. <b>I</b> don't agree with them....

60|$|He left me suddenly; {{as if he}} {{desired to}} cut short any further talk between us. I thought <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why.</b> Further talk might have let me into the secret of what Miss Rachel had said {{to him on the}} terrace.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} the bluff that the Haughts had climbed so laboriously, and now <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> they had been so slow.

60|$|Now it was <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> Simon Kenton had {{refrained from}} making any disagreeable remark when Paul told of our movements.

60|$|Down {{over the}} hill was Hugh Blair's place. When we came to it, Hester turned in at the gate.

60|$|Charlie {{spoke on}} and on, and on; while I, {{separated}} from him {{by thousands of}} years, was considering the beginnings of things.

60|$|We had our {{expected}} good {{dinner at}} Cousin Mattie's--may it be counted unto her for righteousness.

60|$|After the Easterns came {{many others}} {{from all parts}} of the earth. Then {{suddenly}} appeared a company of about six hundred folk of every age and English in their looks.

60|$|Now, when I {{heard all}} this, I, Harmachis, {{put my hand}} to my head, not knowing if I dreamed.

60|$|He {{would have}} made short work of my present difficulty, I feel certain. It was ridiculously simple. But I had lost my head, and had ceased for the moment to be a {{reasoning}} creature.
