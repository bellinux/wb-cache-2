In this paper, a study on the effects of <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> thickness on annual cooling and heating energy uses under different Chinese climates is reported. Firstly, two indexes: Energy Gain Ratio (EGR) and Relative Variation Ratio (RVR) of the sum of annual cooling and heating energy uses, to assess the effects of <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> thickness on energy saving potential are introduced. Secondly, a model space having four different exterior zones facing four different orientations in an office building is presented and the settings of the model space described. Lastly, the simulated annual cooling and heating energy uses for the four different exterior zones at different <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> thicknesses under three different climates in China, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, are reported. The results suggested that energy saving was significant by increasing the <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> thickness in exterior zones facing all orientations under Beijing's climate, since the heating energy use was dominant and can be reduced remarkably with the increase in insulation thickness. Under Shanghai's climate, increasing <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> thickness to over 26. mm would not reduce the sum of annual heating and cooling energy uses in the south-facing exterior zone, but would help save energy in exterior zones facing the other three orientations. For all exterior zones under Guangzhou's climate, it was, however, hardly possible to reduce the sum of annual heating and cooling energy uses by increasing the <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> thickness.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{existing}} quality problems of <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> system, a new <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> system was developed through the rational use of closed air layer’s thermal insulation performance. Considering three kinds of ways of heat transfer [...] convection, conduction and radiation and using the coefficient of air equivalent thermal conductivity to obtain the thermal resistance in the air layer, compared with the thermal resistance at different thicknesses in the new system using polyurethane and polystyrene board of insulation material with two different thicknesses, the authors can get the most optimal model. This paper takes the extreme value of indoor and outdoor temperature in summer as the temperature loads of this model and uses ANSYS simulation to obtain its heat flow density, gradient and temperature field, and in the meanwhile, undertakes a comparison with the present form of <b>external</b> wall <b>insulation</b> in the new code.

In this approach, the entire interior of the autoclave is filled with live steam at the appropriate pressure.

It requires different vacuum bagging materials but has the advantage of eliminating heaters, ducts, and the circulation fan.

5000|$|Several {{inches of}} {{insulation}} must {{be added to}} the inside working diameter to get the diameter of the pressure vessel. Putting the insulation on the outside yields the smallest pressure vessel for a given inside working diameter, but the energy required to heat up the vessel itself each cycle soon makes this a very unattractive way of economizing, unless steam injection is used for heating, in which event <b>external</b> <b>insulation</b> must be used. For most machines, figure on four to six inches of insulation thickness. On machines rated at less than , this can be reduced to three inches (76 mm) [...] For temperatures over , it should be increased to eight inches or more. This affects the diameter significantly, but the trade-off generally favours the additional insulation.|$|E
