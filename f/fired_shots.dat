5|$|During this stage, Antoine Fauré lead {{close to}} his hometown, and 200 fans {{tried to stop the}} rest of the cyclists from {{following}} him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up with broken fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials <b>fired</b> <b>shots</b> in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires.

5000|$|Interesting note- While a Rossi Circuit Judge (18" [...] barrel) is {{considered}} a shotgun with a revolving cylinder (violation of #8 above), the CA DOJ claims it is legal {{because it has a}} rifled barrel.

Conversely, there are many revolvers that <b>fire</b> <b>shot</b> shells made in different calibers (e.g. 22, 9mm, 38, etc.) mostly used to shoot birds or snakes. Even though these handguns, with less that 18" [...] barrels, <b>fire</b> <b>shot</b> shells, like the Judge, they are legal in California.|$|R
