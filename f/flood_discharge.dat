500|$|Sunita Narain, the {{director}} of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) think tank, said the unprecedented floods in the Chennai metropolitan region were the direct result of unregulated urbanisation. According to Narain, [...] "our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural <b>flood</b> <b>discharge</b> channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water." [...] According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract_The {{determination}} of <b>flood</b> <b>discharges</b> that fits {{to the physical}} condition of the watershed requires an effort in developing <b>flood</b> <b>discharges</b> estimation model that meets the physical condition of the watershed. The research uses two models in estimating the flood in any watershed. The first model {{is the development of}} surface runoff coefficient model (Cm). The second model is the development of <b>flood</b> <b>discharges</b> models (Qm) that is used further as plan flood prediction for each sub watershed. The research aims to determine the parameter of physical characteristic of the watershed that affects the surface runoff coefficient, to develop the correlation between physical characteristics of the watershed with the surface runoff coefficient, and to determine the plan flood prediction for Bango watershed. The analysis applied in determining the parameter of physical characteristics of the watershed uses geographical information system (GIS), and the development of surface runoff coefficient model by using multiple linear correlation-regression. The findings show that the mean slope of watershed (Ia), the main river length factor (Lb), topography factor (T), land use factor (Lu), and land type factor (S) influence the surface runoff coefficient. The parameter correlation toward the surface runoff coefficient is linear, while for <b>flood</b> <b>discharges,</b> it is non-linear.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a statewide study conducted to develop main-channel slope (MCS) curves for 138 selected streams in Iowa with drainage areas greater than 100 square miles. MCS values determined from the curves {{can be used}} in regression equations for estimating <b>flood</b> frequency <b>discharges.</b> Multi-variable regression equations previously developed for two of the three hydrologic regions defined for Iowa require the measurement of MCS. Main-channel slope is a difficult measurement to obtain for large streams using 1 : 24, 000 -scale topographic maps. The curves developed in this report provide a simplified method for determining MCS values for sites located along large streams in Iowa within hydrologic Regions 2 and 3. The curves were developed using MCS values quantified for 2, 058 selected sites along 138 selected streams in Iowa. A geographic information system (GIS) technique and 1 : 24, 000 -scale topographic data were used to quantify MCS values for the stream sites. The sites were selected at about 5 -mile intervals along the streams. River miles were quantified for each stream site using a GIS program. Data points for river-mile and MCS values were plotted and a best-fit curve was developed for each stream. An adjustment was applied to all 138 curves to compensate for differences in MCS values between manual measurements and GIS quantification. The multi-variable equations for Regions 2 and 3 were developed using manual measurements of MCS. A comparison of manual measurements and GIS quantification of MCS indicates that manual measurements typically produce greater values of MCS compared to GIS quantification. Median differences between manual measurements and GIS quantification of MCS are 14. 8 and 17. 7 percent for Regions 2 and 3, respectively. Comparisons of percentage differences between flood-frequency discharges calculated using MCS values of manual measurements and GIS quantification indicate that use of GIS values of MCS for Region 3 substantially underestimate <b>flood</b> <b>discharges.</b> Mean and median percentage differences for 2 - to 500 -year recurrence-interval <b>flood</b> <b>discharges</b> ranged from 5. 0 to 5. 3 and 4. 3 to 4. 5 percent, respectively, for Region 2 and ranged from 18. 3 to 27. 1 and 12. 3 to 17. 3 percent for Region 3. The MCS curves developed from GIS quantification were adjusted by 14. 8 percent for streams located in Region 2 and by 17. 7 percent for streams located in Region 3. Comparisons of percentage differences between <b>flood</b> <b>discharges</b> calculated using MCS values of manual measurements and adjusted-GIS quantification for Regions 2 and 3 indicate that the flood-discharge estimates are comparable. For Region 2, mean percentage differences for 2 - to 500 -year recurrence-interval <b>flood</b> <b>discharges</b> ranged between 0. 6 and 0. 8 percent and median differences were 0. 0 percent.
