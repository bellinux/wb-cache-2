The urgent requirement of evaluation on performance of roadway rapid <b>excavation</b> is emerging with development of various <b>excavation</b> techniques. However, shortages of current definitions and evaluation systems of rapid <b>excavation</b> cause to lack of effective tools in performance comparison between the techniques. The paper presents an <b>excavation</b> quality evaluation system based on the multiple attribute decision making theory, and gives a definition of rapid <b>excavation.</b> The practices show {{that the system is}} able to evaluate quality of roadway <b>excavation</b> technology, help companies select the most appropriate <b>excavation</b> method, and promote development of <b>excavation</b> techniques...|$|R

5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw {{an increasing number of}} <b>excavations</b> of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle <b>excavations</b> as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle <b>excavations</b> fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting <b>excavations</b> on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aimed to {{the problem}} of <b>excavation</b> and {{stability}} for a high and steep rocky slope, with the design <b>excavation</b> height of 90. 23 m, this paper grasped the engineering geological conditions and physical and mechanical properties of rock mass by such following methods as the field engineering geological survey, measuring, drilling sampling and laboratory test. Based on this, a comparative analysis of two different <b>excavation</b> ways was conducted using the large discrete element program-UDEC. The analysis included the stress-strain law and deformation failure trends of the slope when adopting slow <b>excavation</b> and steep <b>excavation</b> respectively. Moreover, the environmental damage caused by the two <b>excavation</b> ways was discussed. The results show that the slope has a better engineering geological condition and stability. In order to avoid disturbing hills and protect the natural environment, the steep <b>excavation</b> way is suggested for <b>excavation</b> and reinforcement of this slope...|$|R

Further <b>excavations</b> were done during six working seasons from 1989 to 1992, which led to a contradictory view that the brick structures and the wells investigated by Wheeler were of poor quality as they were founded on poor sandy foundations.

The <b>excavations</b> have now established that the trading with Rome extended to a period beyond that assessed by Wheeler; that trading continued from the second century BCE to the seventh or eighth century CE.|$|E

40|$|Earthmoving is {{a common}} {{activity}} at mines, construction sites, hazardous waste cleanup locations, and road works. Expensive and sophisticated machines such as front-end-loaders (FEL), backhoe loaders, LHD loaders and front shovels are used for these <b>excavation</b> tasks. Autonomous <b>excavation</b> control for these machines has gained considerable attention in order to remove human operators from hazardous environments, improve productivity and utilization, reduce machine abuse, as well as decrease machine operating costs. However, automatic control of <b>excavation</b> tasks for many sites that require digging in rock cannot be implemented using existing factory-based automation techniques. For example, control of bucket motions by simply partitioning the terrain into a set of volumes where each equals the bucket capacity often does not work. Planning {{in this way is}} possible only when digging in the materials such as loose soils where bucket motion resistance through the media can be predicted. Resistance predictions are impossible and/or infeasible to generate for <b>excavation</b> in the environments which consists mainly of irregular rigid objects such as rock piles with oversized particles, since no means exists to predetermine subsurface bucket/material interactions that are required to preplan the bucket trajectory. As a result, bucket actions must be determined through on-line decision making based on sensory feedback of the current <b>excavation</b> status in the unpredictable, unstructured and dynamic rock <b>excavation</b> environment. This research proposes a control method for autonomous rock <b>excavation.</b> The control architecture is designed following the behavior-based control concept. That is, the rock <b>excavation</b> control problem is solved by decomposition of the complicated task into a variety of simple elements that can be implemented by <b>excavation</b> behaviors. However, this control approach presents a new structure and operational paradigm that is developed based on, but different from the traditional behavior control method. Here, the behaviors are chosen using fuzzy <b>excavation</b> situation assessment with guidance of <b>excavation</b> task planning which embodies <b>excavation</b> heuristics and human strategies. Task plans are formulated using finite state machines which integrate neural networks for decision making. This organizational structure has the capability to include more <b>excavation</b> goals and to adapt to different environments via learning. <b>Excavation</b> behaviors are performed by primitive and machine executable actions or action sequences structured using finite state machines and simple action arbitration rules. The actions of human FEL operators were observed and analyzed to extract basic bucket actions and define rules of arbitration for different actions or action sequences under particular <b>excavation</b> environments. Fuzzy logic is applied to implement each <b>excavation</b> action where fuzzy rules represent the human experience and heuristics that are intrinsically linguistic, and bucket <b>excavation</b> motions are evaluated based on insufficient and inaccurate input sensory data. A variety of experiments were performed to test the ability of the proposed control algorithm. The laboratory-based experimental autonomous <b>excavation</b> system consists of a robotic arm, an <b>excavation</b> testbed, a force/torque sensor mounted between the robot arm wrist and the <b>excavation</b> bucket, and a control computer. Various rock piles to simulate realistic <b>excavation</b> environments and conditions were generated in the testbed. With these experiments, the control algorithm has demonstrated the ability to execute real-time automated loading cycles effectively and efficiently in complex <b>excavation</b> environments and under difficult digging conditions, through the use of the flexible <b>excavation</b> behaviors...|$|R
