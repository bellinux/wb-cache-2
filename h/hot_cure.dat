50|$|Worn tires can be retreaded by two methods, {{the mold}} or <b>hot</b> <b>cure</b> method and the {{pre-cure}} or cold one. The mold cure method involves {{the application of}} raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices. During the curing period, vulcanization takes place and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix. On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves {{the application of a}} ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.|$|E

Flexible PU foams meet {{the following two}} criteria: have a limited resistance to an applied load, being both permeable to air and reversibly deformable. There are two main types of flexible foams, hot and cold cure foams differing in composition and processing temperatures. The <b>hot</b> <b>cure</b> foams are widely applied and represent the main composition of actual foams, while cold cure foams present several processing and property advantages, e. g, faster demoulding time, better humid aging properties and more versatility, as hardness variation with index changes are greater than with <b>hot</b> <b>cure</b> foams. The processing of cold cure foams also is attractive due to the low energy consumption (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 65 degrees C) comparatively to <b>hot</b> <b>cure</b> foams (mould temperature from 30 degrees to 250 degrees C). Another advantage is the high variety of soft materials for low temperature processing moulds. Cold cure foams are diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) based while <b>hot</b> <b>cure</b> foams are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) based. This study is concerned with Viscoelastic flexible foams MDI based for medical applications. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to characterize the cure kinetics and Dynamical Mechanical Analisys to collect mechanical data. The data obtained from these two experimental procedures were analyzed and associated to establish processing/properties/operation conditions relationships.

40|$|Damage {{assessment}} {{techniques have}} been applied to particulate-filled woven roving glass fibre reinforced epoxy laminates. Impact energies up to 43 J were applied to approximately 8 mm thick laminates, using a drop weight apparatus. An optimal testing arrangement was used to investigate the effect of particulate filler characteristics, e. g. particle strength, size, shape and surface treatment, on the compressive strength of undamaged and impact-damaged laminates. The damage to impacted laminates filled with particulate fillers was examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy and quantified by measuring the maximum damage zone size. Their damage tolerance was determined by compressive strength retention. All the particulate fillers caused a deterioration in the damage tolerance. Mineral fillers increased {{the size of the}} damage zone, and the compressive strength of unimpacted laminates was increased by incorporating hard, high modulus filler. The compressive failure modes before and after impact were distinctly different. Glass beads gave the highest damage resistance and compressive strength retention, but hollow glass microspheres and mica caused the most severe damage and a significant reduction in the retention of compressive strength after impact, while alumina trihydrate, calcium carbonate and quartz showed moderate damage tolerance. The size of the glass beads had a more significant effect on the damage resistance and post-impact compressive strength than the surface treatments. Although the laminates filled with two-dimensional glass flakes showed a lower impact damage resistance than those containing glass beads, they showed a higher compressive strength retention caused by better interlaminar shear strength. Adding rubber modifiers and combining Kevlar fabrics with glass fibre did not improve the damage tolerance of ATH-filled laminates. The use of a <b>hot</b> <b>cure</b> (piperidine) system improved the quality of the filled laminates probably by lowering the void content and/or improving fibre/matrix adhesion, and therefore improved the low energy impact resistance of laminates, but this advantage disappeared at higher impact energies. Based on a theoretical analysis of the impact damage mechanism, the fundamental matrix properties affecting the damage tolerance of laminates were identified, and verified by experimental data. There was a linear relationship between the strength of the matrix and the compressive strength retention of impact damaged laminates. The pre-impact interlaminar shear strength of laminates also correlated well with the compressive strength retention of laminates after impact. But there was no positive correlation between the modulus of the matrix and the impact damage tolerance' of laminates...|$|E

40|$|Iminoamino {{methylene}} bases intermediates {{are obtained}} by the decomposition of hexamethylenetetra- mine (hexamine). These are stabilized {{by the presence of}} strong anions such as SO 24 and HSO 4, that is, “hexamine sulfate. ” The effect of hexamine sulfate was closely linked to the strong buffering action it has on MUF resins. Its role is mainly to induce regularity of the reaction and the stability of conditions during resin networking, due to the buffer. Shifting of the polycondensation a degradation equilibrium to the left appeared to be the determinant factor. This was a consequence of maintaining a higher, constant pH during curing, due to the buffer action. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) increases the curves of hexamine sulfate-catalyzed MUF resins, confirming this trend. The resins are faster curing than when catalyzed by ammonium sulfate. The effect is valid within the narrow buffering range of pH’s used for resin hardening. Polycondensation is far too slow to occur at a much higher pH, and degradation is, instead, more predominant at much lower pH’s. The network formed is then more crosslinked and less tainted by degra- dation when curing occurs within the correct pH range. The result is a much better performance of the wood board after water attack. The effects induced by hexamine sulfate effects are of longer duration than those of other potential buffers. This is due to the hexamine sulfate heat stability under standard <b>hot</b> <b>curing</b> conditions of the resin. Alternate systems were found and shown to have a comparable effect...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability is {{considered}} to be highly important for preserving continued industrial growth and human development. Concrete, being the world’s largest manufacturing material comprises cement as an essential binding component for strength development. However, excessive production of cement due to high degree of construction practices around the world frames cement as a leading pollutant of releasing significant amounts of CO 2 in the atmosphere. To overcome this environmental degradation, silica fume and hydrated lime are used as partial replacements to cement. This paper begins with the examination of the partial replacement levels of hydrated lime and silica fume in concrete and their influence on the mechanical properties and durability characteristics of concrete. The effect of <b>hot</b> water <b>curing</b> on concrete incorporated with both silica fume and hydrated lime is also investigated in this paper. The results reported in this paper show that the use of silica fume as a partial replacement material improved both the mechanical properties and durability characteristics of concrete due to the formation of calcium silica hydrate crystals through the pozzolanic reaction. Although the hydrated lime did not significantly contribute in the development of strength, its presence enhanced the durability of concrete especially at long-term. The results also showed that <b>hot</b> water <b>curing</b> enhanced the strength development of concrete incorporated with silica fume due to the accelerated rate of both the hydration and pozzolanic reaction that takes place between silica fume and calcium hydroxide of the cement matrix particularly at early times.

The effect of a reactive rubber on these properties, on its own and in ATH-filled composites have also been considered. All filled compositions showed a lower tensile strength than the unfilled resin. The largest effect occurred at low volume fractions, up to V[sub]f = 0. 1, loadings higher than this did not reduce the strength any further. The addition of a rubber toughener (ATBN), to the ATH-filled composite, reduced the strength still further. The elongation to failure was also reduced. Young's modulus was increased and was in agreement with other studies and predictions of theoretical models. The Lewis and Nielsen equation was found to give a satisfactory approximation for both the ATH-filled and ATH-rubber compositions. The fracture energy (G[sub]lc) exhibited a maximum at a volume fraction of 0. 1. The fracture toughness (K[sub]lc) increased linearly with increasing volume fraction of filler. Addition of ATBN rubber to ATH-filled composites increased G[sub]lc and K[sub]lc further. The results correlated well with the crack-pinning prediction of Green at high volume fractions but showed some deviation at low loadings.
