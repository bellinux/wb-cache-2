5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually.

5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> smaller groups on the ground, rather than on or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E

40|$|Skin {{color and}} juice {{constituents}} in large(L), medium(M), nad small(S) fruits of four peach cultivars, Hashiba-hakuho(early maturing), were analyzed to elucidate {{the effect of}} fruit size on the quality. The fruits containing higher soluble solids than 12 °Brix were samled at a commercial packing-house located in southen Okayama. They were stored at 25 ℃ until fully ripened. The skin color on the cheeks (yellowish) was dark <b>in</b> S <b>fruits</b> of Hashiba-hakuto and Hakurei, respectively, compared to the fruits of other sizes. The sucrose + fructose content in juice, {{the major source of}} the sweetness, was higher in S and M <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hakuho, Shimisu-hakuto, and Hakurei, while the malic+citric acid content, the major sour constituent, was lower <b>in</b> L <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> those cultivars, although no significant difference was found in Hashiba-hakuho. Asparagine, the biggest amino acid fraction and thought to deteriorate the fruit taste at high levels, was higher <b>in</b> L <b>fruits</b> tahn <b>in</b> S <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hashiba-hakuho and Hakuho. The content in Shimizu-hakuto and Hakurei fruits was generally low and not affected by fruit size. The content of γ-decalactone, the major peachy aromatic substance, was higher <b>in</b> L <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hashiba-hakuto, <b>in</b> M <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hakuho and Shimizu-hakuto, and <b>in</b> S <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Hakurei, than in those of other sizes. Sensory tests revealed that the L fruits of Hakuho and S fruits of Hakurei were poor in flavor. These results suggest that the larger fruits of Hakuho, Shimizu-kakuto, and Hakurei, the representative white peach <b>fruits</b> <b>in</b> Okayama, have rather falatter tastes than medium size fruits because of their lower sweetness and sourness and weaker aroma, as well as poorer texture. 岡山市一宮のモモの選果場に出荷された有袋栽培の‘橋場白鳳’（早生），‘白鳳’（早中生），‘清水白桃’（中生）および‘白麗’（晩生）から，３段階のサイズ（Ｌ，Ｍ，Ｓ）の果実を入手し，完熟状態（手で皮が剥ける）に達するまで 25 ℃の室温においた．それらの果実について，果皮色と果汁成分の分析と果肉の食味テストを行い，果実のサイズによる品質の相違を検討した．‘橋場白鳳’では，Ｓ果実は地色が暗く，‘清水白桃’のＬ果実は着色が濃いが色調が暗く，‘白麗’のＬ果実は着色が薄くて黄色が強く，いずれも外観が劣った．果汁中の主要な甘味成分であるスクロース＋フルクトース含量は，‘白鳳’，‘清水白桃’および‘白麗’ではＳまたはＬ果実で高く，酸味成分のリンゴ酸＋クエン酸含量は，それら３品種のＬ果実で最も低かった．‘橋場白鳳’では果実サイズによる糖・酸含量の有意な差がなかった．果実に苦みを与えるアスパラギン含量は，‘橋場白鳳’と‘白鳳’ではＬ果実で高かったが，‘清水白桃’と‘白麗’ではどのサイズでも含量が低かった．モモ香の主成分であるγ-decalactoneは，‘橋場白鳳’ではＬ果実で高かったが，‘白鳳’と‘清水白桃’ではＭ果実で，‘白麗’ではＳ果実で高かった．官能テストの結果，‘白鳳’のＬ果実と‘白麗’のＳ果実は食味が劣った．これらの結果から，岡山の「白桃」を代表する‘白鳳’，‘清水白桃’，‘白麗’の大果は，中程度の大きさの果実より甘味と酸味が低く，アロマが弱いなど，食味が薄く，肉質も劣ると考えられる...|$|R

5|$|Already {{a friend}} of the {{composer}} Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>in</b> {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal. The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} mycorrhizal mushrooms to <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E

5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcap}} feeds {{mainly on}} insects during the breeding season, then switches to <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> late summer, the change being triggered by an internal biological rhythm. When migrants arrive on their territories they initially take berries, pollen and nectar {{if there are}} insufficient insects available, then soon switch to their preferred diet. They mainly pick prey off foliage and twigs, but may occasionally hover, flycatch or feed on the ground. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} invertebrate prey, although aphids are particularly important early in the season, and flies, beetles and caterpillars are also taken in large numbers. Small snails are swallowed whole, since the shell is a source of calcium for the bird's eggs. Chicks are mainly fed soft-bodied insects, fruit only being provided if invertebrates are scarce.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the adult}} Guianan cock-of-the-rock {{consists}} mainly of fruits meaning they are frugivorous.

5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella bombycina is a {{saprobic}} species. Fruit bodies grow singly or {{in small}} groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include sugar maple, red maple, silver maple, magnolia, mango, beech, oak, and elm. It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks. It has been noted to <b>fruit</b> <b>in</b> the same location for several years. Despite its preference for hardwoods, {{it has been reported}} growing on rare instances on coniferous wood. An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (China, India, Korea, Pakistan), the Caribbean (Cuba), Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it. Variety microspora is known from Venezuela, while V.bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, adult {{amphibians}} are predators, {{feeding on}} virtually anything that moves {{that they can}} swallow.
