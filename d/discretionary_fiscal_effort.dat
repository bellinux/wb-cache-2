The Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) recommended a three-pronged strategy to alleviate States'' fiscal distress, built around greater orientation toward market discipline, incentives for fiscal consolidation targets, and commitment to fiscal correction. We find that States have created fiscal space through raising revenues and reducing and reprioritizing expenditures. Looking ahead, expansion of fiscal space is essential to meet the States'' large infrastructure and social needs in order to alleviate bottlenecks to growth.

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for indentifying <b>discretionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy with real time data. The {{starting}} point is the observation that automatic stabilizers should depend on true GDP, while <b>discretionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy depends on the information that policy makers have in real time. We approximate the information set of policy makers with GDP data released in real time. True GDP is approximated using the last GDP release. Accordingly, we can compute a real time measurement error. <b>Discretionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy {{can be expected to}} react to this measurement error, whereas automatic fiscal policy will not. We apply this identification approach in order to test the central identifying assumption of Blanchard and Perotti's (2002) seminal structural VAR. According to this assumption, fiscal policy makers do not react to GDP evolutions contemporaneously in a discretionary fashion. We find that government expenditure is adjusted upward if GDP in real time is lower than true GDP. This suggests that fiscal policy makers can use short-term funds to buy goods and services in response to GDP updates. Our results therefore call the identifying assumption of Blanchard and Perotti's (2002) SVAR into question.

(5) The automatic stabilizers embedded in the fiscal system have experienced little net change since the 1960 s and have contributed to cushioning cyclical fluctuations.

First, {{we find that}} the federation adopted a countercyclical fiscal policy in approximately 60 % of all periods observed.

Second, the two stabilizing instruments of fiscal policy, automatic stabilizers and <b>discretionary</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy are compared with each other.
