40|$|The random energy model, {{originally}} used {{to analyze}} the physics of spin glasses, has been employed to explore what makes a protein a good folder versus a bad folder. In earlier work, the ratio of the folding temperature over the glass–transition temperature was related to a statistical measure of protein energy landscapes denoted as the <b>foldability</b> F. It was posited and subsequently established by simulation that good folders had larger foldabilities, on average, than bad folders. An alternative hypothesis, equally verified by protein folding simulations, was that it is the energy gap Δ between the native state and the next highest energy that distinguishes good folders from bad folders. This duality of measures has led to some controversy and confusion with little done to reconcile the two. In this paper, we revisit the random energy model to derive the statistical distributions of the various energy gaps and <b>foldability.</b> The resulting joint distribution allows us to explicitly demonstrate the positive correlation between <b>foldability</b> and energy gap.

40|$|In this {{analysis}} of the contact energies guiding the protein folding, {{the performance of the}} PERM algorithm on a simple, cubic lattice is examined when Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) and Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) energy matrices are applied. Geometric similarity of minimum energy conformations of twenty proteins, generated when HP and MJ are used, is determined by the Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) and the fraction of Common Contacts (CC). RMSD is a measure of global similarity, while CC indicates local similarity. On average, RMSD is one lattice edge, which is the resolution of the model. More contacts are formed when the MJ energies are used, as opposed to HP energies. This difference is attributed to the greater likelihood of contact formation between two polar residues in the MJ model. The local and global differences in conformations predicted by HP and MJ, increase with protein length, and decrease with hydrophobic fraction. A novel parameter, protein ”foldability”, is introduced. It {{is a measure of the}} simplicity of folding a protein.

We phylogenetically reconstructed 47 -residue ancestral motifs that form five-bladed lectin propellers via oligomeric assembly. We demonstrate a functional trajectory of tandem duplications of these motifs leading to monomeric lectins. <b>Foldability,</b> i. e., higher efficiency of folding, was the main parameter leading to improved functionality along the entire evolutionary trajectory.

Previous work showed that Ala replacement of B 8 Gly significantly decreased both the activity and the <b>foldability</b> of insulin. However, the effects of substitution are complicated, and different replacements sometimes cause significantly different results. To analyze the effects of B 8 replacement by different amino acids, three new insulin/single-chain insulin mutants with B 8 Gly replaced by Ser, Thr or Leu were prepared by protein engineering, and both their <b>foldability</b> and activity were analyzed. In general, replacement of B 8 Gly by other amino acids causes significant detriment to the <b>foldability</b> of single-chain insulin: the conformations of the three B 8 mutants are essentially {{different from that of}} wild-type molecules as revealed by circular dichroism; their disulfide stabilities in redox buffer are significantly decreased; their in vitro refolding efficiencies are decreased approximately two folds; the structural stabilities of the mutants with Ser or Thr substitution are decreased significantly, while Leu substitution has little effect as measured by equilibrium guanidine denaturation. As far as biological activity is concerned, Ser replacement of B 8 Gly has only a moderate effect: its insulin receptor-binding activity is 23 % of native insulin.

40|$|Background: A common {{approach}} to the protein folding problem involves computer simulation of folding using lattice models of amino acid sequences. Key factors for good performance in such models are the correct choice of the temperature and the average interaction energy between residues. In order to push the lattice approach to its limit {{it is important to}} have a method to adjust these parameters for optimal folding that is not limited by our ability to successfully simulate folding in a reasonable time. Results: In this study, we adopt a simple cubic-lattice model and present a method for calculating the free energy of a chain as a function of the number of native contacts. This does not require that we are able to fold the sequence by simulation and it provides a method of estimating the folding transition temperature. For a given set of parameters, the free energy analysis also allows an estimate of <b>foldability.</b> By applying the method to sequences with 27 and 125 residues, we show that optimal folding occurs near the folding transition temperature and at either zero or small negative average interaction energy. We find ourselves able to fold only 125 -mers that have significant short-range native contacts. Conclusions: A free energy analysis during unfolding is a useful tool for the study of <b>foldability</b> and should be applicable to a variety of folding models. In this way we are able to fold some 125 -mer designed sequences and our results confirm the finding that short-range contacts contribute to <b>foldability...</b>|$|E

40|$|Nature {{has come}} up with an {{enormous}} variety of protein three-dimensional structures, each of which is thought to be optimized for its specific function. A fundamental biological endeavor is to uncover the evolutionary driving forces for discovering and optimizing new folds. A long-standing hypothesis is that fold evolution obeys constraints. Aiming at elucidating those constraints, we evaluated some physical quantities for a large number of biological molecules. Firstly, flexibility was estimated via two independent methods: CONCOORD, which predicts conformational ensembles for atomic protein structures using geometrical constraints, and elastic network models, a simple coarse-grain model. <b>Foldability</b> was measured by Contact Order, which can predict the folding rate of a protein by measuring the distance between native contacts within the protein. Lastly, mechanical strength was predicted with Langevin Dynamics simulations of the conventional Go-type models of proteins, a coarse-grained model based on the X-ray structure, under force. We mapped those physical quantities onto a phylogenomic tree of protein structures resulting from the analysis of the abundance of 3, 000 protein families. Bimodal trends were observed for the different physical quantities suggesting a turnover at around 1. 5 billions years ago. This turnover corresponds to the apparition of multicellular organism that could have drastically modified the constraints applied on the evolution of protein structures. More specifically, before 1. 5 Gya, we observed an increase of <b>foldability</b> and a decrease of mechanical stability that might be the result of a concerted need for fast folders and compact proteins resulting from molecular compartimentalization, i. e. the rise of cells. On the contrary, after 1. 5 Gya, we observed a decrease of <b>foldability</b> and an increase of mechanical stability that suggest a need for mechanical stability probably related to the rise of multicellular organisms with increased mechanical stresses between cells. The loss in <b>foldability</b> after the big bang might be due to that cells started to make use of proteins such as chaperones or other advanced mechanisms thereby removing, at least partly, the constraint for fast folders. Taken together, we identified physical constraints that are likely {{to play a role in}} the evolution of protein structures. Our global approach opens avenues for a more comprehensive analysis of genomic and structural data available.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{analytical}} and computational {{models have been}} proposed {{to answer the question}} of why some protein structures are more “designable” (i. e., have more sequences folding into them) than others. One class of analytical and statistical-mechanical models has approached the designability problem from a thermodynamic viewpoint. These models highlighted specific structural features important for increased designability. Furthermore, designability was shown to be inherently related to thermodynamically relevant energetic measures of protein folding, such as the <b>foldability</b> F and energy gap Δ 10. Δ 10. However, many of these models have been done within a very narrow focus: Namely, pair–contact interactions and two-letter amino-acid alphabets. Recently, two-letter amino-acid alphabets for pair–contact models have been shown to contain designability artifacts which disappear for larger-letter amino-acid alphabets. In addition, a solvation model was demonstrated to give identical designability results to previous two-letter amino-acid alphabet pair–contact models. In light of these discordant results, this report synthesizes a broad consensus regarding the relationship between specific structural features, <b>foldability</b> F, energy gap Δ 10,Δ 10, and structure designability for different energy models (pair–contact vs solvation) across a wide range of amino-acid alphabets. We also propose a novel measure ZdkZdk which is shown to be well correlated to designability.
