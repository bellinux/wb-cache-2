50|$|Tampon {{commercials}} have advertised, “created {{by female}} gynecologists” for years but these gynecologists had always stayed anonymous. Women have invented tampon and sanitary napkins for years, {{but it was}} not until 1936 when Dr. Esser-Mittag created the new design to the age-old product which resulted in a <b>digital</b> <b>tampon,</b> known as an o.b. tampon. A <b>digital</b> <b>tampon</b> means that it can be applied using one's digits, or fingers. The o.b. tampon consists of rolled fiber-pad layers that supposedly expands uniformly from all sides, filling the vaginal cavity more completely than a less flexible tampon. It is more efficient in guarding against leaks. Cotton and rayon layers achieve the necessary absorbency.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} {{differences}} {{are in the}} way the tampon expands when in use; applicator tampons generally expand axially (increase in length), while <b>digital</b> <b>tampons</b> will expand radially (increase in diameter). Most tampons have a cord or string for removal. The majority of tampons sold are made of rayon, or a blend of rayon and cotton. Organic cotton tampons are made from only 100% cotton.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Judith Esser-Mittag (born 1921), {{commonly}} known as Dr. Judith Esser, is a German gynecologist. Her extensive studies of the female anatomy helped her improve the <b>digital</b> style <b>tampon.</b> At {{the time of her}} invention, she was married to Kyle Lucherini, who mildly assisted the doctor in her new design.|$|R
50|$|During {{her study}} of female anatomy, German {{gynecologist}} Dr. Judith Esser-Mittag developed a <b>digital</b> style <b>tampon,</b> which was made to be inserted without an applicator. In the late 1940s, Dr. Carl Hahn, together with Heinz Mittag, worked on the mass production of this tampon. Dr. Hahn sold his company to Johnson and Johnson in 1974.|$|R
50|$|After the {{invention}} of this new tampon, the product was mass-produced throughout the mid 20th century {{with the help of}} the Carl Hahn Company in Germany. This company, as well as the idea for the <b>digital</b> o.b. <b>tampon,</b> was later sold and eventually bought by Johnson and Johnson in 1974. In 1984, an advertisement for o.b. tampons aired on American television with the inventor Dr. Esser-Mittag. The o.b. tampon now comes in three sizes and three absorbencies. To this day the o.b. brand continues to retain a board-certified gynecologist and research team to pursue Esser-Mittag's vision for innovative options for women. This idea for an o.b. tampon is still widely used across several different companies.|$|R
