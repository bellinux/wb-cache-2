5000|$|... ===League of Ireland=== Cork Bohemians {{were elected}} to the League of Ireland in 1932-33 after Brideville and Jacobs failed to gain {{re-election}} and Waterford resigned from the league {{before the start of}} the season. After Fordsons/Cork F.C. they became the second club from Cork city to join the league. Bohemians, following the example of Cork F.C., augmented local talent by importing players from Northern Ireland and England and their team included several former and future internationals. After an encouraging start to the 1932-33 season, which included 15,000 people watching a local derby against Cork F.C., they were forced to release eight professionals, and ended the season finishing fourth from the bottom. The 1933-34 season proved to be a lean one for all League of Ireland clubs and in particular Cork Bohemians. Travelling to fulfil away <b>fixtures</b> <b>drained</b> their meagre financial resources and receipts from their home games did not help. During the regular season their away game against Bray Unknowns was not played and the points were awarded to the Unknowns. Bohemians fell behind in their 5% of gate receipts payable to the league and found themselves suspended. Within a week the required amount was scraped together and the suspension lifted. However it proved only temporary relief and, after failing to raise the £15 which would have paid for them to travel to a League of Ireland Shield fixture with Dolphin at Harold's Cross Stadium on 28 April 1934, they resigned from the league on 22 April.‌ ...|$|R
50|$|Under {{many older}} {{building}} codes, a vent stack (a pipe {{leading to the}} main roof vent) is required to be within a 5 ft radius of the <b>draining</b> <b>fixture</b> it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow only one vent stack, and thus one roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack. One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run. Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability of the long run.|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} hygiene strategies, {{in recent}} years, the major {{focus has been}} on the hands as the key route of infection transmission. However, there is a multitude of lesser-known and underestimated reservoirs for microorganisms which are the triggering sources and vehicles for outbreaks or sporadic cases of infection. Among those are water reservoirs such as sink <b>drains,</b> <b>fixtures,</b> decorative water fountains and waste-water treatment plants, frequently touched textile surfaces such as private curtains in hospitals and laundry, but also transvaginal ultrasound probes, parenteral drug products, and disinfectant wipe dispensers. The review of outbreak reports also reveals Gram-negative and multiple-drug resistant microorganisms to have become an increasingly frequent and severe threat in medical settings. In some instances, the causative organisms are particularly difficult to identify because they are concealed in biofilms or in a state referred to as viable but nonculturable, which eludes conventional culture media-based detection methods. There is an enormous preventative potential in these insights, which has not been fully tapped. New and emerging pathogens, novel pathogen detection methods, and hidden reservoirs of infection should hence be given special consideration when designing the layout of buildings and medical devices, but also when defining the core competencies for medical staff, establishing programmes for patient empowerment and education of the general public, and when implementing protocols for the prevention and control of infections in medical, community and domestic settings...|$|R
