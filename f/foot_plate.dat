40|$|The {{group at}} Klinik Berlin/Charite University Hospital in Berlin, Germany, began studies to promote motor {{recovery}} after stroke {{in the early}} 1990 s. Following the introduction of treadmill training with partial body-weight support, the group designed an electromechanical gait trainer, GT I, based on movable <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> that relieve therapist effort (e. g., when assisting {{the movement of the}} paretic limbs) and intensify patient gait training (GT). Preliminary results of a recent multicenter trial of 155 acute stroke patients showed that the GT I effectively promotes gait ability and competence in activities of daily living. The experimental group received 20 min of GT and 25 min of physiotherapy (PT) and the control group received 45 min of PT every day for 4 weeks. The laboratory's next step was the HapticWalker, a robotic walking simulator with freely programmable <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> so that patients can, for example, additionally train for stair climbing and perturbations. The <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> can be operated in full guidance or compliance control modes, thus reducing foot support according to the patient's learning success. For the severely affected upper limb, the laboratory's computerized arm trainer, called the Bi-Manu-Track, enables bilateral practice of forearm pronation/supination and wrist flexion/extension. Compared with electrical stimulation of the paretic wrist extensors, acute stroke patients with severe arm paresis (n = 44) had significantly more upper-limb muscle strength and control {{at the end of the}} 6 -week intervention period and at follow-up.

40|$|Background: In spastic {{cerebral}} palsy (SCP), a {{limited range of}} motion of the foot (ROM), limits gait and other activities. Assessment of this limitation of ROM and knowledge of active mechanisms is of crucial importance for clinical treatment. Methods. For a comparison between spastic {{cerebral palsy}} (SCP) children and typically developing children (TD), medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon complex length was assessed using 3 -D ultrasound imaging techniques, while exerting externally standardized moments via a hand-held dynamometer. Exemplary X-ray imaging of ankle and foot was used to confirm possible TD-SCP differences in foot deformation. Results: SCP and TD {{did not differ in}} normalized level of excitation (EMG) of muscles studied. For given moments exerted in SCP, <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angles were all more towards plantar flexion than in TD. However, <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle proved to be an invalid estimator of talocrural joint angle, since at equal <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angles, GM muscle-tendon complex was shorter in SCP (corresponding to an equivalent of 1 cm). A substantial difference remained even after normalizing for individual differences in tibia length. X-ray imaging of ankle and foot of one SCP child and two typically developed adults, confirmed that in SCP that of total footplate angle changes (0 - 4 Nm: 15 °), the contribution of foot deformation to changes in <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle (8) were as big as the contribution of dorsal flexion at the talocrural joint (7 °). In typically developed individuals there were relatively smaller contributions (10 - 11 %) by foot deformation to changes in <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle, indicating that the contribution of talocrural angle changes was most important. Using a new estimate for position at the talocrural joint (the difference between GM muscle-tendon complex length and tibia length, GM relative length) removed this effect, thus allowing more fair comparison of SCP and TD data. On the basis of analysis of <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle and GM relative length as a function of externally applied moments, it is concluded that <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle measurements underestimate angular changes at the talocrural joint when moving in dorsal flexion direction and overestimate them when moving in plantar flexion direction, with concomitant effects on triceps surae lengths. Conclusions: In SCP children diagnosed with decreased dorsal ROM of the ankle joint, the commonly used measure (i. e. range of <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle), is not a good estimate of rotation at the talocrural joint. since a sizable part of the movement of the foot (or <b>foot</b> <b>plate)</b> derives from internal deformation of the foot. © 2013 Huijing et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

Complete and harmonius development occurs in the intraocular grafts. Experimental exchanges of tissues between the two hair-bearing regions indicated that epithelium from the snout and dorsum can participate with homologous and heterologous follicle-bearing mesoderm to produce hair follicles.

In response, some players who use electric wheelchairs attach a flat metal or wooden panel to the front of their <b>foot</b> <b>plates.</b> This measure both prevents the ball on sliding underneath the chair during play (a common problem), and also gives the player a flat surface when making contact with the ball.

40|$|Careful {{diagnosis}} of ankle joints with suspected ligamentous trauma {{is necessary to}} decide on adequate therapy. Accurate 3 D stress test techniques can assist in diagnosis. However, the devices used to stress the foot relative to the lower leg are inapt for clinical application as they are not ergonomical. The goal was to present and to evaluate a newly designed 3 D <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> intended {{to fulfill the requirements}} of its users. Criteria on functionality included position and fixation of the foot in extreme positions relative to the lower leg; and compatibility with imaging systems. Criteria on usability included the operator having a sense of control, application for 95 % of an adult human population, and operation within 100 s with low mental and physical effort. The design was based on a Stewart platform. Preliminary assessment of the 3 D <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> performed with CT-scans of 4 subjects showed that an extreme foot position could be reached repeatedly within 6 degrees. The remainder of evaluation was focused was on ergonomic assessment. The prototype can reach all extreme foot positions for adults with varying anthropometric dimensions. A usability test was performed with 20 radiology technicians who were asked to perform four tasks with the prototype. All radiology technicians surveyed agreed that the device can be operated by one person with minor physical and mental effort (NASA XLT median 3. 5 - 11 %). The tasks were executed with a median time of 91 s(20 - 513 s) and a median error of 0 (0 - 6). The 3 D <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> fulfills the majority of criteria and is well-received by the intended users. Relevance to industry: This study shows how a multidisciplinary approach (engineering, ergonomics, radiology and imaging) can contribute to the design of an industrial product for improved clinical diagnosis and preoperative planning, while taking into account the specific clinical working environment.
