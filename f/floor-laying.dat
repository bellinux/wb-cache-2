40|$|More work-related {{injuries}} and problems {{occur in the}} construction industry than in other industries, particularly with regard to musculoskeletal disorders. One reason might be that the industry is organized around projects that lead to short-term benefits and does not stimulate innovations that will reduce injuries in the future. In this article, we present the findings from a survey performed in Sweden among 50 <b>floor-laying</b> companies. The results indicate that short-term income revenues override concerns over the long-term risks of {{injuries and}} employees leaving the profession as a result of those injuries.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 6000 layer-type pullet chicks were fed either a low protein (9. 1 %) or a high protein (15. 4 %) diet from 8 through 18 {{weeks of the}} growing period in two experiments. All chicks were fed a {{commercial}} starter for the first 8 weeks and the high protein diet from 18 to 21 weeks of age. All chicks were grown in floor pens and were supplied feed and water ad libitum throughout the growing trial. They were placed in either a cage- or <b>floor-laying</b> house and fed a commercial layer diet for 12 periods of 28 days each. The experiment was repeated in the sub-sequent year. The low protein regimen was found to produce a smaller pullet, delay sexual maturity, delay production peaks, and maintain higher levels of production {{near the end of}} the laying period. Pullets fed the low protein grower diet had higher mortality during the growing period, greater feed intake during the laying period, eggs with higher Haugh unit values, and reduced egg production in the laying house.

40|$|Certain easily {{perceived}} criteria {{help identify}} the laying hen—large, bright-red combs and wattles, for example. Also, the pubic bones are spread wide and are flexible; the vent is relatively large. How-ever, some hens show ail thèse traits, yet never lay an egg (Cole and Hutt, 1953). Thèse hens often ovulate into the ab-dominal cavity where the yolks are re-sorbed. They also show bleaching of the pigment {{from the body}} that is typical of a laying hen, as illustrated by Urban and Goodwin (1953). The need for a more accurate method of identifying the non-layer is obvious. For positive identification a trap-nest or indi-vidual cage is required. But even the trap-nest may be inaccurate {{to the extent that}} <b>floor-laying</b> exists. In some cases non-layers hâve abnormal oviducts that can be detected by examination of the exposed oviduct orifices. The oviduct is exposed {{in the same manner as}} is used in artifkial insémination, as described by Burrows andQuinn (1939). The cloaca of ovulating non-laying hens may be easily everted, whereas non-ovulating and non-laying hens are difficult to open. The color and size of the orifice may also be used to détermine if a hen is laying. During an investigation of hematocrit values of the blood, it was noticed that non-laying hens had darker yellow plasma than layers. This color is largely due to a carotenoid pigment—xanthophyll. This suggested the possibility of using a "blood test " for the non-laying hen. One ml. of sérum was added to 15 ml. of acétone; this précipita ted the proteins. The acétone extract was filtered and the light absorbance (optical density) read with a Beckman spectrophotometer Model B at 445 m/i wave length, which is one of the peaks of xanthophyll absorption.
