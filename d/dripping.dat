50|$|The {{story of}} the sandwich's {{invention}} by Philippe's has several variants: some sources {{say that it was}} first created by a cook or a server who, while preparing a sandwich for a police officer or fireman, accidentally dropped it into a pan of meat <b>drippings.</b> The patron liked it, and the dish surged in popularity shortly after its invention. Other accounts say that a customer who didn't want some meat <b>drippings</b> to go to waste requested his sandwich be dipped in them. Still others say that a chef dipped a sandwich into a pan of meat <b>drippings</b> after a customer complained that the bread was stale. Cole's account states that the sandwich was invented by a sympathetic chef, Jack Garlinghouse, for a customer who was complaining of sore gums. Some accounts tell Philippe's version of events, but assign the location to Cole's. The mystery of the sandwich's invention might not be solved {{due to a lack of}} information and observable evidence.|$|R

5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above the other at {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening {{in the form of}} a 'jade dragon's neck'.

On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E

They are medium thick and often resemble a thin tomato soup. [...] They penetrate the meat easily rather than sit on top.

After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment.

5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his <b>dripping</b> blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen <b>dripping</b> out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} when Tetsuya Mizuguchi asked Masahiro Sakurai {{to make a}} falling block puzzle. Believing that the genre had not evolved since Tetris Attack (1995), Sakurai {{came up with the}} idea of having the blocks fall and shooting back up. The game's prototype was created in three days by a designer, a programmer, and a graphic artist. It was inspired by the TV series 24, the film The Matrix, and the Missile Command game. According to Mizuguchi, 24 camera work and the beginning of The Matrix (with <b>dripping,</b> green computer code) were the basis of the puzzle-game concept. In a Famitsu interview, Sakurai said that the opening CG video explaining its backstory was added to provide a sense of the game's world.|$|E
