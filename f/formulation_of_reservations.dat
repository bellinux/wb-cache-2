At the same time the study, also focus on the factors responsible for their unemployment along with the suggestions for improvement in the present status. To explore all these ideas four objectives are framed along with same number of research questions. After a critical analysis we find that the present policies and issues made by the government are praise worthy but the implementation level is not at all fruitful in the grass root level. For that we have made some suggestions for up-gradation of the present situation for tribals like: strict implementation <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> seats in public sector employment, proper looking into <b>reservation</b> <b>of</b> seats in institutions <b>of</b> higher learning, <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> proper welfare schemes for prosperity of tribals based on fact data, in private sector also these should be reservations for schedule tribes. The present 7. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> for government services should be increased whenever necessary...|$|R
40|$|Reservation {{policy is}} an {{extremely}} contentious topic in Indian politics. Proponents claim that a policy of positive discrimination {{is the only way}} to rectify the past injus-tices against India’s poor. Opponents claim that reservation policy creates perverse incentives that strengthen traditional caste boundaries and encourage backwardness. Despite vocal advocates on both sides of the issue, there is little empirical data on the actual effects <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy. This thesis provides theoretical and quantitative evidence on the unintended consequences <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy. I develop and estimate a model of marriage choice in the presence <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> on the persistence of caste identity. I conclude that different effects <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> encourage both exogamy and endogamy along different dimensions, but the net impact <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> policy favors exogamy. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{question}} of the legality <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> to international human rights treaties. The evolution <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> law demonstrates that the system seek to promote universal adherence to multilateral treaties through flexible rules that reflects the superiority of national sovereignty in the international society. However, the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>reservation</b> law as codified in the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties has facilitated wide acceptance of multilateral treaties at the cost of their integrity. In the case of human rights treaties, this issue is of paramount importance considering the essentiality of a balance between integrity and universality for human rights norms. There is an urgent necessity to promote adequate reforms of the Vienna Convention system and rely on human rights treaty bodies’ competence and jurisdiction to review the validity <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> and ensure that universality and integrity are equally respected...|$|R
