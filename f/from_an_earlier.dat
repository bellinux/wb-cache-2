5|$|When {{discussing}} chess {{history from}} the 1850s onwards, commentators have debated whether Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> time, perhaps as early as 1866. Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894, and lost a rematch in 1896–97.|$|E
5|$|A thermæ and caravanserai of {{the same}} period were also found, and {{is similar to the}} thermæ at Ashkelon and others in the nearby country. A row of rooms <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier,</b> 1st century BCE to 1st century CE {{fortress}} revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan {{was with}} trumpeter Harry Edison in 1959–60, and tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins in 1961–62, {{including}} a UK tour. In this period, Flanagan recorded albums for several leaders <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> era, including Lionel Hampton, Jo Jones, and Pee Wee Russell, {{as well as}} one with Edison and around 10 with Hawkins. Flanagan then played with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Percy Heath as a trio in New York.|$|E
5|$|Oasis evolved <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> {{band called}} the Rain, {{composed}} of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam {{suggested that the}} band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster that hung in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.|$|E

5|$|The 1913 {{edition of}} the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several {{separate}} accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or so-called Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, {{but it was so}} damaged by fire that it is useless. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript, or that both parts originated <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> version of Seaxburh's Life.|$|E
5|$|The Hetumoger {{confederation}} {{was under}} a dual leadership, according to Ibn Rusta and Gardizi (two Muslim scholars from the 10th and 11thcenturies, respectively, whose geographical books preserved texts <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> work written by Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani from Bukhara). The Hungarians' nominal or sacred leader was styled kende, while their military commander bore the title gyula. The same authors add that the gyula commanded an army of 20,000 horsemen, but the reliability of this number is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The name Dunster derives <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> name Torre ("tor, rocky hill"), {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book written twenty years after the Norman conquest. The origin of the prefix is uncertain, although it may well refer to Dunn, a Saxon noble who held land in nearby Elworthy and Willett before the conquest, giving Dunestore meaning Dunn's craggy hill.|$|E

5|$|The short was {{released}} on the home media release of Iron Man 3, and was received positively by critics and the audience <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> screening at San Diego Comic-Con.

5|$|Æthelnoth (died 1038) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Descended <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to {{becoming}} archbishop. While archbishop, he travelled to Rome {{and brought back}} saint's relics. He consecrated {{a number of other}} bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, there is little evidence of his veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains a number of software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> saved game can be enough to get past them. There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{in their}} 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever argued that there is a conflict between these two groups.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{seems to}} have been on good terms with the West Saxons: he stood as sponsor to the baptism of their king, Cynegils, and married Cynegils' daughter. Her name is {{reported}} by only one source, Reginald of Durham's 12th century Vita S. Oswaldi, which says that it was Kyneburga. Although Oswald had one known son, Æthelwald, it is uncertain whether this was a son from his marriage to Cynegils' daughter or <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> relationshipsince Æthelwald began ruling in Deira in 651, {{it has been argued that}} a son from this marriage would have been too young at the time to be trusted with this position, and therefore may have been older, the product of a relationship Oswald had during his exile.|$|E
5|$|The Stretford Pageant is {{an annual}} Rose Queen festival {{held on the}} last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a {{procession}} of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in the park {{on the day of}} the pageant, such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.|$|E
