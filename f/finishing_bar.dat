40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the results of theoretical investigations of the process of rolling reinforcement bars designed for concrete reinforcement. In the investigation. particular consideration was given to the analysis of the effect of pre-finished band shape on the formation of ribs on the <b>finished</b> <b>bar</b> in the <b>finished</b> pass. Design/methodology/approach: Using the numerical modelling to rolling process of the reinforcement <b>bars</b> in a <b>finished</b> pass to define rolling parameters. The simulations of the ribbed bar rolling were carried out using the Forge 2005 ® software. Findings: It has been performed in order to define the specific features of the mode of metal flow in the roll gap and to determine the effect of the shape and dimensions of the feedstock oval on the height of the ribs and on the thickness of surface layer of the <b>finished</b> <b>bar.</b> Research limitations/implications: The use of commercial software applications in the design of process technologies will allow for the development of reinforcement bars rolling technology with a minimum number of laboratory and industrial trials. Practical implications: Reinforcement bars are chiefly used in the building industry at production of reinforced concrete constructions. and as working elements in bridge building. Originality/value: Production of the reinforcement bars is very difficult. One from many problems during production the bars is rolling in the finished pass.

40|$|Technology {{of round}} bars rolling on a three-high skew rolling mills allows rolling of {{standard}} {{materials such as}} steel and aluminum, {{as well as new}} materials, especially hard deformable materials. The paper presents the results of theoretical and experimental rolling process of aluminum bars with a diameter of 20 mm. As the stock round bars with a diameter of 25 mm made of aluminum grade 1050 A and aluminum alloy grade 2017 A were used. The rolling process of aluminum bars has been carried out in a single pass. The numerical analysis was carried out by using computer program Forge 2011 ®. On the basis of theoretical research it has been determined the state of deformation, stress and temperature distribution during rolling of aluminum bars. In addition, the results of theoretical research allowed to determine the schema of the metal plastic flow in the roll gap. Verification of the theoretical research was carried out during the rolling of aluminum bars on the RSP 40 / 14 laboratory three-high skew rolling mill. From the <b>finished</b> <b>bars</b> were taken the samples to set the shape and compared with the results of theoretical research. <b>Finished</b> aluminum round <b>bars</b> were characterized by low ovality and good surface quality...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To use {{metallographic}} {{analysis to}} evaluate the quality of Co-Cr and Ti CP alloy casting processes routinely used in dentures with ferrule attachment to implants. Methods: An aluminum base simulating a mandible was machined, onto which prototype wax patterns were sculped, consisting of eight bars, measuring 3 mm in diameter with an extension of 6 cm. Four Ti bars were cast by the voltaic arch technique and four of Co-Cr alloy by the gas and air technique using a blowtorch. The eight <b>finished</b> <b>bars</b> were cut, embedded in resin for metallographic analysis, and were then called test specimens (TS). They were analyzed by the naked eye and macrographically at 100 X magnification using electronic microscopy. Results: The analysis result showed that the four titanium castings {{with the use of}} voltaic arch presented defects such as voids, cracks, porosities and slags. The four bars cast with Co-Cr by the gas and air technique using the blowtorch were shown to be satisfactory, even with the presence of dendritic microstructure. Conclusion: It was concluded that the lack of quality observed in these laboratory processes is due to both the low learning curve of the technicians and possible defects in the equipment used...|$|R
