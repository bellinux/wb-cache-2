50|$|Incidences in most endemic {{areas are}} circa 0.5 per 100,000 population, with {{occasional}} local areas attaining {{as high as}} 12 per 100,000. Most Canadian data fit this picture. In Ontario, Canada, considering both endemic and non-endemic areas, the overall incidence is around 0.3 cases per 100,000; northern Ontario, mostly endemic, has 2.44 per 100,000. Manitoba is calculated at 0.62 cases per 100,000. Remarkably higher incidences were shown for the Kenora, Ontario region: 117 per 100,000 overall, with aboriginal reserve communities experiencing 404.9 per 100,000. In the United States, the incidence of blastomycosis is similarly high in <b>hyperendemic</b> areas. For example, the city of Eagle River, Vilas County, Wisconsin, which has an incidence rate of 101.3 per 100,000; the county {{as a whole has}} been shown in two successive studies to have an incidence of ca. 40 cases per 100,000. An incidence of 277 per 100,000 was roughly calculated based on 9 cases seen in a Wisconsin aboriginal reservation during a time in which extensive excavation was done for new housing construction. The new case rates are greater in northern states such as Wisconsin, where from 1986 to 1995 there were 1.4 cases per 100,000 people.|$|E
50|$|Cosa {{appears to}} have been {{affected}} by an earthquake in 51, which occasioned the reconstruction of the republican Basilica as an Odeon under the supervision of Lucius Titinius Glaucus Lucretianus, who also worked on the Capitoline temple; however, as early as 80, Cosa seems to have been almost deserted. It was revived under the emperor Caracalla, during whose reign was built the portico around the forum, concealing two large granaries, while the odeon were restored, a Mithraeum was constructed {{in the basement of the}} Curia, and a sanctuary to Liber erected at the southeast end of the Forum. The new town did not last long, however, and by the 4th century only the sanctuary of Liber was periodically visited. In the early 6th century some occupation in the ruins is attested by pottery and the remains of a church have been found built onto the Basilica. Perhaps at the same time the Arx was occupied by a fortified farm, subsequently transformed into a small fortified outpost under Byzantine control. This was abandoned in the late 6th or early 7th century. It is possible that the intermittent nature of the occupation of the town was due to the fact that, already in the early Empire, malaria was <b>hyperendemic</b> on the coast of Tuscany.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{developing}} profile of urban and other domestic blastomycosis cases, beginning with an outbreak tentatively attributed to construction dust in Westmont, Illinois. The city of Rockford, Illinois, was also documented as a <b>hyperendemic</b> area based on incidence rates as high as 6.67 per 100,000 population for {{some areas of the}} city. Though proximity to open watersheds was linked to incidence in some areas, suggesting that outdoor activity within the city may be connected to many cases, there is also an increasing body of evidence that even the interiors of buildings may be risk areas. An early case concerned a prisoner who was confined to prison during the whole of his likely blastomycotic incubation period. An epidemiological survey found that although many patients who contracted blastomycosis had engaged in fishing, hunting, gardening, outdoor work and excavation, the most strongly linked association in patients was living or visiting near waterways. Based on a similar finding in a Louisiana study, {{it has been suggested that}} place of residence might be the most important single factor in blastomycosis epidemiology in north central Wisconsin. Follow-up epidemiological and case studies indicated that clusters of cases were often associated with particular domiciles, often spread out over a period of years, and that there were uncommon but regularly occurring cases in which pets kept mostly or entirely indoors, in particular cats, contracted blastomycosis. The occurrence of blastomycosis, then, is an issue strongly linked to housing and domestic circumstances.|$|E
50|$|In 1949 Allison {{participated in}} a {{vocational}} Oxford University Expedition to Mount Kenya. He took up the task of collecting blood samples from Kenyans for analyses of blood groups and genetic markers such as for sickle-cell disease. At {{the time it was}} a scientific puzzle that the disease was prevalent even though it killed people before they reached puberty, before they can have children to pass on the lethal gene. He found that the prevalence of sickle-cell trait (heterozygous condition) among people inhabiting coastal areas was higher than 20%. (At the time the highest record was 8% among African-Americans.) He was posed with the question as to why such a deadly disease (in homozygous condition) would be more prevalent in a localised area {{in the form of a}} less lethal heterozygous form. He formulated a hypothesis that it was because it had selective advantage towards malaria. Because the region was malaria endemic, acquiring a genetic mutation, but not the lethal form, could confer resistance to Plasmodium falciparum. To test his hypothesis he had to wait four years until he completed his medical course. He returned to Nairobi in 1953 to start his experiments. He selected volunteers of the Luo people, who came from malaria <b>hyperendemic</b> area around Lake Victoria. Under experimental infection, volunteers indicated partial resistance to malaria. Then he found children naturally infected with malaria in Buganda. He discovered that children with heterozygous trait had significantly low number of parasites in their blood. This implies further that heterozygosity in children acquired better survival rate against malaria. His final results reported in 1954 from nearly 5,000 East Africans indicated the overall picture: sickle-cell trait confers resistance to malaria.|$|E

Epidemiological contexts were defined as endemic (wet season, no epidemic), <b>hyperendemic</b> (dry season, no epidemic), and epidemic (dry season, epidemic). Eight studies reporting a total of eighty pairs of serogroup-specific meningococcal meningitis incidence and carriage estimates were included in this review. For serogroup A, changes associated with the transition from endemic to <b>hyperendemic</b> incidence and from <b>hyperendemic</b> to epidemic incidence were 15 -fold and 120 -fold respectively. Changes in carriage prevalence associated with both transitions were 1 -fold and 30 -fold respectively.  For serogroup W and X, the transition from endemic to <b>hyperendemic</b> incidence involved a 4 -fold and 1 • 1 -fold increase respectively. Increases in carriage prevalence for the later transition were 7 -fold and 1 • 7 -fold respectively. No data were available for the hyperendemic-epidemic transition for these serogroups. Our findings suggested that the regular seasonal variation in serogroup A meningococcal meningitis incidence between the rainy and the dry season could be mainly driven by seasonal change in the ratio of clinical cases to subclinical infections. In contrast appearance of epidemic incidences is related to {{a substantial increase in}} transmission and colonisation and to lesser extent with changes in the case-carrier ratio. Seasonal change in the rate of progression to disease given carriage together with variations in frequency of carriage transmission should be considered in models attempting to capture the epidemiology of meningococcal meningitis and mainly to predict meningitis epidemics in the African meningitis belt...|$|E
40|$|Background: More than 200, 000 {{new cases}} of leprosy were {{reported}} by 105 countries in 2011. The disease is a public health problem in Brazil, particularly within high-burden pockets in the Amazon region where leprosy is <b>hyperendemic</b> among children. Methodology: We applied geographic information systems and spatial analysis to determine the spatio-temporal pattern of leprosy cases in a <b>hyperendemic</b> municipality of the Brazilian Amazon region (Castanhal). Moreover, we performed active surveillance to collect clinical, epidemiological and serological data of the household contacts of people affected by leprosy and school children in the general population. The occurrence of subclinical infection and overt disease among the evaluated individuals was correlated with the spatio-temporal pattern of leprosy. Principal Findings: The pattern of leprosy cases showed significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity (p, 0. 01). Considering 499 mapped cases, we found spatial clusters {{of high and low}} detection rates and spatial autocorrelation of individual cases at fine spatio-temporal scales. The relative risk of contracting leprosy in one specific cluster with a high detection rate is almost four times the risk in the areas of low detection rate (RR = 3. 86; 95 % CI = 2. 26 – 6. 59; p, 0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is {{a global}} {{parasitic}} zoonosis caused by the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus. The disease is <b>hyperendemic</b> in western China because of poor economic development; limited community knowledge of CHD; widespread, small-scale household animal production; home killing of livestock; and the feeding of dogs with uncooked offal. Methodology/Principal Findings: A control program focusing on monthly praziquantel (PZQ) treatment of all registered dogs and culling unwanted and stray dogs {{has been designed to}} control CHD in <b>hyperendemic</b> areas in China. A pilot field control project in two counties (Hutubi and Wensu) in Xinjiang, China showed that after 4 years of treatment, the prevalence of dogs with E. granulosus was reduced from 14. 7 % and 18. 6 %, respectively, to 0 %, and this caused a 90 %– 100 % decrease of CHD in sheep born after commencement of the control program. Conclusions/Significance: The strategy aimed at preventing eggs being released from dogs into the environment by treating animals before adult tapeworms are patent can decrease E. granulosus transmission and considerably reduce <b>hyperendemic</b> CHD. Monthly treatment of dogs with PZQ and culling unwanted and stray dogs {{have been shown to be}} an efficient, highly cost-effective and practicable measure for implementation in rural communities.

40|$|Backround. Despite {{consistently}} meeting international {{performance targets}} for tuberculosis case detection and treatment success, areas where tuberculosis is <b>hyperendemic</b> fail {{to achieve the}} predicted epidemiological impact. In this article, we explore the anomalous relationship between defined performance targets and actual reduction in tuberculosis transmission. Methods. In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, poorly ventilated social gathering places such as shebeens (informal alcohol drinking places), minibus taxis, and clinic waiting rooms are all potential transmission hot spots. We modeled the transmission reduction achieved by removal of infectious persons in settings with different tuberculosis prevalence rates to demonstrate the concept of transmission elasticity. We then applied this concept to real-life data from a <b>hyperendemic</b> community in Cape Town, South Africa. Results. In a <b>hyperendemic</b> area, {{reducing the number of}} infectious people by a given percentage results in a smaller percentage decrease in the annual risk of infection (ARI) compared with a nonendemic area; for example, removing 10 % of infectious persons could result in as little as a 5 % reduction in the ARI. With use of real-life data and removal of 60 % of infectious individuals with tuberculosis, as would be achieved by meeting current performance targets of 70 % case detection and 85 % cure, the estimated ARI reduction is 50 %.

40|$|Abstract. Coprologic {{surveys were}} carried out in villages of the Behera Governorate in the Nile Delta region of Egypt to {{characterize}} the epidemiologic features of human fascioliasis caused by Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica in this lowland endemic area by comparison with fascioliasis caused by only F. hepatica in areas <b>hyperendemic</b> for human disease in the Andean highlands of South America. The fascioliasis prevalences detected (range 5. 2 − 19. 0 %, mean 12. 8 %) are the highest obtained in Egypt. The comparison with previous results suggests that in the Nile Delta, fascioliasis is spreading from an original situation of sporadic human cases in well-known endemic foci for animal disease to an endemic distribution in humans, which may be characterized as a mesoendemic region that includes several <b>hyperendemic</b> areas for human disease. As in Andean countries, a relationship with sex was found, although in Egypt prevalences, but not intensities, appeared to be significantly higher in females. All ages appear to be susceptible to liver fluke infection, with prevalences and intensities being lower before and after school age, {{a situation that is}} consistent with that detected in Andean countries, although the peak in the 9 − 11 -year-old age group appears less pronounced in Egypt.
