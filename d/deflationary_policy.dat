50|$|After {{the stock}} market crash in the United States in 1929, the Czechoslovakian economy {{followed}} suit and entered a depression. The Central Bank originally followed a deflationary monetary policy, which exacerbated the problems. Furthermore, the Central bank created a currency crisis by eliminating the ability to convert currency into gold and competitive devaluation. The perceived harm that The National Bank of Czechoslovakia was causing created social discontent.

Ultimately, the gold standard was abolished and the Ministry of Finance was deemed incapable of solving the economic problems at that time.
