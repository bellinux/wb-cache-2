The combination of the shunting arc and the negative pulse voltage applied to target is promising for plasma-based ion implantation and deposition for metallic or semimetallic three-dimensional materials. The delay time, which {{is defined as the}} time between the start of the arc current and applying the pulse voltage, was varied.
