50|$|Any of the {{following}} commands usually cause the modem to hang up and terminate a voice call: AT+VLS=0, AT#VLS=0, ATH, ATZ. Dropping the RS232 DTR (<b>data</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>ready)</b> signal often accomplishes this as well. The modem remains in voice mode (except {{in the case of}} ATZ).|$|E
50|$|DECserver 300The DECserver 300 Terminal Server was an Ethernet Communications Server for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{providing}} a convenient method to logically connect up to sixteen digital asynchronous terminals {{to one or}} more service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. The DECserver 300 used MMJs (Modified Modular Jacks) for the attachment of asynchronous devices. The MMJ segregated a Data from a Voice connection. The DECserver 300 utilized the EIA 423-A electrical interface standard for local connections. EIA 423-A is compatible with the EIA 232-D interface and supports DTR/DSR (<b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> Ready/Data Set <b>Ready)</b> signals. EIA 423-A supports longer cable runs and higher signaling speeds. The DECserver 300 implemented the LAT protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. The DECserver 300 also implemented the TCP/IP protocol suite for communication with host systems that implemented TCP/IP.|$|R

The system essentially includes a preselected number of <b>data</b> <b>terminals</b> which are each adapted to convert data words of decimal form to another form, i. e., binary, usable with the computer. Each <b>data</b> <b>terminal</b> may {{take the form of a}} keyboard unit having a number of depressable buttons or switches corresponding to selected data digits and/or function digits. A bank of data buffers, one of which is associated with each <b>data</b> <b>terminal,</b> is provided as a temporary storage. <b>Data</b> from the <b>terminals</b> is applied to the data buffers on a digit by digit basis for transfer via a multiplexer to the computer...|$|R
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Ready</b> (DTR) is {{a control}} signal in RS-232 serial communications, {{transmitted}} from data terminal equipment (DTE), {{such as a}} computer, to data communications equipment (DCE), for example a modem, {{to indicate that the}} terminal is ready for communications and the modem may initiate a communications channel.|$|E

50|$|The modem {{interprets the}} <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Ready</b> (DTR) pin {{as a signal}} from the {{computer}} to know when it wants to terminate a call. DTR is a signal from the computer to the modem. The computer keeps DTR high at all times until it wants to terminate a call, at which time the computer lowers DTR {{for a second or}} two. The computer also keeps DTR low when no programs are running that want to use the modem - this keeps the modem from answering calls due to auto-answer or otherwise doing something unexpected or undesired. The computer may safely assume that after DTR has been brought low for a couple seconds, that the modem will be in command mode.|$|E
5000|$|The RS-232 {{standard}} {{defines the}} voltage levels {{that correspond to}} logical one and logical zero levels for the data transmission and the control signal lines. Valid signals are either {{in the range of}} +3 to +15 volts or the range −3 to −15 volts with respect to the [...] "Common Ground" [...] (GND) pin; consequently, the range between −3 to +3 volts is not a valid RS-232 level. For data transmission lines (TxD, RxD, and their secondary channel equivalents), logic one is defined as a negative voltage, the signal condition is called [...] "mark". Logic zero is positive and the signal condition is termed [...] "space". Control signals have the opposite polarity: the asserted or active state is positive voltage and the deasserted or inactive state is negative voltage. Examples of control lines include request to send (RTS), clear to send (CTS), <b>data</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>ready</b> (DTR), and data set ready (DSR).|$|E
