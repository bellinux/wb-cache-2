50|$|US Patent # 1,660,922 - <b>Flushing</b> <b>Apparatus</b> for Water Closet. Application filed May 10, 1927; Patent {{issued to}} Executors of Philip Haas Estate February 28, 1928.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth in}} {{population}} {{and of the}} economy of Hong Kong has caused {{a significant increase in}} the demand for fresh water. To secure sufficient water supply and to reduce reliance on imported water from Dongjiang (East River) in Mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government has implemented a wide range of water conservation measures which include the use of seawater for toilet flushing, metering and a tiered water tariff, large-scale replacement and rehabilitation of ageing pipelines to reduce leakage, valve-type toilet <b>flushing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and education and publicity programmes. To ensure sustainable and safe water supply, the HKSAR government is actively exploring alternative water resources including the treated effluent from sewage treatment plant, desalination of seawater and the extension of water-gathering grounds in the territory.

40|$|Optical-emission spectrometric {{apparatus}} used {{to monitor}} variable-polarity plasma arc welding of aluminum alloys. Spectrometer incorporated into control system to ensure quality of weld because in keyhole, arc fully penetrates weld joint and impurities <b>flushed</b> out. <b>Apparatus</b> helps ensure high quality of weld by monitoring such contaminants as oxygen and hydrogen in shield gas, detecting inadequate flow of shield gas, and sensing changes in temperature of arc with changes in arc current and voltage...|$|R
50|$|Laboratory hydrogenolysis is operationally {{similar to}} hydrogenation, {{and may be}} {{accomplished}} at atmospheric pressure by stirring the reaction mixture under a slight positive pressure of hydrogen gas, having <b>flushed</b> the <b>apparatus</b> with more of this gas. The hydrogen may be provided by attaching a balloon to a needle, filling it from a bottle, and inserting the needle into the reaction flask via a rubber septum. At high pressure, a hydrogenation autoclave (i.e., a Parr hydrogenator) or similar piece of equipment is required.|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{industries}} of the Zebo region (China) include the petrochemical, pharmaceutical, china and ceramics sectors. Zibo is also abundant in natural resources. In support of the ceramics industry, they have large reserves of clay, limestone and bauxite. Consequently, {{there are a number}} of mines in the region and the outflow of acidic water from these metal and coal mines, known as acid mine drainage (AMD), is considerable. The AMD is rich in sulphate ions and contains other pollutants that are subsequently transferred to the soils and surrounding surface rivers through both irrigation and infiltration of the ground water. To understand the behaviour of the soil in the presence of infiltrating pollutants and atmospheric precipitation, soil-column experiments were performed. A chosen soil sample was undisturbed in the sense that the structure of the soil layers and any pollutants within the column were preserved when the soil was transferred to the experimental apparatus. To simulate the processes that occur within the environment (infiltration and precipitation), polluted water (liquor) from a nearby source was introduced at the top of the column and once this material has infiltrated the column, clean water was allowed to <b>flush</b> through the <b>apparatus.</b> The initial concentration of various ions in the liquor were measured and throughout the experiment, the fluid that reaches the bottom of the column was collected and analysed. The goal for the workshop is to derive a mathematical model that predicts the observed experimental time dependence of the ionic concentrations emerging from the bottom of the the apparatus. Developing the model will require an understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms of the solute transport though the soil. This is an important first step in the eventual development of remediation schemes for the contaminated soil...|$|R
