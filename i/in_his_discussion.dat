25|$|Bultmann's {{analysis}} is still widely applied in German-speaking countries, although with many corrections and discussions. Wide-ranging replies {{have been made}} to this analysis. Today, most Christian exegetes reject much of Bultmann's theory, but accept certain of his intuitions. For instance, J. Blank uses Bultmann <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of the Last Judgment and W. Thüsing uses him to discuss the elevation and glorification of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Lévi's Baphomet is {{the source}} of the later Tarot image of the Devil in the Rider-Waite design. The concept of a downward-pointing pentagram on its {{forehead}} was enlarged upon by Lévi <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the microcosmic man arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book La Clef de la Magie Noire by Stanislas de Guaita. It was this image that was later adopted as the official symbol—called the Sigil of Baphomet—of the Church of Satan, and continues to be used among Satanists.|$|E
25|$|Bernard Lewis has {{cited the}} Greek philosopher Aristotle who, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of slavery, stated that while Greeks are free by nature, 'barbarians' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, {{in that it}} is in their nature to be more willing to submit to despotic government. Though Aristotle does not specify any {{particular}} races, he argues that people from outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from Greece. While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body. This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist Benjamin Isaac.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, the {{connection}} between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat {{is a form of}} energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.|$|E

500|$|But {{difficulties}} remain. Bailey, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of ġē names, {{has pointed}} out that Ely would be anomalous if really from ēlġē [...] "eel district", being remote from the areas where possible examples of ġē names occur, and moreover, there is no parallel for the use of a fish-name in compounds with ġē. More seriously, the usual English spelling remains Elig, even in the dative case used after many prepositions, where Elige would be expected if the second element were īġ [...] "island". This is in conflict with all the other island names which surround Ely.|$|E

50|$|The {{philosophers}} whose writings {{have made}} the greatest impact upon Ben-Ze'ev are Aristotle, Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant. Kant’s main influence is most evident in Ben Ze'ev's discussions on epistemology and perception.

500|$|Colbert {{is deeply}} self-centered and takes {{everything}} personally, a trait which is reflected <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of the news}} and current events. According to the comedian, [...] "There's nothing too large that doesn't involve him. Every news story is really about him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." [...] This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds with well-known figures such as The Decemberists, Sean Penn, Conan O'Brien, Rain, Barry Manilow, Tony Bennett, and Don Rickles (the latter three of whom beat out Colbert for Best Individual in a Variety or Music Program at the Emmys). The comedian equates these feuds with Bill O'Reilly's culture wars.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> {{of science}} and {{religion}} in the novel, John Glendening notes that both character commentary on Darwin's publications along with the epigraphs mentioning those works as direct contributor's to the novels emphasis on science superseding religion. Similarly, by quoting Marx with the first epigraph, along with multiple subsequent epigraphs, the novel directs thematic attention towards the socio-economics issues within the novel. Deborah Bowen describes literary critics struggling to find readings of the epigraphs that explore the themes of the novel, and argues that the poor relationship between the epigraphs and the text [...] "disperses {{the authority of the}} narrative voice, thus destroying his power to speak as a moralist." [...] For Bowen, the epigraphs support the satire of Victorian fiction conventions in the novel.|$|E
500|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of the film's {{relation}} to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved [...] "examination {{of the process}} of human interaction and interpersonal communication" [...] and [...] "immediately establishes [...] self-referential stance" [...] that invites the spectator [...] "to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth". For him, Alvy [...] "is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning -- or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' -- and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure." [...] Marcus Geduld cites the flashback to Alvy as a child (in a therapist's office with his mother) as an example of basic problems (poverty, discordant parents) being masked by a supposed existential crisis.|$|E

500|$|Here Sophocles {{says that}} he has {{completed}} a stage of Aeschylus' work, meaning that he went through a phase of imitating Aeschylus' style but is finished with that. Sophocles' opinion of Aeschylus was mixed. He certainly respected him enough to imitate his work early on in his career, but he had reservations about Aeschylus' style, and thus did not keep his imitation up. Sophocles' first stage, in which he imitated Aeschylus, is marked by [...] "Aeschylean pomp in the language". Sophocles' second stage was entirely his own. He introduced new ways of evoking feeling out of an audience, as in his Ajax, when Ajax is mocked by Athene, then the stage is emptied so that he may commit suicide alone. Sophocles mentions a third stage, distinct from the other two, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of his development. The third stage pays more heed to diction. His characters spoke {{in a way that was}} more natural to them and more expressive of their individual character feelings.|$|E
500|$|With Spector as his co-producer, Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for [...] "Let It Down" [...] in London {{early in the}} summer of 1970. Similar to the [...] "libidinous detour" [...] {{provided}} by [...] "I Dig Love", Leng views the inclusion of [...] "Let It Down" [...] on All Things Must Pass as [...] "a brief sensory interlude" [...] from the predominant spiritual concerns found on the album. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of the song, Inglis notes that this period coincided with heightened suspicion on Boyd's part regarding her husband's womanising, while music journalist John Harris has written of there being an element of intrigue during the All Things Must Pass sessions, through Clapton's growing infatuation with Boyd. This development was an open secret to the musicians with whom Clapton formed Derek and the Dominos at this time – his fellow Delaney & Bonnie bandmates Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon and Carl Radle – and to an apparently indifferent Harrison. Clapton sought refuge in heroin from his [...] "torment", Harris writes, while pouring his feelings for Boyd into the songs that Derek and the Dominos would soon record for their album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970).|$|E
500|$|McKenzie {{wrote that}} Tripp only {{partially}} succeeded in {{his goal of}} describing homosexuality, that his bibliography omitted basic works and included some dubious sources, and that while some of Tripp's observations were thought-provoking, others were ludicrous. He also described the book as a rambling, awkwardly written, and poorly organized anecdotal survey. Hendin called The Homosexual Matrix pseudoscience and Tripp an [...] "erudite con man" [...] who lacked impartiality and had a [...] "bias toward homosexuality". Hendin argued that Tripp saw homosexuality as superior to heterosexuality and sexual passion as dependent upon anger, mistakenly drew conclusions about heterosexuality from observations about homosexual behavior, and had a distorted view of sexual history and a negative view of women. Hendin wrote that Tripp's conclusion that homosexuality {{is not related to}} fear or anger toward women, family relationships, or a reflection of confusion over sexual identity, was baseless. His review was followed by letters of protest from the historian Martin Duberman, Pomeroy, Weinberg, and others, to which Hendin replied with a rebuttal. Cameron called Tripp [...] "vulgar" [...] and prejudiced and characterizing Tripp's evidence as [...] "largely literary." [...] Cameron criticized Tripp for treating the Kinsey Reports as authoritative, writing that they had been [...] "critically studied for almost thirty years" [...] and were out of date, for being careless <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> of history, and for focusing mainly on male homosexuality and neglecting lesbianism. Cameron was convinced by Tripp's argument that strains and tensions are necessary in a relationship to keep the partners interested in each other, and found his discussion of psychotherapy insightful.|$|E
