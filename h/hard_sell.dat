5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{released}} in Europe on November 14, 2008. It {{was published in the}} region by Rising Star Games. The game was also released in Australia on January 15, 2009. In North America, the title was published by Marvelous Entertainment USA in partnership with Xseed Games. The North American version used a different localization to the European version with further polishing performed by Xseed Games, which contributed the delay in releasing the game. Another reason for the delay was the game's unique nature, which made it a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for the company, in addition to the flagging popularity of the DS at the time. Xseed Games spent an unspecified time deliberating over whether to release it in North America at all before approving the decision. Initially scheduled for March 2009, the game eventually released in North America on June 16. In English territories, the subtitle was changed to Murder and Mystery in Paradise, while the game's original title remained intact.|$|E
25|$|Tiffany's career {{suffered}} as musical tastes {{changed in the}} early 1990s, swinging away from dance-pop and towards harder-edged rock and rap. This was shown in her third album, the urban-influenced New Inside. It was her first album away from Tobin, {{and some of her}} fans felt the new soulful, sultrier Tiffany was a <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> New Inside received mixed reviews from critics, but was successful in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The ZR-1 {{displayed}} ability both {{in terms}} of acceleration and handling capabilities, but carried with it high price. MSRP for the (375hp) ZR-1 in 1990 was $58,995, almost twice the cost of a (250hp) non-ZR-1, and had increased to $66,278 by 1995; some dealers successfully marked units as high as $100,000. Even at base MSRP, this meant that the ZR-1 was competing in the same price bracket as cars like the Porsche 964, making it a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for GM dealers.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, GM {{introduced}} a hybrid diesel-electric military (light) truck, {{equipped with a}} diesel electric and a fuel cell auxiliary power unit. Hybrid electric light trucks were introduced in 2004 by Mercedes Benz (Sprinter) and Micro-Vett SPA (Daily Bimodale). International Truck and Engine Corp. and Eaton Corp. have been selected to manufacture diesel-electric hybrid trucks for a US pilot program serving the utility industry in 2004. In mid-2005 Isuzu introduced the Elf Diesel Hybrid Truck on the Japanese Market. They claim that approximately 300 vehicles, mostly route buses are using Hinos HIMR (Hybrid Inverter Controlled Motor & Retarder) system. In 2007, high petroleum price means a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for hybrid trucks and appears the first U.S. production hybrid truck (International DuraStar Hybrid).|$|E
500|$|While filming Weir {{guiding the}} team to find the ZPM, {{the fact that she}} can see [...] "everything" [...] without looking at {{anything}} was a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> for an actor, but with Higginson's drive in her eyes, this would make the scene more believable for the audience. The scene was not written in the original script. The set for the core room in the Asuran city was the same set as Atlantis' gate room, though {{in order to make it}} look as different as possible, the cameras were placed at angles not usually used for filming in the gate room, such as where they would normally place lights.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Veronica Henry {{reviewed}} Epiphany 2.32, saying [...] "To be fair, {{this would}} be a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> as a primary desktop browser for most users. In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance where you need to fire up a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, {{one of the first things}} I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. TV Guides Matt Roush, for instance, called the show [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "offbeat", and noted how {{literally}} the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the melding of the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What do you think of Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, {{what do you think of}} Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> was the only way to get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} for a release in North America {{under the title}} Muramasa: The Demon Blade in October 2008 for a release the following year. The game was originally being published by Xseed Games, but in April 2009 they announced that they were dropping the title from their schedule. Publishing rights were transferred to Ignition Entertainment. Ignition Entertainment later explained {{that it was in}} hot competition with Xseed and Atlus to acquire the American publishing rights, and after seeing Muramasa at TGS 2008 they were encouraged to apply for the rights. The change between publishers was an internal agreement between Xseed, their parent company Marvelous USA, and Ignition. The situation was amicably resolved as Xseed already had a large number of Wii titles lined up, and giving Muramasa to another publisher allowed multiple titles not to be overlooked when it came to Western publicity. The game released in North America on September 8, 2009. The game's localization was done by external localization companies in close collaboration with Ignition Entertainment. Due to the game's strong Japanese atmosphere, it was seen as a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> in the West, but during localization a lot of work went into preserving it rather than adjusting it for Western tastes. Due to this, the game was not dubbed into English, but instead retained its Japanese voice track while text was localized. An aspect Ignition worked hard with was to make sure the localization was of good quality by working closely with their chosen localization partners. This was due to backlash received by fans and critics over the [...] "lackluster" [...] localization of Lux-Pain, which had been beyond their control during development.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key part}} of Wells Fargo's {{business}} strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products.

2500|$|In July 1999, Schutz instigated the Maverick imprint at Dark Horse Comics {{which was}} {{designed}} as an umbrella title {{for a number of}} creator-owned titles, including some already published by Dark Horse and some new to the publisher.

[...] The aim of the [...] "Maverick" [...] line was to [...] "push the medium a little bit," [...] although Schutz recognized that such titles are often a <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> To help address this, the Maverick Annual anthologies (published from 2000 as Dark Horse Maverick and later under such subtitles as Happy Endings and AutobioGraphix) placed newer creators (Farel Dalrymple, Gilbert Austin, Jason Hall, Matt Kindt) alongside the more established names of Frank Miller and Sam Kieth.|$|E

Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so [...] "through the late '80s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple." [...] Windows based IBM-PC clones also {{led to the development of}} additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM, and thus [...] "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the '80s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market." ...|$|E
