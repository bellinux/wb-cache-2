40|$|AbstractTFA-MOD {{process is}} {{expected}} to be promising for future applications since it can produce high performance YBCO coated conductors with low cost. The dip-coating is adopted as the coating process because of its simplicity and controllability of the overall film thickness. Dip-coated films have uniform thickness along longitudinal direction, but not necessary in transverse direction. In the case of thicker films, the more cracks form during processing at the thicker region near the edges generate and propagate mainly due to tensile and bending strain. So we have to suppress the thickness distribution in transverse direction for thicker films for high IC values. In this study, we found that the thickness distribution was firstly given by meniscus shape and then the solution flew down till it's dried. The solution in the center region drops more since it is slowly dried compared with the edge region. Then, we developed a drying process, which accelerates the drying by blowing hot gas to prevent the coated solutions from dropping. As a result, the thickness uniformity was improved; the thickness ratio of the thick region (edge) to the flat one (center) was improved from 1. 35 to 1. 07. Furthermore, we successfully produced ~ 1. 5 μm thick films with high critical current density values (> 2 MA/cm 2) by the new coating process including the <b>force</b> <b>drying</b> step...|$|E
40|$|Radioactive waste repositories, {{designed}} {{in accordance with}} the current UK concept, would be required to provide containment for thousands of years beneath hundreds of metres of rock. The physical processes, both geological and other processes, that might lead to migration of radionuclides are slow in comparison to human timescales — it is impractical to make an experiment of the whole system and so these systems are typically investigated through the use of numerical models. Predictive models are based on combinations of: assumptions, mathematical formulations and parameter values derived from experimental observations. The Ventilation Experiment in the Opalinus Clay at Mont Terri, Switzerland, was designed to involve geological and other physical processes that would be active during the excavation and construction phases of a repository, and with consequences for the repository performance during the operational phase. The experiment consisted of a 10 m long tunnel of 1 : 3 m diameter through which air of known relative humidity was circulated in order to <b>force</b> <b>drying</b> and re-saturation through the tunnel wall. Two such cycles over four years have been observed via installed instrumentation. Several numerical models have been constructed of the ventilation experiment by different international teams under the decovalex project using different approaches for cross-validation. Through participation in this project, a 1 D model using Richards’ Equation was developed that effectively reproduces the hydrodynamic, mechanical and conservative mass transport results. During the course of developing that model, many other domains, meshes, formulations and software versions were investigated. Now that the field scale Ventilation Experiment can be reproduced with numerical models, the findings (assumptions, formulations, parameter values, computational methods and software) would be transferable to other argillaceous formations to enable predictive modelling of similar scenarios and contribute to the safe disposal of nuclear waste and other problems involving similar geological processes. Work of this type fills the gap between laboratory scale experiments and regional scale modelling of geological systems. The gap is especially wide for low-permeability formations because the size and time-scale limitations effect the ability to make direct observations and measurements. Two particular problems were also addressed in this work: that of the use relative permeability functions and also the computational treatment of the physical interface between the tunnel domain and the rock domain. A sensitive component in many models of unsaturated flow through porous media and covering a wide variety of applications, including reservoir engineering, is the representation of permeability at an unsaturated point (kx) as a scaling of the saturated permeability (ksat) by introducing some function of the pressure head, or saturation as the relative permeability (krel) in the relation kx = ksatkrel. The choice of the particular function and its parameter values adds little {{to our understanding of the}} physical parameters. A solution is proposed to the second problem, of how to computationally represent, implement and manage the interface between two physical (i. e. spatial) domains. The scheme maps every part of the boundary of one domain onto the corresponding part of the boundary of the other domain, storing the state variables in shared memory and converting between physical components...|$|E

However, over time, defects can appear on the covering such as blistering of vinyl and rising of tiles from the surface.

The covering traps this residual moisture, thus preventing evaporation to the ambient air and gradually generates a vapour pressure underneath the covering, which can result in damage. Here, experimental results on the long-term influence of an impermeable covering on the moisture condition in concrete in normal and <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> conditions are presented.

The current standard states that impervious floor coverings should not be applied until the surface of the floor reaches a relative humidity (RH) of 75 %, established using a surface hygrometer test. Tests at Trinity College Dublin on drying concrete slabs in natural and <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> environments show that there is a large variation in the residue of moisture deep in the concrete when the floor covering is applied, particularly so in a <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> environment [1]. When an impermeable floor covering is applied tothe floor surface, this residue of moisture will gradually equilibrate and generate (over a long time) avapour pressure that can result in substantial damage to the covering, resulting in expensive repairwork. This paper presents a finite element model that predicts the changing moisture content, in terms ofthe internal RH, during drying and after the application of the floor covering as the internal RHequilibrates over time. The model accounts for the thickness of the slab, w/c ratio, environmentalconditions, boundary conditions and uses nonlinear diffusion coefficients and evaporation rates toaccurately model the moisture movement in the slab.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado en Croacia en octubre 2009. Maize {{bread is}} a {{traditional}} food in northern Spain and Portugal. Usually whole flint white, yellow or orange grain is milled and mixed with wheat or rye. Although quality parameters have not been clearly defined, density, milling test and grain health is considered important traits. One of the main handicaps for maize bread diffusion {{is the lack of}} a processing and conservation protocol that allows conservation of quality for commercialization. In this research, we tested the effects of several methods of grain drying, freezing, vacuum and storage on grain viability and quality for flour production. Environmental and genotypic factors have minor effects on grain production and quality, and the genotype x environment interaction is seldom significant. The main factor affecting grain quality and flour production is the time of storage, while freezing has very limited effects. The traditional air-drying and natural storage is adequate for flour production, although not for maintaining viable seed. An additional <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> reduces moisture and grain damage. If freezing is required for controlling insect pest, damage is reduced and grain weight slightly increased. Finally, vacuum packaging has no interesting effects.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a theoretical assessment of energy, exergy, and syngas cleaning performances in a biomass gasification {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant with varying operating parameters. The analysis {{is carried out}} using a detailed model of a biomass gasification CHP plant developed with Aspen Plus. The model describes: wood drying and gasification in a dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactor, syngas cleaning, as well as combustion in a gas engine for electricity production. Heat is recovered from the CHP system for internal needs and for district and domestic water heating. An accurate prediction of tar and inorganic contaminants is developed for proper modeling of syngas cleaning efficiency. The influence of wood moisture content, drying conditions, flow rate of the sand circulating in the DFB reactor, catalyst and scrubbing agent efficiencies, as well as additional electricity production through steam turbine on the overall process performances is studied. On the basis of the comparative analysis of nine case studies, it is found that the highest energetic efficiencies are obtained when <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> is not implemented in the CHP system. Lowering the inlet wood moisture content with natural drying (energy-free) prior to the CHP plant improves the electrical efficiency. An overall energeticefficiency of 74 % (23 % electric, 51 % thermal; based on the lower heating value of wood on anhydrous basis) is then reached with wood fed at 30 % moisture content. The best exergetic efficiency is reached when wood (naturally dried to 30 %) is dried further to 15 % by <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> in the CHP plant and when some of the high-temperature heat is recovered for electricity production via steam turbine instead of district heating.
