25|$|Thomas Scally {{stated that}} {{he was sitting in}} Alley Pond Park on Winchester Boulevard, in the borough of Queens, at dusk with a female friend when a yellow Volkswagen Beetle {{approached}} his car door to door and only three inches apart from his vehicle, which did not have its engine running. Scally kept an air gun under his seat and, as the VW approached his car, the VW driver was met with the gun pointed straight at him. At first, he appeared to be a light-skinned black male, but he also appeared to be wearing a stocking over his face. The driver of the VW quickly started his car and gunned it in reverse out of the parking lot. Scally chased the car to a point in Glen Oaks, Queens, where the driver jumped out and ran. He did not want to leave his female passenger to give chase, so he telephoned the Son of Sam <b>Hot</b> <b>Line.</b> Detective Richard Carroll from the Son of Sam Task Force (and Scally's former baseball coach) later told Scally that he had indeed seen the Son of Sam.

5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot water. Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot water temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of <b>hot</b> water <b>line</b> siphoning in open-loop hot water circulation systems which utilize the cold water line to return water back to the water heater. <b>Hot</b> Water <b>Line</b> Siphoning occurs when water from within the <b>hot</b> water <b>line</b> siphons or is forced into the cold water line due to differences in water pressure between the hot and cold water lines. Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot water out of <b>hot</b> water <b>lines</b> during cold water use. Using cold water instantly lowers the water pressure in the cold water lines, the higher water pressure in the <b>hot</b> water <b>lines</b> force water through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic crossover valves and backflow check valves (which only prevent cold water from flowing into <b>hot</b> water <b>line),</b> increasing the energy demand on the water heater.|$|R

Journal of {{environmental}} engineeringIn {{order to the}} evaluate heat loss from <b>hot</b> water supply <b>lines</b> in a residential building, hot water demand {{in a house in}} Chiba prefecture was measured and analyzed. The following results were obtained. 1. The heat loss of the <b>hot</b> water supply <b>line</b> was about 132 kJ for the shower and 110 kJ for the bathtub in winter. Since the temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of the <b>hot</b> water supply <b>line</b> is small, the measured heat loss from the <b>hot</b> water supply <b>line</b> sometimes becomes negative. 2.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} mini-shuttle like transportation system called flexi, with routes formed by analyzing passenger trip {{data from a}} large set of taxi trajectories. The usage of public transportation is declining as often it no longer matches with individual needs. Thus, the flexi system provides a transportation mode in between buses and taxis so that inconvenience in switching to the system can be minimized overall. To generate flexi routes, we propose a two-phase approach. In the first phase, a fast diameter-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm is developed and applied to the set of trips derived from the GPS data. This phase identifies a set of heavily traveled spatio-temporal trip clusters called <b>hot</b> <b>lines.</b> In the second phase, a directed acyclic graph is constructed from the <b>hot</b> <b>lines.</b> Then, an optimal single flexi route discovery algorithm on graph searching is proposed. Multiple routes are discovered by iteratively applying the single routing algorithm.
