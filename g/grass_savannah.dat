Seasonal variation of these parameters were examined and compared on regional basis. Results shows a significant dependent of volumetric rainfall and lightning on seasons in most regions, except for the Tropical Rain Forest that experience relatively high rainfall throughout the four seasons. Total volumetric rainfall tends to concentrate over the South Atlantic in DJF and moves gradually inland over the Tropical Rain Forest, Deciduous Forest North and Brush <b>Grass</b> <b>Savannah</b> North in MAM. During JJA, maximum rainfall is found around latitude 10 °N- 15 °N (Semi-Desert & part of Desert North Regions) and this moves back again to South Atlantic Ocean in SON. The South Atlantic which experiences the highest rainfall has very low lightning flash clusters which tends to concentrate around the Guinean Coast. Generally, flash counts are high around the Tropical Rain Forest, West African coast and greater part of Southern Africa in DJF. This becomes more fairly distributed in MAM and SON over the entire continent except for the Desert North and South Atlantic that is conspicuously blank. However in JJA, total flash counts are seen to concentrate between latitude 5 °N and 20 °N, around the belt of the ITCZ, implying the convective nature of rainfall during this season.

The total area is about 220, 000 feddans (9247 ha). The area is divided into 220 blocks each block is (2 x 2 km) about 1000 feddans, The annual mean temperature is 27. 7 oC; the average annual rainfall ranges from 400 mm. to 700 mm, the rainy season extends from May to October with maximum rainfall in August, the distribution and intensity are erratic. The annual potential evapotranspiration is 1894 mm and generally decreases when rainfall increases, resulting in an annual water deficit of about 1543 mm. The mean annual sunshine percentage is 75 %; the wind is moderate all over the year with an average monthly value of 2. 4 meter / second. The prevailing wind blows from the north-east direction in dry season and from south-west direction in the rainy season. The soil of the project area has an Isohyperthermic soil temperature regime, and has an ustic moisture regime because the survey area is located in the semi-arid climatic zones. The main geological formations underlying the survey consist mainly of basement complex that includes igneous and sedimentary rocks. The mantle that cover the underlying rocks are of recent thick deposits mainly fine textured forming the clay plain these sediments have been weathered in the Ethiopian high lands under humid conditions transported by the Blue Nile. The general topography of the area is flat to nearly flat plain with some depressions of variable extent, the largest depressions running along the general slope of the project area.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the underlying causes}} of differences between latent heat (LE) fluxes measured with two enclosed-path eddy covariance systems (EC) at two measurement levels and independent estimates in an open oak-tree <b>grass</b> <b>savannah</b> over almost one year. Estimates of LE of the well-stablished underlying grass by replicated weighable tension-controlled lysimiters (LELys) provided a robust baseline against which to compare EC LE measured at 1. 6 mabove ground (LE 1. 6). Similarly and at the ecosystem level, LE up-scaled using independent measurements (LEupscaled = sap flow+ lysimeter) was benchmarked with 3 EC-derived LE estimates: 1) LE measured by a EC tower at 15 mabove ground (LE 15), 2) LE 15 adjusted to close the energy balance by using the Bowen ratio method (LEBowen = (Rn −G) /(1 +b)), and 3) LE derived from the energy budget residual (LEresidual = Rn −G−H 15). The sensitivity of EC LE to the correction method applied (i. e. corrections for low-pass filtering effects on water vapor fluctuations and the so-called angle-of-attack correction) {{and its impact on the}} energy balance closure (EBC) were also evaluated. Comparison of EC LE between 1. 6 m- and 15 m-heights showed that grass dominated annual evaporative loss from 69 to 87 % depending upon the spectral correction method applied. Results revealed substantial underestimation of LE 1. 6 (up to 35 %) compared to LELys, which mostly occurred during the growing season. However those differences were remarkably lower when likening LE 15 versus LEupscaled (14 %) suggesting that the dampening of the water vapor fluctuations due to low-pass filtering effects is more pronounced near the surface. Interestingly, a diagnostic evaluation of the errors with a random forest model showed that differences followed quite structured patterns and were associated with certain atmospheric conditions: turbulent mixing deficiencies and or stable atmospheric stratification. In addition, the model showed that differences increased with increasing relative humidity (RH) and soil moisture. Our results revealed that the degree of EBC is highly sensitive to the flux correction method applied, in particular when correcting for flow distortion effects. Typically, turbulent fluxes fell below the measured available energy (slope 0. 92) but the slope switched abruptly when the angle-of-attack correction was applied (slope 1. 07). Consistent with the EBC, independent LE estimates matched well with LEBowen and the EBC gap decreased when LEupscaled was used (slope 0. 96). The use of independent estimates of LE together with machine learning methods are proposed as a powerful means to diagnose the complexity behind LE errors and give insights into the energy imbalance problem. In addition to inherent randomness of EC LE data, accounting for uncertainties associated with the appropriateness of the correction method applied is highly recommended...|$|E

40|$|East African Rift Valley Lakes hold a {{rich source}} of {{information}} for palaeoclimate change. Specifically, the sediment archives of Lake Chamo, one of the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes, reveal short-term climatic fluctuations and environmental instability during the Holocene, since it is located in a temporary endorhëic system. Currently there are no substantial studies yet that investigate palaeoenvironmental history of Lake Chamo. The objective of this thesis is to reconstruct the Holocene climatic and environmental history of Lake Chamo at high temporal resolutions. The specific aim of the project is to estimate climate-driven and anthropogenic environmental change during the Holocene, and to test a hypothesis that there were rapid climate fluctuations during the termination phase of the “African Humid Period” (AHP). Initially, the first continuous and high-resolution geochemical and geophysical core data from the sediments of Lake Chamo using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanner and Geotek Multi-Sensor-Core-Logger (MSCL) respectively, is presented. Using these techniques palaeoclimatic conditions of the region during the Holocene are reconstructed. Additionally, the core chronology is established using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis, the results of which show that the core dates back to 9000 cal yr BP. Early-Holocene can be seen to be characterised wetter climatic conditions as recorded from the relative lower lightness values, high Silicon to Titanium ratio (Si/Ti), and minimum calcium concentration in the sediment. Pronounced peak in calcium and Strontium content, which are the main features of the early-mid Holocene transition period, are ascribed to a high evaporation to precipitation ratio, implying the aridity of the region in this time frame. In addition, the peak values of magnetic susceptibility (MS), Potassium (K), Titanium (Ti), Silicon (Si), and Iron (Fe) during 1500 – 800 cal yr BP are found to be associated to a change in intensity of anthropogenic land use in the area surrounding the lake. Subsequently, the charcoal counting and detection of benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) methods are implemented to estimate paleofire occurrence in relation to climatic and anthropogenic impact of Lake Chamo. These results are used to correlate the long term trends in fire occurrence in relation to climate, vegetation and human activities at different spatial and temporal scales. Fire occurrence was found to be higher during the early Holocene, typically identified through black carbon (BC) from woody or shrub vegetation sources. The occurrence of fire was found to be lower during the mid-Holocene, due to the presence of predominantly <b>grass</b> <b>savannah</b> which usually results in reduced biomass burning in response to drier condition. Climate and vegetation were found to be the main factors for fire occurrence during the early and mid Holocene, whereas the increased fire intensity since 2000 cal yr BP record is potentially attributed to anthropogenic forcing. Finally, ostracod analyses are used to gain evidence about climatic and hydrological instability of southern Ethiopia during the Holocene. The ostracod study focuses on the taxonomy, stratigraphy and the use of ostracod assemblages to interpret the palaeoenvironments established during Holocene period. Ostracod assemblages were found to be infrequent and of limited diversity in the sediment profile, implying a period of wetter conditions. The highest abundance and more diverse ostracod assemblage were found to be associated with periods of drier climatic condition in the Lake Chamo records. To summarize, the geophysical, geochemical, charcoal, and ostracod data analysis, alongside core chronology results of this thesis have been used to reconstruct Holocene climatic and environmental history of Lake Chamo region, and of the East Africa region as a whole. The main results of this study provide significant input for the understanding of climate variability in the Holocene, as well as identifying termination of the African human period was gradual in Lake Chamo region. ...|$|E

Currently 60 percent of the population live in rural areas and 55 percent of the economic active population is dependent on agriculture, but annual urban growth rates at nearly 4 percent are the most rapid in the world and nearly twice the global average (FAOSTAT, 2006). Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and GDP per capita in the world (ERS/USDA, 2008). Economies are mainly based on primary products or natural resources. The exploitation of these are often related to loss and degradation of forests and woodlands, loss of animal and plant species, land degradation, increasing water shortages and declining water quality. The pressure and degradation of sub-Saharan Africa’s environment is mainly the result of the high population growth that has exceeded the capacity of natural resources to meet expanding human needs with the current technology. Population increase and economic growth is associated to increased utilization of fossil fuel energy, – mostly in the form of firewood and charcoal - which accounts for over 75 % of final energy consumption in sub-Saharan nations (EIA, 1999). The conversion of natural vegetation to agriculture associated with poor land management practices causes land degradation and erosion processes. It is estimated that about 25 percent of the land is subject to water erosion and 22 percent to wind erosion and desertification affects over 45 percent of the land area of which 55 percent at high to very high risk (UNEP, 1992). The implications of land cover changes on natural vegetation, biodiversity, socio-economic stability and food security may have a long-term impact on natural resources such as freshwater- and forest resources, sustainable food production, the climate and last but not least human welfare (Foley et al. 2005). Hence assessing the dynamics of land-cover and land-use changes and understanding its underlying causes has been {{recognized as one of the}} key research domains in regional and global environmental change research.

40|$|High- and low-latitude forcing of {{terrestrial}} African paleoclimate variability is demonstrated using 900 ka eolian and biogenic component records from Ocean Drilling Program site 663 {{in the eastern}} equatorial Atlantic. Terrigenous (eolian dust) and phytolith (<b>savannah</b> <b>grass</b> cuticle) accumulation rate records vary predominantly at 100 and 41 kyr periodicities and spectral phase estimates implicate high-latitude forcing. The abundance of freshwater diatoms (Melosira) transported from dry African lake beds varies coherently at 23 - 19 kyr orbital periodicities and at a phasing which implicates low-latitude precessional monsoon forcing. Modeling studies demonstrate that African climate is sensitive to both high- and low-latitude boundary conditions. African monsoon intensity is modulated by direct insolation variations due to orbital precession, whereas remote high-latitude forcing {{can be related to}} cool North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) which promote African aridity and enhance dust-transporting wind speeds. The site 663 terrigenous and phytolith records covary with North Atlantic SST variability at 41 °N (site 607). We suggest that Pleistocene African climate has responded to both high-latitude North Atlantic SST variability as well as low-latitude precessional monsoon forcing; the high-latitude influence dominates the sedimentary record. Prior to circa 2. 4 Ma, terrigenous variations occurred primarily at precessional periodicities (23 - 19 kyr), indicating that African climate was largely controlled by low-latitude insolation variations prior to the onset of high-amplitude glacial-interglacial climate change...|$|R

The first {{ecosystem}} mimic hypothesis suggests clear advantages if man-made {{land use}} systems do not deviate greatly in their resource use patterns from natural ecosystems {{typical of a}} given climatic zone. The second hypothesis claims that additional advantages will accrue if agroecosystems also maintain {{a substantial part of}} the diversity of natural systems. We test these hypotheses for the savannah zone of sub-Saharan Africa, with its low soil fertility and variable rainfall. Where annual food crops replace the natural <b>grass</b> understorey of <b>savannah</b> systems, water use will decrease and stream and groundwater flow change, unless tree density increases relative to the natural situation. Increasing tree density, however, will decrease crop yields, unless the trees meet specific criteria. Food crop production in the parkland systems may benefit from lower temperatures under tree canopies, but water use by trees providing this shade will prevent crops from benefiting. In old parkland trees that farmers have traditionally retained when opening fields for crops, water use per unit shade is less than in most fast growing trees introduced for agroforestry trials. Strong competition between plants adapted to years with different rainfall patterns may stabilise total system productivity – but this will be appre-ciated by a farmer only if the components are of comparable value. The best precondition for farmers to maintain diversity in their agroecosystem hinges on the availability of a broad basket of choices, without clear winners or ‘best bets’. 1...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} play a {{key role}} in climate change, and have adverse effects on human health. Given South Africa�s status as a rapidly-developing country with increasing urbanisation and industrial growth, information on the quality of ambient air is important. In this study, the chemical composition of ambient particles and the particles in fresh biomass burning plumes were studied at a savannah environment in Botsalano, South Africa. The results showed that Botsalano was regularly affected by air masses that had passed over several large point sources. Air masses that had passed over the coal-fired Matimba power station in the Waterberg, or over the platinum group metal smelters in the western Bushveld Igneous Complex, contained high sulfate concentrations in the submicron ranges. These concentrations were 14 to 37 times higher compared with air masses that had passed only over rural areas. Because of the limited nature of this type of data in literature for the interior regions of southern Africa, our report serves as a valuable reference for future studies. In addition, our biomass burning study showed that potassium in the fresh smoke of burning <b>savannah</b> <b>grass</b> was likely to take the form of KCl. Clear differences were found in the ratios for potassium and levoglucosan in the smouldering and flaming phases. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive chamber experiments on various fuel types used in southern Africa, to confirm the ratio of important biomass burning tracer species that can be used in source apportionment studies in the future...|$|R
