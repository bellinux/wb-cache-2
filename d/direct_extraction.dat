While the efficiency of nanowire-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has been investigated, there has yet to be a comparison of heterostructures based on nanowires grown in different crystallographic directions. We compared the directed external quantum efficiency (EQE) of III-nitride LEDs on silicon based on axial and radial nanowire heterostructures, considering m- and c-directional nanowires. The <b>directed</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency was calculated using photonic simulations, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was estimated using the A-B-C model. We found that m-directional axial heterostructures have the highest <b>directed</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency, due to the strong polarization anisotropy of III-nitrides, and display similar IQE as c-directional axial heterostructures.

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{foodborne}} viruses, especially human noroviruses (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), {{have been}} increasingly reported as {{the causes of}} foodborne disease outbreaks. Soft red fruits, especially raspberries, have a high incidence among the types of food concerned. Due to low infectious doses and low concentrations of enteric viruses in food samples, {{it is necessary to}} have an efficient and rapid detection method to implement prevention measures. A standard method for virus detection and quantification in food, including raspberries (XP CEN ISO/TS 15216 - 1 and - 2, 2013) is currently available. This method proposes a consensus detection approach by RT-real time PCR (RT-qPCR) but also a virus extraction procedure based on the elution-concentration principle. In this study, an alternative method of extraction in which RNAs are directly extracted from food matrices (based on <b>direct</b> RNA <b>extraction)</b> has been optimized. First, each step was improved to make it a highly rapid, specific and simple method. Second, the standard virus concentration method was compared with the optimized <b>direct</b> RNA <b>extraction</b> one. Human enteric viral surrogates, Murine Norovirus (MNV) and F-specific RNA bacteriophage GA, were selected according to their adhesion properties and resistance to pH close to our main targets (NOV and HAV). Raspberries were artificially contaminated using two different techniques (immersion and spotting) in order to define a recovery rate and the amounts of virus recovered. Results showed that the <b>direct</b> RNA <b>extraction</b> method revealed significantly higher viral extraction efficiency (46. 2 %) than the elution-concentration method (20. 3 %), with similar proportions of inhibitors for both. In the same way with inoculation by spotting, the best recovery rate of GA phage (39. 7 % against 0. 7 %) and MNV (42. 8 % against 0. 5 %) was observed by <b>direct</b> RNA <b>extraction.</b> For the lowest concentrations of phage and virus in the immersion bath, only the <b>direct</b> RNA <b>extraction</b> method allowed their recovery. <b>Direct</b> RNA <b>extraction</b> proved to be more effective (best recovery rate), faster (< 8 h) and simpler (fewer steps) than the one proposed in the CEN ISO standard method when it came to detecting enteric viruses on raspberries...|$|R

5000|$|For a few year {{close to}} 1880 a {{controversy}} raged round {{the composition and}} analysis of milk.

While this statement had never met with acceptance by continental chemists, public analysts had adopted Wanklyn’s figures and methods of milk analysis. The Wanklyn's procedure for the separation of fatty and non-fatty constituents was rather crude and yielded vastly varying results, as demonstrated in a celebrated milk case, heard in Manchester in 1885. Adams proposed a rather simple alternative: by merely distributing a weighed quantity of milk over strips of blotting paper and thus subdividing the solids over a very large surface, the <b>direct</b> <b>extraction</b> of the fat from milk became easy and complete.

50|$|Coffee {{production}} in the country began in 1779 in the Meseta Central which had ideal {{soil and climate conditions}} for coffee plantations. Coffea arabica first imported to Europe through Arabia, whence it takes its name, was introduced to the country directly from Ethiopia. In the nineteenth century, the Costa Rican government strongly encouraged coffee production, and the industry fundamentally transformed a colonial regime and village economy built on <b>direct</b> <b>extraction</b> by a city-based elite towards organized production for export on a larger scale. The government offered farmers plots of land for anybody who wanted to harvest the plants. The coffee plantation system in the country therefore developed in the nineteenth century largely as result of the government's open policy, although the problem with coffee barons did play a role in internal differentiation and inequality in growth. Soon coffee became a major source of revenue surpassing cacao, tobacco, and sugar production as early as 1829.Exports across the border to Panama were not interrupted when Costa Rica joined other Central American provinces in 1821 in a joint declaration of independence from Spain. In 1832, Costa Rica, at the time a state in the Federal Republic of Central America, began exporting coffee to Chile where it was re-bagged and shipped to England under the brand of “Café Chileno de Valparaíso”. In 1843, a shipment was sent directly to the United Kingdom by the Guernseyman William Le Lacheur, captain of the English ship, The Monarch, who had seen the potential of directly cooperating with the Costa Ricans. He sent several hundred-pound bags and following this the British developed an interest in the country. They invested heavily in the Costa Rican coffee industry, becoming the principal customer for exports until World War II. Growers and traders of the coffee industry transformed the Costa Rican economy, and contributed to modernization in the country, which provided funding for young aspiring academics to study in Europe. The revenue generated by the coffee industry in Costa Rica funded the first railroads linking the country to the Atlantic Coast in 1890, the “Ferrocarril al Atlántico”.

Chemical treatment with 6 M urea, 3 mM EDTA, and 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at pH 9. 0 proved an effective combination for extracting recombinant protein from intact cells. Comparable levels of Long-R 3 -IGF-I were recovered by <b>direct</b> <b>extraction</b> as achieved by in vitro dissolution following mechanical disruption.
