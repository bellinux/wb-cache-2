5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, <b>Gibraltar</b> {{played a}} key role. The Ocean Convoy System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, <b>Gibraltar</b> and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, <b>Gibraltar</b> had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe. From late 1942, <b>Gibraltar</b> was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between <b>Gibraltar</b> and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to <b>Gibraltar.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower was {{appointed}} Allied Commander-in-Chief of Operation Torch. Churchill placed <b>Gibraltar</b> {{under the command}} of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this, the first large-scale Anglo-American operation of the war. He arrived in <b>Gibraltar</b> on 5 November 1942 to take over, not just command of Operation Torch itself, but also military command of <b>Gibraltar.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Trafalgar, <b>Gibraltar</b> became a major supply base for {{supporting}} the Spanish uprising against Napoleon. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison {{to cross the border}} and destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, as well as the old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege <b>Gibraltar</b> or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of <b>Gibraltar,</b> but did not attempt to target <b>Gibraltar</b> itself as they believed that it was impregnable. The French besieged Tarifa, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave up after a month. <b>Gibraltar</b> faced no further military threat for a century.|$|E
2500|$|... 2007 10 February — Spain lifted {{restrictions}} on <b>Gibraltar's</b> ability {{to expand and}} modernise its telecommunications infrastructure. These included a refusal to recognise International Direct Dialling (IDD) code which restricted the expansion of <b>Gibraltar's</b> telephone numbering plan, and the prevention of roaming arrangements for <b>Gibraltar's</b> GSM mobile phones in Spain.|$|R

5|$|The Ocean Village Marina is one {{of three}} marinas in the British Overseas Territory of <b>Gibraltar,</b> at the {{southern}} end of the Iberian Peninsula. Formerly Sheppard's Marina, it is located in the Bay of <b>Gibraltar,</b> between the North Mole of <b>Gibraltar</b> Harbour and the runway of <b>Gibraltar</b> International Airport. Both Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay have been incorporated into the Ocean Village Project, a luxury resort.|$|E
5|$|The Reconquista of <b>Gibraltar</b> {{took place}} on the feast of St. Bernard, whom the Spanish named patron saint of <b>Gibraltar</b> and has {{remained}} so ever since. This brought an end to Moorish <b>Gibraltar,</b> just over 751 years after Tariq ibn-Ziyad had begun the conquest of Iberia.|$|E
5|$|The loss of <b>Gibraltar</b> {{led to the}} {{deposition}} of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr, who quickly reversed policy, abandoned the rebels in Ceuta and gave Algeciras (and thus the claim on <b>Gibraltar)</b> to the Marinids in 1310, {{as part of a}} new treaty, hoping they might recover it. But too busy elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after. The Granadans launched an attempt to recover <b>Gibraltar</b> by themselves in 1315, but without Marinid support, the Second Siege of <b>Gibraltar</b> faltered and failed.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other Moorish {{remnants}} are still visible in <b>Gibraltar</b> today. A hamam or bath-house, similar to examples in Fez in Morocco, {{was built in the}} lower town; its remnants can still be seen today incorporated into the <b>Gibraltar</b> Museum. It was built using Roman and Visigothic capitals, perhaps salvaged from the nearby ruined city of Carteia. The bath-house may {{have been part of the}} Moorish governor's house. A mosque was built in the city centre and was later converted by the Spanish into a Catholic church (now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned). A small mosque was built near Europa Point at the southern tip of <b>Gibraltar</b> and was later converted into the Christian Shrine of Our Lady of Europe. A subterranean reservoir, now known as the Nun's Well, was also built at Europa Point for the supply of water to the city. An existing 12th-century wall along the sea shore was extended to Europa Point to block access to places where landings could be made by sea. Much of the remainder of Moorish <b>Gibraltar</b> was obliterated by the destruction caused by the Great Siege of <b>Gibraltar</b> in 1779–83 and is now buried below the strengthened fortifications and rebuilding implemented by the British afterwards.|$|E
5|$|After peace returned, <b>Gibraltar</b> {{underwent}} {{major changes}} during the reformist governorship of General Sir George Don, who {{took up his}} position in 1814. The damage caused by the Great Siege had long since been repaired, but <b>Gibraltar</b> was still essentially a medieval town in its layout and narrow streets. A lack of proper drainage had been a major contributing factor in the epidemics that had frequently ravaged the fortress. Don implemented improved sanitation and drainage as well as introducing street lighting, rebuilding St Bernard's Hospital to serve the civilian population and initiating {{the construction of the}} Cathedral of the Holy Trinity to serve Gibraltar's Protestant civilians. For the first time, civilians began to have a say in the running of <b>Gibraltar.</b> An Exchange and Commercial Library was founded in 1817, with the Exchange Committee initially focused on furthering the interests of merchants based in the fortress. The Committee evolved into a local civilian voice in government, although it had no real powers. A City Council was established in 1821, and in 1830 <b>Gibraltar</b> became a Crown colony. In the same year, the <b>Gibraltar</b> Police Force was established, modelled on London's pioneering Metropolitan Police Service, and a Supreme Court was set up to try civil, criminal and mixed cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} <b>Gibraltar</b> by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF presence was also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in <b>Gibraltar</b> under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal <b>Gibraltar</b> Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the <b>Gibraltar</b> Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) planning a car bomb attack in <b>Gibraltar</b> ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} <b>Gibraltar</b> {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in <b>Gibraltar,</b> and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, <b>Gibraltar</b> would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and with the increased presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, <b>Gibraltar</b> provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in England, Higginbotham was {{eligible}} {{to play for the}} <b>Gibraltar</b> national team through his maternal grandmother. The former <b>Gibraltar</b> manager, Allen Bula, is his uncle. Higginbotham made his international debut in Gibraltar's first ever match as a UEFA member, a 0–0 draw in a friendly against Slovakia, on 19 November 2013. He was praised for his performance and was named man of the match. He announced his retirement from international football in March 2014, having earned three caps for <b>Gibraltar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Britain's hold on <b>Gibraltar</b> was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} <b>Gibraltar</b> returned, while the British disliked {{the continuation of}} the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across {{the upper end of the}} peninsula, cutting off <b>Gibraltar</b> from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. <b>Gibraltar</b> was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and other supplies.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command {{played a}} limited {{part in the}} Mediterranean Theatre of Operations. No. 202 Squadron RAF and No. 233 Squadron RAF {{operated}} from <b>Gibraltar.</b> They {{were involved in the}} sinking of U-74 and U-447 on 2 May and 7 May 1943, respectively as part of AHQ <b>Gibraltar,</b> under command of Air Commodore S.P. Simpson.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wars}} against Napoleonic France, <b>Gibraltar</b> served {{first as a}} Royal Navy base from which {{blockades}} of the ports of Cádiz, Cartagena and Toulon were mounted, then as a gateway for British forces and supplies in the Peninsular War between 1807 and 1814. In July 1801 a French and Spanish naval force fought the two Battles of Algeciras off <b>Gibraltar,</b> which ended in disaster for the Spanish when two of their largest warships each mistook the other for the enemy, engaged each other, collided, caught fire and exploded, killing nearly 2,000 Spanish sailors. Two years later <b>Gibraltar</b> served {{as a base for}} Lord Nelson in his efforts to bring the French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve to battle, which culminated in the Battle of Trafalgar in which Nelson was killed and Villeneuve captured. Nelson sailed to <b>Gibraltar</b> in June 1803 to launch the Trafalgar Campaign and oversee the blockades against France and Spain, though he spent little time ashore. On 28 October 1805, a week after the Battle of Trafalgar, the badly damaged HMS Victory returned to <b>Gibraltar</b> with Nelson's body aboard; Admiral Collingwood's dispatch to General Fox, announcing the victory and Nelson's death, was printed {{in the pages of the}} <b>Gibraltar</b> Chronicle. It thus became the first newspaper in the world to report the victory at Trafalgar, two weeks ahead of The Times.|$|E
5|$|France {{declared}} war on Britain in February 1793, and <b>Gibraltar</b> was recommissioned under Captain Thomas Mackenzie in May 1793. In September she was refitted {{at a cost of}} £17,485 before joining the Channel Fleet under Richard Lord Howe. As part of this fleet, <b>Gibraltar,</b> on 2May 1794, accompanied the East and West India and Newfoundland convoys along the Channel as far as Lizard Point. Howe then divided his force, sending eight ships-of-the-line and four or five frigates to escort the convoys further. The remaining 26 ships-of-the-line, including <b>Gibraltar,</b> set off to search for a large Franco-American grain convoy known to be heading to France.|$|E

5|$|From Sardinia, Italian Piaggio P.108 bombers {{attacked}} <b>Gibraltar</b> several times, {{mainly in}} 1942. The last raids on <b>Gibraltar</b> were {{done during the}} 1943 Allied landing in Algeria, when those bombers hit successfully even the Oran port.|$|E
5|$|German and Italian spies kept a {{constant}} watch on <b>Gibraltar</b> {{and sought to}} carry out sabotage operations, sometimes successfully. The Italians repeatedly carried out raids on Gibraltar's harbour using human torpedoes and divers operating from the Spanish shore, damaging a number of merchant ships and sinking one. Three Spaniards being run as spies and saboteurs by the German Abwehr were caught in <b>Gibraltar</b> in 1942–43 and hanged. The threat to <b>Gibraltar</b> was greatly reduced {{after the collapse of}} Italy in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gibraltar</b> {{has three}} marinas: Marina Bay, Ocean Village Marina, and Queensway Quay Marina. Ocean Village Marina {{is located on}} Gibraltar's Westside, outside the {{northern}} end of <b>Gibraltar</b> Harbour, in the Bay of <b>Gibraltar,</b> next to the airport runway. It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north. The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex, often referred to as just Ocean Village. Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard's Marina or Sheppard's Yard. Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village, between the North Mole and the airport runway. The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture-laden Levanter winds.|$|E
