500|$|Such was the {{likelihood}} of Manchester United going on to retain the title, bookmaker Fred Done paid out on punters with two months of the season left. Arsenal steadily closed the gap, however, and victory against Wimbledon in March 1998 set up a title clash between themselves and the reigning champions. Wenger in the lead up to the game maintained {{it was possible for}} Arsenal to win the league, stating [...] "two or three weeks ago, the title was just a dream for us and people laughed when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> could still do it". He suggested Manchester United were responsible for making the title race [...] "interesting". At Old Trafford, Overmars scored the decisive goal to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. The victory was followed by nine consecutive league wins, the last of which was a home fixture against Everton that secured Arsenal's status as champions. Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the double, when his team beat Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final.|$|E

500|$|The Anasazi ruins were {{constructed}} in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, {{due to the}} presence of a rare [...] "spiny black horned toad" [...] in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, [...] "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and [...] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up." [...] However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox. Manners noted that Davis had [...] "a hell of a time" [...] trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, because the hole was fake. The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a [...] "great sequence".|$|E

2500|$|The witness {{tampering}} {{charges were}} based on text messages Ravi sent to Wei, in which he tried to persuade her not to contradict what he had told police.

According to a prosecution expert witness, Ravi deleted almost 100 text messages between him and Wei and another high school friend, whom he had invited to view Clementi's second encounter with his guest. A key aspect of the prosecution's evidence tampering charge was Ravi's deletion of two potentially incriminating postings: one on Twitter on September 19 in which he wrote that his roommate was [...] "making out with a dude. Yay", and one on September 21 in which he told his iChat followers [...] "dare you to video chat me" [...] {{during the time of}} Clementi's tryst.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
