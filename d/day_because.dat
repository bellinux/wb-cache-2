5|$|Tornado {{occurrence}} {{is highly}} dependent {{on the time of}} <b>day,</b> <b>because</b> of solar heating. Worldwide, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, between 3 pm and 7 pm local time, with a peak near 5 pm. Destructive tornadoes can occur at any time of day. The Gainesville Tornado of 1936, one of the deadliest tornadoes in history, occurred at 8:30 am local time.|$|E
5|$|A typhoon watch {{was issued}} for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on December 14, which was {{upgraded}} to a typhoon warning the next <b>day.</b> <b>Because</b> Paka was intensifying while passing {{to the south}} of Rota, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, was less severe than the second wind from the southeast. Sustained winds on the island reached 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching 185km/h (115mph). Many trees in the mountainous portion of the island were left defoliated, which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, Paka dropped 250–300mm (10–12in) of rain. Damage on the island totaled $4.4million (1997USD, $6.4million 2015USD). The typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next <b>day.</b> <b>Because</b> this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E

By the next <b>day,</b> <b>because</b> of the {{irregularities}} and votes {{that would be}} thrown out, the projected winner was Baxter, by only 3,000 votes. The General Assembly met on January6 for a special joint session to declare Baxter, who by their count had received the most votes, the legal winner of the election. After a short address he was sworn in by Chief Justice John McClure. He then assumed the duties of Governor of the State of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Casey had {{intended}} to come ashore {{on the first day}} of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a <b>day</b> <b>because</b> the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a <b>day.</b> <b>Because</b> the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E

5|$|On May 26, 1943, the 32nd Infantry Regiment {{was pinned}} down by enemy {{fire in the}} {{vicinity}} of Fish Hook Ridge, in the Aleutian Islands. On his own account, Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez {{was shot in the head}} as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying of the wound the following <b>day.</b> <b>Because</b> of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Steady losses had {{occurred}} throughout {{their participation in}} the battle. On 18 August, known as the Hardest <b>Day</b> <b>because</b> both sides suffered heavy losses, the Stuka was withdrawn after 16 were destroyed and many others damaged. According to the Generalquartiermeister der Luftwaffe, 59 Stukas had been destroyed and 33 damaged to varying degrees in six weeks of operations. Over 20% of the total Stuka strength had been lost between 8 and 18 August; and the myth of the Stuka shattered. The Ju 87s did succeed in sinking six warships, 14 merchant ships, badly damaging seven airfields and three Chain Home radar stations, and destroying 49 British aircraft, mainly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the <b>day</b> <b>because</b> the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the <b>day</b> <b>because</b> of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E
5|$|Williams was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Municipal Auditorium in Charleston, West Virginia on Wednesday December 31, 1952. Advance ticket sales totaled US$3,500. That <b>day,</b> <b>because</b> of an ice storm in the Nashville area, Williams could not fly, so he hired a college student, Charles Carr, to drive him to the concerts. Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say that Williams would not arrive on time owing to the ice storm and was ordered to drive Williams to Canton, Ohio, for the New Year's Day concert there.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying <b>day</b> <b>because</b> of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for the primary care of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 2015, {{during the}} annual cyclone season, a low {{pressure}} area consolidated into a depression and slowly intensified into a deep depression before crossing the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following <b>day.</b> <b>Because</b> of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked {{low pressure area}} over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November. The system brought very heavy rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 15 November, well-marked low pressure area moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 24‑hour totals peaking at 370mm in Ponneri. Chennai International Airport recorded 266mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28–29 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490mm of rainfall at Tambaram in 24 hours starting 8:30 am on 1 December. Very heavy rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to Cuddalore.|$|E
