40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to identify both individual and contextual characteristics that may affect the wage earnings of Chinese in the U. S. labor market. The major individual characteristics include education, labor experience, and English ability; the contextual factors include percent of Chinese Americans, percent of Asian Americans, percent of nonwhites, percent of Chinese-owned businesses, occupational and residential segregation between Chinese and whites, and unemployment rate. Using the combined data of one percent and five percent 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples for 70 metropolitan areas, hierarchical linear models (HLM) were run for three groups of Chinese: native-born, foreign-born U. S. citizens, and foreignborn non-U. S. citizens. The {{results show that the}} returns to education are highest for the native-borns but lowest for the non-U. S. citizens. A command of good <b>English</b> <b>benefits</b> recent immigrants more than the native-borns. Labor experience tends to bring positive gains to both native-born and foreign-born U. S. citizens but shows no effects on earnings of foreign-born non-U. S. citizens. The results support both the human capital and assimilation perspectives. The HLM results indicate that occupational segregation from majority whites tends to impose a strong and negative effect on the earnings of native-born Chinese; a higher percentage of Chinese-owned businesses tends to increase the earnings of only foreign-born U. S. citizens; unemployment rate is likely to depress the wage earnings of the foreign-borns but not the native-borns. This suggests that Chinese workers with a different immigration history face the labor market differently. Residential segregation, percent of Chinese Americans, percent of Asian Americans, and percent of nonwhites, do not show any direct effects. Occupational segregation, the percent of Chinese-owned businesses, and the representation of the Chinese population are found to impact earnings indirectly through the individual characteristics. All these findings suggest that contextual factors do not necessarily impose direct effects on wage earnings; however, they may transfer their effects onto earnings via individual characteristics. This study represents an attempt to bring new insights into earnings attainment models and an addition to the meager body of knowledge concerning both individual and contextual factors that may affect the earnings process of a minority group in the United States. The strengths of using the HLM techniques, the limitations of the study, as well as issues for future study, were also discussed...|$|E

In this paper we report a study whose aim is twofold: to test for possible positive effects of physical activity when L 2 learning has already reached some level of proficiency, and to test whether the assumed better performance when engaged in physical activity is limited to the linguistic level probed at training (i. e. L 2 vocabulary tested by means of a Word-Picture Verification task), or whether it extends also to the sentence level (which was tested by means of a Sentence Semantic Judgment Task). The results show that Chinese speakers with basic knowledge of <b>English</b> <b>benefited</b> from physical activity while learning a set of new words. Furthermore, their better performance emerged also at the sentential level, as shown by their performance in a Semantic Judgment task. Finally, an interesting temporal asymmetry between the lexical and the sentential level emerges, with the difference between the experimental and control group emerging from the 1 st testing session at the lexical level but after several weeks at the sentential level...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we sought}} to find and measure the {{long-term}} effects of subtitled second language audiovisual material on second language acquisition, and how significant the potential effects were. The participants of this study were students from a VG 3 level in upper secondary school class who were divided into three groups. Two of these groups were experimental groups who watched four episodes of Family Guy with either English or Norwegian subtitles, while the third group, being a control group, watched the material without any subtitles. This master’s project has been a continuation of Ingrid Elisabeth Nufsfjord Kvitnes and Lisa Marie Grønn Aurstad’s theses on the short term effects of subtitles in second language acquisition. This study looks more extensively on the long-term effects in the same area. We found that viewing intralingual subtitles, in this case <b>English,</b> <b>benefitted</b> students on word recall aptitude, and that vocabulary and grammar proficiency had an effect on word definition skill. Furthermore, we established that word frequency was a predicator for accuracy on the lexical recall task, showing that higher frequent words are more easily recalled after {{a longer period of time}} after being exposed to the material (circa 1 month) than lower frequent words. An additional finding was that both proficiency with vocabulary and grammar were linked to word definition ability, meaning higher expertise with vocabulary and grammar establish better scores on word definition tasks...|$|R

Word-to-word mappings from aligned sentences are easily accomplished if a bilingual lexicon is provided. However, newly coined words cannot be aligned automatically since they are not registered in the lexicon. For automated alignment of newly identified words, we introduce new heuristics to align maximal number of words, using structural transfer patterns between the two languages. Provided maximum word alignments together with paired sentences in a parallel corpus, Korean learners of <b>English</b> can <b>benefit</b> from recognizing distinctions on sentential structures as well as vocabularies between the two languages...|$|R
