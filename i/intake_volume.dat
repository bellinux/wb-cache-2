The procedure consisted of handling the pups for 1 min/day in the first 10 days postnatally. When adults, animals had their body weight verified and were housed in individual metabolic cages. After a 24 -hour period, urine samples were collected and the urinary and water <b>intake</b> <b>volumes</b> measured. Blood samples to determine osmolality, aldosterone, corticosterone, angiotensin II, creatinine, urea, sodium and potassium levels were collected. The kidneys were removed for histological assessment.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether the daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> of alcoholic beverages is associated with craving in patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal. Methods: A total of 158 male patients were assessed using the obsessive compulsive drinking scale (OCDS) at admission. The daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> of alcoholic beverages was calculated by adding the volume of all regularly con-sumed alcoholic beverages, disregarding their alcohol percentage. Lesch’s typology was used to classify patients for subgroup analysis. Results: The daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> of alcoholic beverages correlated significantly with the extent of the OCDS (r = 0. 33; P < 0. 001). With general linear models, we found a significant association of the calculated daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> of all alcoholic beverages with craving (F = 6. 426; P = 0. 012), but not for the daily ethanol intake. Differentiating the patients according to Lesch’s typology a signi-ficant association was particularly found in Lesch Type 2 (model of anxiety) patients (F = 11. 31; P = 0. 001). Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> is associated with craving and suggest a role of pathophysiological changes in volume regulating mechanisms (such as vasopressin or ANP) in the neurobiology of alcohol craving, particularly in male patients of Lesch’s Type 2 undergoing alcohol withdrawal...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In {{sedentary}} adults, hydration {{is mostly}} influenced by total fluid intake {{and not by}} sweat losses; moreover, low daily fluid intake is associated with adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to model the relation between total fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers. SUBJECTS/METHODS: During 4 consecutive weekdays, 82 adults (age, 31. 6 ± 4. 3 years; body mass index, 23. 2 ± 2. 7 kg/m 2; 52 % female) recorded food and fluid consumed, collected one first morning urine (FMU) void and three 24 -h (24 hU) samples. The strength of linear association between urinary hydration biomarkers and fluid <b>intake</b> <b>volume</b> was evaluated using simple linear regression and Pearson’s correlation. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) modeled the association between fluid intake and 24 hU hydration biomarkers. RESULTS: Strong associations (|r|X 0. 6; Po 0. 001) were found between total fluid <b>intake</b> <b>volume</b> and 24 hU osmolality, color, specific gravity (USG), volume and solute concentrations. Many 24 hU biomarkers were collinear (osmolality versus color: r 0. 49 – 0. 76; USG versus color: r 0. 46 – 0. 78; osmolality versus USG: 0. 86 – 0. 97; Po 0. 001). Measures in FMU were not strongly correlated to intake. Multivariate PLS and simple linear regression using urine volume explained 450 % {{of the variance in}} fluid <b>intake</b> <b>volume</b> (r 2 0. 59 and 0. 52, respectively); however the error in both models was high and the limits of agreement very large.

MethodsA total of 24 healthy Sprague–Dawley rats were divided randomly into four groups (n= 6 each) which determined if the animals would receive induction of MS or drug (promethazine) treatment: MS(–) /Drug(–); MS(+) /Drug(–); MS(–) /Drug(+ at 0. 25 mg); and MS(+) /Drug(+). MS was induced by complex motion stimulation and the conditioned taste aversion was used as a behavioral indicator of MS. The volume of 0. 15 % sodium saccharin solution (SS) intake within 45 minutes after motion stimulation was measured. H 1 R in the vestibular nucleus was examined by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of H 1 R protein in brainstem tissue at vestibular nucleus level was detected by western blot. ResultsThe mean SS <b>intake</b> <b>volume</b> in the MS(+) /Drug(–) group (8. 8 ml) was significantly less than that of the MS (–) /Drug(–) group (15. 1 ml) (P < 0. 01). The mean SS <b>intake</b> <b>volume</b> of the MS(–) /Drug(+) group (14. 8 ml) was {{similar to that of the}} MS(–) /Drug(–) group. The mean SS <b>intake</b> <b>volume</b> (9. 6 ml) of the MS(+) /Drug(+) group was more than that of the MS (+) /Drug(–) group (P < 0. 01), but less than that of the MS (–) /Drug(–) group or MS (–) /Drug(+) group (P < 0. 01). Immunofluorescence staining showed positive expression of H 1 R in the vestibular nucleus of brainstem and the expression was enhanced by motion stimulation. Western blot analysis showed that H 1 R protein expressed in the brainstem tissue at vestibular nucleus level and the expression also increased significantly after motion stimulation. The MS–induced increase of H 1 R was not affected significantly by promethazine. ConclusionsH 1 Rs exist in the vestibular nucleus in rats and H 1 R expression is up–regulated by motion stimulation, but not affected by promethazine. The findings indicate that the histaminergic system is involved in MS. Promethazine, as an H 1 R blocker, may play its anti–MS role by competing the binding site on H 1 Rs with histamine rather than inhibiting H 1 R expression...|$|E

However, male offspring rats that perinatally exposed to captopril showed a significant attenuation in water intake induced by osmotic stimulation, extracellular dehydration and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, captopril treatment during perinatal period decreased the salt appetite induced by sodium depletion. This treatment also attenuated thirst and sodium appetite aroused during inhibition of peripheral angiotensin 11 generation raised by low concentration of captopril in the adult offspring. Interestingly. perinatal exposure to captopril did not alter water or salt intake induced by i. c. v. administration of angiotensin I or angiotensin II.

As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{nutritional}} {{content of}} donated expressed breast milk (DEBM) is variable. Using DEBM {{to provide for}} the energy requirements of neonates is challenging. Objective: The authors hypothesized that a system of DEBM energy content categorization and distribution would improve energy intake from DEBM. Methods: We compared infants’ actual cumulative energy intake with projected energy intake, had they been fed using our proposed system. Eighty-five milk samples were ranked by energy content. The bottom, middle, and top tertiles were classified as red, amber, and green energy content categories, respectively. Data on 378 feeding days from 20 babies who received this milk were analyzed. Total daily intake of DEBM was calculated in mL/kg/day and similarly ranked. Infants received red energy content milk, with DEBM intake in the bottom daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> tertile; amber energy content milk, with intake in the middle daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> tertile; and green energy content milk when intake reached the top daily <b>volume</b> <b>intake</b> tertile. Results: Actual median cumulative energy intake from DEBM was 1612 (range, 15 - 11 182) kcal. Using DEBM with the minimum energy content from the 3 DEBM energy content categories, median projected cumulative intake was 1670 (range 13 - 11 077) kcal, which was not statistically significant (P =. 418). Statistical significance was achieved using DEBM with the median and maximum energy content from each energy content category, giving median projected cumulative intakes of 1859 kcal (P =. 0006) and 2280 kcal (P =. 0001), respectively. Conclusion: Cumulative energy intake from DEBM can be improved by categorizing and distributing milk according to energy content...|$|R
2500|$|Both {{available}} engines used a Bosch Motronic fully electronic {{engine control}} unit (ECU), with cylinder bank selective knock control, dual-barrel throttle valve, lambda mixture control via <b>intake</b> air <b>volume</b> metering and exhaust gas temperature sensor, and required unleaded petrol. Fuel was delivered to the combustion chambers via eight intake manifold-sited electronic fuel injectors, fed from two common fuel rails (one per cylinder bank), and were sequentially 'fired' or activated {{in accordance with the}} engine's firing order. [...] Whilst the 3.6V8 was able to use 95RON (91AKI) fuel, for the 4.2V8, the more expensive 98RON (93AKI) 'SuperPlus' unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output. The usage of 95RON in the 4.2V8 resulted in a lower power output, as well as increased fuel consumption.|$|R
