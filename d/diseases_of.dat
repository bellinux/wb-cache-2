5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi {{cause the}} majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E

In this paper we present a long-term study of 25 cases of adult linear IgA <b>disease,</b> 25 cases <b>of</b> chronic bullous <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> childhood, and four cases of childhood cicatricial pemphigoid, which has revealed further similarities among all three groups.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{validity}} of the present subdivision of patients with inflammatory bowel disease into those with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the small bowel or of the colon and those with ulcerative colitis, 252 patients with inflammatory bowel disease have been studied by questionnaire and case note review. One hundred and seventy-two variables concerning the nature and frequency of symptoms in remission and relapse, the incidence of complications and results of investiga-tion have been analysed by computer. As expected, there were many highly significant variables between patients with ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the small bowel. The latter showed evidence of a more severe disease course with more complications. There were similar, although less marked, differences between patients with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the colon and those with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the small bowel. There were very few differences in disease course between patients with Crohn's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the colon and those with ulcerative colitis.

5|$|After {{passing the}} {{required}} examinations, Negus proceeded in 1909 {{to the next}} stage of his basic medical education at the nearby King's College Hospital, at that time located on Portugal Street between the Strand and Lincoln's Inn Fields. Three more years of study led to the attainment in 1912 of the MRCS and LRCP (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, known as the 'conjoint diploma'), marking his formal qualification to practice medicine. In the final year of these studies, Negus was an usher at the funeral service for Lord Lister at Westminster Abbey. Another connection with Lister's generation came when Negus worked as surgical dresser and house surgeon under Sir William Watson Cheyne, who had himself been house surgeon to Lister. The postgraduate stages of Negus's training involved specialisation in <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> the ear, nose and throat, a direction influenced and guided by the otorhinolaryngologist St Clair Thomson (1857–1943).

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{metastasis}} of many cancers {{is due in}} part to loss of cell–cell adhesion. E-cadherin, plakoglobin and β-catenin are important in cell adhesion. Our aim was to examine the presence of these molecules in Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the vulva and Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the breast, and to correlate any differences in their expression with the presence <b>of</b> invasive <b>disease</b> or an underlying carcinoma. Sixty-three archival cases <b>of</b> Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the vulva, including eight associated with invasive disease, and 23 archival cases <b>of</b> Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> breast, which included 10 cases with ductal carcinoma in situ alone, four cases with both ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma, and five cases with underlying invasive carcinoma alone, were analysed immunohistochemically for expression of E-cadherin, plakoglobin and β-catenin proteins. The respective mRNAs were also detected by in situ hybridisation using digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes. Seventy-six percent (41 / 54) <b>of</b> Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> vulva cases had > 50 % of Paget cells expressing the E-cadherin protein, compared with 28 % (2 / 7) <b>of</b> Paget's <b>disease</b> vulva with invasive disease. This result was significant, with a P-value of 0. 039. Twenty-five percent (14 / 55) of the intraepidermal Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the vulva cases had > 50 % of Paget cells expressing the plakoglobin protein, compared with 12 % (1 / 8) of cases <b>of</b> Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> vulva with invasive disease, and for β-catenin, 9 % (5 / 55) of the non-invasive Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the vulva had > 50 % of Paget cells expressing β-catenin, compared with 12 % (1 / 8) <b>of</b> Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the vulva cases with invasive disease. Sixty-five percent (15 / 23) <b>of</b> the Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> the breast had > 50 % of Paget cells expressing E-cadherin, and for plakoglobin and β-catenin it was 17 % (4 / 23) and 28 % (6 / 21), respectively.

40|$|Background: Haemolytic <b>Disease</b> <b>of</b> Newborn is {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} neonatal deaths and complications worldwide. Its incidence in Zimbabwe is not clearly understood. Objective: To find out incidence <b>of</b> Haemolytic <b>Disease</b> <b>of</b> Newborn in Harare and ability to identify antibodies associated with HDN. Methods: A retrospective cross sectional study at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals and National Blood Service, Zimbabwe (NBSZ). We studied 22493 infants at Parirenyatwa Hospital during the 1995 - 1997 and 2002 - 2003 periods. The main outcome measures were ABO and Rh blood group results, Direct Antiglobulin Test and Maternal Antibody Screening and Identification Results were obtained from the NBSZ. Results: One hundred and ninety-one (0, 85 %) infants had Haemolytic <b>Disease</b> <b>of</b> Newborn. One hundred and sixty-three (85. 34 %) of these were due to anti-AB, twenty five (13. 09 %) were due to anti-D and three (1. 57 %) due to anti-Kell. Incidence <b>of</b> Haemolytic <b>Disease</b> <b>of</b> Newborn during 1995 - 1997 and 2002 - 2003, were 0. 93 % and 0. 64 %, respectively (p = 0. 014).
