40|$|The {{dynamics}} of water drop impact at high impinging velocity onto superhydrophobic substrates is experimentally investigated. The solid substrate—comprised of regular and hydrophobic micropillars—is transparent, thereby facilitating close-up, top-or-bottom-view, high-speed imaging. With a sufficient impact velocity, {{instead of a}} completely-bouncing ‘‘Fakir’’ droplet, wetting splashing can occur, with an <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> at the centre surrounded by a wetted area {{as well as an}} emission of satellite droplets during the advancing phase of spreading lamella. A large portion of the lamella travels upon air and subsequently recoils due to surface tension, forming a partial rebound on the central wet spot. We present and discuss quantitative results of the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble,</b> the central wetted area, and the maximal spreading lamella as the impact velocity is increased. We further vary the lattice periodicity of the micro-patterns and find its profound influence on the macroscopic flow. More specifically, directional splashing can emerge, emitting secondary droplets in certain directions which are associated with the lattice. Directional splashing can be suppressed to a gentle spreading by decreasing the periodicity of the lattice and, furthermore, can be tuned to a completely-wetting splashing in the diagonal directions of the lattice by a larger periodicity, offering opportunities to control the wetting process. Finally, the elimination of directional splashing by reducing air pressure suggests that the underlying air is squeezed outwards by the falling droplet upon the solid boundary whereby the air flow is affected, leading to different splashing behavior...|$|E

Although this method offers a simple and cheap solution, its use in practical applications is still very limited. This might be primarily ascribed {{to the concerns of}} practising engineers about the durability of gas/air bubbles in soils over time. This paper discusses the durability of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> under various simulated field conditions that may potentially cause the dissolution, diffusion, compression and escape of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Multiple series of 1 g vertical sand column and high-g centrifuge tests were undertaken to provide insights into the problem.

40|$|When a ball is {{dropped in}} fine very loose sand, a splash and {{subsequently}} a jet are observed above the bed, {{followed by a}} granular eruption. To directly and quantitatively determine what happens inside the sand bed, high-speed X-ray tomography measurements are carried out in a custom-made set-up that allows for imaging of a large sand bed at atmospheric pressures. Herewith, we show that the jet originates from the pinch-off point created {{by the collapse of}} the air cavity formed behind the penetrating ball. Subsequently, we measure how the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> rises through the sand, and show that this is consistent with bubbles rising in continuously fluidized beds. Finally, we measure the packing fraction variation throughout the bed. From this we show that there is (i) a compressed area of sand in front of and next to the ball while the ball is moving down, (ii) a strongly compacted region at the pinch-off height after the cavity collapse and (iii) a relatively loosely packed centre {{in the wake of the}} rising bubble...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The superhydrophobic {{behavior}} of nano- and microtextured surfaces leading to rebound of impacting droplets {{is of great}} relevance to nature and technology. It is not clear however, if and under what conditions this behavior is maintained when such surfaces are severely undercooled possibly leading {{to the formation of}} frost and icing. Here we elucidate key aspects of this phenomenon and show that the outcome of rebound or impalement on a textured surface is affected by air compression underneath the impacting drop and the time scale allowing this air to escape. Remarkably, drop impalement occurred at identical impact velocities, both at room and at very low temperatures (− 30 °C) and featured a ringlike liquid meniscus penetration into the surface texture with an <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in the middle. At low temperatures, the drop contact time and receding dynamics of hierarchical surfaces were profoundly influenced by both an increase in the liquid viscosity due to cooling and a partial meniscus penetration into the texture. For hierarchical surfaces with the same solid fraction in their roughness, minimizing the gap between the asperities (both at micro- and nanoscales) yielded the largest resistance to millimetric drop impalement. The best performing surface impressively showed rebound at − 30 °C for drop impact velocity of 2. 6 m/s...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with air bubble entrapped in another liquid media find many practical applications in engineering and science (e. g. air bubble formation in molten metal during metallurgic processes, air bubble entrainment at hydraulic jumps, self-aeration of free jets and slug flow when gas formation within slug occurs). The study of motion of air bubble {{may lead to}} understand and control the highly complex processes like nucleate boiling and safety of nuclear reactors. Therefore {{it is clear that}} the study of air bubble motion in any liquid medium plays an important role to avoid defects and to enhance the efficiency of various engineering processes. In the present dissertation, a numerical investigation has been made to study the behavior of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> and to understand the combined effect of jet force and buoyancy on it. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) with 3 D Volume of Fluid (VOF) model has been adopted to formulate/simulate the present problem. Different combinations of Reynolds number, initial position of bubble and number of bubbles have been considered for better understanding about the mobility of air bubble in water. The effects of various fluid properties and turbulence on its motion and shape have also been studied. For each of the case studies, the contours of phases, velocity and velocity vectors have been evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In {{practical}} geotechnical engineering soils {{below the}} groundwater table are usually {{regarded as a}} two-phase medium, consisting of solids and water. The pore water {{is assumed to be}} incompressible. However, under certain conditions soils below the groundwater table may exhibit a liquid phase consisting of water and air. The air occurs in form of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and dissolved <b>air.</b> Such conditions are named quasi-saturated and the assumption of incompressibility is no longer justified. In addition the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> influence the hydraulic conductivity of soils. These effects are usually neglected in standard problems of geotechnical engineering. However, sometimes it is required to include the pore fluid compressibility when modelling the hydraulic behaviour of soils {{in order to be able}} to explain certain phenomena observed in the field. This is for example true for fast fluctuating water levels in reservoirs. In order to study these phenomena, numerical investigations on the influence of the pore fluid compressibility on the pore water pressure changes in a soil layer beneath a reservoir with fast fluctuating water levels were performed.

For good agreement with the experimental data it is crucial to include the confined geometry into the model: The <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> acts back on the acoustic field in the channel and thus on its own dynamics.

It {{was found that the}} <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> has a radius of 5 µm just after the entrapment. The bubble then grows by rectified diffusion due to the applied pressure field, used for jetting droplets. Bjerknes forces drive the displacement of the <b>air</b> <b>bubble.</b> First, the bubble is pushed into the channel. After reaching the resonance size, given by the characteristic printhead frequency, the Bjerknes force reverses sign, pushing the <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> towards the nozzle.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} stem diameter, xylem pressure potential, and temperature on the rate of recovery of hydraulic conductivity in embolized stems of Acer saccharum Marsh. Recovery of conductivity was accompanied by an increase in stem water content as water replaced air bubbles and bubbles dissolved from vessels into the surrounding water. The time required for stems to go from less than 3 to 100 % hydraulic conductivity increased approximately with the square of the stem diameter and increased with decreasing xylem pressure potential. Recovery was halted when xylem pressure potential decreased below − 6 kPa. Increasing xylem pressure from 13 to 150 kPa reduced the time for recovery by a factor of 4. Temperature had little influence on the rate of recovery of hydraulic conductivity. All of these results are in accord with a theory of bubble dissolution in which it is assumed that: (a) the rate of bubble dissolution is rate limited by diffusion of air from the bubbles to the outer surface of the stems, (b) the equilibrium concentration of gases in liquid in stems is determined by Henry's law at all air-water interfaces, (c) the equilibrium solubility concentration is determined only by the partial pressure of the gas in the gas phase and not directly by the liquid-phase pressure, and (d) the gas pressure of an <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in the lumen of a cell can never be less than atmospheric pressure at equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} air-water interfacial flows are studied including plunging wave {{breaking and}} flow past a vertical surface-piercing circular cylinder using complementary CFDShip-Iowa version 6 including Cartesian grid solver and orthogonal curvilinear grid solver. The plunging wave-breaking process for impulsive flow over a bump {{in a shallow}} water flume has been simulated using the exact experimental initial and boundary conditions. The overall plunging wave breaking process is described with major wave breaking events identified: jet plunge, oblique splash and vertical jet. These major events repeat up to four times before entering the chaotic breaking. The simulations show a similar time line as the experiments consisting of startup, steep wave formation, plunging wave, and chaotic wave breaking swept downstream time phases. Detailed wave breaking processes, including wave profile at maximum height, first plunge, <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> trajectories and diameters, kinetic, potential, and total energy, and bottom pressures are discussed along with the experimental results. The simulations show differences and similarities with other experimental and computational studies for wave breaking in deep water and sloping beaches. The geometry and conditions {{in the present study}} are relevant to ship hydrodynamics since it includes effects of wave-body interactions and wave breaking direction is opposite to the mean flow. Large-eddy simulation with the Lagrangian dynamic subgrid-scale model has been performed to study the flow past a surface-piercing circular cylinder for Re and Fr effect. The flow features near the air-water interface show significant changes with different Reynolds numbers from sub-critical to critical regime. It is shown that the interface makes the separation point more delayed for all regime of Re. Remarkably reduced separated region below the interface is observed for critical Re regime and it is responsible for much reduced wake and recirculation region behind the cylinder and it recovers in the deep flow. At different Fr, significant changes are shown on the air-water interface structures. At lower Fr, relatively smaller bow waves are observed in front of the cylinder with Kelvin waves behind the cylinder and small amount of free-surface roughness and turbulence are also seen in the wake region. For higher Fr, the bow wave increases remarkably with the larger wake region and deeper depression and it breaks with similar features of plunging breakers. Much more small air-water interface structures including splashes and bubbles are observed behind the cylinder. It is hard to distinguish the Kelvin waves behind the cylinder due to much larger free-surface oscillations and turbulence. As Fr increases, the Kelvin wave angle decreases and deeper and narrower depression region behind the cylinder are observed. The flow features around the cylinder are significantly changed due to this cavity region behind the cylinder...|$|E
40|$|Cryogenic {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (cryo-SEM), image analysis (IA) of SEM micrographs and X-ray microtomography (XMT) were used to obtain new information about the morphology of iron ore green pellets in this work. Cryo-SEM and freeze fracturing was used to observe <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and arrangement of particles around the bubbles and in the matrix of wet green pellets. The observations of samples prepared by plunge and unidirectional freezing indicate that unidirectional freezing facilitates the observation of entrapped bubbles with minimum formation of artifacts, whereas plunge freezing enables observation {{of the degree of}} water filling at the outer surface of wet pellets with minimum amount of artifacts. It was also observed in the wet pellets that the size of the water domains in the matrix is quite small and the finer grains are mixed with coarser grains resulting in a denser matrix, whereas no fine grains were observed {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>air</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Two types of pellets prepared with and without addition of extra flotation reagent prior to balling were studied using IA and XMT. IA of scanning electron micrographs of epoxy impregnated pellets was used to separate bubble porosity from packing porosity and to quantify the former. The individual SEM micrographs acquired by a backscattered electron detector were reconstructed to provide the entire two-dimensional (2 D) sections of the pellets. The 2 D data obtained by IA were unfolded to three-dimensional (3 D) by stereology and relatively good agreement with XMT data was observed. The size and amount of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> could be quantified with both techniques. The addition of extra flotation reagent was found to increase the number of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and slightly decrease the median bubble diameter. The additional <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> due to the addition of extra flotation reagent was shown to be responsible for the difference in total porosity observed by mercury porosimetry between the two types of pellets. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) is shown in this work to produce inappropriate results with regard to the porosity due to bubble entrapment, it only provides values for total porosity and the throat size distribution of the porosity. In summary, this work has shown that cryo-SEM, IA of SEM micrographs and XMT are powerful and very useful methods for characterization of the morphology of iron ore green pellets.

Typically, the damage pattern under uniaxial tension is a large number of closely spaced microcracks of width less than 100  μm, spaced a few millimeters apart. In this manner, localized catastrophic brittle fracture is suppressed. The ductility of ECC is the sum total of distributed deformation resulting from the diffused microcrack damage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{formation}} of an excess of dissolved gas (“excess air”) in quasi-saturated media was studied by analyzing and interpreting dissolved noble gas concentrations in laboratory column experiments. Using quartz sand filled columns of 1 m length, two different experimental designs were realized. In the first, groundwater recharge was simulated by a unidirectional vertical water flow through the columns. In the second, groundwater level fluctuations in an aquifer zone without active infiltration were reproduced by cyclic water level fluctuations in the columns. The reproducible generation of excess air under these defined, near natural conditions was successful. Partial or complete dissolution of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> <b>entrapped</b> in the quartz sand could be identified as the mechanism responsible for the generation of excess air. Depending on the experimental design, supersaturation of the dissolved atmospheric noble gases ranging between 1. 4 % Ne and 16. 2 % Ne was found. The measured noble gas patterns were interpreted using inverse modeling and conceptual gas exchange models and were compared to results of numerical simulations of gas bubble dissolution in water filled soil columns.

Presumably silver tracer should be absent when no discrepancy exits between {{the depth of}} demineralization {{and the extent of}} adhesive infiltration. However, silver deposits similar to water tree were observed in both groups and these water channels extend through the adhesive layer, which provides the most direct way for water movement across the polymerized layers [27]. These regions represent areas of sub-optimal conversion within the polymer matrix due to the incompletely removal of solvent [9, 28]. On the other hand, since Clearfil S 3 adhesive contains 2 -hydroxyethyl metacrylate - HEMA (hydrophilic monomer) and water, it is important to perform strong air drying to evaporate water and solvents. This procedure results in a viscous resin material with <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> remaining on the dentin surface and reduces the thickness of the layer, turning it more susceptible to the polymerization inhibition by oxygen [29].|$|R

Pt NPs-chitosan composite bubbles can be applied in controlled release and tissue engineering; however, chitosan carrier substrates will disintegrate and dissolve in acid solution such as gastric juices. Therefore, Pt NPs-chitosan composite bubbles are limited in acidic condition. Fortunately, alginate polymer provides a solution to overcome this problem. Alginate polymer has a dense structure to pass the acid solution. To our best knowledge, Pt NPs-alginate composite (Pt NPs@alginate) bubbles are seldom reported in literatures, and they can provide applications for wide pH ranges.|$|R

Many researchers have shown that these defects can be reduced by adopting an appropriate gating system design.

In this study, we tried to draw a comparison between two gating system designs with and without a ceramic foam filter.

The water modeling experiment was conducted with four different amounts of the initial volumes of water in the reservoir to verify the effects of initial pouring velocity. The results of the experiment applying the filter showed remarkably changed flow characteristics. The use of the filter was found to convert the flow pattern of water in the desired direction. The ceramic foam filter performed well to reduce flow velocity and stabilize the water stream. The flow pattern without a filter can be improved significantly even with the the use of just a 10 PPI irregular filter. Although the study confirmed that use of the filter may change the flow characteristics, it needs to be noted that the use of the ceramic filter alone cannot solve all the problems caused by a poorly designed gating system...|$|R

Some {{of these processes}} are, however, not well understood and therefore require further investigation. This is the first study simultaneously investigating soil air and groundwater {{in the context of}} noble gas tracer applications, accounting for seasonal effects in different climate regions. The sampled data confirm a general reliability of common assumptions proposed in the literature. In particular, a solubility-controlled description of excess air formation and of groundwater degassing can be confirmed. This study identifies certain effects which need {{to be taken into account}} to reliably evaluate noble gas patterns. First, long-term samplings suggest a permanent temperature-driven equilibration of shallow groundwater with <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles,</b> even some years after recharge. Second, minor groundwater degassing is found to challenge existing excess air model approaches, depending on the amount and the fractionation of excess air. Third, soil air composition data of this study imply a potential bias of noble gas temperatures by up to about 2 °C due to microbial oxygen depletion and a reduced sum value of O 2 +CO 2. This effect causes systematically lower noble gas temperatures in tropical groundwater samples and in shallow mid-latitude groundwater samples after strong recharge during the warm season. However, a general bias of noble gas temperatures in mid-latitudes is probably prevented by a predominant recharge during the cold season, accompanied by nearly atmospheric noble gas mixing ratios in the soil air. Findings of this study provide a remarkable contribution to the reliability of noble gas tracer applications in hydrology, in particular with regard to paleoclimate reconstructions and an understanding of subsurface gas dynamics...|$|R

However, entrapment of an air microbubble into the ink channel can severely impede the productivity and reliability of the printing system. The <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> disturbs the channel acoustics resulting in disrupted drop formation and failure of the ink channel. In this research we study air entrapment in a normal inkjet printhead and a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based inkjet printhead. By using the actuating piezo transducer in receive the acoustics inside the channel could be monitored, clearly identifying the presence of an air microbubble inside the channel during a channel failure. A model was developed to calculate the two-way coupling between the channel acoustics and the disturbing bubble. The model was validated by simultaneous acoustical and infrared detection of the bubble. Using a glass inset in the normal printhead and a infrared visualization technique for the MEMS printhead allowed for an accurate depiction of the bubble size and its translational dynamics inside the print head. The model proves to be a very valuable tool in calculating the presence, the size and the position of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> inside an operating ink printhead, purely from its acoustic response. We also studied the details of droplet formation with the Brandaris ultrahigh-speed imaging facility at frame rates of up to 10 million frames per second and using an even faster stroboscopic technique of order 5 nanoseconds. The highly reproducible recordings were analyzed to give the local flow rate and velocity distribution within the droplet. The results are compared to a 1 -dimensional model based on the lubrication approximation. In the model the equations are solved on an Eulerian grid with a second order accurate scheme. The pinch-off singularity is prevented by regularization of the surface tension at small radius and overall we find excellent agreement with the experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|The NASA Manned Space Program uses an {{electrocardiograph}} (ECG) {{system to}} monitor astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA). This ECG system, called the Operational Bioinstrumentation System (OBS), was {{developed during the}} Apollo era. Throughout the Shuttle program these electrodes experienced failures during several EVAs performed from the Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) airlocks. An attempt during Shuttle Flight STS- 109 to replace the old electrodes with new commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) disposable electrodes proved unsuccessful. One assumption for failure of the STS- 109 COTS electrodes was the expansion of trapped gases under the foam electrode pad, causing the electrode to be displaced from the skin. Given that our current electrodes provide insufficient reliability, a number of COTS ECG electrodes were tested at the NASA Altitude Manned Chamber Test Facility. Methods: OBS disposable electrodes were tested on human test subjects in an altitude chamber simulating an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) operating pressure of 4. 3 psia with the following goals: (1) to confirm {{the root cause of}} the flight certified, disposable electrode failure during flight STS- 109. (2) to identify an adequate COTS replacement electrode and determine if further modifications to the electrodes are required. (3) to evaluate the adhesion of each disposable electrode without preparation of the skin with isopropyl alcohol. Results: There were several electrodes that failed the pressure testing at 4. 3 psia, including the electrodes used during flight STS- 109. Two electrodes functioned well throughout all testing and were selected for further testing in an EMU at altitude. A vent hole placed in all electrodes was also tested as a possible solution to prevent gas expansion from causing electrode failures. Conclusions: Two failure modes were identified: (1) foam-based porous electrodes <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> under the pad (2) poor adhesion caused some electrodes to fai...|$|R
40|$|Structural designs barely {{consider}} the dynamic scenario of a well-developed impinging wave hitting the structure. The usual area of {{focus is on}} static and stability factors (e. g. drag, inertia, resistive forces related to weight, buoyancy, sliding etc). Even the "Factor of Safety" which is regularly used in designs to account for unknown and/or unforeseen situations which might occur implies a degree of uncertainty about the dynamic scenario of breaking waves in the coastal environment. In the present study the hydrodynamics of a coastal structure-turbulent bore interaction was studied by examination (two-dimensional) of the singular case of a plunging breaking wave forming a well developed turbulent bore which impacted on a model sea wall structure. The turbulent bore impact event was found to display similar characteristics to the impact event of other wave shapes, in particular that of a plunging breaker. Examination of the impact event confirmed the conversion of nearly all horizontal velocity to vertical velocity during the "flip through" event. In accordance with theoretical expectations the location of maximum pressure was found to occur just below the still water level (SWL). Resulting pressure data {{in the present study}} consisted of two blunt spikes as opposed to the "church-roof" (high spike) shape seen in other results. The shape of the pressure data was attributed to the following: firstly, to the initial impact of the protruding jet of the breaking wave which causes the first maxima, secondly, to the sensor encountering the bulk of the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> hence causing the drop in pressure between the blunt spikes and lastly, to the inherent hydrostatic pressure combined with the compression of the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles,</b> by the subsequent forward motion of the water within the wave, which causes the second maxima. The point of maximum pressure was found to always be within the second maxima. Observation of the turbulent bore-structure interaction showed that the consequential maximum pressure was {{a direct result of the}} compression of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> by the weight of the water in the wave as it continued forward onto the structure combined with the inherent hydrostatic pressure of the wave. The project was conducted in an attempt to contribute to the vast knowledge of coastal structure-wave interactions and to add to the understanding of the physics and characteristics of breaking waves. Whilst numerous studies and experiments have been carried out on the phenomenon of breaking waves by previous researchers the current project highlights the advent of new equipment and technological advances in existing methods...|$|R
40|$|We present fluid {{dynamics}} videos illustrating wetting splashing-produced by water drop impact onto hydrophobic microstructures at high impact velocity (∼ 3 ms^- 1). The substrate consists of regular and transparent microtextures in square or hexagonal lattice, yielding a high contact angle of ∼ 150 ^∘. Our high speed top-or-bottom view recordings through the transparent surface {{shed light on}} the solid-liquid-air interfaces at impact. Despite the superhydrophobicity of the latticed micropillars (of a periodicity of 10 μm), water droplet wets a certain central area and moreover <b>entraps</b> an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> beneath the droplet. Besides the central wet area, lamella surf on air splashing outward at high impinging velocity. The effects of micropatterns and air pressure on the impact outcome are also examined. We show that microscopic boundary condition, imposed by the solid texture, profoundly influences the macroscopic flow dynamics upon superhydrophobic surfaces at high impinging velocity. In addition, the intervening air between the liquid and the solid plays a crucial role in directional splash, which can be eliminated by a reduced air pressure. Comment: 2 videos attache...|$|R
40|$|For {{a limited}} set of impact conditions, a drop {{impacting}} onto a pool can <b>entrap</b> an <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> {{as large as}} its own size. The subsequent rise and rupture of this large bubble {{plays an important role}} in aerosol formation and gas transport at the air-sea interface. The large bubble is formed when the impact crater closes up near the pool surface and is known to occur only for drops that are prolate at impact. Herein we use experiments and numerical simulations to show that a concentrated vortex ring, produced in the neck between the drop and the pool, controls the crater deformations and pinchoff. However, it is not the strongest vortex rings that are responsible for the large bubbles, as they interact too strongly with the pool surface and self-destruct. Rather, it is somewhat weaker vortices that can deform the deeper craters, which manage to pinch off the large bubbles. These observations also explain why the strongest and most penetrating vortex rings emerging from drop impacts are not produced by oblate drops but by more prolate drop shapes, as had been observed in previous experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} steady {{shearing}} versus z-blade mixing on mechanical aeration and gas retaining {{ability of the}} dough during processing and subsequent proofing and bread baking stages was investigated. Reduction in moisture content led to reduction in both static and dynamic densities of z-blade mixed dough. At low moisture content, dough had higher consistency and tended to physically <b>entrap</b> more <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> upon processing, leading to a higher dough volume and, thereby a low density. The results showed that both processes led to similar mechanical aeration as measured by static dough density immediately after processing. Shearing at a low rotational speed, led to similar proofing dough volume as z-blade mixing did. Nevertheless, both dough expansion test and breadmaking trials showed {{a significant reduction in}} gas retaining ability of sheared dough, especially at higher rotational speeds. This is {{explained by the fact that}} higher shear rates could break up the gluten network and negatively influence gas retaining ability. The results revealed the influence of processing conditions; e. g. the type of deformation flow on dough aeration. Furthermore, it was shown that rotational speed in the shearing system influences the aeration and gas holding ability of the dough during proofing and baking processes...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{breaking}} is {{an important}} coastal process, influencing hydro-morphodynamic processes such as turbulence generation and wave energy dissipation, run-up {{on the beach and}} overtopping of coastal defence structures. During breaking, waves are complex mixtures of air and water (“white water”) whose properties affect velocity and pressure fields {{in the vicinity of the}} free surface and, depending on the breaker characteristics, different mechanisms for air entrainment are usually observed. Several laboratory experiments have been performed to investigate the role of <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in the wave breaking process (Chanson & Cummings, 1994, among others) and in wave loading on vertical wall (Oumeraci et al., 2001; Peregrine et al., 2006, among others), showing that the air phase is not negligible since the turbulent energy dissipation involves air-water mixture. The recent advancement of numerical models has given valuable insights in the knowledge of wave transformation and interaction with coastal structures. Among these models, some solve the RANS equations coupled with a free-surface tracking algorithm and describe velocity, pressure, turbulence and vorticity fields (Lara et al. 2006 a-b, Clementi et al., 2007). The single-phase numerical model, in which the constitutive equations are solved only for the liquid phase, neglects effects induced by air movement and trapped <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> in water. Numerical approximations at the free surface may induce errors in predicting breaking point and wave height and moreover, <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> <b>bubbles</b> and water splash in air are not properly represented. The aim of the present thesis is to develop a new two-phase model called COBRAS 2 (stands for Cornell Breaking waves And Structures 2 phases), that is the enhancement of the single-phase code COBRAS 0, originally developed at Cornell University (Lin & Liu, 1998). In the first part of the work, both fluids are considered as incompressible, while the second part will treat air compressibility modelling. The mathematical formulation and the numerical resolution of the governing equations of COBRAS 2 are derived and some model-experiment comparisons are shown. In particular, validation tests are performed in order to prove model stability and accuracy. The simulation of the rising of a large <b>air</b> <b>bubble</b> in an otherwise quiescent water pool reveals the model capability to reproduce the process physics in a realistic way. Analytical solutions for stationary and internal waves are compared with corresponding numerical results, in order to test processes involving wide range of density difference. Waves induced by dam-break in different scenarios (on dry and wet beds, as well as on a ramp) are studied, focusing on the role of air as the medium in which the water wave propagates and on the numerical representation of bubble dynamics. Simulations of solitary and regular waves, characterized by both spilling and plunging breakers, are analyzed with comparisons with experimental data and other numerical model in order to investigate air influence on wave breaking mechanisms and underline model capability and accuracy. Finally, modelling of air compressibility is included in the new developed model and is validated, revealing an accurate reproduction of processes. Some preliminary tests on wave impact on vertical walls are performed: since air flow modelling allows to have a more realistic reproduction of breaking wave propagation, the dependence of wave breaker shapes and aeration characteristics on impact pressure values is studied and, on the basis of a qualitative comparison with experimental observations, the numerical simulations achieve good results. ...|$|R
