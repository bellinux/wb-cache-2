50|$|In the sonnet {{there are}} both neoclassical and romantic elements: {{references}} to the classical tradition (Aphrodite, Homer and Odysseus) <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of neoclassicism and {{the focus on the}} poet, the theme of graves and remains and the homesickness <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> of romanticism.|$|R
5|$|The rocks {{belong to}} the calc-alkaline series. Trace element data are typical for Central Volcanic Zone rocks. High {{potassium}} content <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for shoshonite-like lavas erupted at large distance from the trenches.|$|E
5|$|According to Swami Vivekananda, Sita <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of India – the {{idealized}} India. Swami Vivekananda assured if world {{literature of}} the past and world {{literature of the}} future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another Sita, because Sita is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E

50|$|Hwangseok-ri House has a layout that <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> of commoners' houses {{found in}} this province.

5|$|Built on former {{reservation}} {{lands of}} Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Indians, Lawton {{was founded on}} August 6, 1901, and was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine–American War. Lawton's landscape <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of the Great Plains, with flat topography and gently rolling hills, while the area {{north of the city}} is marked by the Wichita Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. September Morn <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of his style.|$|E

5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking. Poverty of thought {{is one of}} the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and might also be a feature of severe depression or dementia. A patient with dementia might also experience thought perseveration. Formal thought disorder is a common feature of schizophrenia. Circumstantial thinking might be observed in anxiety disorders or certain kinds of personality disorders.|$|E
5|$|In classes where {{horses are}} {{turned out in}} saddle seat equipment, it <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for the horse to be shown in a single curb bit with a bit shank under , rather than the double bridle more common to other saddle seat breeds. Riders wear typical saddle seat attire. Hats are not always mandatory, but use of safety helmets is allowed and ranges from {{strongly}} encouraged to required in some pleasure division classes.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E

40|$|Predatory {{behaviour}} of Yllenus arenarius hunting flies (Diptera) was studied. The general spider's {{approach and}} capture <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> for salticids hunting prey that has high ability to escape. Two modes of approach {{in close proximity}} of prey were observed. One <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> {{for the majority of}} predatory encounters where the spider's velocity was significantly reduced with decreasing distance to prey. Stalk and movement masking <b>were</b> <b>typical</b> for this type of approach. Second mode occurred sporadically and was characterized by a high spider's velocity that was not reduced {{in the vicinity of the}} prey...|$|R

5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of the north-west of Europe, {{although several}} of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds {{for a variety of}} seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|E
5|$|The Computer Language Benchmarks Game {{compares the}} {{performance}} of implementations of typical programming problems in several programming languages. The submitted Perl implementations typically perform toward {{the high end of}} the memory-usage spectrum and give varied speed results. Perl's performance in the benchmarks game <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for interpreted languages.|$|E
5|$|The Country Wife is more neatly {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> {{of its time}} and place in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's impotence trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} has {{a melting}} point of 1920 °C, body-centered cubic crystal lattice and a lattice constant a = 1088.0 ± 0.5 pm. Upon heating to 1200 °C, the cubic Bk2O3 transforms to a monoclinic structure, which further converts to a hexagonal phase at 1750 °C; the latter transition is reversible. Such three-phase behavior <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> for the actinide sesquioxides.|$|E
