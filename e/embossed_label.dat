5000|$|Jaroslawski {{collaborated with}} Baccarat for the perfume bottles but also had {{commissioned}} Lalique {{to create the}} luxurious Art Nouveau glass medallions. Baccarat produced the classic Ybry perfume bottle, a flattened square in colored crystal. These beautiful bottles were made by overlaying colored crystal on white crystal to create an opaque and unique luminescent quality. Each different color, was related to a particular perfume, and to a different gem. The colors range from a red, slag green to a darker green, jet black, orange to butterscotch, deep purple to lavender. Most of the time, the bottles had matching enameled and gilded metal covers. These covers were placed over the inner stoppers at an angle on {{one corner of the}} bottle. The atomizers came equipped with either chrome or gilt brass hardware. The colored bottles had round gold foil <b>embossed</b> <b>labels,</b> the black bottles had square, silver foil <b>embossed</b> <b>labels.</b> This bottle received a patent granted on 1925.The bottles ranged in size from 7 7/8" [...] tall down to diminutive sample sizes of just 1 3/8" [...] tall. The presentation boxes were covered with fine leather and often had color-coordinated small triangular segments and luxurious silk tassels. Other boxes looked like little suitcases and were covered in suede, and held multiple presentations, such as three bottles and two atomizers. Another rare example held two bottles, one atomizer and a Lalique medallion attached to the case with a silk tassel.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{methods of}} thermal, {{mechanical}} and surface analyses of biodegradable PCL/PLA composites {{with the addition}} of different concentrations of coconut fibres were performed. The aim was to assess the potential of these composite materials for the relief-printing plates as an alternative to classical photopolymer materials. Differential scanning calorimetry, surface free energy calculations and hardness measurements were performed on the samples. Results have shown that most thermal transitions that are characteristic for PLA and PCL do not take place in the area of temperatures applicable in the printing process. Most thermal transitions were not affected by the addition of coconut fibres. Coconut fibres in the composite structure contributed to the increased hardness of the material. Moreover, the hardness range of the prepared PCL/PLA composites was within the range of some classic photopolymer printing plates. By adding coconut fibres in higher concentrations, surface free energy of the materials decreased, which enables a wider application of the material for the production of printing plates. From the obtained results it can be concluded that there is a potential for the use of PCL/PLA biodegradable composite materials in the manufacture of various relief-printing plates for different printing techniques (letterpress, <b>embossing,</b> <b>label</b> printing) ...|$|R

He took the prompt to devise and patent accurate methods for constructing graduated cylinders, as well as reagent bottles with an <b>embossed</b> ground <b>label,</b> which were widely used.

Specifically, those {{who are visually impaired}} are not able to see common details of clothing (i. e., colors, texture, sizes, pricing) they intend to buy, making these individuals subject to seeking help from others or having to opt for using the same colors and patterns for all of their clothing. Introducing a Braille design <b>embossed</b> on the <b>label</b> would allow visually impaired individuals to read crucial data about the piece of clothing. The subjects for this study included a convenience sample of visually impaired individuals from a midsize, Midwest university. Visually impaired individuals face challenges while shopping for clothing, especially in the identification of the prices, color, and size of the clothes. The results show that dependence on family members is high and seems to be a primary option the participants have.
