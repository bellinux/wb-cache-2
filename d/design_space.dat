Unfortunately, no satisfactory theory exists to explain the discrepancies between the uniform crossover and the traditional approaches.|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} and recognition received by [...] "Cog" [...] led {{a number of}} other companies to create pieces in a similar vein—either as homages, in parody, or simply to further explore the <b>design</b> <b>space.</b> The first of these was Just Works, a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 directory assistance service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners. Just Works was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith, whose previous work included spots for BT Cellnet, Heinz, and Guinness, and the Oscar-nominated short film Holiday Romance. Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy their advert, which, under BACC guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second Just Works spots from appearing on British television. Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted virally. Just Works went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from The One Club.|$|E

2500|$|A {{self-replicating}} {{machine is}} a type of autonomous robot that is capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials found in the environment, thus exhibiting self-replication in a way analogous to that found in nature. The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by Homer Jacobsen, Edward F. Moore, Freeman Dyson, John von Neumann and in more recent times by K. Eric Drexler in his book on nanotechnology, Engines of Creation (coining the term clanking replicator [...] for such machines) and by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in their review Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator <b>design</b> <b>space.</b> The future development of such technology {{is an integral part of}} several plans involving the mining of moons and asteroid belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of solar power satellites in space. The possibly misnamed von Neumann probe is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the universal constructor, a self-replicating machine that would operate in a cellular automata environment.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have doubted {{both the}} {{feasibility}} of self-replicating nanorobots and {{the feasibility of}} control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of mutations removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations. [...] Advocates address the first doubt {{by pointing out that}} the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of Lego blocks, was built and operated experimentally in 2002. [...] While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; [...] similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. [...] Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology, and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator <b>design</b> <b>space</b> recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.|$|E

Its purpose is to guarantee end product quality within a range of manufacturing boundaries. The effects of scale up activities should be fully understood by the manufacturer. Most initial <b>design</b> <b>space</b> conclusions are based upon laboratory testing or pilot batches with scale up effects being inferred by experimentation or based on statistical evidence, simulations, or studies. Ongoing <b>design</b> <b>space</b> verification should be dependent upon the results of an assessment of risk involved with scale up activities. More specifically, how scaling up production affects scale-dependent variables. It should be noted that <b>design</b> <b>space</b> verification is much more focused in scope than overall process validation. <b>Design</b> <b>space</b> verification specifically aims to confirm output quality within a given operating range. This allows for changes in operating level flexibility while guaranteeing production quality, and allows for changes in production quantities without necessitating a reevaluation of the production process.|$|E

Changes in manufacturing output within the <b>design</b> <b>space</b> should not present any risks.
