40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{progress}} of the first court-ordered trial of alcohol ignition interlocks in Queensland. It focuses on the predominant factors affecting the implementation of the program and the current self-reported impact of using interlocks on key program outcomes such as drinking and drink driving behaviours. The report highlights issues influencing participation rates, the relationship between the downloaded and selfreported data and provides suggestions for future interlock programs. Characteristics of the Interlock Program A trial of alcohol ignition interlocks is currently being implemented in Queensland, with the aim being to determine whether the device in combination with a drink driving rehabilitation program is more effective than the rehabilitation program alone in reducing drink driving recidivism. This approach is based on recent research that is demonstrating interlocks in combination with rehabilitation programs and intensive supervision increases the possibility of long-term behavioural change (Marques, Voas et al., 2000). In the Queensland interlock trial, the rehabilitation program that is combined with <b>interlock</b> <b>installation</b> is an 11 -wee...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{impaired}} driving can {{be estimated}} {{through the use of}} several technologies but few programs utilize the full spectrum of predictive technologies and often underutilize the ones they do employ. The record of alcohol ignition interlock breath alcohol (BAC) tests are good predictors of future DUI risk, but still not widely used. These are a good, but imperfect predictor, since drivers other than the DUI offender of record can use the interlock car. Biological markers of alcohol use can more directly target the impairment risk of specific individuals. Use of biomarkers to monitor progress among DUI offenders is growing in Europe but less so in North America. A sample of 537 interlock using DUI offenders from Alberta, Canada have been providing self-report assessments as well as biological specimens at two time points, the beginning of an <b>interlock</b> <b>installation,</b> and typically 6 months later, to determine: a) the predictive relationship between the biomarkers and the record of interlock BAC tests, b) the cross-relationship among the biomarkers, c) the relationship between the biomarkers and self-report assessments, and d) {{the extent to which the}} markers, self-report, and interlock BAC tests can correctly predict futur...|$|R

40|$|Six legislatively-based safety {{improvement}} measures (LSIMs) were proposed for evaluation within a rural safety policy improvement index (RSPII) framework during Phase I of this project. This report documents the step-by- step {{application of the}} RSPII framework and its rural roadway crash fatality reduction results for these LSIMs. Several approaches to the framework application were completed for each LSIM and the results compared. It was estimated (based on the selection of one framework outcome for each LSIM) that rural roadway crash fatalities could be reduced by 209 from the primary enforcement of seat belt use, 299 from universal motorcycle helmet use, 322 from the regular application of sobriety checkpoints, 120 from graduated driver licensing program upgrades, 268 from the mandatory ignition <b>interlock</b> <b>installation,</b> and 699 from automated speed enforcement. These estimates cannot be summed, however, because the fatalities impacted by these LSIMs sometimes overlap. The assumptions and generalizations required to overcome challenges to the RSPII framework application will also {{have an impact on}} its results. Additional LSIM research is suggested and it is recommended that the estimates in this report be used {{as a starting point for}} rural roadway safety discussions and the completion of more accurate individual state RSPII framework applications...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The paper {{reports on}} a {{longitudinal}} study that focused on both quantitative and qualitative data to {{examine the impact of}} alcohol ignition interlocks on a group of recidivist drink drivers from a users’ perspective. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study utilised a case-study approach to investigate 12 participants’ self-reported perceptions and experiences of using an interlock and the effect that the device had on key program outcomes such as drinking levels, operational performance, circumvention attempts and general beliefs regarding the effectiveness of the device in comparison to traditional legal sanctions. RESULTS: Participants reported positive appraisals regarding the effectiveness of the device as qualitative themes emerged concerning the educational and practical benefits of interlocks in comparison to traditional sanctions. However, closer examination of individual interlock performances revealed each participant had attempted to start their vehicle after consuming alcohol, and a smaller sample of three drivers were regularly attempting to start their vehicle after drinking. The combination and analysis of self-reported and downloaded interlock data revealed four main themes: (a) initial operational difficulties, (b) a general unwillingness to reduce alcohol consumption levels, (c) an unwillingness to acknowledge/recognise that interlock breath violations resulted from drinking, and (d) an overall decline in the frequency of interlock breath violations over the <b>interlock</b> <b>installation</b> period. A further notable finding was that half the sample still consumed harmful levels of alcohol upon program completion. CONCLUSIONS: This paper will further outline the major findings of the program of research and consider treatment implications for individuals who continue to be unwilling to change drinking behaviours...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} predictive diagnostic in high-power transformers. Particularly, this paper is focused on their use in uninterruptible power supply systems for safety critical applications, such as railway <b>interlocking</b> signaling <b>installations.</b> With respect {{to the state of}} the art, where typically only thermal and electrical faults are monitored, this work proposes a distributed network of measuring nodes where also vibration-based mechanical stress diagnosis is implemented. Mechanical degradation is tracked through vibration measures, using multichannel accelerometers, with sensitivity down to 0. 5 mg and local signal processing in the transformed frequency domain, up to 1 kHz. A compact hardware-software implementation of the nodes is also presented. The performances of the diagnostic system are assessed through experimental measurements on real three-phase high-power transformers used in railway applications...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports a}} trial of an {{extension}} of the "Under the Limit" Drink Driving Rehabilitation program (UTL) to include ignition interlocks which commenced in February 2001. The task of implementation has been extremely complex and required policy advice and decision support from senior staff on issues such as administrative requirements associated with licensing and offence data, policing, implications for the offender's vehicle insurance, civil liberties and equity issues, and advice on sentencing options and offender supervision. It is considered both impractical and unacceptable for offenders in each court to be randomly allocated to the trial and the solution was to randomly allocate courts to the intervention or control groups, rather than offenders. The current trial aimed to establish if it is possible to achieve reduced recidivism, including post interlock reductions, by using associated systematic rehabilitation and probation {{with the use of the}} interlocks. This model builds on latest international research findings and the work on barriers to the use of interlocks identified in other states in Australia. The importance of trying to implement the interlock in such a way that a sustained reduction in recidivism can be achieved has been a major focus of the project. The model that was accepted for the Queensland trial has an initial period of full licence disqualification during which time the UTL rehabilitation program is completed, followed by <b>interlock</b> <b>installation</b> with no additional restrictions. Currently, 29 participants have installed an interlock and 147 offenders have participated in the research project and formed part of a comparison group. A preliminary evaluation of the trial indicates that interlocks have the potential to reduce re-offence rates as well as produce a positive impact on other key program outcomes i. e., reduce drinking levels. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed if interlocks were to be implemented beyond the trial and to move beyond the current limited take up rates...|$|R

40|$|Concern remains {{regarding}} {{the efficacy of}} drink driving countermeasures to produce lasting change for repeat offenders, as {{a wide array of}} countermeasures have been developed that demonstrate varying levels of success in reducing re-offence rates. This thesis proposes that the collection and examination of repeat offenders' self-reported perceptions, experiences and behavioural changes that result from completing court-ordered interventions can provide valuable contributions to the development of effective sentencing strategies. As a result, the program of research implemented a mixed-method design to investigate the self-reported impact of legal sanctions, a drink driving rehabilitation program, and alcohol ignition interlocks on key outcome measures for a group of recidivist drink drivers. [...] - Study One incorporated a cross-sectional design to examine the deterrent effect of traditional legal sanctions (e. g., fines and licence disqualification periods), non-legal sanctions, alcohol consumption, recent offending behaviour(s), and the actual severity of sanctions on perceptual deterrence and intentions to re-offend. The study involved face-to-face and telephone interviews with 166 repeat offenders. The analysis indicated that participants perceived legal sanctions to be severe, but not entirely certain nor swift. [...] - In Study One, self-reported recent drink driving behaviours and alcohol consumption levels were identified as predictors of future intentions to drink and drive. The results suggest that habitual behaviours are difficult to change, and heavy alcohol consumption levels increase the probability of re-offending. At a bivariate level, three non-legal sanctions were negatively associated with intentions to re-offend but were not predictors of future intentions to drink and drive in the model. In addition, a relationship was not evident between: (a) the size of the penalties and perceptions of sanction severity or future intentions to drink and drive, and (b) the number of previous convictions and self-reported deterrence. The findings of the study confirm the popular assumption that some repeat offenders are impervious to the threat and application of legal sanctions. [...] - Study Two examined the stages of change and self-efficacy levels of 132 repeat offenders - who were all involved in Study One - while they completed an 11 week drink driving rehabilitation program. A repeated measures design was implemented to focus on the impact of the intervention on a number of salient program outcomes such as participants' motivations and self-efficacy levels to control and change their drinking and drink driving behaviour(s). Prior to program commencement, the majority of participants were motivated to change their drinking driving, but not their drinking. The sample also reported high self-efficacy levels to control the two behaviours, but did not have high expectations of the effectiveness of the program. [...] - Upon completion of the program, significant increases were evident in motivations to change drinking and drink driving behaviours, and a large percentage of participants reported a positive appraisal of the effectiveness of the intervention. Program completion also resulted in a reduction in self-reported alcohol consumption levels, yet the majority of the sample continued to consume harmful levels of alcohol. Self-efficacy levels remained high, although a notable finding was that participants reported higher levels of control over their drinking rather than drink driving behaviours. In general, Study Two provided a positive perspective of the capacity of a drink driving rehabilitation program to produce change for a group of repeat offenders. [...] - Study Two extended a small body of research and examined the effects that mandated program enrolment has on motivations to change, as well as expectations and appraisals of program effectiveness. Contrary to predictions, mandated participants did not report lower levels of motivation to change drinking and drink driving compared to voluntary attendees, but did indicate lower expectations of the effectiveness of the program, as well as being willing to engage in the program. Furthermore upon program completion, mandated participants also reported lower appraisals of the effectiveness of the program, but this factor was not associated with intentions to re-offend or non-program completion. Rather, not successfully completing the program appeared linked with being unwilling to change drinking behaviours. [...] - Study Three involved a longitudinal case-study design that utilised both quantitative and qualitative data to conduct one of the first examinations of the impact of alcohol ignition interlocks on a group of recidivist drink drivers from a users' perspective. The study investigated 12 participants' self-reported perceptions and experiences of using an interlock and the effect that the device had on key program outcomes such as drinking levels, operational performance, circumvention attempts and general beliefs {{regarding the}} effectiveness of the device in comparison to traditional legal sanctions. [...] - Participants reported positive appraisals regarding the effectiveness of the device as qualitative themes emerged concerning the educational and practical benefits of interlocks. However, closer examination of individual interlock performances revealed each participant had attempted to start their vehicle after consuming alcohol, and a smaller sample of three drivers were regularly attempting to start their vehicle after drinking. The combination and analysis of self-reported and downloaded interlock data revealed four main themes: (a) initial operational difficulties, (b) a general unwillingness to reduce alcohol consumption levels, (c) an unwillingness to acknowledge/recognise that interlock breath violations resulted from drinking, and (d) an overall decline in the frequency of interlock breath violations over the <b>interlock</b> <b>installation</b> period. Similar to Study Two, a notable finding was that half the sample was still consuming harmful levels of alcohol upon program completion. [...] - Taken together, the results of the program of research highlight that repeat offenders' entrenched behaviours, such as drinking and drink driving, are resistant to change and that multi-modal interventions are required if the drinking and driving sequence is to be broken for this population. The findings have direct implications for the sentencing and management of repeat offenders and the development of countermeasures that attempt to produce long-term behavioural change...|$|R
