5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses. Many quality female footballers leave their home countries for better opportunities elsewhere. Another issue facing women's football is institutional. Most of the funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> in Africa comes from FIFA, not from national football federations.|$|E
5|$|The {{most basic}} type of {{meetings}} are all-comers track meets, which are largely small, local, informal competitions that allow {{people of all}} ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a {{successful}} appeal by the British, judges reversed {{the result of}} the match, granting Sarah Stevenson two points for a final round kick to her opponent's head which the judges had previously missed. The reversal of the decision, after video footage was considered, is thought to be a first <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b> Another British hopeful, Aaron Cook, was also unhappy with the judges after losing out on bronze in the men's −80kg.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jumping {{technique}} {{has played a}} significant part {{in the history of}} the event. High jumpers typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This {{technique has}} become the overwhelming standard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E
5|$|Kumaritashvili's {{family has}} had a long {{association}} with luge. His father, David, won a USSR Youth Championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union, and was a three-time champion at the Spartakiad, once in two-man bobsled and twice in luge. His uncle, Felix Kumaritashvili, served {{as the head of the}} Georgian Luge Federation. Nodar's grandfather, Aleko Kumaritashvili, introduced luge to Georgia after training <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> in East Germany. Aleko helped establish a luge run in Bakuriani in 1970, and a more developed track funded by the Soviet authorities was built in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Maeda {{was born}} in Funazawa Village, Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, on November 18, 1878. He {{attended}} Kenritsu Itiu high school (currently Hirokou—a Hirosaki school). As a child, {{he was known as}} Hideyo. He practiced sumo as a teenager, but lacked the ideal build <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b> Because of the interest generated by stories about the success of judo at contests between judo and jujutsu that were occurring at the time, he changed from sumo to judo. In 1894, at seventeen years of age, his parents sent him to Tokyo to enroll in Waseda University. He took up Kodokan judo the following year.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E
5|$|That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, {{becoming}} the international governing body for track and field, and it enshrined amateurism {{as one of}} its founding principles <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b> The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1921, {{making it one of the}} most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of track and field at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental track and field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.|$|E

5|$|There {{are over}} 3,000 {{registered}} hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, {{is a common}} activity on Mauna Kea. A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b> Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.|$|E
5|$|Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy is a centre <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> {{of sailing}} on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, {{on the south}} coast of England. The academy {{building}} is located in Osprey Quay on {{the northern tip of}} the island, and the waters of Portland Harbour and Weymouth Bay, adjacent to the site, are the main areas used for sailing. Local, national and international sailing events have been held at the site since it was opened in 2000, and in 2005 WPNSA was selected to host the sailing events at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E
5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon {{and then leave}} it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is to}} demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

5|$|After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a {{year away}} from swimming, {{scheduling}} a return for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. However, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation. From early 2011, there was speculation about Thorpe's return to swimming, fuelled by people claiming to have seen him training. The speculations were substantiated when Thorpe spoke at a February 2011 press conference of his return to swimming after four years away, with the aim of competing in the 2012 London Olympic Games. Thorpe competed at Australia's Olympic Trials in 2012, but failed to make the team. It was subsequently announced that he was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury. In 2014, he was presented with a Doctor of Letters from Macquarie University in recognition of his contribution <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport,</b> philanthropy and Indigenous rights.|$|E
5|$|Dion {{moved to}} Asbestos, Quebec after the {{conclusion}} of his hockey career and {{became involved in the}} local minor hockey movement, often in the capacity of a referee. He helped establish an arena in the city, the Centre Récréatif d'Asbestos, in 1954, which was later renamed Aréna Connie Dion. Since 1991, the Asbestos Minor Hockey Association has held an annual tournament at the arena in his honor. He also became involved in golf, designing several courses and helping lay foundations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> in Asbestos. He had a local tournament named after him in this sport as well, the inaugural edition of which was held in 1973. He was married to Muriel Flanigan, who died in 2011, and had four sons, Paul, Skip, Bob, and Mickey, and one daughter, Carol-Ann. He died on November 7, 2014 at the age of 96 at the Centre de Santé et Service Sociaux in Asbestos, following a two-week period of hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|Gliding is a {{recreational}} activity and competitive air sport in which pilots fly unpowered aircraft known as gliders or sailplanes using naturally occurring currents of rising {{air in the}} atmosphere to remain airborne. The word soaring is also used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport.</b> which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers {{in the rest of}} the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport,</b> and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sport</b> in the Cook Islands, and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E
