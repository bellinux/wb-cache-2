Two distinct combination strategies for the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), for konjac waste fermentation were compared. beta-Mannanase was added to facilitate the hydrolysis of glucomannan and to increase the fermentability of the substrate. The ABE concentration (6. 64 g/L) from SSF was less than that from SHF; the result from the control experiment was 4. 34 g/L of ABE. SHF obtained a higher production of total ABE solvents (10. 95 g/L) with 7. 10 g/L of butanol at a productivity rate of 0. 30 g/L/h. The effect of the bioactive alkaloid abundant in the konjac waste on ABE fermentation was evaluated. The results indicated that the alkaloid affected the ABE fermentation results when using C acetobutylicum, and the effective <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> can help to increase the butanol concentration and shorten the fermentation period. Therefore, the utilization of Amorphophallus konjac waste (a low-cost agricultural resource) in ABE fermentation provides an alternative to increase the economic viability of ABE production.

Methods: Different plant samples were analyzed for the content of atropine and scopolamine with capillary electrophoresis after solid phase <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> Plants were gathered from different areas of Slovenia between April and September 2004. Results: Results were compared and possible correlations between the alkaloid content and species, plant parts, growth conditions, and time of harvest were suggested.

40|$|A quick, {{efficient}} and environmentally beneficial approach for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> in goldenseal based on pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) is presented. PHWE was evaluated following {{the extraction of}} hydrastine and berberine which are the two main alkaloids of goldenseal. The effect s of temperature and other parameters on extraction yields were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The extraction yields were compared to those achieved through reflux and ultrasonic extraction methods. PHWE employed hot water at an optimal temperature of 140 ℃, a pressure of 50 bars and flow rate of 1 mL. min - 1 for extraction experiments conducted in the dynamic mode. Both PHWE and conventional methods achieved comparable extraction yields. Reflux and ultrasonic extractions had procedures that were slower (over 6 h) and employed large quantities (200 mL) of organic solvents. The PHWE method was simple and relatively fast as extraction was achieved in 15 min. At 95 % con fidence level (n = 3), reflux and ultrasonic methods recorded extraction yields that {{were not significantly different}} from that of PHWE. Moreover, PHWE employed a more readily available “ green ” solvent, (water) to achieve comparable results to those of conventional methods which utilize d organic solvents.

40|$|On aqueous {{two-phase}} systems (ATPS) {{composed of}} ionic liquids (ILs) {{it is often}} observed {{that the increase in}} the cation alkyl side chain length enhances the biomolecules extraction for the IL-rich phase. However, mounting evidences suggest that very long alkyl side chains are unfavorable to the separation. This change on the extraction trends was previously suggested to be due to micelle formation; yet, no evidence was provided and an evaluation of the effect of the pH and of the hydrophobicity of the biomolecules on the partition coefficients for a homologous family of ILs was never carried out. In this work a systematic study of the cation alkyl side chain length effect on the partitioning of a series of alkaloids of variable hydrophobicity in ATPS constituted by 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ILs ([C(n) mim]Cl) and potassium citrate (at controlled pH) was conducted. The results here reported show that the alkaloids partition coefficients increase with the cation alkyl chain length until the formation of micelles on the systems with cations larger than [C(6) mim]Cl. Cations with longer aliphatic chains are not favorable for the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> inducing a trendshift on the system by decreasing the partition coefficients or the preferential migration for the IL-rich phase. The pH of the media, and consequently the charged/non-charged state of the alkaloids, as well as the hydrophobicity of the molecules, do not alter the extraction pattern observed. These results indicate that the IL ability to form micelles in ATPS is the interfacial phenomenon that creates the trendshift observed in the partition coefficients. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Non-Supported Liquid Membrane Extraction (NSLME) {{is a new}} {{development}} extraction technology based on Supported Liquid Membrane Extraction (SLME). Sample extraction assembly is composed of three phases: an acceptor phase: phosphate–sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer solution at the bottom; an organic phase: chloroform applied as the non-supported liquid membrane in the middle layer; and a donor phase: aqueous solution samples containing alkaloids in the upper layer. The whole system is maintained stable by density difference among the three layers that avoided the mutual interferences. The alkaloid in the donor phase can spread to the underlying acidic acceptor phase, where {{it is able to}} form water soluble salt in the acid environment, and thus cannot return to the middle organic phase. Therefore, the transmission of alkaloid is a one-way path, and the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> can be achieved and enriched.

Applications discussed include: selective <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> in goldenseal followed by their degradation studies; in-cell clean-up of pesticides in medicinal plants employing custom made molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) sorbents; in-cell pre-concentration followed by desorption of aflatoxins in plants with MIPs; desorption of pesticides from electrospun nanofiber sorbents; and removal of templates from MIPs sorbents. It was demonstrated that selective extractions could be achieved by just changing the temperature of water while adjusting the pressure. For instance, the alkaloids in goldenseal (hydrastine and berberine), were extracted at 140 °C, 50 bars, 1 mL min⁻¹ in 15 min; organochlorine pesticides from medicinal plants were extracted at 260 °C, 80 bars, 1 mL min- 1 in 10 min; while aflatoxins AFG 2, AFG 1, AFB 2 and AFB 1 were extracted at 180 °C, 60 bars and a flow rate of 0. 5 mL min⁻¹ in 10 min. The selectivity of PHWE was further enhanced by combining it with selective MIPs sorbents at higher temperatutes. In-cell clean-up of interfering chlorophyll was successfully removed from the medicinal plants during pesticides analysis while clean-up of aflatoxins AFG 2, AFG 1, AFB 2 and AFB 1 was achieved in two extraction cells connected in series. Ultrasound was also combined with PHWE for extraction of hydrastine and berberine at 80 °C and 40 bars in 30 min. PHWE was further evaluated for removal of templates from quercetin, phthalocynine and chlorophyll MIPs.

Sample clean-up for alkaloids (hydrastine and berberine) in goldenseal, Hydrastis canadensis and flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin) in Ginkgo biloba was achieved using Bond Elut Plexa SPE sorbent. Clean-up of flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba was also achieved using electrospun polymer-silica composite (polystyrene-silica, polyacrylonitrile-silica and nylon 6 -silica) sorbents. All analysis of flavonoids and alkaloids was carried out using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC coupled with a diode array detector. Good peak separation was achieved in less than 6 min employing an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C 18 column (4. 6 x 75 mm, 3. 5 μm) at 35 ⁰C. The mobile phases employed were 0. 1 % phosphoric acid/methanol gradient and 0. 5 % phosphoric acid/methanol (40 : 60) for alkaloids and flavonoids respectively. The calibration curves exhibited linearity up to 120 μg mL⁻¹ with correlation coefficients of more than 0. 9980.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and interpretation of}} contaminants in tissues of wildlife belongs {{to the field of}} toxicology, a scientific discipline with a long, intriguing, and illustrious history (reviewed by Hayes 1991, Gallo 2001, Gilbert and Hayes 2006, Wax 2006). We review its history briefly, to provide a context for understanding the use of tissue residues in toxicology, and to explain how their use has developed over time. Because so much work has been conducted on mercury, and dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), separate case histories are included that describe the evolution of the use of tissue concentrations to assess exposure and effects of these two groups of contaminants in wildlife. The roots of toxicology date back to early man, who used plant and animal extracts as poisons for hunting and warfare. The Ebers papyrus (Egypt - 1550 BC) contains formulations for hemlock, aconite (arrow poison), opium, and various metals used as poisons. Hippocrates (- 400 BC) is sometimes credited with proposing the treatment of poisoning by decreasing absorption and using antidotes (Lane and Borzelleca 2007). Chanakya (350 - 283 BC), Indian advisor of the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (340 - 293 BC), urged the use of food tasters as a precaution against poisoning, and the Roman emperor Claudius may have even been poisoned by his taster Halotus in 54 AD. Moses ben Maimon (1135 - 1204), author of a treatise on poisoning, noted that dairy products could delay absorption of some poisons. Paracelsus (1493 - 1541) shaped the field of toxicology with his corollaries that experimentation is essential to examining the response, that therapeutic properties should be distinguished from toxic properties, that chemicals have specific modes of action, and that the dose makes the poison. The art of concocting and using poisons reached its 2 ̆ 2 zenith 2 ̆ 2 during the Italian Renaissance, eventually culminating in its commercialization by Catherine Deshayes (a. k. a., La Voisine, 1640 - 1680) in France. One of the first to suggest a chemical method for the detection of a poison in modern times was Herman Boerhaave (1668 - 1738), a physician and botanist, who, according to Jurgen Thorwald (The Century of the Detective), placed the suspected poison on red-hot coals, and tested for odors. The Spanish physician Orfila (1787 - 1853) served in the French court, and was the first toxicologist to systematically use autopsy and chemical analysis to prove poisoning. He has been credited with developing and refining techniques to detect arsenic poisoning.

40|$|Mondia whitei (Hook. f.) Skeels (Apocynaceae) is used across sub-Saharan Africa {{to treat}} a vast range of {{diseases}} and health conditions. The root is commonly chewed by men for its aphrodisiac and tonic properties, {{but it is also}} used for the treatment of asthenia and depression; these indications are suggestive for an effect at the central nervous system's level. Consistent with the botanical family of M. whitei, previous phytochemical analyses have revealed the presence <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> whose structures still remain unknown. Along the isolation and characterization <b>of</b> M. whitei <b>alkaloids,</b> these were found to be resulting from the formation of an artifact issuing from the known aromatic compound 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxybenzaldehyde (2 H 4 MBZA). The classical <b>extraction</b> process <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> based on the acid/base equilibrium of this class of compounds, requires the use of alkalizing substances, such as ammonia. This base reacts with the aldehydic carbonyl of 2 H 4 MBZA through a nucleophilic substitution reaction, yielding a new nitrogen compound. We next investigated 2 H 4 MBZA's reactivity towards the neurotransmitters: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Except for epinephrine, these biogenic amines were able to react with 2 H 4 MBZA, forming derived products whose putative structures were confirmed via mass spectrometry analysis. We suggest that the formation of such derivatives may explain the bioactivity of M. whitei in modulating the affinity of the neurotransmitters towards their receptors. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

40|$|Piperine is {{the main}} {{alkaloid}} from black pepper, {{which is responsible for}} its pungency. Nowadays, it is widely used in various herbal cough syrups, and it is also employed in the anti-inflammatory, anti-malarial, and anti-leukemia treatment [1]. Piperine can contribute to an increased bioavailability of many substances according to a number of mechanisms. It inhibits several enzymes responsible for metabolizing nutritional substances and stimulates amino acid transporters in the intestinal lining. Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that piperine can reduce the fat level in the bloodstream by inhibiting the fat cell differentiation [2]. In our studies, the classical solvent extraction and the Accelerated Solvent <b>Extraction</b> (ASE) <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> from the ground black pepper fruit was performed. Based on the literature [1], we selected the following system for running the thin-layer chromatographic analysis of piperine: stationary phase, silica gel; mobile phase, acetone + n-hexane, 3 : 2 (v/v). In our efforts to determine piperine in the commercially traded spices, we decided for TLC/densitometry as a well suited and very promising analytical technique. As main advantages of this technique, we consider its simplicity, rapidity, and cost-friendliness, and the quantitative results obtained with its aid are often comparable with those originating from HPLC. The results obtained in this study confirm an excellent performance of TLC/densitometry in the analysis of piperine contained in botanical material. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Biologically active {{substances}} (BAS) of barberry roots represented by <b>alkaloids</b> <b>of</b> isoquinoline group are perspective substances {{for development of}} preparations with multiple pharmacological activities. However, now manufacture of them in Ukraine is stopped. One of the reasons of this is out-of-date production technologies <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> involving use <b>of</b> toxic and/or flammable solvents. In the article possibility for application of liquefied gases in technology <b>of</b> obtaining <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> from barberry roots has been studied. Materials and methods. Initial raw herb drug were barberry (Berberis vulgaris) roots harvested in spring on the territory of Southern Ukraine. Their moisture content was 11 %, comminuting degree was 0, 5 - 1, 4 mm. At the first stage purification of raw herb drug from lipophilic impurities (defatting) was made with use of some liquefied gases: tetrafluoroethane, isobutane, difluorochloromethane and difluoromethane. <b>Extraction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloid</b> sum was made with difluoromethane mixed with various quantities of liquid ammonia or diethylamine as alkaline agent. Crude extracts were exposed to two-level liquefiedgas purification. At first the alkaloid bases were transformed into saline forms with aqueous solutions of acids and purified from ballast impurities with liquefied freon- 22. Then alkaloid salts were reextracted from aqueous phase in the base form with liquefied mixture of difluoromethane and ammonia. Mixing of liquid phases was provided by creation of alternate gradients of temperatures and, as consequence, pressures between separators feeding alternately cool water into jacket of one of them, and warm water – into jacket of another one. Quantity of lipophilic ballast impurities and also weight of extractives were determined gravimetrically. Quantitative analysis <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloid</b> sum was made by titrimetric method after sedimentation <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> with volumetric solution of phosphomolybdic acid. Results and discussion. It {{has been found that}} at stage of degreasing of raw crude drug the most selective solvent to lipophilic ballast compounds was isobutane and difluorochloromethane, but the latter was more rational for using in industrial scale concerning its fire-safety and economic availability. It has been also found that efficiency of the purification stage <b>of</b> Berberis <b>alkaloids</b> appreciably depends on composition of extracting solvent while obtaining of crude extracts. The best parameters in the finished product have been revealed after purification of the extracts obtained with difluoromethane containing 12 % of liquid ammonia: quantity <b>of</b> BAS (<b>alkaloids)</b> in the finished product reached 95 %, and their losses were insignificant – 3, 5 %. Increasing of cosolvent (ammonia) content in the extracting solvent considerably complicated purification of extractives, and losses <b>of</b> <b>alkaloids</b> raised to 13, 2 %, obviously as a result of presence of considerable quantity of hydrophylic ballast substances. Reducing of the ammonia content in the extracting solvent down to 1 % also caused negative impact on process of obtaining <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloids</b> which yield was the lowest among investigated assays. It’s possible to explain this by lower рН value in extracting medium, change of solvent polarity, therefore middle-polar and hydrophobic compounds preferably passed into composition of crude extracts. Conclusions. Acceptability for use of liquefied gases and their mixtures for purification <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloid</b> sum from barberry roots has been proved. It has been shown that prior to stage <b>of</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> these BAS it’s expedient to withdraw lipophilic impurities from the crude herbal drug with liquified difluorochloromethane (freon- 22). Purification efficiency of the finished product considerably depends on composition of extracting solvent during obtaining of crude extracts. The best parameters were found after purification of the extracts taken with difluoromethane containing 12 % of liquid ammonia. It’s the most expedient to purify crude extracts by two-step procedure using on the first step liquefied difluorochloromethane (freon- 22) as organic phase and on the second one – difluoromethane mixed with 10 % of ammonia, and as aqueous phase – 10 % acidic solutions; at the second step it’s necessary to provide liquid reextraction <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloid</b> bases in triplicate...|$|R
40|$|Neotyphodium lolii is a fungal {{endophyte}} of {{perennial ryegrass}} {Lolium perenne). In this symbiosis, alkaloids are produced that significantly {{impact on the}} performance of farmed animals. Little was previously known about the physiological conditions for the endophyte in the plant leading to their production. A strain of N. lolii, previously transformed with the β-D-glucuronidase (GUS) gene of E. coli under the control of a constitutive fungal promoter, was used for investigations into the in planta metabolic activity of the endophyte; distribution <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloids</b> ergovaline, peramine, and lolitrem B; and photosynthesis. In vitro studies with this transformed N. lolii strain demonstrated the utility of constitutive GUS expression for assessing the metabolic state of the endophyte. By using constitutive GUS expression and a method for quantitation of the in planta biomass of the endophyte, the endophyte metabolic state (EMS) in the grass plant was determined. The EMS was high and uniform in plant tissues and genotypes differing in endophyte concentration, indicating that proliferation of the endophyte in the plant is not controlled via the EMS. Ergovaline, peramine, and lolitrem B exhibited each a characteristic within-tiller distribution maintained across different plant genotypes. None <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloids</b> was distributed in exact proportion to the distribution of metabolically active endophyte mycelium. Differences in the accumulation <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloids</b> per mycelium were observed between plant tissues and plant genotypes, suggesting differential rates of synthesis and/or degradation <b>of</b> the <b>alkaloids</b> in the mycelium and translocation within the grass tiller. Rates of net photosynthesis at high light intensities were lower in plants infected by N. lolii, indicating for an effect on photosynthetic capacity. However this effect was plant-age dependent. Plant growth was not strongly affected by the endophyte, but infected plants had consistently lower leaf elongation rates. The changes in leaf elongation and photosynthetic capacity in infected plants might signal for an effect of N. lolii on the nitrogen metabolism of its host. The experiments concerning the in planta EMS, alkaloid distribution, plant growth, and photosynthesis were conducted in a controlled environment the establishment of which was part of this study. In addition, for the detailed mapping of ergovaline within the grass tiller a method for quantitative <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> this <b>alkaloid</b> was developed and optimised...|$|R
