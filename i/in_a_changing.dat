5|$|The Staffordshire Regiment {{only had}} a {{separate}} existence from 1959–2007. As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, Delivering Security <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> World, the regiment was merged with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose's {{finances}} {{entered the}} second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952–53, and income in 1957 (£104,000) was double what it had been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with the long hours, have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age. Last resigned as Principal in 1956, dying shortly after. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became Principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's patchy knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> environment. Herbert Hart, however, Principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.|$|E

25|$|The {{result is}} that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, {{becoming}} richer in component B.

Since 1990, reductions have been almost constant, through succeeding defence reviews: Options for Change (1990), Front Line First (1994), the Strategic Defence Review of 1998, Delivering Security <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> World (2003), and the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010.

25|$|As part of Delivering Security <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> World, the British Government's 2003 Defence White Paper, on 21 July 2004, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon {{detailed}} {{plans to}} reduce the number of Tornado F3 squadrons by one to three squadrons. This represented 16 aircraft and was the first stage in the transition to the F3's replacement, the Eurofighter Typhoon, which entered operational service with the RAF in 2005. In April 2009, it was announced that the Tornado F3 force would be reduced to one squadron of 12 aircraft in September 2009. The last operational Tornado F3s in RAF service were retired when No. 111 Squadron RAF, located at RAF Leuchars, was disbanded on 22 March 2011.|$|E
25|$|The carbon {{microphone}} is a sound-to-electrical signal transducer {{consisting of two}} metal plates separated by granules of carbon. When sound waves strike this plate, {{the pressure on the}} granules changes, which in turn changes the electrical resistance between the plates. A direct current is passed from one plate to the other, and the changing resistance results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> current, which can be passed through a telephone system, or used in other ways in electronics systems to change the sound into an electrical signal. After a lengthy court battle over patent rights filed in 1877, a United States federal court as well as a British court in 1878 ruled in favor of Thomas Alva Edison over a claim held by Emile Berliner since Edison indisputably preceded Berliner in inventing the transmission of speech as well as the use of carbon in a transmitter.|$|E
