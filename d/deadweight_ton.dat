Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves. The final cost of Kentuckian, including financing costs, was $58.33 per <b>deadweight</b> <b>ton,</b> which came out to just under $579,000.|$|E

Three ships—American, , and —were ordered from Delaware River Shipbuilding in Chester, Pennsylvania, while the fourth——was ordered from Union Iron Works of San Francisco. The {{contract}} cost of the three Pennsylvania-built ships was set at $425,000 each, but financing costs drove the final cost of each ship higher; the final cost of American was $61.00 per <b>deadweight</b> <b>ton,</b> which totaled just under $540,000.|$|E

25|$|The yard's slow {{work after}} the war was a symptom of having a glut of extra ships that were {{available}} for the United States Merchant Marine. The passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 meant that ships could be sold {{for as little as}} $ (equivalent to roughly $ in today's dollars) per <b>deadweight</b> <b>ton.</b> The flip side of this glut of ships was that there was a prediction that in 1961, more ships would be need to be constructed. This was evidenced by the fact that in 1954, there were orders for five tankers, one fleet oiler, and five destroyers. The next year, the yard attempted {{to become part of the}} building of the Forrestal-class aircraft carriers when Bethlehem objected to the awarding of the contracts to the Newport News Shipbuilding and the New York Naval Yard. Although the company pointed out that it had produced many carriers during World War II, Newport News pointed out that the company never requested an improvement of its shipbuilding facilities by the government during the war, which hampered its future bidding of aircraft carrier construction. That it had not built a single carrier since the end of the war also hurt its chances. The yard was later rewarded four frigates to build instead.|$|E
