The analysis begins in the interstate jurisdictions, where the principle first developed. However, following a thorough reconstruction of international treaty law, national legislation, and relevant case law, the Author demonstrates its prevalence in private arbitration as well. The applicability of the principle of <b>forum</b> <b>prorogatum</b> in arbitral jurisdictions can be inferred from general principles of law.

Consequently, <b>forum</b> <b>prorogatum</b> undoubtedly functions if the legal system in which the arbitration is being held impedes the objection of the award for reasons related to the arbitration agreement which were not contested {{during the course of the}} arbitration. On the contrary, doubts arise in the case in which that preclusive mechanism is not provided for. Nevertheless, in the Author's opinion, the principle of <b>forum</b> <b>prorogatum</b> finds application regardless of the system of preclusions, since its applicability is owed to reasons of a logicaldogmatic nature. The only limit to its practicality may be the provision of an express legal prohibition.
