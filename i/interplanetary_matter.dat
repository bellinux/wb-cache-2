40|$|The direct {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Explorer VIII satellite {{provide the}} first sound basis for analyzing all available direct measurements {{of the distribution of}} interplanetary dust particles. The model average distribution curve established by such an analysis departs significantly from that predicted by the (uncertain) extrapolation of results from meteor observations. A consequence of this difference is that the daily accretion of <b>interplanetary</b> particulate <b>matter</b> by the earth is now considered to be mainly dust particles of the direct measurements range of particle size. Almost all the available direct measurements obtained with microphone systems on rockets, satellites, and spacecraft fit directly on the distribution curve defined by Explorer VIII data. The lack of reliable datum points departing significantly from the model average distribution curve means that available direct measurements show no discernible evidence of an appreciable geocentric concentration of interplanetary dust particles...|$|R

40|$|Differs {{from other}} planets in the Solar System, the Venus has a {{retrograde}} and long-period rotation. To ex-plain the special spin of the Venus, mechanisms such as core mantle friction inside planet[1], atmospheric tide[2 - 7], or twain effects together[8 - 11], and impact {{with a giant}} object[12, 13] have been suggested. These mecha-nisms, however, need specific initial conditions with a remote probability [3, 5]. The slow spin of Mercury cannot be explained very well. One viewpoint is that the unusual spins of Venus and Mercury might be naturally evolved from similar initial states by interaction with <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> during long-time evolu-tion. Based on the theory of planet formation and the orderliness of planetary distance, we discuss the possi-bility that the radial density distribution of <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> is undulated, and the wave function satisfies the formal Schrödinger equation. We calculate the evolution of planet spins under the effect of <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> during planets revolution and rotation.

40|$|The Comae Berenicids (COM) {{is a minor}} {{meteor shower}} with an {{activity}} period that extends from Dec. 12 to January 23 and a maximum {{around the end of}} December. This shower was tentatively linked to comet 1913 I (Lowe), but this object was so poorly observed that its existence was not confirmed [1, 2]. By simultaneously imaging meteors belonging to this shower, we can obtain precise physicochemical parameters that can provide {{a better understanding of the}} Comae Berenicids meteoroids stream. These include, for instance, radiant and orbit information. But, besides, bright events allow us to register the emission spectrum produced when meteoroids ablate in the atmosphere, and this can provide useful information related to the chemical composition of these particles of <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> [3, 4, 5, 6]. Nowadays, the SPanish Meteor Network (SPMN) monitors the night sky from 27 meteor observing stations located in the Iberian Peninsula. We have the advantage of more favourable weather conditions during December and January when compared to other areas in the northern hemisphere and, so, this provides good conditions to analyze the Comae Berenicids during the activity period of this shower.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{and analysis of}} flashes produced by the impact of meteoroids on the lunar surface {{is one of the}} techniques suitable {{for the study of the}} flux of <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> impacting the Earth. The first attempts to identify impact flashes produced by large meteoroids on the lunar surface by means of telescopic observations date back to 1997 [1]. Thus, impact flashes have been unambiguously detected during the maximum activity period of several major meteor showers by using this technique, and flashes of sporadic origin have been also recorded [2 - 9]. This method has the advantage that the area covered by one single detection instrument is much larger than the atmospheric volume monitored by meteor detectors on Earth. It can be employed when the illuminated fraction of the lunar disk varies between 10 and 60 %, i. e., during the first and last quarters. At least two telescopes must operate in parallel imaging the same area on the Moon in order to discard false detections produced by other phenomena such as, for instance, cosmic rays. Our team is performing a monitoring of the night side of the Moon from our observatory in Sevilla. This location provides very favourable statistics of clear nights per year. We employ several telescopes equipped with high-sensitivity CCD video cameras and we have also developed our own software to identify and analyze impact flashes. Here we present a preliminary analysis of the main lunar impact flashes recorded during our 2011 and 2012 campaigns...|$|E
40|$|A {{reexamination of}} the results of the Pioneer 10 and 11 Asteroid Meteoroid Detector, or Sisyphus, was carried out in the light of a {{recently}} derived theory characterizing <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> and the Zodiacal Light (ZL). Sisyphus measured individual meteoroids from reflected sunlight and ZL between meteoroid events. The results were questioned because meteoroid orbits could not be calculated as intended and the ZL as computed from individual meteoroids did not agree with values determined from the ZL mode and from the other ZL sensor on the spacecraft. It is first shown that, independent of any explanation, the measurements are, with high probability, valid and strongly correlated with the ZL. The model which explains the strange behavior of the Sisyphus instrument also resolves the enigma why the three dust experiments on the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft produced extreme disparate results for the distribution and orbits of meteoric particles and the ZL. The theory based primarily on these measurements requires a population in the inner solar system of cold meteoroid material composed mainly of volatile molecules. These meteoroids in orbits of high eccentricity are called cosmoids. They are impulsively disrupted from solar heating, resulting in order of magnitude increases in optical cross section. The dispersed particles, predominantly micron sized, scatter most of the ZL and supply the polarization. The sublimation time in sunlight for micron sized particles of volatile composition opposes the gravitational flux increase expected in approaching the sun. The other two Pioneer 10 / 11 dust experiments were: the Imaging Photopolarimeter for the ZL, and the Meteoroid Detection Experiment that measured penetration of 25 micron (Pioneer 10) and 50 micron (Pioneer 11) thick walls of pressurized gas cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{comparison}} with existing ground-based camera networks for meteors monitoring, a space-based optical system would escape dependency on weather and atmospheric conditions and would offer a wide spatial coverage and an unrestricted and extinction-free spectral domain. The potential rates of meteor detections by such systems are evaluated {{in this paper}} {{as a function of}} observations parameters (optical system capabilities, orbital parameters) and considering a reasonable range of meteoroids properties (e. g., mass, velocity, composition) determining their luminosity. A numerical tool called SWARMS (Simulator for Wide Area Recording of Meteors from Space) has been developed. SWARMS is also intended to be used in an operational phase to facilitate the comparison of observations with up-do-date constraints on the flux and characteristics of the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> entering our planet׳s atmosphere. The laws governing the conversion of a fraction of the meteor kinetic energy into radiation during atmospheric entry have been revisited and evaluated based on an analysis of previously published meteor trajectories. Rates of detection were simulated for two different systems: the SPOSH (Smart Panoramic Optical Sensor Head) camera optimized for the observation of transient luminous events, and the JEM-EUSO (Japanese Experiment Module-Extreme Universe Space Observatory) experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). We conclude that up to 6 events per hour in the case of SPOSH, and up to 0. 67 events in the case of JEM-EUSO may be detected. The optimal orbit for achieving such rates of detections depends on the mass index of the meteoroid populations. The determination of this parameter appears therefore critical before an optimal orbiting system might be designed for meteors monitoring...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} the oxygen isotopic composition of several components of Tagish Lake by ion microprobe. This meteorite constitutes the best preserved sample of C 2 matter presently available for study. It presents two different lithologies (carbonate-poor and -rich) which have fairly comparable oxygen isotopic composition, {{with regard to}} both the primary or secondary minerals. For the olivine and pyroxene grains, their delta O- 18 values range from - 10. 5 % to + 7. 4 % in the carbonate-poor lithology, with a mean Delta O- 17 value of - 3. 7 2. 4 %. In the carbonate-rich lithology, delta O- 18 varies from - 7. 9 % to + 3. 3 %, and the mean Delta O- 17 value is - 4. 7 +/- 1. 4 %. Olivine inclusions (Fo(sub > 99)) with extreme O- 16 -enrichment were found in both lithologies: delta O- 18 = - 46. 1 %, delta O- 187 = - 48. 3 % and delta O- 18 = - 40. 6 %, delta O- 17 = - 41. 2 % in the carbonate-rich lithology; delta O- 18 = - 41. 5 %, delta O- 17 = - 43. 4 % 0 in the carbonate-poor lithology. Anhydrous minerals in the carbonate-poor lithology are slightly more O- 16 -rich than in the carbonate-rich one. Four low-iron manganese-rich (LIME) olivine grains {{do not have an}} oxygen isotopic composition distinct from the other "normal" olivines. The phyllosilicate matrix presents the same range of oxygen isotopic compositions in both lithologies: delta O- 18 from approximately 11 % to approximately 6 %, with an average Delta. O- 17 approximately 0 %. Because the bulk Tagish Lake oxygen isotopic composition given by Brown et al. is on the high end of our matrix analyses, we assume that this "bulk Tagish Lake" composition probably only represents that of the carbonate-rich lithology. Calcium carbonates have delta O- 18 values up to 35 %, with Delta O- 17 approximately 0. 5 % 0. Magnetite grains present very high Delta O- 17 values approximately + 3. 4 % 0 +/- 1. 2 %. Given our analytical uncertainties and our limited carbonate data, the matrix and the carbonate seem to have formed in isotopic equilibrium. In that case, their large isotopic fractionation would argue for a low temperature (CM-like, T approximately 0 deg) formation. Magnetite probably formed during a separate event. Tagish Lake magnetite data is surprisingly compatible with that of R-chondrites and unequilibrated ordinary (LL 3) chondrites. Our oxygen isotope data strongly supports the hypothesis of a single precursor for both lithologies. Drastic mineralogical changes between the two lithologies not being accompanied with isotopic fractionation seem compatible with the alteration model presented by Young et aI. Tagish Lake probably represents the first well preserved large sample of the C 2 matter that dominates <b>interplanetary</b> <b>matter</b> since the formation of the solar system...|$|E
