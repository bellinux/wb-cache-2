40|$|Sensor {{networks}} often {{involve the}} monitoring of mobile phenomena, {{which can be}} facilitated by a spatiotemporal multicast protocol we call "mobicast". Mobicast is a novel spatiotemporal multicast protocol featuring a <b>delivery</b> <b>zone</b> that evolves over time. Mobicast can in theory provide absolute spatiotemporal delivery guarantees by limiting communication to a mobile forwarding zone whose size {{is determined by the}} global worst-case value associated with a compactness metric defined over the geometry of the network. In this work, we first studied the compactness properties of sensor networks with uniform distribution. The results of this study motivate three approaches for improving the e#ciency of spatiotemporal multicast in such networks. First, one may achieve high savings on communication overhead by slightly relaxing spatiotemporal delivery guarantees. Second, spatiotemporal multicast may exploit local compactness values for higher e#ciency for networks with non uniform spatial distribution of compactness. Third, for random uniformly distributed sensor network deployment, one may choose a deployment density to best support spatiotemporal communication. We also explored all these directions via mobicast simulation and results are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel protocol for a spatiotemporal variant of multicast called mobicast, designed to support message delivery in sensor and mobile ad hoc networks. The spatiotemporal character of mobicast {{relates to the}} obligation to deliver a message to all the nodes that will be present at time t in some geographic zone Z, where both the location {{and shape of the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>zone</b> are a function of time over some interval (tstart, tend). The protocol, called Face-Aware Routing (FAR), exploits ideas adapted from existing applications of face routing to achieve reliable mobicast delivery. The key features of the protocol are a routing strategy, which uses information confined solely to a node’s immediate spatial neighborhood, and a forwarding schedule, which employs only local topological information. Statistical results showing that, in uniformly distributed random disk graphs, the spatial neighborhood size is usually less than 20 suggest that FAR is likely to exhibit a low average memory cost. An estimation formula for the average size of the spatial neighborhood in a random network is another analytical result reported in this paper. This paper also includes a novel and low cost distributed algorithm for spatial neighborhood discovery...|$|E

In this paper a learning automata based mobicast protocol for sensor networks to support applications which require spatiotemporal coordination has been proposed. The proposed protocol which we call it LA-Mobicast uses the shape {{and the size of the}} forwarding zone to achieve high predicted accuracy. The proposed protocol use learning automata to adaptively determine the location and the shape of the forwarding zone in such away that the same number of wake-up sensor nodes be maintained. The proposed protocol is a fully distributed algorithm which requires lesser communication overhead in determining the forwarding zone and the mobicast message forwarding overhead. In order to show the performance of the proposed protocol, computer simulations have been conducted and the results obtained are compared with the results obtained for five existing mobicast protocols. The results of comparison show that the proposed protocol outperforms existing mobicast protocols in terms of slack time, message exchange, node involved and guarantee percent...|$|E
40|$|Smooth {{delivery}} of molten metal to a chilled substrate {{is a key}} prerequisite {{for the development of}} a successful technique for thin-strip casting steel. In this work, a numerical model of a thin-strip, liquid steel delivery system was developed, validated, and used to make design predictions. The proposed slot-type planar-flow delivery system could contain a porous flow modifier, and features an extended-pool metal delivery system to the chilled substrate. The steady-state, computational-fluid-dynamic (C. F. D.) model developed for this research is two-dimensional, and uses the finite-difference, control-volume formulation. The implicit solutions for the fluid flow and energy fields are fully coupled and include treatment of the solidification phenomena using the enthalpy-porosity approach. The model includes porous flow modifying regions within the <b>delivery</b> <b>zone.</b> These are treated as regions of complex media and make use of the "Brinkman-Forchheimer extended-Darcy" model. Turbulence was modelled using an ad hoc approach for both effective viscosity and effective thermal conductivity. Numerical predictions of fluid flow were compared with experimental flow measurements and flow visualization using a water model of the proposed delivery system. The experiments confirmed that the flow modifiers had a very beneficial smoothing effect on fluid delivery to the substrate in the feeding system. The numerical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. As well, numerical predictions of shell thickness were compared with several different simple semi-analytical test cases. The model was used for several parametric studies. The effect of flow modification, in conjunction with varying pool lengths, was studied. The model predicted that the presence of the flow modifiers would smooth the fluid flow to the substrate, and promote even extraction of heat, despite extension of the reservoir's length. Extending the pool length delayed the onset of solidification. Another study made predictions for cases with differing inlet and substrate boundary conditions, as well as for different exit gap sizes. This part of the work demonstrated the type of predictions possible with this model for use in the design of a prototype of the proposed delivery system...|$|E
