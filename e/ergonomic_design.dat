25|$|The minimalistic {{form and}} low {{material}} costs {{as well as}} the <b>ergonomic</b> <b>design</b> of the garden furniture resulted in the Werkbund’s prize, called “Die gute Form” (the good shape). The creative possibilities of the new Eternit material led to the advertisement of a competition on garden furniture and plant containers, which was organized by the exhibition directors with collaboration from the German enterprise Eternit AG. Contemporarily shaped stools, pots and troughs were designed {{as a result of this}} competition.|$|E

25|$|The <b>ergonomic</b> <b>design</b> of the {{controls}} such as handles, launcher, barrel shape and optical sight, is predefined standard. All controls {{are easy to}} handle in all shooting positions (lying, kneeling or standing). After the weapon is fired, the firing mechanism with the attached optical sight is removed and the barrel thrown away, the firing mechanism is reusable. The effective combat range of Panzerfaust 3 is between 15 and 300 metres against moving and 400 and 600 metres against static targets. An optical sight with line pattern fixed to the reusable firing mechanism enables to engage moving or static targets. To ensure night combat capability, a night-vision device or residual light amplifier {{can be set up}} in front of the optical sight.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} SNES controller adds X and Y face {{buttons to}} the design of the NES iteration, arranging the four in a diamond shape, and adds two shoulder buttons. It features an <b>ergonomic</b> <b>design</b> by Lance Barr, later used for the NES-102 model controllers, also designed by Barr. The Japanese and PAL region versions incorporate the colors of the four action buttons into the system's logo. The North American version's buttons are colored to match the redesigned console; the X and Y buttons are lavender with concave faces, and the A and B buttons are purple with convex faces. Several later consoles derive elements of their controller design from the SNES, including the PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox, and Wii Classic Controller.|$|E

In 1953 advertising executive Pierre Guichenné advised Bich to shorten his family name to Bic as an easy-to-remember, globally adaptable tradename for the pen, which fit in with product branding trends of the post-war era. Early Bic advertisements in France referred to the Cristal as the [...] "Atomic pen". Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the Bic Cristal's writing tip and <b>ergonomic</b> <b>design</b> helped shift the worldwide market for pens from fountain pens to ballpoints.|$|E

50|$|The Chain SAW was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} technical exercise to test new <b>ergonomic</b> <b>designs</b> for light machine guns.

As the Chain SAW is intended to be hip-fired, various targeting aids were developed alongside it to aid the aiming and accuracy, although KAC admits that more work on targeting aids will have to be made before the Chain SAW could be produced and used effectively.|$|R

40|$|In-vehicle {{information}} systems (IVIS) {{have been shown}} to increase driver workload and cause distraction, both of which are causal factors for accidents. This simulator study evaluates the impact that two prototype <b>ergonomic</b> <b>designs</b> for a smart driving aid have on workload, distraction and driving performance. Scenario complexity was also manipulated as an independent variable. Results showed that real-time delivery of smart driving information did not increase driver workload or adversely affect driver distraction, while also having the positive effect of decreasing mean driving speed in both the simple and complex driving scenarios. Subjective workload was shown to increase with task difficulty, as well as revealing important differences between the two interface designs. The findings are relevant to {{the development and implementation of}} smart driving interface designs in the future...|$|R

The new <b>designed</b> prototype of <b>ergonomic</b> safety seat, featuring with two cushions under the seat, buffering device in the back-rest support and lowery placing the child restrain belt through the rear side of the seat, is suitable for the use of those children with weight ranging from 9 to 18 kilograms. The forward car collision experiment was performed in National Vehicle Research Center. Results of the collision experiment show that the new <b>designed</b> <b>ergonomic</b> safety seat can decrease by 30. 19 percent, comparing with the national standard value, in the portion of head acceleration and also can decrease by 12. 34 percent in the portion of chest acceleration under the conditions of standard impact velocity and maximum simulated car acceleration. The collision experiment also reveals that the new <b>ergonomic</b> <b>designed</b> seat can obviously eliminate the acceleration value in comparison with the conventional standard safety seat in the areas of dummy child’s head, neck and chest according to the real dynamic impact detection reports...|$|R
