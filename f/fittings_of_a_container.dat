40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{specific}} procedure for the structural assessment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack is implemented to a realistic case {{in order to}} evaluate its effectiveness in the prediction of the operational limits <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> vessel. The feasibility <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extensive calculation based on such procedure is tested, paving {{the way to the}} direct analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack subject to the inertial loads arising from the ship motions. The procedure is based on a 3 D non-linear FE analysis coupled with <b>a</b> direct simulation <b>of</b> non-linear ship motions for the determination of inertial forces acting on <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack. <b>A</b> non-linear approach has been used for modelling both the ship motion response and the container stack structural response, leading to a global large amplitude analysis. <b>A</b> simplified model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack has been defined in order to decrease the computational cost of the structural calculations, allowing for a use in the framework <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extensive analysis considering many different ship sailing conditions. As final results, diagrams showing the occurrence of failure of container structures or lashing equipment are presented...|$|R

Bulge is <b>a</b> type <b>of</b> deformation <b>containers</b> experience when subject to compressive forces such as stacking or internal forces due to under- and over-packaging. Both compressive and internal forces can accelerate the failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> by causing panels to flex and flutes to buckle, compromising structural integrity.
