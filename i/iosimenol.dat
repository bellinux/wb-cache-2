40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine prospectively the expression of the multifunctional CD 98 protein in peripheral white blood cells in patients receiving iodinated contrast media (CM) for a computed tomography (CT) exami-nation. Materials and Methods: In 12 adult patients that received non-ionic dimeric CM (<b>iosimenol</b> or iodixanol), the expression of CD 98 was analyzed from samples of peripheral white blood cells obtained prior to, one hour, and 24 hours after CM injection by the use of flow cytometry analysis {{and the use of the}} direct immuno-fluorescence technique. Results:Overall, expression of CD 98 was significantly downregulated 24 hours after CM injection (51. 9 %± 10. 8 % vs. 38. 8 %± 16. 9 %; p < 0. 04). Patients that received <b>iosimenol</b> exhibited a more pronounced but not significant decrease of CD 98 expression both one hour and 24 hours after CM injection. In an analysis of specific patient responses, CD 98 downregulation occurred in eight patients. In two patients, CD 98 was upregulated, and in the remaining two patients, expres...|$|E
