Her parents {{divorced}} when she was seven and her mother remarried, this time to William D. Mathis, a widower with three children whose name she would eventually adopt as a stage name. She had been a sickly child and believed she healed herself through her sheer force of will. She believed everything was mental and everyone had certain vibrations, stating, [...] "If you are vibrating in the right place, you will inevitably come in contact with the others who can help you. It's like tuning in on your radio. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right wave-length, you have your station." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, father," [...] she answered. [...] "If I {{decide to}} go to Aunt Jane's I must buy some clothes; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> money I'll never see a cent of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not that! Do {{you go back}} to {{the company}} and make some excuse for me. Do not alarm them. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance, tell Lord Comyn where to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it must be. Everybody {{said that}} you were {{to be one of them}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> <b>the</b> other people out. Is it Mr. Bonteen?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Conciseness itself," [...] Mangan admitted, [...] "and I {{compliment}} {{you most}} heartily upon your scheme. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right people into it, it should prove a most valuable society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{wrong side}} of the post, you'll come out right at last. You'll have a nice {{property}} some of these days, but you're just a little short of cash at present." ...|$|R
