40|$|This study {{describes}} the pharmacokinetic parameters of gemopat-rilat, a potent vasopeptidase inhibitor, in humans and the compar-ative biotransformation {{of the compound}} in rats, dogs, and humans after administration of a single oral dose of [14 C]gemopat-rilat. <b>Gemopatrilat</b> was rapidly absorbed in humans with an oral bioavailability of 49 %. Within 5 h after dose, the mean concentra-tions of <b>gemopatrilat</b> were less than 1 % of the mean Cmax values. The total area under the first-moment time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC(INF) ] value for <b>gemopatrilat</b> was only 2 % of the AUC(INF) of radioactivity in plasma. <b>Gemopatrilat</b> showed a large apparent steady-state volume of distribution (2500 liters) and a prolonged terminal-phase decline in plasma concentration. These {{results are consistent with}} the idea that the free sulfhydryl group of <b>gemopatrilat</b> forms reversible disulfide linkages with plasma and tissue proteins and is thus eliminated from the body at a very slo...|$|E
40|$|Background. Control {{of blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) and optimal reduction of proteinuria (U-prot) {{are necessary for}} long-term renoprotection. Unfortunately, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists are not effective during sodium repletion. Vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPI) cause dual inhibition of ACE and neutral endopeptidase, the latter resulting in decreased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) breakdown and thus enhanced natriuresis. Therefore, in contrast with ACEI, VPI may be effective during high sodium intake. Methods. To test this hypothesis, the renoprotective actions of the new VPI <b>gemopatrilat</b> (GEM) were studied during low (0. 05 % NaCl) and high (3. 0 % NaCl) sodium diets in normotensive Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. The ACEI lisinopril (LIS) was used as control. Rats received either GEM (0. 3 mg/g chow), an equihypotensive dose of LIS (75 mg/L drinking water), or vehicle (VEH) from week 6 (that is, established U-prot) until sacrifice. The effect of therapy was monitored by measuring systolic BP and U-prot (weekly) and structural renal damage {{at the end of}} study (week 16). Results. During low sodium, GEM effectively reduced U-prot (- 48 +/- 4 %), but LIS was more effective (- 80 +/- 2 %), while U-prot slightly increased in VEH (+ 23 +/- 2 %). The focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) score after GEM (38 +/- 14) was lower than in the VEH group (79 +/- 27), although this was not significant. LIS (18 +/- 6) reduced FGS significantly. Remarkably, on high sodium, GEM was completely ineffective in reducing BP, U-prot and structural renal injury, just like LIS. Conclusions. The renoprotective actions of VPI depend on dietary sodium intake in normotensive nephrotic rats: therapeutic efficacy is fully blunted by a high sodium diet. During a low sodium diet, <b>gemopatrilat</b> was renoprotective, but less effective than lisinopril. Whether higher doses of the VPI could improve its renoprotective efficacy remains to be elucidated...|$|E
