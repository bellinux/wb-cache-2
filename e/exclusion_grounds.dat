The second aim is to examine if the revision of the directive has solved the prior existing problems regarding social considerations in public procurement. In this paper a traditional European legal method is used. The examinations show a number of things, including the Revised Classic directive involving codification of case law, references to other sources of law and some clarified rules as well as new provisions. The regulations regarding reserved contracts, technical specifications, and selection criterion are satisfied in the Revised Classic directive. Certain changes and clarifications are still required in regards to the regulations of <b>exclusions</b> <b>grounds,</b> contract award criterion and abnormally low tenders. The facet of the directive which requires the most significant clarification is regarding the conditions for performance of contracts.     Keywords: public procurement, social considerations, socially responsible public procuremen...|$|R

40|$|Disabled {{people are}} marginalised and {{excluded}} from 'mainstream' society. In general, {{our understanding of}} the processes of <b>exclusion</b> is <b>grounded</b> in time and history. In this paper, it is argued that space, as well as time, is instrumental in reproducing and sustaining disablist practices. Disability has distinct spatialities that work to exclude and oppress disabled people. Spaces are currently organised to keep disabled people 'in their place' and 'written' to convey to disabled people that they are 'out of place'. Furthermore, social relations currently work to spatially isolate and marginalise disabled people and their carers. Disability is spatially, as well as socially, constructed. It is contended that an understanding of society's reaction to, and the experiences of, disability should be framed within an approach that combines a spatialised political economy with social constructivism. Unlike neo-Marxist approaches this approach is centred on notions of power rather than capital. Using this approach, the spatialities of disability are explored...|$|R

40|$|Making {{intelligent}} {{decisions on}} the basis of the video captured by a large network of surveillance cameras requires the ability to identify overlap between their fields of view. Without this information it is impossible to perform even simple analysis, such as distinguishing between repeated behaviours and multiple views of the same behaviour. Large-scale intelligent video surveillance thus requires a means of understanding the relationships between the fields of view of the cameras involved. The exclusion approach is the only method currently capable of performing online estimation of camera overlap for networks of more than 50 cameras, with a version of the algorithm applicable to 1000 camera networks having been published. Empirical evaluation of every such algorithm is critical to assessing its performance, and essential if comparisons between methods are to be made. This paper presents a method by which such an empirical evaluation may be carried out, and makes publicly available the data (including ground truth) on which it based in order that competing methods might be compared equally. Precision vs recall curves are reported for a series of experiments comparing the results of <b>exclusion</b> to <b>ground</b> truth. These results demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the exclusion-based estimation process, but show that the performance of the method exceeds the requirements of surveillance applications.

40|$|All {{schools must}} be safe places for {{all members of}} the {{learning}} community. Schools have the right and indeed the responsibility to develop safe school climates to protect the safety of students and teachers, as well as the integrity of learning Yet the data indicate that it is relatively rare for students to pose a serious danger to themselves or others. In states like Texas, serious safety concerns trigger a "non-discretionary" mandatory removal, but these represent less than 5 % of all disciplinary removals from school. While <b>exclusion</b> on <b>grounds</b> of safety is infrequent, students are routinely removed from school for minor offenses like tardiness, truancy, using foul language, disruption, and violation of the dress code. Of course, public school educators are also responsible for ensuring the integrity of the learning environment and attend to misbehavior that does not raise safety concerns. There is no question that there are circumstances where removing a student from a classroom is helpful to de-escalate a conflict, or to pursue an intervention outside the classroom with the support of an administrator, a counselor, parent(s) or community members. However, too many of our nation's public schools have moved away from reserving school exclusion only for the most serious offenses, and as a measure of last resort. Excessive suspensions and expulsions threaten educational opportunity, thereby undermining our national goals for closing academic achievement gaps for all children...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to improve}} {{the understanding of the}} socio-psychological links between older age and attitudes to road pricing, to enhance our understanding of the acceptability of road pricing as a solution for the management of road transport demand. Older people’s attitudes are of particular interest because they face particular types of risk of social <b>exclusion</b> on transport <b>grounds.</b> In an ageing society, older people have a growing influence in democracy in general, and the acceptability of road pricing in particular. Moreover, it is hypothesised that older people may have particular attitudes to the acceptability of road pricing due to pro-social attributions. They may also have a particular influence on the evaluations of family and friends. The paper reports on a questionnaire implemented to identify age-specific attitudinal differences with respect to road pricing. Further analysis and future data collection will examine in more detail the influence that social norms and pro-social value orientations have on people’s attitudes to road pricing, with a view to testing the hypothesis that this influence is greater amongst older people...|$|R
30|$|<b>Exclusion</b> on the <b>grounds</b> of {{disability}} and ethnic minority status. The National Plan (RGOC, 2003, p. 40) {{states in the}} case of children with disabilities that national policy and strategies should be formulated “to assure equitable access to education opportunities including specific program interventions such as school buildings design, specialized teaching and learning materials”. With regard to ethnic minorities it says that targeted facilities, programs and curriculum reform should be provided, with special incentives for minority area staff deployment as well as the hiring of local teachers. There is a suggestion that inclusion {{in the life of the}} community can be pursued through access to education and that this is therefore a priority for the government. However, little detailed information is given about how this can realistically be achieved. UNICEF has been involved in starting the first preschool for deaf children in Cambodia in 2004, located in Krousar Thmey. The goal was to teach children sign language so that they had a language with which to communicate when they entered primary school. The project has created a Khmer Braille code and set up a committee to work on creating a uniform Khmer sign language.|$|R

Both species are actively managed as pests to livestock production. Contemporaneously, the dingo {{proportion of the}} wild dog population, being considered native, is protected in areas designated for wildlife conservation. Wild dogs particularly affect sheep and goat production because of the behavioural responses of domestic sheep and goats to attack, and the flexible hunting tactics of wild dogs. Predation of calves, although less common, is nowmore economically important because of recent changes in commodity prices. Although sometimes affecting lambing and kidding rates, foxes cause fewer problems to livestock producers but have substantial impacts on environmental values, affecting the survival of small tomedium-sized native fauna and affecting plant biodiversity by spreading weeds.

40|$|This {{introductory}} editorial {{article is}} {{premised on the}} fundamental notion that education is about personal and social change. But such a view, as in Dickens’s “A Tale of Two Cities”, is fraught with contradictions. To illustrate: education could either be an instrument of oppression or of emancipation; it could be inequitable as in socially differentiated curricula and resource distribution; or it could unequivocally pursue equity {{for the benefit of}} all social strata. Our broad conceptual construction is guided by global and South African trends, {{as well as by the}} varied contributions featured in this special issue. Implicitly, if not explicitly, the underlying thrust is that <b>exclusion,</b> on whatever <b>grounds,</b> from quality education for all has a paralytic effect on the individual and on society, whereas equity is not only a moral compulsion but also a material imperative with broad palliative effects. The conclusion drawn is that democratic education systems should not only pay inordinate attention to SET (i. e. science, engineering, and technology) as a consequence of global exigencies, but that equal attention should be given to knowledge that enhances human sensibilities and social cohesion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{processes}} of social exclusion within Pakistani Muslim communities in Britam and Germany through the symbolic act {{of caring for}} one's elders. In particular social exclusion is explored through individual perceptions {{of what it means}} to be included or excluded with reference to their experiences and expectations of informal familial care Pakistani Muslim identities in diaspora are maintained, in part, through the continual exercise of Islamic and Pakistani cultural symbols. These symbols also serve to construct and sustain community boundaries, distinguishing 'us' (Pakistani Muslims) from 'them' (non-Muslim White British and Germans). Hierarchical structures based on gerontocratic principles, aligned with the importance of family, and ethics of izzath, result in widespread beliefs amongst Pakistani Muslim communities that 'we' look after our elders and 'they' do not. As a result familial care of elders has come to be seen as an integral symbol of 'Pakistani Muslim' identity in diaspora S uch symbolic value results in the care relationship between elders and their kin being subject to Islamic and Pakistani cultural understandings of 'good' and 'bad'. Whilst these moral assertions have the potential to exclude, individual experiences, understandings and perceptions of them differ. Through an exploration of these experiences this study seeks to provide a grounded understanding of social exclusion. Based on qualitative empirical data, consisting of 43 interviews, 26 of which were conducted in Germany, and 17 in Britain, the research advocates a re-configuration of the emphasis placed upon structurally constructed thresholds of social <b>exclusion.</b> Through <b>grounded</b> accounts of the care relationship the thesis puts forward an alternative typology of care, which takes into account the ethics of izzath, khidmath, reciprocity and the corresponding structural frameworks of Islam and Pakistani culture. The research demonstrates that the diasponc Pakistani Muslim community's attempts at continuation and unity have the potential to exclude where conditions and values of such perpetuation are not met. However, such thresholds of exclusion are fluid, subject to individual resource and identity negotiations that call into question exclusion based upon 'indisputable' moral authorities.

40|$|Biotic homogenization, {{with its}} {{emphasis}} on invasions, extinctions, and convergence in taxonomic similarity, provides an important framework for investigating changes in biodiversity across scales. Most research thus far has focused on documenting patterns of biotic homogenization; less emphasis has been placed on identifying drivers. Through their selective foraging, large populations of white-tailed deer are altering population sizes, driving extirpations, and facilitating invasions of plants throughout the eastern United States. I tested the hypothesis that they can also drive biotic homogenization in forest understory communities. I studied the effects of 18 years of deer <b>exclusion</b> in the <b>ground</b> layer vegetation and composition of a hemlock-northern hardwood stand in N Wisconsin. ANOVA reveals that percent cover is four times higher in deer-excluded plots, and diversity is greater. Within blocks, average pairwise similarity in species composition (based on Jaccard and Bray-Curtis metrics) is highest among transects within deer exclosures and lowest among transects in treatment and control areas. This seems to imply deer exclusion facilitates biotic homogenization. Examining patterns among blocks, however, reveals control plots exhibit higher pairwise similarity values than deer excluded plots. This reflects biotic homogenization. These findings suggest deer exclusion reverses biotic homogenization at the stand level, {{but it is not clear}} how these patterns might change at different spatial or temporal scales...|$|R
