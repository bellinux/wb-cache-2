5|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries,</b> the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries</b> has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E
5|$|These signs {{give us some}} of the {{terminology}} used today. The <b>first</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries</b> was named when the vernal equinox was actually in the constellation Aries; it has since moved into Pisces.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the <b>first</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries</b> and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5000|$|The graphic to {{the right}} {{displays}} the Zodiac symbols in its inner circle based on their alignment with the Northern Hemisphere AUTUMNAL Equinox, NOT the Vernal Equinox. This is because the Great Year/Yuga Cycle commences when the Autumnal Equinox is aligned with the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> the Constellation <b>Aries</b> as stated above (ref [...] "The Holy Science" [...] by Sri Yukteswar). Hence they {{may appear to be}} rotated 180 degrees to those who normally use the Northern Hemisphere VERNAL Equinox as their reference point for the Zodiac 'Ages' ...|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} table enumerates {{the twelve}} divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss). The longitude intervals, being a mathematical division, are {{closed for the}} first endpoint (a) and open for the second (b) — for instance, 30° of longitude is the <b>first</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> Taurus, not part <b>of</b> <b>Aries.</b> Association <b>of</b> calendar dates with astrological signs only makes sense when referring to Sun sign astrology.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the effects}} of precession, the First Point of Libra, (also known as the autumn equinox point) lies within the {{boundaries}} of Virgo very close to β Virginis. This is one of the two points in the sky where the celestial equator crosses the ecliptic (the other being the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries,</b> now in the constellation of Pisces.) This point will pass into the neighbouring constellation of Leo around the year 2440.|$|E
500|$|Each star's {{approximate}} {{position on}} the celestial sphere is given using the equatorial coordinate system. [...] The celestial sphere is an imaginary globe of infinite size with the Earth at its center. [...] Positions on the celestial sphere are often expressed using two coordinates: declination and sidereal hour angle, which are similar to latitude and longitude {{on the surface of}} the Earth. [...] To define declination, the Earth's equator is projected out to the celestial sphere to construct the celestial equator, and declination is measured in degrees north or south of this celestial equator. [...] Sidereal hour angle is a measurement between 0 and 360 degrees, indicating how far west a body is from an arbitrarily chosen point on the celestial sphere called the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While the astrological sign Pisces per {{definition}} {{runs from}} elliptical longitude 330° to 0°, {{this position is}} now mostly covered by the constellation of Aquarius, due to the precession from when the constellation and the sign coincided. [...] Today, the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries,</b> or the vernal equinox is in the Pisces constellation. There are no prominent stars in the constellation, with the brightest stars being of only fourth magnitude. One star in the constellation, Alpha Piscium, {{is also known as}} Alrescha which comes from the Arabic الرشآء al-rišā’, meaning [...] "the well rope," [...] or [...] "the cord." [...] Ptolemy described Alpha Piscium as the point where the cords joining the two fish are knotted together. The astrological symbol shows the two fishes captured by a string, typically by the mouth or the tails. The fish are usually portrayed swimming in opposite directions; this represents the duality within the Piscean nature. Although they appear as a pair, the name of the sign in all languages originally referred to only one fish with the exception of Greek, [...] Bulgarian, Dutch, Latvian, Italian.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries,</b> {{also known}} as the Cusp of Aries, is the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, and is named for the constellation of Aries. It is one of the two points on the celestial sphere at which the celestial equator meets the ecliptic plane, the other being the First Point of Libra, located exactly 180° from it. Over its year-long journey through the constellations, the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north at the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries,</b> and from north to south at the First Point of Libra.

Navigational ephemeris tables record the geographic position of the <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries</b> as the reference for position of navigational stars. Due to the slow precession of the equinoxes, the Zenith view (above a location) of constellations at a time of year from a given location have slowly walked West (by using solar epochs the drift is known). tropical zodiac are identically affected and no longer correspond with the constellations (the Cusp of Libra today is located within Virgo), and is the basis for the concept of astrological ages. In sidereal astrology, by contrast, the <b>first</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries</b> remains aligned with the Aries constellation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries</b> is {{so called}} because, when Hipparchus defined it in 130 BCE, it {{was located in}} the western extreme of the {{constellation}} of Aries, near its border with Pisces and the star γ Arietis. Due to the Sun's eastward movement across the sky throughout the year, this western end of Aries was {{the point at which}} the Sun entered the constellation, hence the name <b>First</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aries.</b>|$|E
