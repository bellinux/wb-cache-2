5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong <b>drag</b> <b>force,</b> without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a <b>drag</b> <b>force</b> vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous <b>drag</b> <b>force</b> acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} {{sheltering}} effect of Posidonia oceanica meadows on <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> exerted on shells {{of the fan}} mussel Pinna nobilis. We examine a range of shell sizes under four unidirectional flow speeds (0. 05 – 0. 34 m s− 1) and two oscillating regimes. Three meadow densities are evaluated and a control without vegetation. We found that the attenuating effect of the meadow on <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> experienced by bivalves {{is determined by the}} form of the hydrodynamic energy, e. g., as unidirectional flow or wave action. In tidal currents, the meadow protects most sizes of bivalves, with a higher efficiency for dense meadows, while in wave dominant zones the meadow reduces <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> for bivalves with shell areas below a threshold of 0. 019 m 2, whereas larger animals experience increased <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> within the meadow independent of meadow density. Reduction of shoot density in seagrass meadows might therefore not affect the effectiveness of the canopy to reduce <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> on associated species like the fan mussel in wave-dominated areas while increased storm frequency could result into losses of larger individuals during periods of high wave action. ...|$|R

In the current state of the research, a formulation based on the analytical catenary equation is most commonly used for the analysis of mooring lines. However, due to the inability of catenary equations to consider the ocean current <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> on mooring lines, the effect of <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> on fairlead restoring forces has not been investigated yet. In this study, we have investigated the influence of <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> on fairlead forces using discrete catenary formulation for modeling mooring line. The discrete catenary formulation has the ability to incorporate ocean current <b>drag</b> <b>forces.</b> Three types of elements; fully suspended, touchdown and seabed element are formulated to model the suspended, touchdown and seabed portion of a slack mooring line, respectively. The influence of viscous drag on the fairlead restoring forces is demonstrated through the analysis of OC 3 -Hywind mooring system subjected to ocean currents. It was found that the viscous drag significantly influences the fairlead forces...|$|R

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for vehicles towing caravans to use more than double the fuel than normal. This massive increase in fuel usage is almost entirely due to the changed aerodynamics. This project focuses on improving the aerodynamics of a specific caravan with minimal impact on the useability and practicality of the caravan. The caravan’s current aerodynamic characteristics are evaluated and optimised using CFD software. The CFD software is utilised to perform a parametric study on specific areas of the caravan’s geometry to determine the optimum shape and size of specific features. Results found show that optimising the aerodynamics of the JPC caravan can reduce the <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> by approximately 29. 5 % while having little impact on practical aspects of the caravan. The results have shown that the reduction in <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> can be achieved through the implementation of four different modifications. The optimisation of caravans ride height can accomplish an overall possible reduction in <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> of 15 %. Optimising the distance from the tow vehicle to the caravan showed potential decreases of <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> ranging from 9 % to 15 %. Coupled with the positioning of the caravan a further 10 % reduction in <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> are obtainable through the modification of an already existing front to roof chamfer. The introduction of a new roof to rear caravan chamfer {{can also be used to}} achieve further reductions of around 5 %. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{continues}} to be strong interest in the subjects of damping and <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> associated with electrodynamic suspension (EDS) systems. While electromagnetic <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> resist the forward motion of a vehicle and therefore consume energy, damping forces control, at least in part, {{the response of the}} vehicle to disturbances. Ideally, one would like to reduce the <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> as much as possible while retaining adequate damping forces to insure dynamic stability and satisfactory ride quality. These two goals turn out to be difficult to achieve in practice. It is well known that maglev systems tend to be intrinsically under damped. Consequently it is often necessary in a practical system design to enhance the damping passively or actively. For reasons of cost and simplicity, it is desirable to rely as much as possible on passive damping mechanisms. In this paper, rough estimates are made of the passive damping and <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> caused by various mechanisms in EDS systems. No attention will be given to active control systems or secondary suspension systems which are obvious ways to augment passive damping mechanisms if the latter prove to be inadequate...|$|R

In addition, <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> are continually slowing the plane once it has crossed the shear layer, so the airspeed gained by crossing the boundary is not all retained through the 180° turns.

This first widely publicised flight led to a more organized effort between aviators and scientists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.|$|E
25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which guides {{the face of the}} kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and <b>drag</b> <b>force</b> components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or tethers to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} fluid flow effects of {{geometries}} with a dimpled surface {{as compared to}} smooth surfaces. Geometries studied include cylinders, pointed orgives and streamlined bodies. The surfaces of the geometries studied have an array of evenly spaced dimples with specific dimensional properties to achieve a reduction in total <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> exerted by fluid flow. Computational Fluid Dynamic flow simulations were conducted to observe boundary layer initiation and development along each object profile and <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> experienced at speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 40 m/s. Along with the computed analysis, wind tunnel testing was conducted to observe real time boundary layer formation and <b>drag</b> <b>forces</b> resulting from wind speeds of the same range over geometry models. For visualisation in wind tunnel testing a smoke wand was utilised to demonstrate fluid flow over each model. Drag data was collected from surface integration calculations produced in CFD testing and from force gauges in wind tunnel testing. All results were compared {{with the performance of}} smooth surfaced models of the same geometry to observe the effects of the dimpled surface application.

25|$|A bird or bat {{flying through}} the air at a {{constant}} speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well).

The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.

25|$|The main {{mechanism}} for sorting is {{the arrangement of}} the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles <b>drag</b> <b>force</b> that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By shifting {{the arrangement of the}} optical lattice point, there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.|$|E
25|$|During a {{free-fall}} with no aerodynamic forces, {{the object}} accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity {{as the object}} descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a <b>drag</b> <b>force</b> that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented {{at an angle to}} the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.|$|E
