40|$|The astronomical {{community}} {{continues to}} be interested in suitable programmable slit masks for use in multi-object spectrometers (MOSs) on space missions. There have been ground-based MOS utilizing digital micromirror devices (DMDs) and they have proven to be highly accurate and reliable instruments. This paper summarizes the results of a continuing study to investigate the performance of DMDs under conditions associated with space deployment. This includes the response of DMDs to radiation, to the vibration and mechanical shock loads associated with launch, and the operability of DMD under cryogenic temperatures. The optical contrast ratio and a study of the long-term reflectance of a bare device have also been investigated. The results of the radiation testing demonstrate that DMDs in orbit would experience negligible heavy-ion induced single event upset (SEU) rate burden, we predict SEU rate of 5. 6 micromirrors per 24 hours. Vibration and mechanical shock testing was performed according to the NASA General <b>Environmental</b> <b>Verification</b> Standard (GEVS), no mirrors failed in the devices tested. The results of low temperature testing suggest that DMDs are not affected by the thermal load and operate smoothly at temperatures at least as low as 78 K. The reflectivity of a bare DMD did not measurably change even after being exposed to ambient conditions over a period of 13 months. The measured contrast ratio (on state vs off state of the DMD micromirrors) was greater than 6000 /: 1 when illuminated with an f/ 4 optical beam. Overall, DMDs are extremely robust and promise to provide a reliable alternative to micro shutter arrays (MSA) to be used in space as remotely programmable slit masks for MOS design...|$|E
