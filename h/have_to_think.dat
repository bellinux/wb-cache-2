25|$|Gramsci {{stated that}} bourgeois {{cultural}} values {{were tied to}} folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence Roman Catholicism had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between {{the religion of the}} learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it as an expression of their own experience.|$|E

500|$|Because [...] "radical, body-altering" [...] {{surgery on}} a long-running {{character}} {{would cause the}} production team ongoing problems with continuity, {{it was decided that}} Peggy would have a [...] "less visible" [...] lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy. A member of the EastEnders production team explained: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about costume and what it's going to look like afterwards and what we're lumbering ourselves with [...] you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that for a long-term character." [...] Additionally, giving Peggy a lumpectomy at that stage of her disease was viewed favourably by source organisations, as it helped to spread a message that a mastectomy is not necessary in all breast cancer cases. However, the storyline was revisited several times over the next few years. In August 1997, Peggy was given the [...] "all-clear" [...] at her follow-up mammogram, and in March 1999 the cancer returned and she underwent a mastectomy, while in 2000 she had a breast reconstruction. It has been reported that Peggy was the first soap opera character to undergo a mastectomy. BBC Production chief executive Matthew Bannister praised Windsor's portrayal of Peggy coming to terms with a mastectomy, commenting: [...] "It's brought a good deal of comfort and help to us {{and a lot of other}} people." ...|$|E

Evans commented on the possibility of representing Team GB at the London 2012 Summer Olympics: [...] "If I was asked then it's something I'd definitely look at doing.

500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him.

[...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E

I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> when I speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, [...] "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's 'Front Porch Campaign' became a legend in American political history." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{working on}} their debut self-titled album, Whodini {{embarked}} on a three-month European tour. Two-and-a-half weeks into this tour, {{they were joined by}} Kangol Kid and UTFO.

Singer-songwriter Jalil Hutchins later said, [...] "Somebody should've stepped in and made us [...]" [...] Whodini member John Fletcher (Ecstasy) said that the group thought European audiences would be unfamiliar with their music, but they [...] "found that lots of kids, lots of club owners, had made a real effort to get hold of our music.

500|$|Attempting {{to perfect}} their work, Coldplay had to [...] "step it {{up a few}} notches and work hard at it to get it right". The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} on the standard version of It Won't Be Soon Before Long without the inclusion of Rihanna, however, Levine stated {{in an interview with}} James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the accompanying music video that he wanted to try something different for the album's re-release. The singer continued, saying that he asked Rihanna to do some [...] "bits and pieces" [...] in the recording studio and that it came together very quickly. Levine stated that if there is [...] "magic" [...] between two artists, then [...] "you don't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it." [...] During the interview, Rihanna confirmed that the song would be the only one to feature a collaboration on her re-release of Good Girl Gone Bad, revealing that she had always wanted to work with the group and was honored when they contacted her.

[...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that {{hard to keep up}} with the Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the spectacle of the Eiffel Tower collapsing." [...] He summarized the movie as [...] "a more straight-faced brand of idiocy than its cheerfully dumb 2009 predecessor." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, and then you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would be silly to go out against yourself in the form of The Beatles. So I fell in with the idea and thought, 'Great, I don't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about an album.'" [...] McCartney was occupied with working on Standing Stone in the interim.|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about anything else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E
