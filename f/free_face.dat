25|$|The {{effects of}} the {{collision}} are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic <b>free</b> <b>face,</b> the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea {{and away from the}} collision zone. These far-field effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the propagation of}} three-dimensional symmetric waves localised near the traction free edge of a semi-infinite elastic plate with either traction <b>free</b> or fixed <b>faces.</b> For both types of boundary conditions, we present a variational proof {{of the existence of}} the low order edge waves. In addition, for a plate with traction <b>free</b> <b>faces</b> and zero Poisson ratio, the fundamental edge wave is described by a simple explicit formula, and the first order edge wave is proved to exist. Qualitative variational predictions are compared with numerical results, which are obtained using expansions in three-dimensional Rayleigh-Lamb and shear modes. It is also demonstrated numerically that whatever non-zero Poisson ratio in a plate with traction <b>free</b> <b>faces,</b> the eigenfrequencies related to the first order wave are complex valued...|$|R

50|$|The dunce hat is contractible, but not collapsible. Contractibility can {{be easily}} seen by noting that the dunce hat embeds in the 3-ball and the 3-ball {{deformation}} retracts onto the dunce hat. Alternatively, note that the dunce hat is the CW-complex obtained by gluing the boundary of a 2-cell onto the circle. The gluing map is homotopic to the identity map on the circle and so the complex is homotopy equivalent to the disc. By contrast, it is not collapsible {{because it does not}} have a <b>free</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

In the present work the influences of dispersions and of nonlinearity material on shear horizontal (SH) waves in simple-cubic crystal plates with <b>free</b> <b>faces</b> are examined on basis of nonlinear equations extracted from 3 -dimensional lattice model. The analysis is restricted to excitations which consist of a slowly varying envelope modulating a harmonic carrier which {{is not limited to}} long wave length. In the case of excitations of small amplitude it is shown that the amplitude of the envelope is governed by a cubic nonlinear SchrGdinger equation...|$|R
50|$|In {{planning}} economically, {{the aim was}} {{to reduce}} the access tunnelling to the minimum. Chambers leading directly off the main tunnel, were generally used, with a passing bay provided to avoid congestion or, even better, with a service tunnel. These tunnels were excavated using diamond drills and gelignite. The drill holes were placed over two metres apart armed with a pound of gelignite per metre depth of drilled hole. The blasts were able to reach a <b>free</b> <b>face</b> over 2 m and sometimes up to 4.5 m away. This was a fast way of tunnelling but in retrospect it may have used too much explosive as the remaining rock around tunnels of this era are unstable and rock falls have killed people.|$|E

50|$|Rocktown, Georgia is a <b>free</b> <b>face</b> rock {{climbing}} area. It {{consists of an}} outcropping of sandstone boulders on the Appalachian Plateau in northwest Georgia. It comprises several acres of large sandstone boulders; the average size is 30 to 40 ft high.

There is a one mile hike from the trail head {{to get to the}} Rocktown area. Most of these boulders have been untainted by pollution and graffiti because it is in a remote part of northwest Georgia. Because it is located in a wildlife management area, it is possible to encounter wild animals in this area, including both venomous and non-venomous snakes, bobcats, deer, wild turkeys, black bears and wild hogs. When climbing and exploring the boulders, caves and grottoes it is common to encounter wasps, yellow-jackets and spiders and even the occasional bat.|$|E

Surface geometry alone does not explain high amplification and polarization at sites with pronounced topography (Burjánek et al. 2014).

Therefore, the research on water infiltration {{is the key to}} solving the problem of collapsibility.

A field soaking experiment was conducted on collapsible loess in western China, in which a soaking pool with diameter of 15 [*]m was built. Time-Domain-Reflectometry (TDR) system and soil sampling were employed to measure the water content within the depth of 12 [*]m.

Also, a pilot tunnel was excavated to investigate how the <b>free</b> <b>face</b> can affect the infiltration behaviors. The experimental results revealed the characteristics of infiltration in both horizontal and vertical directions. Moreover, the response of <b>free</b> <b>face</b> on infiltration behaviors was also found.
