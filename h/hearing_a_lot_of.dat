In addition to Hammond, Chris lived in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania - Flint, Michigan - Hamilton, Ohio - Newcastle, Pennsylvania - Buffalo, New York and Rochester, New York. His earliest musical memory is that of seeing singing cowboys on TV, which engendered a yearning in chris to own and play a guitar. Aged ten, his parents presented Chris with an old archtop Kay guitar. He went on take lessons for around 6 months. The family were living near Detroit at the time, and Chris recalls <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Motown music, plus it was {{the era of the}} Beatles U.S. invasion {{and the end of the}} Folk Music boom. Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, the Beatles and a whole range of singer songwriters all inspired Chris’s musical interest.|$|E

The patent defined a social network {{as the ability to}} see the people you do not know through the people you do know, made possible by indexing people's relationships in a single database. The patent was sold along with SixDegrees to YouthStream Media Networks in 2000 and later to Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Mark Pincus of Zynga and Tribe.net for $700,000 at an auction in 2003. [...] When explaining his reasoning for purchasing the Six Degrees patent, Hoffman stated, [...] "Right now you're <b>hearing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> spurious patent threats (...)

Both Mark and I had tracked six degrees as an intellectual precursor to our own businesses." [...] Andrew Katz of Fox Rothschild, specialist in Internet intellectual property, said of Hoffman's and Pincus' acquisition of the patent: [...] "It should be taken very seriously by everybody in the industry because it {{is in the hands of}} people who have the means and the business acumen to enforce it properly." ...|$|E

Besides autobiographies, he wrote on American history, so he used historical themes in his comedy routines. He liked to quote the Declaration of Independence on a citizen's duty to protest an unjust government. A current analogue would be to Iraqi resistance to occupation. In his speeches he used linguistic features as allusions, {{to make the point that}} we don't look at black violence the same way as white violence in American history.
