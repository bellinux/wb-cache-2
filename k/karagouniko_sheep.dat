40|$|A {{total of}} 216 local {{crossbred}} sheep from 16 scrapie-affected Greek flocks and 210 purebred sheep of the milk breeds Chios and Karagouniko from healthy flocks were analysed for scrapie-linked polymorphisms in the prion protein (PrP) gene. Of the 216 sheep in this case-control study, 96 sheep were clinical cases, 25 subclinical cases (asymptomatic {{at the moment}} of euthanasia but positive by histopathology and/or ELISA detecting proteinase-resistant PrP) and 95 healthy controls (negative by all evaluations). Polymorphisms at codons 136, 154 and 171 were determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, followed by RFLP and sequencing. Scrapie, both clinical and subclinical, was associated with the genotypes ARQ/ARQ (88 of 110 sheep of that genotype), ARQ/TRQ (9 of 13), ARQ/AHQ (115 of 38) and VRQ/VRQ (9 of 17). Histopathological lesions were more severe in the clinical cases. Genotypes ARQ/ARR (26 sheep), ARQ/ARK (seven sheep), AHQ/ARR (one sheep), ARH/ARH (one sheep) and ARR/ARH (three sheep) were detected exclusively in healthy control sheep. In the purebred survey, four genotypes were present in the Chios sheep (ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/TRQ, ARQ/AHQ and ARQ/ARR) and four in the <b>Karagouniko</b> <b>sheep</b> (ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/AHQ, ARQ/ARR and ARQ/ARH).

40|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} separate outbreaks of Bluetongue (BT) disease of ruminants in Europe since 1998, often entering via the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Spain and Greece. BT {{is caused by}} an orbivirus, Bluetongue virus (BTV), {{a member of the}} family Reoviridae. BTV is a non-enveloped double-capsid virus, which encodes 7 structural proteins (VP 1 -VP 7) and several non-structural proteins (NS 1, NS 2, NS 3 / 3 a and NS 4) from ten double-stranded RNA segments of the genome. In this report, we have prepared BTV virus-like particles (VLPs, composed of VP 2, VP 3, VP 5 and VP 7) and sub-viral, inner core-like particles (CLPs, VP 3 and VP 7) using a recombinant baculovirus expression system. We compared the protective efficacy of VLPs and CLPs in sheep and investigated the importance of geographical lineages of BTV in the development of vaccines. The Greek crossbred <b>Karagouniko</b> <b>sheep,</b> which display mild to sub-clinical BT, were vaccinated with VLPs or CLPs of BTV- 1, derived from western lineage and were challenged with virulent BTV- 1 from an eastern lineage. All VLP-vaccinated animals developed a neutralising antibody response to BTV- 1 from both lineages prior to challenge. Moreover, post-challenged animals had no clinical manifestation or viraemia and the challenged virus replication was completely inhibited. In contrast, CLP-vaccinated animals did not induce any neutralising antibody response but developed the group specific VP 7 antibodies. CLPs also failed to prevent the clinical manifestation and virus replication, but in comparison to controls, the severity of disease manifestation and viraemia was mitigated. The data demonstrated that the outer capsid was essential for complete protection, while the geographical origin of the BTV was not critical for development of a serotype specific vaccine...|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{extensification}} measures {{within the}} agri-environmental {{policies of the}} 2000 reformed CAP, a process of livestock farming intensification has occurred {{in most of the}} sheep and goat farms in the whole country (Hadjigeorgiou and Zervas 2009). Intensification of the farm management in terms of animal feed inputs is reflected in higher consumption of external inputs (feedstuffs), reduction or cessation of using grazing resources or else reduction of the grazing time period. Intensification is also reflected in upgrading the breeding stock of local <b>sheep</b> (<b>Karagouniko,</b> Chios, Arta, Lesvos, Sfakia, Anogia, etc.), goat (indigenous, Skopelos, etc.) or cattle (Katerini, Brachyceros, etc.) breeds (Georgoudis et al. 20012011) by crossing with exotic higher productivity breeds (Lacaune, Awassi, Assaf for sheep; Zaanen, Alpine for goats; Holstein, Charolais, Limousin for cattle, etc.) which are kept in sheds. The introduction of modern technologies in housing and machinery used (milking parlours, automated feeders etc) are also elements of the present day. Furthermore, the limited labour force available, due to social devaluation of the profession and the hard working conditions, as well as the high opportunity cost of family labour, is hampering extensive pastoral management, as there are fewer experienced shepherds available (Vallerand et al. 20012007). As a consequence of all the above, monthly and annual stocking rates as well as grazing pressure on the local vegetation are considerably lowered nowadays.|$|R
40|$|THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CRYPTORCHIDISM IN THE <b>KARAGOUNIKO</b> BREED OF <b>SHEEP</b> AND THEMODE OF INHERITANCE HAVE BEEN STUDIED. CRYPTORCHIDISM IS A GENETIC DEFECT WITH A HIGH FREQUENCY (23, 81 % OF MALE LAMBS) (P< 0. 001) IN THE KARAGOUNIKO BREED. IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH HORNLESSNESS IN RAMS. HORNED RAMS ARE NOT CARRIERS OF THE DEFECT. CRYPTORCHIDISM WAS BILATERAL OR UNILATERAL (20 : 1) (P< 0. 001) ABDOMINAL OR BUBONIC (P< 0. 001). ABDOMINAL BILATERAL CRYPTORCHIDISM IS THE MOST USUAL TYPE (P< 0. 001) AND AMONGST UNILATERAL CRYPTORCHIDS, RIGHT IS MORE COMMON THAN LEFT. CRYPTORCHID LAMBS CAN NOT PRODUCE SPERM. EWES WITH THE CRYPRORCHIDISM CHARACTER PRODUCED MORE MILK AND HAD A HIGHER PROLIFICACY INDEX IN COMPARISON WITH EWES FREE OF THE ANOMALY (P< 0. 001). THEY ALSO BORE MORE MALE THAN FEMALE LAMBS (P< 0. 001). CRYPTORCHIDISM IS NOT A RESULT OF CHIMAERISM OR A RESULT OF ARITHMETIC OR MORPHOLOGICAL DISORDERS IN SEX CHROMOSOMES. TWO INDEPENDENT GENES SEEM TO BE RESPONSIBLE: (I) A DOMINANT GENE AND (II) A RECESSIVE GENE. HORNLESS RAMS (MM OR MM) OR EWES (MM) CAN TRANSFER THE GENES RESPONSIBLE FOR CRYPTORCHIDISM. CRYPTORCHIDISM CAUSES CONSIDERABLE (I) DECREASE IN SHEEP - BREEDERS' INCOME (P< 0. 001) AND (II) RETARDATION TO GENETIC IMPROVEMENT. FURTHERMORE, CRYPTORCHID LAMBS ARE USUALLY BORN BY EWES OF HIGHER MILK YIELD. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT CRYPTORCHIDISM IN A FLOCK CAN BE REDUCED BY USING HORNED RAMS AND SLAUGHTERING ALL THE EWES WITH THE CHARACTER OF CRYPTORCHIDISM. ...|$|R
