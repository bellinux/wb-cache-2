5|$|Due in part {{to strong}} public support, the MTA Board {{committed}} in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from East Harlem to Lower Manhattan. In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion {{for the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway. In 2001, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A new <b>draft</b> <b>statement</b> proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets. South of 14th Street, the line could either travel under Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan, or link to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street to provide access to Lower Manhattan. The Water Street option was the one eventually chosen.|$|E

Although Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens felt the statement [...] "was not written by a proponent," [...] it maintained the general approval for pipeline construction that was demonstrated in the <b>draft</b> <b>statement.</b> U.S. Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton allowed 45–days of comment after the release, and conservationists created a 1,300-page document opposing the impact statement. This document failed to sway Judge Hart, who lifted the injunction on the project on August 15, 1972.|$|E

2500|$|Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri said on 20 June {{that the}} MDC was {{primarily}} responsible for the violence, alleging that the party was using its Democratic Resistance Committees to intimidate voters in an effort [...] "to influence {{the outcome of the}} elections". Chihuri stressed that the police would not tolerate any violence and said that they were enforcing the law fairly and without regard for political affiliation, despite the MDC's claims to the contrary. According to Chihuri, 390 MDC supporters had been arrested for political violence since the first round, along with 156 ZANU-PF supporters. On the same day, Chamisa suggested that the MDC might withdraw from the election, saying that there was [...] "a huge avalanche of calls and pressure from supporters across the country, especially in the rural areas", expressing opposition to taking part in the run-off under the circumstances. Meanwhile, in a <b>draft</b> <b>statement</b> on 20 June, the EU said that it was prepared [...] "to take additional measures against those responsible for violence", which was viewed as a threat to impose stronger sanctions on Zimbabwe.|$|E

She alleged she watched from a wall as the couple kissed, embraced and fondled {{for half an hour}} in the back of Allan's car. Terre'Blanche denied ever having met Shaw. [...] Allan alleged that Shaw had sinister motivations for testifying against her, saying [...] "she has told people she was obsessed with me and {{that was the only way}} she could exorcise me. She was openly bisexual." [...] She also agreed with the statement that Shaw was a [...] "habitual liar" [...] and continued [...] "I disapproved of the number of men she had traipsing into her bedroom and suggested she should have a turnstile on her bedroom door". Andrew Broulidakis, a childhood friend of Allan's who also knew Shaw, brought into question the latter's character in a <b>draft</b> <b>statement</b> supplied to the court. Sebastian Faulks remarked in The Guardian: [...] "What is it that makes George Carman worth £10,000 a day when plaintiffs witness Andrew Broulidakis was so easily able to wrong foot him." [...] A witness also alleged that Shaw had disparagingly referred to Allan as a [...] "frigid bitch" [...] and it would be a [...] "scream" [...] to have her [...] "nailed for gang-banging Nazis". Shaw also faced allegations that she had deliberately gotten pregnant to ensnare a boyfriend and that she had said [...] "I Never trust a man until I've slept with him." ...|$|E

40|$|Dear Dr. Meserve: I {{would like}} to thank you and the other Commissioners for {{providing}} the DOE with the opportunity to comment on the NRC's <b>draft</b> Policy <b>Statement</b> for prescribing decommissioning criteria for the West Valley Demonstration Project (WVDP). The NRC published a <b>draft</b> Policy <b>Statement</b> on December 3, 1999, for establ ishing the decommissioning criteria for the WVDP/West Valley Site and conducted a public meeting on January 5, 2000, to discuss the draft criteria. Upon review of applicable documentation and of the NRC staff's comments at the January 5 public meeting, DOE finds a number of issues with the <b>draft</b> Policy <b>Statement</b> that should be addressed. Our detailed comments on the <b>draft</b> Policy <b>Statement</b> are enclosed. The DOE's issues are both procedural and technical, but primarily revolve around the sequence of agency decision making actions reflected in NRC's <b>draft</b> Policy <b>Statement.</b> The importance of this issue cannot be understated, as it relates the fundamental obligations of our respective agencies established under the WVDP Act. According to the Act: "[w]ithin one year from the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the Commission to establish arrangements for review and consultation by the Commission with respect to the project [...] .
