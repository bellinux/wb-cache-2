25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the <b>dephasing</b> time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.|$|E

2500|$|The NMR signal {{observed}} {{following an}} initial excitation pulse decays with time due to both spin relaxation and any inhomogeneous effects which cause different spins {{in the sample}} to precess at different rates. [...] The first of these, relaxation, leads to an irreversible loss of magnetisation. However, the inhomogeneous <b>dephasing</b> can be removed by applying a 180° inversion pulse that inverts the magnetisation vectors. [...] Examples of inhomogeneous effects include a magnetic field gradient and a distribution of chemical shifts. If the inversion pulse is applied after a period t of <b>dephasing,</b> the inhomogeneous evolution will rephase to form an echo at time 2t. [...] In simple cases, {{the intensity of the}} echo relative to the initial signal is given by e–2t/T2 where T2 is the time constant for spin-spin relaxation. The echo time (TE) is the time between the excitation pulse and the peak of the signal.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of decay {{for a spin}} polarized population can be broadly classified as spin-flip scattering and spin <b>dephasing.</b> Spin-flip scattering is a process inside a solid that does not conserve spin, and can therefore switch an incoming spin up state into an outgoing spin down state. Spin <b>dephasing</b> is the process wherein a population of electrons with a common spin state becomes less polarized over time due to different rates of electron spin precession. In confined structures, spin <b>dephasing</b> can be suppressed, leading to spin lifetimes of milliseconds in semiconductor quantum dots at low temperatures.|$|E
