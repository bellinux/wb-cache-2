His fellow {{executive producer}} Jed Whedon explained that each Marvel project is intended to standalone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has {{to be aware of the}} film division's plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe.

[...] Vicky Frost from the media blog Organgrinder felt that although the storyline was decent, [...] "it did seem to be about three different episodes stuffed into one." [...] She also noted the it was generally [...] "ridiculous, but it isn't nearly as ridiculous - or ridiculously bad - as its spin-off [...] was." [...] Leigh Holmwood however, believed [...] "it was good to see the spy drama return for a seventh series with a high octane episode mixing Islamic terrorism and Russian counter espionage, {{even if it did}} overdo the 'for Queen and country' bit."
