In last two decades, tremendous {{progress has been made}} by the study of QTLs and genes controlling rice flowering, which not only identified the nature of the mobile signal florigen, but also unveiled a complex genetic network that controls florigen in rice. Hd 3 a and RFT 1, two <b>florigens</b> regulated respectively rice flowering under SD and LD, are mainly controlled through Hd 1 and Ehd 1 pathways. However, as mentioned in various T 65 with lack of both, rice also develops some additional pathways that could induce rice flowering.|$|E
30|$|Rice flowers earlier under short day (SD) {{conditions}} {{than under}} long days (LD). The photoperiodic flowering pathway of rice {{is controlled by}} OsGIGANTEA (OsGI) (Yano et al. [2000]; Hayama et al. [2002], [2003]; Kojima et al. [2002]; Doi et al. [2004]). This gene regulates flowering time by promoting Heading date 1 (Hd 1), an ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) (Yano et al. [2000]; Hayama et al. [2002], [2003]). Hd 1 enhances Early heading date 1 (Ehd 1) expression under SD but inhibits its expression under LD (Wei et al. [2010]; Ishikawa et al. [2011]). Ehd 1 is an immediate upstream positive regulator of Heading date 3 a (Hd 3 a) and Rice Flowering Locus T 1 (RFT 1), which encode <b>florigens</b> that promote flowering (Doi et al. [2004]; Tamaki et al. [2007]; Komiya et al. [2008], [2009]).|$|E
40|$|The <b>florigen</b> {{paradigm}} {{implies a}} universal flowering-inducing hormone that {{is common to}} all flowering plants.

Additional studies of SFT and SP (SELF PRUNING, homolog of TFL 1), two antagonistic genes regulating {{the architecture of the}} sympodial shoot system, have suggested that transition to flowering in the day-neutral and perennial tomato is synonymous with ‘termination’.

40|$|Sorghum is {{a typical}} short-day (SD) plant and its use in grain or biomass {{production}} in temperate regions depends on its flowering time control, but the underlying molecular mechanism of floral transition in sorghum is poorly understood. Here we characterized sorghum FLOWERING LOCUS T (SbFT) genes to establish a molecular road map for mechanistic understanding. Out of 19 PEBP genes, SbFT 1, SbFT 8 and SbFT 10 were identified as potential candidates for encoding <b>florigens</b> using multiple approaches. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SbFT 1 clusters with the rice Hd 3 a subclade, while SbFT 8 and SbFT 10 cluster with the maize ZCN 8 subclade. These three genes are expressed in the leaf at the floral transition initiation stage, expressed early in grain sorghum genotypes but late in sweet and forage sorghum genotypes, induced by SD treatment in photoperiod-sensitive genotypes, cooperatively repressed by the classical sorghum maturity loci, interact with sorghum 14 - 3 - 3 proteins and activate flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, suggesting florigenic potential in sorghum.

40|$|Recent {{research}} into the flowering of rice (Oryza sativa) has revealed both unique and conserved genetic pathways in the photoperiodic control of flowering compared with those in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We discovered an early heading date 2 (ehd 2) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date 1 (Hd 1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway. This phenotype in the ehd 2 mutants suggests that Ehd 2 is pivotal for the floral transition in rice. Map-based cloning revealed that Ehd 2 encodes a putative transcription factor with zinc finger motifs orthologous to the INDETERMINATE 1 (ID 1) gene, which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays). Ehd 2 mRNA in rice tissues accumulated most abundantly in developing leaves, but was present at very low levels around the shoot apex and in roots, patterns {{that are similar to}} those of ID 1. To assign the position of Ehd 2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as Ehd 1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd 3 a, and Rice FT-like 1 (RFT 1; rice <b>florigens),</b> between the wild-type plants and the ehd 2 mutants. Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd 2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd 2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd 1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd 3 a and RFT 1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice...|$|E
40|$|FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) {{is a key}} {{flowering}} integrator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), with homologs that encode <b>florigens</b> in many {{plant species}} regardless {{of the type of}} photoperiodic response. We identified 10 FT homologs, which were arranged as five pairs of linked genes in different homoeologous chromosomal regions, in soybean (Glycine max), a paleopolyploid species. Two of the FT homologs, GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a, were highly up-regulated under short-day (SD) conditions (inductive for flowering in soybean) and had diurnal expression patterns with the highest expression 4 h after dawn. Under long-day (LD) conditions, expression of GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a was down-regulated and did not follow a diurnal pattern. Flowering took much longer to initiate under LD than under SD, and only the GmFT 5 a transcript accumulated late in development under LD. Ectopic expression analysis in Arabidopsis confirmed that both GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a had the same function as Arabidopsis FT, but the effect of GmFT 5 a was more prominent. A double-mutant soybean line for two PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA) genes expressed high levels of GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a under LD, and it flowered slightly earlier under LD than the wild type grown under SD. The expression levels of GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a were regulated by the PHYA-mediated photoperiodic regulation system, and the GmFT 5 a expression was also regulated by a photoperiod-independent system in LD.

Two FT homologs, GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a, are involved in photoperiod-regulated flowering and coordinately control flowering in soybean. However, the molecular and genetic understanding of the roles played by GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a in photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean is very limited. In this study, we demonstrated that GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a were able to promote early flowering in soybean by overexpressing these two genes in the soybean cultivar Williams 82 under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. The soybean homologs of several floral identity genes, such as GmAP 1, GmSOC 1 and GmLFY, were significantly upregulated by GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a in a redundant and differential pattern. A bZIP transcription factor, GmFDL 19, was identified as interacting with both GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a, and this interaction was confirmed by yeast two-hybridization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The overexpression of GmFDL 19 in soybean caused early flowering, and the transcription levels of the flowering identity genes were also upregulated by GmFDL 19, as {{was consistent with the}} upregulation of GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a.

40|$|Higher plants use {{multiple}} perceptive {{measures to}} coordinate flowering time with environmental and endogenous cues. Physiological {{studies show that}} <b>florigen</b> is a mobile factor that transmits floral inductive signals from the leaf to the shoot apex. Arabidopsis FT protein {{is widely regarded as}} the archetype <b>florigen</b> found in diverse plant species, particularly in plants that use inductive photoperiods to flower. Recently, a large family of FT homologues in maize, the Zea CENTRORADIALIS (ZCN) genes, was described, suggesting that maize also contains FT-related proteins that act as a <b>florigen.</b> The product of one member of this large family, ZCN 8, has several attributes that make it a good candidate as a maize <b>florigen.</b> Mechanisms underlying the floral transition in maize are less well understood than those of other species, partly because flowering in temperate maize is dependent largely on endogenous signals. The maize indeterminate 1 (id 1) gene is an important regulator of maize autonomous flowering that acts in leaves to mediate the transmission or production of florigenic signals. This study finds that id 1 acts upstream of ZCN 8 to control its expression, suggesting a possible new link to flowering in day-neutral maize. Moreover, in teosinte, a tropical progenitor of maize that requires short-day photoperiods to induce flowering, ZCN 8 is highly up-regulated in leaves under inductive photoperiods. Finally, vascular-specific expression of ZCN 8 in Arabidopsis complements the ft- 1 mutation, demonstrating that leaf-specific expression of ZCN 8 can induce flowering. These results suggest that ZCN 8 may encode a <b>florigen</b> that integrates both endogenous and environmental signals in maize...|$|R
30|$|The plant {{developmental}} {{transition from}} vegetative to reproductive growth is regulated by multiple genes and environmental factors, such as temperature and photoperiod (Koornneef et al. 1998; Wilczek et al. 2010). In rice, this transition influences {{the time of}} floral heading. The heading date is an important agronomic trait of cultivated rice for adaption to variable growth season and photoperiod changes and is also associated with biomass, plant size and grain productivity (Xue et al. 2008; Endo-Higashi and Izawa 2011). Rice are cultivated within {{a wide range of}} latitudes ranging from 55 °N to 36 °S; therefore, a wide range of heading varieties are required for efficient and sustainable agriculture practices in these various geographic regions (Khush 1997). In rice, the flowering time or heading date is primarily controlled by the two <b>florigens,</b> Hd 3 a and RFT 1 (Kojima et al. 2002; Komiya et al. 2008). Hd 3 a, an ortholog of Arabidopsis FT, interacts with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins in the apical cells of shoots, thereby yielding a complex that translocates to the nucleus and binds to OsFD 1, which is a rice transcription factor homologue of Arabidopsis FD, to induce floral initiation (Taoka et al. 2011; Tsuji et al. 2013). RFT 1, another ortholog of Arabidopsis FT, is a major floral activator under long-day (LD) conditions. The defective expression of RFT 1 increases the heading date to more than 200  days, while, RFT 1 overexpression reduces the heading date (Komiya et al. 2008; Komiya et al. 2009). During flower development, Hd 3 a and RFT 1 translocate from the leaf to the apical meristem, thereby activating the expression of downstream genes, such as OsMADS 14, OsMADS 15 and OsMADS 18, which regulate flower development (Tamaki et al. 2007; Komiya et al. 2008; Komiya et al. 2009; Kobayashi et al. 2012).|$|E
30|$|Secondly, {{the tissue}} {{localization}} of Hd 3 a protein was examined using transgenic rice plants expressing Hd 3 a-GFP fusion protein {{driven by the}} Hd 3 a promoter. Hd 3 a-GFP was present in vascular tissue from the leaf blade to {{the upper part of}} the stem, the region just below the meristem where nodes are present, and in the inner cone-like region of the SAM. Hd 3 a-GFP protein is thus synthesized in the vascular tissues of leaf blades and transported through the phloem. Hd 3 a protein is then unloaded from the end of the vascular tissue and enters the SAM through cells just beneath the SAM [74]. Essentially, the same localization of Hd 3 a-GFP was observed when other vascular-specific promoters were used to express Hd 3 a-GFP, confirming that Hd 3 a-GFP is translocated from leaf and stem vasculature to the SAM. These observations indicate that Hd 3 a protein is a mobile flowering signal in rice (Fig.  1). The ability of Hd 3 a/FT protein to move long distances is also suggested from a study of the rice phloem sap proteome [4]. Rice phloem sap contains a member of Hd 3 a/FT protein family, FT-LIKE 12, along with RKIP-like proteins RICE CENTRORADIALIS 3 (RCN 3) and MOTHER OF FT 1. Hd 3 a itself was not detected, probably because photoperiod conditions and timing of sampling was not suitable for detection of Hd 3 a. Hd 3 a/FT proteins, however, have been detected in the phloem sap of other plant species. CmFTL 2, a functional ortholog of Hd 3 a/FT in Cucurbita maxima, has also been found in vascular sap and can move through graft unions to promote flowering [47]. Phloem sap obtained from the inflorescence stems of Brassica napus also contained FT protein [14]. These observations provide additional evidence that Hd 3 a/FT proteins are <b>florigens.</b> Evidence from Arabidopsis also supports the florigen activity of FT protein. Phloem-expressed FT-GFP and Myc-tagged FT move to the apex and cause early flowering, but FT protein with nuclear localization signal or 3 xYFP do not, probably because of immobilization [8, 29, 52].|$|E

Previous studies have revealed that ectopic expression of OsMADS 45 induces early flowering and reduces plant height under short-day (SD) conditions.

We introduce an OsMADS 45 overexpression construct Ubi:OsMADS 45 into TNG 67 plants (an Hd 1 (Heading date 1) and Ehd 1 (Early heading date 1) defective rice cultivar grown in Taiwan), and we analyzed the expression patterns of various floral regulators to understand the regulation pathways affected by OsMADS 45 expression. The transgenic rice exhibit a heading date approximately 40 days earlier than that observed in TNG 67 plants, and transgenic rice display small plant size and low grain yield. OsMADS 45 overexpression did not alter the oscillating rhythm of the examined floral regulatory genes, Hd 3 a (Heading Date 3 a) and RFT 1 (RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1), but advanced (by approximately 20 days) the up-regulation of the two <b>florigens</b> and suppressed the expression of Hd 1 at the juvenile stage. The expression levels of OsMADS 14 and OsMADS 18, which are two well-known reproductive phase transition markers, were also increased at early developmental stages and {{are believed to be}} the major regulators responsible for early flowering in OsMADS 45 -overexpressing transgenic rice. OsMADS 45 overexpression did not influence other floral regulator genes upstream of Hd 1 and Ehd 1, such as OsGI (OsGIGANTEA), Ehd 2 /Osld 1 /RID 1 and OsMADS 50. These results indicate that in transgenic rice, OsMADS 45 overexpressing ectopically activates the upstream genes Hd 3 a and RFT 1 at early developmental stage and up-regulates the expression of OsMADS 14 and OsMADS 18, which promote early flowering. 中文摘要	VII ABSTRACT	VIII 1.

40|$|Two basic {{experiments}} {{defined a}} long-day inhibitory effect on Xanthium flowering: the basal {{half of a}} single leaf on long day inhibits response of the tip half to a short day; and a long-day leaf inhibits response of a short-day leaf, providing it is between the short-day leaf and a receptive bud (whether above or below the short-day leaf). Five hypotheses were explored with the conclusions that the tip half can synthesize <b>florigen,</b> and inhibition is not due to prevention of <b>florigen</b> synthesis, translocational effects, or a translocatable long-day inhibitor. Inhibition is localized and may be a condition of the leaf or a relatively immobile substance. Studies of critical dark period, light intensity, and interruption of a dark period show that, when the leaf is not producing <b>florigen,</b> it is actively inhibitory. Immature leaves are more inhibitory than older leaves. The effect was found not to pass dead tissue, and iron-deficient tissue will cause inhibition, though it will not cause promotion...|$|R
40|$|The annual weed, beggar-ticks, is a quantative short-day plant. The {{flowering}} {{process was}} analyzed by preparation of experimental plants with different leaf or branch systems {{and by their}} exposure to short or long days in different patterns. We found that the flowering stimulus, <b>florigen,</b> seems to be produced in the leaves exposed to short days {{for at least three}} to four days. The <b>florigen</b> needed to evoke a flower initial in a vegetative bud is produced in sufficient amounts by one short-day leaf. The <b>florigen</b> probably moves from the induced leaf (source) to the receptor bud (sink) after assimilation stream. It seems likely that the inhibition of flowering by long-day treatment is not caused by a specific transmissible inhibitor produced in the long-day leaf. The long-day leaf attached at the upper node or on a branch inhibits flowering of the terminal bud simply as a result of competitive blocking of the assimilation stream from the induced short-day leaf attached at the lower node or on an other branch to the terminal bud...|$|R
30|$|Flowering {{time is a}} key trait for {{geographical}} {{and seasonal}} adaptation of plants and is an important consideration for rice breeders. Recently identified genetic factors provide new insights into this complex trait. The list of genes involved in flowering and their functions {{tells us that the}} molecular basis of day-length measurement includes both of the evolution of unique factors and the regulatory adaptation of conserved factors in rice. This information helped identify rice <b>florigen,</b> a mobile flowering signal. Our current view of flowering time regulation incorporates the presence of complex layers of gene networks integrated with the synthesis of <b>florigen</b> protein and its subsequent transport and perception.|$|R
40|$|Day length {{perceived}} by a leaf {{is a major}} environmental factor that controls the timing of flowering. It has been believed that a mobile, long-distance signal called <b>florigen</b> is produced in the leaf under inductive day length conditions, and is transported to the shoot apex where it triggers floral morphogenesis. Grafting experiments have shown that flori-gen is transmissible from a donor plant that {{has been subjected to}} inductive day length to an uninduced recipient plant. However, the nature of <b>florigen</b> has long remained elusive. Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is expressed in cotyledons and leaves in response to inductive long days (LDs). FT protein, with a basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD, acts in the shoot apex to induce target meristem identity genes such as APETALA 1 (AP 1) and initiates floral morphogenesis. Recent studies have provided evidence that the FT protein in Arabidopsis and corresponding proteins in other species {{are an important part of}} <b>florigen.</b> Our work shows that the FT activity, either from overexpressing or inducible transgenes or from the endogen-ous gene, to promote flowering is transmissible through a graft junction, and that an FT protein with a T 7 tag is transported from a donor scion to the apical region of recipient stock plants and becomes detectable within a day or two. The sequence and structure of mRNA are not of critical importance for the long-distance action of the FT gene. These observations led to the conclusion that the FT protein, but not mRNA, is the essential component of <b>florigen...</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{problems}} with isolating <b>florigen,</b> and of the inconsistent results acquired, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>florigen</b> does not exist as an individual substance; rather, florigen's effect could be the result of a particular ratio of other hormones. However, more recent findings indicate that <b>florigen</b> does exist and is produced, or at least activated, in the leaves of the plant and that this signal is then transported via the phloem to the growing tip at the shoot apical meristem where the signal acts by inducing flowering. In Arabidopsis thaliana, some researchers have identified this signal as mRNA coded by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, others as the resulting FT protein. First report of FT mRNA being the signal transducer that moves from leaf to shoot apex came from the publication in Science Magazine. However, in 2007 other group of scientists made a breakthrough saying that it is not the mRNA, but the FT Protein that is transmitted from leaves to shoot possibly acting as [...] "Florigen". The initial article that described FT mRNA as flowering stimuli was retracted by the authors themselves.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the above}} regulators, Ehd 1 {{expression}} is also modulated by other four flowering factors independently. Indeterminate 1 (ID 1) {{is one of}} them, which expresses in leaf but induces flowering in the shoot meristem. ID 1 has been {{once thought to be}} involved in the <b>florigen</b> synthesis in maize (Colasanti et al., 2006; Colasanti et al., 1998), and its regulated mechanism has been exhibited in rice. Lesions in rice RID 1 (Early heading date 2 /OsINDETERMINATE 1 /Rice INDETERMINATE 1, Ehd 2 /OsID 1 /RID 1, RID 1 for short) lead to extremely late flowering phenotype, as well as decreased expression of Ehd 1 and downstream <b>florigen</b> genes under both SD and LD (Matsubara et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008).|$|R
30|$|Ghd 7 also {{functions}} to repress Ehd 1, but its transcription peaks at 2 to 3 weeks before declining {{to a low}} level. This occurs much earlier than when the <b>florigen</b> genes are expressed (Matsubara et al. [2011]; Kim et al. [2013]). OsCOL 4 is another regulator that suppresses Ehd 1 and the <b>florigen</b> genes. In particular, OsCOL 4 expression is maintained {{at a high level}} in the early vegetative stages but decreases when Ehd 1 expression begins (Lee et al. [2010]). This temporal expression pattern is similar to SNB and OsIDS 1 except that OsCOL 4 is reduced later than the AP 2 genes. Therefore, these results suggest that the AP 2 genes as well as Ghd 7 and OsCOL 4 coordinately suppress flowering time.|$|R
30|$|Besides Ehd 1, T 65 also bears a loss-of-function allele of Hd 1, but {{it could}} still flower in time {{and serves as a}} {{commercial}} rice variety, so there are must some other regulators independent of Hd 1 and Ehd 1 in rice flowering network (Doi et al., 2004). OsCO 3 and DTH 2 are two of them, and promote flowering by regulating <b>florigen</b> genes. Though both of them are COL genes, they function under different photoperiodic conditions. Expressions of Hd 3 a and FT-like genes are decreased in the OsCO 3 -overexpressing plants under SD without altered expression of other <b>florigen</b> upstream regulators, suggesting that OsCO 3 primarily controls flowering time under SD by negatively regulating the expression of <b>florigen</b> genes, independent of other known SD-promotion pathways (Kim et al., 2008). For DTH 2, both association analysis and transgenic experiments indicate that two functional nucleotide polymorphisms that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD in northern Asia. Further combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH 2 probably represents a target of artificial selection for adaptation to LD during rice domestication and improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding (Wu et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Phytochromes {{mediate the}} {{photoperiodic}} control of flowering in rice (Oryza sativa), a short-day plant. Recent molecular genetics studies have revealed a genetic network {{that enables the}} critical daylength response of <b>florigen</b> gene expression. Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity 5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd 7), a floral repressor gene in rice. There are three phytochrome genes in rice, but the roles of each phytochrome family member in daylength response have not previously been defined. Here, we revealed multiple action points for each phytochrome in the critical daylength response of <b>florigen</b> expression by using single and double phytochrome mutant lines of rice. Our results show that either phyA alone or a genetic combination of phyB and phyC can induce Ghd 7 mRNA, whereas phyB alone causes some reduction in levels of Ghd 7 mRNA. Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd 7 activity and Early heading date 1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively. Therefore, each phytochrome gene of rice has distinct roles, {{and all of the}} phytochrome actions coordinately control the critical daylength response of <b>florigen</b> expression in rice...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} {{to respond to}} day length, photoperiodism, is crucial for flowering plants to adapt to seasonal change. The photoperiodic control of flowering in plants is mediated by a long-distance mobile floral stimulus called <b>florigen</b> that moves from leaves to the shoot apex. Although the proteins encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and its orthologs in other plants are identified as the long-sought <b>florigen,</b> whether their transport is a simple diffusion process or under regulation remains elusive. Here we show that an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (FTIP 1), is an essential regulator required for FT protein transport in Arabidopsis. Loss of function of FTIP 1 exhibits late flowering under long days, which {{is partly due to}} the compromised FT movement to the shoot apex. FTIP 1 and FT share similar mRNA expression patterns and subcellular localization, and they interact specifically in phloem companion cells. FTIP 1 is required for FT export from companion cells to sieve elements, thus affecting FT transport through the phloem to the SAM. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of <b>florigen</b> transport, demonstrating that FT moves in a regulated manner and that FTIP 1 mediates FT transport to induce flowering...|$|R
40|$|Xanthium pennsylvanicum is induced {{to flower}} by {{exposure}} to a single uninterrupted dark period equal to or exceeding some minimum duration (ca. 9 hours). A system of stages of floral bud development is described, which gives a quantitative measurement {{of the degree of}} induction caused by various treatments. A number of factors which may affect the degree of induction are investigated, and it is concluded that age of the leaf and light intensity before and after induction strongly influence the effects of a given inductive dark period, while other factors are less important in this respect. Methods in the use of auxin are also described. Auxin is shown to inhibit induction in the leaf, but to promote floral bud development after induction is complete. Applied auxin will replace a requirement for the presence of active buds after and just before induction. The induced state is discussed, and it is proposed that this condition consists of a given concentration of <b>florigen</b> in the plant which is maintained at the level brought about by the act of induction. Concentration curves indicate that auxin acts in floral inhibition such as it does in other auxin-induced phenomena. Applied auxin has little effect upon the critical night length, but inhibits the rate of <b>florigen</b> synthesis which follows. Auxin is most effective when applied two to three hours after the beginning of the dark period, and its effectiveness decreases up until translocation of <b>florigen</b> out of the leaf is complete. Light interruption of the dark period is most effective after 8 hours. Light interruption and auxin are additive in their inhibitory effect. It is suggested that the act of induction consists of at least three phases: transformation of photo-receptor pigment, preparatory reaction, and hormone synthesis. A possible mechanism of auxin action through destruction of <b>florigen</b> is discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Florigen,</b> {{a protein}} encoded by the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis and Heading date 3 a (Hd 3 a) in rice, is the {{universal}} flowering hormone in plants. <b>Florigen</b> is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem and initiates floral evocation. In shoot apical cells, conserved cytoplasmic 14 - 3 - 3 proteins act as <b>florigen</b> receptors. A hex-americ <b>florigen</b> activation complex (FAC) composed of Hd 3 a, 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, and OsFD 1, a transcription factor, activates OsMADS 15, a rice homolog of Arabidopsis APETALA 1, leading to flowering. Because FD {{is a key}} com-ponent of the FAC, we characterized the FD gene family and their functions. Phylogenetic analysis of FD genes indicated that this family {{is divided into two}} groups: (i) canonical FD genes that are conserved among eudicots and non-Poaceae monocots; and (ii) Poaceae-specific FD genes that are orga-nized into three subgroups: Poaceae FD 1, FD 2 and FD 3. The Poaceae FD 1 group shares a small sequence motif, T(A/V) LSLNS, with FDs of eudicots and non-Poaceae mono-cots. Overexpression of OsFD 2, a member of the Poaceae FD 2 group, produced smaller leaves with shorter plasto-chrons, suggesting that OsFD 2 controls leaf development. In vivo subcellular localization of Hd 3 a, 14 - 3 - 3 and OsFD 2 suggested that in contrast to OsFD 1, OsFD 2 is restricted to the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoplasmic 14 - 3 - 3 proteins, and interaction of Hd 3 a with 14 - 3 - 3 facili-tates nuclear translocation of the FAC containing OsFD 2. These results suggest that FD function has diverged between OsFD 1 and OsFD 2, but formation of a FAC is essential for their function...|$|R
40|$|The {{superiority of}} hybrids {{has long been}} {{exploited}} in agriculture, and although many models explaining "heterosis" have been put forth, direct empirical support is limited. Particularly elusive have been cases of heterozygosity for single gene mutations causing heterosis under a genetic model known as overdominance. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), plants carrying mutations in SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) encoding the flowering hormone <b>florigen</b> are severely delayed in flowering, become extremely large, and produce few flowers and fruits, but when heterozygous, yields are dramatically increased. Curiously, this overdominance is evident only {{in the background of}} "determinate" plants, in which the continuous production of side shoots and inflorescences gradually halts due to a defect in the flowering repressor SELF PRUNING (SP). How sp facilitates sft overdominance is unclear, but is thought to relate to the opposing functions these genes have on flowering time and shoot architecture. We show that sft mutant heterozygosity (sft/+) causes weak semi-dominant delays in flowering of both primary and side shoots. Using transcriptome sequencing of shoot meristems, we demonstrate that this delay begins before seedling meristems become reproductive, followed by delays in subsequent side shoot meristems that, in turn, postpone the arrest of shoot and inflorescence production. Reducing SFT levels in sp plants by artificial microRNAs recapitulates the dose-dependent modification of shoot and inflorescence production of sft/+ heterozygotes, confirming that fine-tuning levels of functional SFT transcripts provides a foundation for higher yields. Finally, we show that although flowering delays by <b>florigen</b> mutant heterozygosity are conserved in Arabidopsis, increased yield is not, likely because cyclical flowering is absent. We suggest sft heterozygosity triggers a yield improvement by optimizing plant architecture via its dosage response in the <b>florigen</b> pathway. Exploiting dosage sensitivity of <b>florigen</b> and its family members therefore provides a path to enhance productivity in other crops, but species-specific tuning will be required...|$|R
50|$|Another set of {{flowering}} controls stems from photoperiodism which initiates flowering {{based on the}} length of nighttime. Long day plants flower with a short night, while short day plants require uninterrupted darkness. Some plants are restricted to either condition, while others can operate under a combination of the two, and some plants do not operate under photoperiodism. In Arabidopsis, the gene CONSTANS responds to long day conditions and enables flowering when it stops repressing flowering locus t (Shim et al. 2015). In rice, photoperiodic response is slightly more complex and is controlled by the <b>florigen</b> genes Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1) and Heading date 3 a (Hd3a). Hd3a, is a homolog {{of flowering}} locus t and, when no longer repressed, activates flowering by directing modification of DNA at the shoot apical meristem with <b>florigen.</b> Heading date 1 (Hd1) is a gene that promotes flowering under short day conditions but represses flowering under long day as it either activates or suppresses Hd3a. Meanwhile, RFT1 can cause flowering under non-inductive long day. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 can lead to silencing of the genes through histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. A variety of chromatin modifications operating in both long and short days or only under one condition can also affect the two <b>florigen</b> genes in rice (Sun et al. 2014).|$|R
50|$|<b>Florigen</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by Soviet Armenian plant physiologist Mikhail Chailakhyan, who in 1937 demonstrated that floral induction {{can be transmitted}} through a graft from an induced plant to one {{that has not been}} induced to flower. Anton Lang showed that several long-day plants and biennials could be made to flower by treatment with gibberellin, when grown under a non-flower-inducing (or non-inducing) photoperiod. This led to the suggestion that <b>florigen</b> may be made up of two classes of flowering hormones: Gibberellins and Anthesins. It was later postulated that during non-inducing photoperiods, long-day plants produce anthesin, but no gibberellin while short-day plants produce gibberellin but no anthesin. However, these findings did not account for the fact that short-day plants grown under non-inducing conditions (thus producing gibberellin) will not cause flowering of grafted long-day plants that are also under noninductive conditions (thus producing anthesin).|$|R
