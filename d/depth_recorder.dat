5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the terrestrial Crittercam {{made it possible for}} researchers to monitor the animals and their activity exactly when it occurred. Previously, the cameras could only record data and images for future playback once the camera was retrieved from the animal. When introduced in 2001 the camera was about half an inch in size. It had a resolution of 340 lines and is sensitive down to 3 lux. At this time it used a nine-volt battery for short term documentation of the animal’s activities and a 1-pound battery to monitor for one week. The size of the battery continually increased as the duration of documentation did as well. Footage obtained from its use has appeared in program titles including [...] "Great White Shark", [...] "Sea Monsters," [...] and “Tiger Shark”.The first depth gauge was invented in the late 1800s. However, it wasn’t until 1964 that the first <b>depth</b> <b>recorder</b> was actually placed on an animal, a Weddell seal in Antarctica. The next advancement in recording animal-borne imagery was made possible by a microprocessor that attached a video camera in a submersible case to a loggerhead turtle. This case {{came to be known as}} the Crittercam. Marshall first conceived his idea of the Crittercam on a diving trip in Belize. During one dive he encountered a shark with a sucker fish clinging to its body. He then realized that if a camera could be utilized to replace the sucker fish, researchers could explore the environment and behavior of sharks without having to dive deep. He immediately began work on this idea, receiving small grants from the American Museum of Natural History to support his funding. He later secured a grant from the National Geographic Society and began to develop highly improved prototypes of his initial device that was strapped to the loggerhead turtle. These prototypes were successfully utilized on sharks and sea turtles. Since its production the Crittercam has been used to study the underwater behaviors of green turtles, humpback whales, blue whales, monk seals, reef sharks, and many other marine animals. When employed on emperor penguins, the camera proves its usefulness by capturing their behavior below the ice of Antarctica’s waters where no human would be able to dive and manually record because of the freezing temperatures. In order to ensure the safety of the animals, in case something was to go wrong with the camera, scientists are able to remove the device through a remote control.|$|E

These benthic dives decreased markedly in the days following or prior to a nesting event, suggesting that the behaviours associated with nesting may be protracted. This importance of the seabed for loggerhead turtles in Cyprus contrasts with the far more extensive use of mid-water resting dives recently reported for this species in Japan.

However, recent use of animal-borne video imaging, temperature and <b>depth</b> <b>recorders,</b> and satellite telemetry has shown that monk seals spend much more time foraging in deeper water outside the reefs at sub-photic depths of 300 m or more. Hawaiian monk seals breed and haul-out on sand, corals, and volcanic rock; sandy beaches are more commonly used for pupping. Due to the immense distance separating the Hawaiian Islands from other land masses capable of supporting the Hawaiian monk seal, its habitat is limited to the Hawaiian Islands.|$|R

40|$|Studies on diving {{behavior}} of marine mammals using data loggers including time <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> (TDR) are becoming popular these days.

40|$|International audienceDive {{duration}} generally decreases with dive {{depth in}} air-breathing vertebrates. In most penguin species, this occurs due to increasing transit (descent and ascent) durations. However, in U-shaped dives, {{this is also}} because {{the duration of the}} bottom phase of the dive increases with increasing depth. We considered the time-based efficiency with which birds can use different diving depths by using <b>depth</b> <b>recorders</b> on 9 foraging emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri, studied during the early and late chick-rearing period in Adélie Land, Antarctica. Dive and post-dive duration positively correlated with diving depth, but particularly long recovery durations were apparent for dives longer than 456 s. This inflection point (i. e. 456 s) corresponded to a theorized maximum rate of gain of prey per dive cycle. By using the number of undulations in the bottom phase of the dive as a proxy for prey capture success, we conclude that the most lucrative dive depths for the birds studied were between 50 and 225 m. Since these depths were also those most often visited, we think that foraging emperor penguins focus on depths where profitability is highest...|$|R

Females also spent one hour longer diving per day compared to males. There were differences in diving strategies and diet, indicating that both sexes targeted essentially the same prey, but of different sizes, males specializing in bigger fish. Although the relationship between sexual dimorphism and diving depth was positive (larger animals diving deeper), evidence suggests that body size (in terms of oxygen storage capacity) is not sufficient to explain so many differences in foraging ecology. Instead, we propose prey size (possibly driven by a limitation of prey handling ability in relation to beak size) could be an essential factor in shaping the male/female behavioural segregation in the Crozet shag; future studies should concentrate on this particular aspect...|$|R

However, {{there is a need}} to investigate other possible impacts of instruments on animals. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of deploying instruments on the surface temperature distribution of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). Infrared (IR) thermography was used to record the surface temperature of two juveniles that had been fitted with heart rate recorders and mounting straps for the attachment of a time <b>depth</b> <b>recorder.</b> When animals were fully wet and inactive, the surface temperature pattern was unaffected by instruments. However, as animals dried out regions of high temperature were recorded around the edges of attachment sites compared to surrounding fur. This appeared to be due to heat leakage around the sides of instruments and mounting straps that provided an additional layer of insulation. There were no obvious changes in the surface temperature distribution around instruments associated with duration of deployment. This work shows that attachment of relatively small biologging instruments will produce localised effects on heat transfer in air but will not significantly change the total heat exchange of grey seals on land or at sea.
