After Japanese occupation during World War II, it became a UN Trust Territory under Australia and remained so until achieving independence in 1968. In 1989 Nauru sued Australia in the International Court of Justice in The Hague for damages caused by mining. Australia settled the case out of court agreeing to a lump sum settlement of A$107 million and an annual stipend of the equivalent of A$2.5 million toward <b>environmental</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b>|$|E

The corporation was intended to have a 20-year lifespan, during which it would oversee an $8 billion public-private redevelopment plan covering the Anacostia River waterfront, as well as numerous parcels of land in the city east of the river. However, a change in mayoral administrations and frustration with the slow pace of redevelopment resulted in abolition of the corporation after three years.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 26%. of all fish, reptiles, birds, {{and mammals}} in South Florida are exotic—more {{than in any}} other part of the United States—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Many of the {{biological}} controls like weather, disease, and consumers that naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originated, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Concerns over the quality of the Everglades were raised {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century, and by [...] 2000 a federally funded initiative was enacted that gave Everglades restoration the distinction of being the largest planned <b>environmental</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> in history. Exotic species control falls under the management of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994.

40|$|Background: {{during the}} last decades of the 20 th century, many {{psychiatric}} hospitals changed their chronic psychiatric clients' living environments. Aims: we investigated {{the effect of this}} rehabilitation and normalization process on clients' activity and participation level. Method: we developed a new model that we have called the theoretical <b>environmental</b> psychiatric <b>rehabilitation</b> model, and conducted seven years of panel research with all the chronic psychiatric clients resided in one Dutch psychiatric hospital. Results: our theoretical model is largely supported by the data. It demonstrates that more normal living environments {{have a positive effect on}} clients' activity and participation level. This is controlled for the fact that younger clients, and clients with a relative high activity and participation level are selected for these normal living environments.
