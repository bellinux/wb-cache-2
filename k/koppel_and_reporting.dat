40|$|Metal-free chiral Brønsted acid {{catalysis}} {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} new class of chiral organic catalysis. Several quite nice chiral Brønsted acids, such as urea/thiourea, alcohol, and phosphoric acid, have already been reported as a chiral electron acceptor of carbonyl and imine compounds. 1 However, compared with chiral metal Lewis acid catalysts, the utility of chiral Brønsted acid catalysts is still limited to the reactive substrates. This drawback can be overcome by designing a Brønsted acid catalyst with higher acidity. To increase the acidity of Brønsted acids, it is necessary to increase the stability of the counteranion. <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> co-workers <b>reported</b> that introduction of a strong electron acceptor group, such as d NTf, into an acid system instead of an dO group increased the stability of counteranions and their acidity (Figure 1). 2 For example, the pKa of N-triflyl benzamide in acetonitrile (11. 06) is much lower than that of benzoic acid (20. 7).
