50|$|Thermal mixing is an <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{between the}} {{electron}} spin ensemble {{and the nuclear}} spin, which {{can be thought of}} as using multiple electron spins to provide hyper nuclear polarization. Note that the electron spin ensemble acts as a whole because of stronger inter-electron interactions. The strong interactions lead to a homogeneously broadened EPR lineshape of the involved paramagnetic species. The linewidth is optimized for polarization transfer from electrons to nuclei, when it is close to the nuclear Larmor frequency. The optimization is related to an embedded three-spin (electron-electron-nucleus) process that mutually flips the coupled three spins under the energy conservation (mainly) of the Zeeman interactions. Due to the inhomogeneous component of the associated EPR lineshape, the DNP enhancement by this mechanism also scales as B0−1.|$|E
40|$|Computational {{aerothermodynamics}} {{concerns the}} coupling of real gas effects with {{equations of motion}} to include thermochemical rate processes for chemical and <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>phenomena.</b> These processes concern the creation and destruction of gas species by chemical reactions and the transfer of energy between the various species and between the various energy modes (e. g., translation, rotation, vibration, ionization, dissociation/recombination, etc.) of the species. To gain some insight into when such phenomena occur for current and future aerospace flight vehicles the author shows the flight regimes of some typical vehicles (e. g., Concord, aerospace plane, Space Shuttle, associated space transfer vehicles, Apollo entry vehicle, etc.) in terms of flight altitude and flight speed. Also indicated are regimes where chemical reactions such as dissociation and ionization are important and where nonequilibrium thermochemical phenomena are important...|$|E
40|$|The "coupled-mode" {{theory has}} proved {{itself to be}} an {{important}} tool in the analysis of <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>phenomena</b> between traveling waves. In its original form [1] it is capable of yielding important qualitative results. To extend its range of usefulness into the quantitative domain, one needs to evaluate the coupling coefficients which govern the energy exchange. This is done in this paper where we treat the 'small coupling' case. We assume that in obtaining the coupling coefficients for the small coupling case we may use for the different physical observables their values in the absence of coupling. This procedure is analogous to that used in evaluating the Q of a cavity or the attenuation constant of a waveguide, for the small loss case, where the loss-free field solutions are used instead of the actual solutions in the presence of losses, and is a type of perturbation theory formulated on physical grounds...|$|E
40|$|A finite (periodic) FPU {{chain is}} chosen as a {{convenient}} point for investigating the <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in nonlinear oscillatory systems. As we have recently shown, this phenomenon may {{occur as a}} consequence of the resonant interaction between high-frequency nonlinear normal modes. This interaction determines both the complete <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> between different parts of the chain and the transition to energy localization in an excited group of particles. In the paper, we demonstrate that this mechanism can exist in realistic (asymmetric) models of atomic or molecular oscillatory chains. Also, we study the resonant interaction of conjugated nonlinear normal modes and prove a possibility of linearization of the equations of motion. The theoretical constructions developed in this paper are based on the concepts of "effective particles" and Limiting Phase Trajectories. In particular, an analytical description of <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> between the "effective particles" in the terms of non-smooth functions is presented. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

In this paper are discussed topics concerning credit risk, market price risk and foreign exchange risk. In the part of credit risk there are introduced issues covered the introduction to the whole credit risk mechanism, the split of the risk between different risk holders and the tools serving to the risk mitigation. The market risk includes primarily the risk connected with the actual value of the futures contracts and its possible change, furthermore the liquidity and margining requirements due to market changes and mark to market evaluation are described. The foreign exchange risk derives {{from the fact that the}} price of exchange contracts and the payments are in euros, but the domestic currency is Czech crown. In focus are the possible changes in the contact value nominated in crowns due to exchange rate volatility, without any certain presumable trend. The models used to demonstrate the impact of the above mentioned factors are based on the Monte Carlo simulation methodology. Each demonstration uses a simple example, which clarifies the assumptions on which the simulations are calculated.

The {{aim of this}} work is to study the MLS in order to optimize the inverse greenhouse effect; its is made by a survey on theoretical formalism of the <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>phenomena.</b> This optimization requires that the window materials (MLS) are good reflectors in the visible range and assuring a total transmission in the infrared zone (8 - 13 µm). One of the support elements, of the window, answering to these criterions is germanium, for which we have studied the thickness influence and {{have found that the}} equilibrium temperature reached by the absorber has a minimal value between 0. 01 µm and 0. 06 µm. However, only with germanium, the window can not products the inverse greenhouse effect. Indeed, the germanium must include other layers in order to increase the visible reflectance and the infrared transmittance (8 - 13 µm); what forms a multilayered structure. Several system have been used, only 7 of them have been kept for this work: S 1, S 2, …, S 7 systems Only the following systems: S 2 /S 1, S 3 /S 2 /S 1 and MgO/S 3 /S 2 /S 1 give a radiative cooling effect, with a very good result of 15 °C below ambient temperature {{in the case of the}} S 6 system. To approach of the real conditions of this system realization (S 6), we simulated the effects of such imperfections, as presence of air, that would be due to the quality of the layers deposition. This study is made in the case of the S 7 system. As results, we found that, for zenithal angles ≤ 60 °, the layers of air, for which the thickness is lower than 0. 5 µm, don't present any influence on the absorber's equilibrium temperature.

40|$|The present thesis {{presents}} several theoretical {{studies on}} the dynamical processes of physicochemical interest involving superfluid helium (4 He) nanodroplets. It has been developed a theoretical approach and computationally implemented. This consists {{in the first stage}} on the theoretical study of chemical reaction dynamics in superfluid helium nanodroplets. The description of the system is fully quantum and consists in a hybrid method in which different theoretical approaches are combined to describe the different components of the system. The liquid helium (superfluid) has been described through the Density Functional Theory (DFT), using a phenomenological energy functional. Atomic and molecular impurities have been described by means of standard quantum dynamics. The methodology developed in the present thesis has been applied to the study of various physicochemical processes of interest. These studies con be grouped as: -	Study of the structure, energy and electronic spectroscopy of helium nanodroplets doped with atomic oxygen in different electronic states. In this work, the influence of the electronic state of oxygen and energy structure of the drop has been determined to be the induction of anisotropy on the helium density (for the open-shell cases), as well as the high quality of helium nanodroplets acting as a matrix for high-resolution spectroscopy confirmed. -	Investigation on the dynamics of the photodissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules in superfluid helium nanodroplets. In this context, the method developed has been initially applied to the case of molecular chlorine. Some interesting results related with the <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and generation of quantum (confined) resonances due tot the interaction of the molecules with the helium nanodroplet have been reported. Moreover, the relaxation process of the nanodroplet after the photodissociation has been also studied. This methodology developed has been also applied to the case of two halogen homonuclear diatomic molecules more, Br 2 and I 2. Different phenomenology and mechanism have been found for these cases, even producing full recombination for the biggest droplet considered. Furthermore, {{in order to determine the}} role played by the mass of the atoms of the diatomic homonuclear molecule on this process, we have studied the photodissociation dynamics of prototypic “isomers” of Cl 2. -	We have modeled the process of the capture of a neon atom by superfluid helium nanodroplets. We have restricted to the case of zero angular momentum as a first approach to the problem at the quantum level. We obtained the time scale of this process. Also, it was found that the <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> does not take place at any time, but until the velocity is low enough (Landau’s critical velocity) there is no mechanism for the <b>exchange</b> <b>energy.</b> This leads to a constant (mean) velocity of the quantum particle (Ne atom), since the friction force is zero. The resulting wave packet in momentum representation has a Gaussian type profile. -	The synthesis reaction of a dimer of van der Waals (Ne 2) in helium nanodroplets has been investigated. This process starts with a drop initially doped with Ne atom. Then, a second Ne atom is captured, which initiates the process of the synthesis. We have restricted to the zero angular momentum case for computational reasons. A great variety of phenomenology (reaction mechanisms) depending on the collision velocity and the droplet size has been found. La present Tesi doctoral comprèn diferents estudis teòrics sobre processos fisicoquímics relacionats amb nanogotes d'heli (4 He) superfluid. Per a la seva realització s'ha desenvolupat la metodologia teòrica i implementat a nivell computacional. Es tracta d'un primer estudi teòric en qual s'estudia la dinàmica de reaccions químiques en nanogotes d'heli superfluid. La descripció del sistema és completament quàntica, combinant diferents aproximacions teòriques per descriure els components del sistema. L'heli líquid s'ha descrit a través de la teoria del funcional de la densitat (DFT), utilitzant un funcional fenomenològic. Les impureses atòmiques i moleculars s'han descrit mitjançant dinàmica quàntica. La metodologia desenvolupada ha estat aplicada a l'estudi de diversos processos d'interès quimicofísic. Aquests són: -	Estudi de l'estructura, energètica i espectroscòpia electrònica de nanogotes d'heli dopades amb oxigen atòmic en diferents estats electrònics. -	Estudi de la dinàmica de la fotodissociació de molècules diatòmiques homonuclears en nanogotes d'heli superfluid. El mètode desenvolupat s'ha aplicat inicialment al cas del clor molecular. Posteriorment s'ha realitzat els casos del brom i el iode, així com d'"isòtops" artificials del clor amb l'objecte de determinar la influència de la massa sobre aquest tipus de processos. S’ha pogut determinar la formació de ressonàncies quàntiques, les qual s’han estudiat amb detall posteriorment. -	Modelització del procés de captura d'un àtom de neó per part de nanogotes d'heli superfluid. S'ha estudiat el cas de moment angular nul com una primera aproximació a la problemàtica a nivell quàntic. -	Reacció de síntesi d'un dímer de van der Waals (Ne 2) en nanogotes d'heli.

40|$|Treadmill walking aims to {{simulate}} overground walking, but intra-stride belt speed variations of treadmills result in some interaction between treadmill and subject, possibly obstructing this aim. Especially in self-paced treadmill walking, {{in which the}} belt speed constantly adjusts to the subject, these interactions might affect the gait pattern significantly. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> between subject and treadmill, during the fixed speed (FS) and self-paced (SP) modes of treadmill walking. Eighteen subjects walked on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill at both modes. The <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> was calculated as the integration of the product of the belt speed deviation and the fore-aft ground reaction force over the stride cycle. The total positive <b>energy</b> <b>exchange</b> was 0. 44. J/stride and the negative exchange was 0. 11.
