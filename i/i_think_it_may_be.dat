I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and {{to the establishment of}} a Yankee marine.|$|E

It's very, very serious and I think it will really divide the audience. It will really test them and their {{relationship}} to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A eugenicist {{who applied}} his social Darwinism to entire nations, Pearson saw war against [...] "inferior races" [...] as a logical {{implication}} {{of the theory of}} evolution [...] "My view – and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> called the scientific view of a nation," [...] he wrote, [...] "is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races." [...] He reasoned that, if August Weismann's theory of germ plasm is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from poor stock.|$|E

I don't believe {{that neither of}} you gave the other quite a fair chance. There! Now I've got rid on it,' said Mr Tapley {{in a fit of}} desperation: 'I can't go a-carryin' it about in my own mind, bustin' myself with it; {{yesterday}} was quite long enough. It's out now. I can't help it. I'm sorry for it. Don't wisit on him, sir, that's all.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Collier's {{views on}} {{religion}} and ethics are interesting for their comparison with the views of Thomas and Julian Huxley, both of whom gave Romanes lectures on that subject. In The religion of an artist (1926) Collier explains [...] "It [...] is mostly concerned with ethics apart from religion... I {{am looking forward to}} a time when ethics will have taken the place of religion... My religion is really negative. [...] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain on upon the reasoning faculties." [...] On secular morality: [...] "My standard is frankly utilitarian. As far as morality is intuitive, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens." [...] His views on ethics, then, were very close to the agnosticism of T.H. Huxley and the humanism of Julian Huxley.|$|E

And [...] "An omnipotent Deity who sentences even the vilest of his creatures to eternal torture is infinitely more cruel than the cruellest man".

6000|$|... "It must {{be looked}} to," [...] Muir continued, [...] "and, after all, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> well {{to hold a}} short {{consultation}} with Master Cap, than whom a more loyal subject {{does not exist in}} the British empire." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> {{therefore}} {{be of some}} use to lay before you the chief causes of this wretched condition we are in, {{and then it will}} be easier to assign what remedies are in our power toward removing, at least, some part of these evils.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe, sir, we {{must all}} follow so good an example," [...] Mr. Sharp observed; [...] "and I {{sincerely}} hope that this scheme will not prove useless. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> effected by means {{of some of the}} public agents at Mogadore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you call much," [...] said Augustus, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> done {{for three or four}} hundred a year.

60|$|We went to Milton on as fine a day {{as could}} consist with snow on the ground. The {{situation}} is eminently beautiful; a fine promontory round which the Clyde makes a magnificent bend.

6000|$|... 'I don't know. A mutual {{understanding}} follows, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> carry us through. Here I split my discourse (give me your arm, Sophronia), into three heads, {{to make it}} shorter and plainer. Firstly, it's enough to have been done, without the mortification of being {{known to have been}} done. So we agree to keep the fact to ourselves. You agree?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, by the candour {{of early}} friendship, Scremerston {{was called the}} Arcadian, an allusion to a certain {{tenderness}} of heart allied with--h'm--a rather confident and sanguine disposition. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> console you to reflect that perhaps he rather overestimates his success with the admirable young lady of whom we spoke. You are not certain that she has accepted him?' ...|$|R
60|$|Sect. 2. To this purpose, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not be amiss, to {{set down}} what I take to be {{political}} power; {{that the power of}} a MAGISTRATE over a subject may be distinguished from that of a FATHER over his children, a MASTER over his servant, a HUSBAND over his wife, and a LORD over his slave. All which distinct powers happening sometimes together in the same man, if he be considered under these different relations, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> help us to distinguish these powers one from wealth, a father of a family, and a captain of a galley.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> not {{too much}} to say that, of all the {{political}} delusions which are current in this queer world, the very stupidest are those which assume that labour and capital are necessarily antagonistic; that all capital is produced by labour and therefore, by natural right, is the property of [187] the labourer; that the possessor of capital is a robber who preys on the workman and appropriates to himself that which he has had no share in producing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not believe}} it is pride,' said Sophy, meekly; 'at least, I hope not. I feel humiliated enough, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a sort of shame, as well as {{consideration}} for them, that would make me wish that no difference should be made. Do you not think we may let things go on?' she said, in so humble a manner, that it brought Albinia's tears, and a kiss was the only answer. 'Please tell me,' said Sophy; 'for I don't want to deceive myself.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{his role}} as a gay character, Brian Kinney, on Showtime's Queer as Folk, Harold was interviewed by Ilana Rapp for NYCastings about whether the {{same-sex}} scenes are a challenge for an actor. Among other things, he stated: [...] "I'm straight, but the character was too important to me to muddle his world with my private life. As a nobody, I got away with that deflection. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have helped to introduce Brian as a believable gay man. Maybe not. However it played, it's been out of my hands for a long time". The interview was published on April 15, 2013.|$|R
