40|$|In {{root hairs}} of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the {{requirement}} of Ca 2 + for Nod factor signaling has been investigated by means of ion-selective microelectrodes. Measured 50 to 100 μm behind the growing tip, 0. 1 μm NodRm-IV(C 16 : 2,S) increased the cytosolic free [Ca 2 +] by about 0. 2 pCa, while the same concentration of chitotetraose, the nonactive glucosamine backbone, had no effect. We demonstrate that NodRm-IV(C 16 : 2,S) still depolarized the plasma membrane at external Ca 2 + concentrations below cytosolic values if the free EGTA concentration remained low (≤ 0. 01 mm). Externally added Sr 2 + was able to replace Ca 2 +, {{and to some extent}} even enhanced the Nod-factor-induced depolarization, whereas with Mg 2 + it was decreased. This suggests that the Nod factor response is triggered by Ca 2 + from external stores. The addition of the endomembrane Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitor 2, 5 -di(t-butyl) - 1, 4 -benzohydroquinone, which presumably mobilizes Ca 2 + from Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 -sensitive stores, mimicked the Nod factor response, i. e. increased the cytosolic free [Ca 2 +], triggered Cl−-efflux, depolarized the plasma membrane, and alkalized the root <b>hair</b> <b>space.</b> In all cases a refractory state toward Nod factor perception was produced, indicating a shortcut of Nod factor signal transduction by releasing Ca 2 + from internal stores. These latter results strongly support the idea that an elevation of cytosolic free [Ca 2 +] is indispensable for the transduction of the Nod factor signal, which is consistent with the role of Ca 2 + as a second messenger...|$|E

The sequence observed is that expected from the theoretical analysis. The fluorescence chelate used, chlorotetracycline, is believed to be specific for mem-brane-bound calcium.

25|$|The en dash – {{always with}} spaces in running text when, as {{discussed}} in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause – and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support full justification. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the not spaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated {{by the use of}} thin <b>spaces,</b> <b>hair</b> <b>spaces,</b> or even zero-width spaces {{on the sides of the}} em dash. This provides the appearance of a not spaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{suite of}} {{epidermal}} characters in Arabidopsis {{is under the}} transcriptional control of a combinatorial complex containing WD repeat, bHLH and MYB proteins. Many genetic, molecular and biochemical means have been employed to identify and characterize a complete minimal set of complex members required for the trichome initiation, root <b>hair</b> <b>spacing,</b> anthocyanin production and seed coat tannin production pathways. In addition, the WD and bHLH proteins required for outer seed coat differentiation have been identified. However, until now the MYB complex member(s) required for this last WD–bHLH–MYB complex-dependent character have remained elusive. Here we identify two MYBs, AtMYB 5 and TT 2, as partially redundant in regulating this outer seed coat developmental process with MYB 5 having the major role. MYB 5 and TT 2 are shown to be expressed in this outer seed coat domain. We also show that MYB 5 has weak pleiotropic control over trichome development and tannin production and is also expressed in the appropriate places for these functions. TT 8 and the downstream GL 2 and TTG 2 regulators of seed coat development {{are found to be}} downregulated in the MYB mutants. Although the TTG 1 -dependent R 2 R 3 MYBs are considered to be highly pathway specific, identification of MYBs responsible for outer seed coat development allowed for the elucidation of previously undetected novel developmental pleiotropy among these elements...|$|R

In addition to being crucial for epidermal appendage initiation, they control the interfollicular spacing pattern and contribute to the spatial orientation and largely parallel alignment of hair follicles.

Here, we discuss the recently suggested reaction-diffusion (RD) mechanism of spatial hair follicle arrangement in the light of yet unpublished data and conclusions.

While metals do become slightly more resistant at higher temperatures, this class of ceramics (often barium titanate and lead titanate composites) has a highly nonlinear thermal response, so that it becomes extremely resistive above a composition-dependent threshold temperature.

40|$|Previous {{investigation}} on five cultivars of healthy Sicilian grapevine allowed {{the isolation of}} endophytic bacteria belonging to Bacillus genus from different organs (bud, leaf, stalk and shoot). The aim of this work was to use {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) experiments in healthy and damaged leaf tissues of Vitis vinifera to visualize and localize bacteria associated with plant materials. The leaves were cleared to minimize the autofluorescence of the plant fragments. The use of fluorescently labelled bacterial probe Eub 338 in FISH experiments on discoloured grapevine leaf disks allowed the estimation of the spatial distribution of different bacterial colonies.
