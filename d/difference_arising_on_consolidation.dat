40|$|The {{treatment}} of the <b>difference</b> <b>arising</b> <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> has been both a subject of debate (especially in the English-speaking counties) {{and a source of}} international diversity in financial reporting. The implementation of the EU Fourth and Seventh Directives could be expected {{to reduce the amount of}} this diversity so far as member states are concerned. To a large extent, the directives imposed methods which were generally accepted in the English-speaking countries; for example, what is now known as the 'former German method' was excluded. Nevertheless, the Directives left a fair amount of flexibility; alternative practices, some generally accepted in the UK and others in the USA, were permitted. This paper compares the {{treatment of}} the consolidation difference in two EU member states, France and the UK, based on an analysis of five years' financial statements of a random sample of seventy companies, in each country (700 sets of financial statements in all). The research shows that, notwithstanding the harmonizing effects of the Directives, substantial differences exist between the French and British treatments. In general, French recommended treatments are quite close to those required by U. S. GAAP, with a major exception in the treatment of 'quasi-goodwill' items such as brands. By contrast, the UK treatments differ from the U. S. and French treatments in some important respects; they also fail to comply with the revised IAS 22. On the other hand, the UK requirements are clearly documented and mandatory; hence the level of compliance is very high. By contrast the French requirements are variously and not always consistently documented and only partly mandatory; the levels of compliance are consequently lower. There was some evidence that the choice of treatment in the UK, as between immediate elimination against reserves and capitalization and amortiz-ation, was influenced by the company's level of gearing. No such choice exists in France, so no comparable analysis was possible. The research suggests that, in the case of the consolidation difference, the EU Directives left an arguably excessive degree of flexibility of treatment, a problem which it has been left to the revised IAS 22 to address. ...|$|E

For over 100 years {{there has been}} diversity of views as to the nature, recognition and measurement of goodwill. Such diversity of views has contributed to the adoption of a variety of accounting practices for goodwill, which has lead to attempts to regulate practice by accounting professions in the Anglo-American world. The research conducted involves a literature review to identify the concepts and definition of goodwill and the criteria for its recognition and measurement. the investigation will then concentrate upon goodwill <b>arising</b> <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the financial statements of a group of companies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Noun Incorporation (NI) in Hopi {{and presents}} evidence that Hopi has Type IV noun incorporation {{according to the}} typological classification presented in Mithun 1984. The incorporated noun (IN) is visible to discourse reference, NI can strand modifiers, and the IN can have a classificatory function. Hopi thus fulfills the criteria for a syntactic analysis as proposed in Baker 1988, 1995. However, the claim that word formation actually occurs in the syntax has been controversial and is challenged {{by a number of}} lexicalists (e. g. Rosen, Mithun). The arguments crucially weigh on the Lexicalist Hypothesis and the division of labour between the morphology and the syntax. Both the syntactic and the lexical approaches seem to account for the basic facts of NI, but significant <b>differences</b> <b>arise</b> <b>on</b> closer examination. The goal {{of this paper is to}} contribute some previously unknown data to the current discussion of this rather unusual morphological process and to consider possible analyses of the data. Furthermore, a brief overview of the polysynthetic properties of Hopi is presented to see whether these tendencies may account for NI in Hopi.

40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} an acute L-dopa administration on eye-closed resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of cognitively preserved Parkinsonian patients. Methods. We examined 24 right-handed patients diagnosed as uncomplicated probable Parkinson’s disease (PD). Each patient underwent UPDRS-part-III evaluation before and 60 minutes after an oral load of L-dopa-methyl-ester/carbidopa 250 / 25 mg. Resting condition eyes-closed EEG data were recorded both pre- and post L-dopa load. Absolute EEG power values were calculated at each scalp derivation for Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta frequency bands. UPDRS scores (both global and subscale scores) and EEG data (power values of different frequency bands for each scalp derivation) were submitted to a statistical analysis to compare Pre e Post L-Dopa conditions. Finally, a correlation analysis was carried out between EEG spectral content and UPDRS scores. Results. Considering EEG power spectral analysis, no statistically significant <b>differences</b> <b>arose</b> <b>on</b> Delta and Theta bands after L-dopa intake. Conversely, Alpha and Beta rhythms significantly increased on centro-parietal scalp derivations, {{as a function of}} L-dopa administration. Correlation analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between Beta power increase on centro-parietal areas and UPDRS subscores (Rigidity of arms and Bradykinesia). A minor significant negative correlation was also found between Alpha band increase and resting tremor. Conclusions. Assuming that a significant change in EEG power spectrum after L-dopa intake may be related to dopaminergic mechanisms, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dopaminergic defective networks are implicated in cortical oscillatory abnormalities at rest in non-demented PD patients...|$|R

Theories disagree on whether this ability is dependent solely on increased neural activation for relevant items or whether active ignoring can also play a role.

They found increased activation in brain regions associated with spatial memory and in content-specific face-processing areas when participants ignored the irrelevant faces. <b>Differences</b> <b>arose</b> even <b>on</b> trials when only previewed faces appeared, and the magnitude of these differences predicted how well faces were ignored in search.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{political}} nature of research partnerships in vocational and technical education. Such research, by its nature, {{is seen as}} being unavoidably political, {{in the sense that}} its undertaking raises issues to do with the nature and distribution of ownership, interest, influence, benefit and threat in - and flowing from - the research practice. Reflection on a selection of case studies of research in the field point both to the diversity of activities that we contemporarily identify as research and to the diversity of significant issues raised in such research partnerships. Those issues are inerpreted through a framework of nine dimensions: (1) the types of knowledge intended from the research partnership; (2) the purposes of the research partnership; (3) the research approach; (4) the ownership of any epistemic gain from the research; (5) the degree of epistemic gain sought or expected from the research partnership; (6) the substantive focus of the research partnership; (7) the openness of the research; (8) the research beneficiaries; and (9) the ownership and resolution of any threats from the research. While these dimensions are largely epistemological in origin, they acquire political import in particular research partnerships to the extent that issues of <b>difference</b> <b>arise</b> <b>on</b> any of the dimensions. It is suggested that the optimum situation in research partnerships is where a coherent political profile is negotiated on these dimensions before they present any issues seriously threatening to the conduct and success of the research.

40|$|A new {{analytical}} method is {{proposed for the}} study of flow through highly-loaded turbomachine stages. The technique is {{used in the present study}} in order to: (i) analyze the three-dimensional induced effects of the viscous blade wakes in an isolated rotor; and (ii) to study the effects of the passage of distorted flow through an axial compressor rotor or stator. In Part I (GT&PDL Report Number 141), it is found, in contrast with the more familiar situation behind aircraft wings, that the induced effects of the vorticity in the (viscous) wakes are important in practical axial turbomachinery; for example, the flow angles through highly-loaded rotors are modified to a significant extent by such wake effects. The induced disturbances grow in strength within a certain distance downstream of the blade row before beginning to decay inversely with such axial distance. In agreement with earlier predictions, pressure disturbances and vorticity disturbances cannot be decoupled in swirling flow. Similarly, in part II (GT&PDL Report Number 151), it is found that major <b>differences</b> <b>arise</b> <b>on</b> comparing two-dimensional with three-dimensional analyses, both for rectilinear and for annular configurations. Further, only the last of these three-dimensional analyses can adequately describe the true flow phenomena in highly-loaded turbomachines. This is because such a description properly includes both centrifugal effects together with two important distinct types of vorticity: the trailing vorticity and the vorticity associated with any stagnation pressure gradients present. Such an analysis predicts, a strongly persisting downstream pressure field which in many cases increases before again beginning to decay inversely with the axial distance downstream, both for free-vortex stators and rotors. By contrast, three-dimensional wheel flow analysis predicts indefinitely persisting downstream disturbances. Further, a purely two-dimensional theory indicates for a stator, the downstream static pressure to be uniform, while even a three-dimensional rectilinear cascade theory would predict only an exponentially decaying pressure field. The amplitude of the above persistent downstream disturbances decreases for free-vortex downstream flow as the number of significant circumferential harmonics of the inlet distortion increases. These analytical results agree well with available experimental data recently obtained in annular cascades. January, 1980 This is part 1.

30|$|Service {{providers}} can {{use these}} results {{in at least}} three ways. First, providers should measure customer perceptions of the components of service value. By measuring these, providers can understand what their existing customers perceive is the value they are receiving for services delivered. Some dimensions, such as service quality, may diverge from technical service quality. Therefore, where these <b>differences</b> <b>arise,</b> complementary work <b>on</b> service quality can be undertaken. For example, where technical service quality is good but perceptions are poor, work {{needs to be done to}} understand why customers have different perceptions from technical measurement. Second, providers can focus on-going relationships with customers on how to best govern services they provide for customers. This will differ according to customer needs. Nevertheless, recognizing service governance as an integral dimension of service value is important for cloud providers. Third, providers can monitor how their services are perceived in the market place by reputation or brand, perceived prices / costs, and in perceived benefits. Understanding each of these from customer viewpoints helps providers to recognize the position of their services in the market.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impact of {{intellectual}} capital (IC) on firms’ financial performance with reference to a sample of companies operating in the European Union (EU) area during the period from 2006 to 2013. The analyses are further differentiated by country of domicile, industry sector, and historical period (pre-crisis and crisis). We investigate whether the value of the components of IC is a relevant factor that influences firms’ performance, proposing and testing a modified version of the value added intellectual capital (VAIC) model which also considers country-specific differences in terms of default risk. The empirical results evidence the relevance of the information on IC disclosed by companies. <b>Differences</b> <b>arise</b> depending <b>on</b> the reference country, industry, and historical period examined. The main limitations of the research are the unbalanced structure of the sample among countries and industries and the specificity of the examined sample (listed firms applying IAS/IFRS system). The main implication of the study is that, since we demonstrate the value relevance of IC, our findings could be of interest for standard setters for defining a standard (qualitative and quantitative) level of information on human resources to be disclosed by companies in their financial statements. Our contribution to the literature is the proposal of some relevant modifications to the original VAIC model and providing new evidence on the influence that IC had in recent years on business performance in the EU...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this work}} are to better {{understand}} (1) the relation between exposure {{and the risk of}} an accident between pedestrians and motorized vehicles and between bicyclists and motorized vehicles occurring at urban intersections and (2) how the speed environment and the victim´s age relate to the injury severity/outcome once a pedestrian or a bicyclist has been struck by a motorized vehicle. Cross sectional studies are used, and the relations are analyzed using multinomial logit models, negative binomial regression and other statistical methods. The results show that there is a positive correlation between the exposure of pedestrians, bicyclists and motorized vehicles and the number of accidents, i. e. the more road users there are, the more accidents occur. The models also suggest that this relation is non-linear; the accident risk per road user is lower at sites where the exposure is greater (safety in numbers effect). Furthermore, the results show safety in numbers effect for single pedestrian accidents, which might suggest that the underlying reasons for this effect is more complex than previously assumed. The thesis suggest an alternative way to interpret risk values and risk curves for injury severity/outcome (if one is involved in an accident), in which <b>differences</b> <b>arise</b> depending <b>on</b> whether the aim is to interpret the relation from an individual perspective or from the perspective of society as a whole. The results furthermore show a strong correlation between the speed environment, the age of the victim and the injury severity/outcome.
