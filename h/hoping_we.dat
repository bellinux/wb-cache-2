500|$|The crowd, {{initially}} 10,000, {{increased as}} Brazilian locals heard radio {{coverage of the}} match. Attendants were mostly supporting for the underdog Americans, cheering with Borghi's defenses and the missed English offenses. According to Bahr, [...] "The overwhelming majority was Brazilians, but they rooted for us the entire time. We didn't realize why until after. They [...] <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> would beat England and that Brazil {{would not have to}} play England in the final game." [...] Some locals even jumped a short wall to enter the stadium through the playing field.|$|E
500|$|Manning and the Colts {{introduced}} their now-signature no-huddle offense, {{and used}} it to great effect in a Week 1 rout of the Jets, 45–24. Two weeks later (Week 2 games were not played as scheduled due to the 9/11 attacks) the Colts advanced to 2–0 with a win over Buffalo, behind Manning's 421yards passing. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game. However, the Colts lost the following week to New England, and continued their slide, losing their following two games. The Colts briefly rebounded, winning two games, but then lost 7 of their last 9, including a 40–21 home loss to the 49ers. After Manning threw a career-high four interceptions in that game, coach Jim Mora uttered his infamous [...] "Playoffs? Don't talk about playoffs. Are you kidding me. Playoffs? I'm just <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> can win a game, another game" [...] press conference. Despite the 6–10 record, Manning finished the season with , , and 4 rushing touchdowns as the offense produced the second most points in the league. However, the defense allowed the most points and Jim Mora was fired after the season.|$|E
500|$|Tom Dowd {{produced}} At Fillmore East; he {{had previously}} worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. [...] "It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff {{who took care of}} business," [...] recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, [...] "which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics." [...] Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph [...] "Juicy" [...] Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding [...] "unofficial" [...] band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. [...] "I was just <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable," [...] said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am.|$|E

500|$|... "Hush" [...] explores issues {{relating}} to the limits and benefits of language and communication. During the first act of the episode, the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused, used as white noise, and employed {{as a means of}} avoiding truth. Many of the conversations between characters, even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode's plot or to the show's overall history, deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication. Whedon stated that he was unaware of how [...] "inevitably coherent" [...] this theme was until after the script was completed. Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling, primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other, but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally. Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him, and Anya, still new at interacting with humans, uses blunt, often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters. Giles desperately wants the others to stop talking. Willow considers the women in the Wicca group to be nonsensical, later complaining to Buffy [...] "Talk, all talk. Blah blah Gaia. Blah blah moon, menstrual lifeforce power thingy. You know after a couple sessions I was <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> would get into something real, but..." [...] These pseudo conversations are what Buffy essayists Alice Jenkins and Susan Stuart refer to as [...] "locutionary acts": language that is formed to have meaning but does not engage the listener.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Pebble Smartwatch {{was designed}} {{based on a}} concept by Eric Migicovsky describing a watch that could display messages from a smartphone and select Android devices. Migicovsky successfully took his idea through the Y Combinator business incubator program, and unusually for a startup company at Y Combinator, Migicovsky's business actually generated revenue during the program. Migicovsky was able to raise US$375,000 from angel investors such as Tim Draper of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, {{but was unable to}} raise additional funds. Discussing his inability to raise further funds, Migicovsky told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I wasn't extremely surprised... hardware is much harder to raise money for. We were <b>hoping</b> <b>we</b> could convince some people to our vision, but it didn't work out." ...|$|E

60|$|That {{which is}} pre-admitted is faith; for {{when we speak}} {{properly}} of hope, and put others distinctly to the duty of <b>hoping,</b> <b>we</b> conclude that such have faith already; for no faith, no hope. To hope without faith, is to see without eyes, or to expect without a ground: for 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for,' as well {{with respect to the}} grace, as to the doctrine of faith (Heb 11:1). Doth such a one believe? No. Doth he hope? Yes. If the first is true, the second is a lie; he that never believed, did never hope in the Lord. Wherefore, when he saith, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord,' he pre-supposeth faith, and signifieth that he speaketh to believers.|$|E

But she changed its name right away. She is a Baptist. Well, in the course of baptizing it over again it got drowned.

One of the forwards; rather a long man who was good out of touch. He {{developed}} {{it a couple of}} days after the match. It's lucky that all our card games are over. We beat John's, Oxford, last Wednesday, and that finished the card. But it'll rather rot up the House matches. We should have walked the cup, but there's no knowing what will happen now. I hope none of your lot caught the mumps from Browning during the game. It's quite likely, of course. Browning ought not to have been playing, but I had no notion that there was anything wrong with him. He never said he felt bad.' You've got it, Drummond. That's what's the matter with you." ...|$|E
