40|$|THE {{effectiveness}} of cod liver oil and ultraviolet rays as prophylactic agents against rickets in the chicken has been definitely established. That irradiated preparations such as irradiated ergosterol and yeast {{are not so}} effective in the control of rickets in the chick as is cod liver oil when equivalent rat units of vitamin D are fed has also been reported by several investigators. Mussehl and Ackerson (1) in 1930 reported that amounts of <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> and irradiated ergosterol theoretically equivalent to 10 and 50 per cent of cod liver oil, respectively, did not prevent leg weakness. At {{about the same time}} Massengale and Mussmeier (2) found that it was necessary to administer the equivalent of 200 per cent cod liver oil in the form of activated ergosterol to produce the effects of 2 per cent of cod liver oil. Hess and Supplee (3) and Russell and Klein (4) observed that it required more units of vitamin D in the form of irradiated ergosterol than in the form of cod liver oil to produce normal calcification in the chick. Recently Steenbock, Kletzien, and Halpin (5) reported that it required from 40 to 120 per cent cod liver oil equivalence as irradiated ergosterol and from 7. 5 to 60 per cent cod liver oil equivalence as <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> to produce the same degree of bone formation as 1 per cent of cod liver oil of average potency.

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae the transcriptionally active MAT alpha locus is {{repaired}} preferentially to the inactive HML alpha locus after UV irradiation. Here we analysed the repair of both loci after <b>irradiating</b> <b>yeast</b> cells {{at different stages}} of the mitotic cell cycle. In all stages repair of the active MAT alpha locus occurs at a rate of 30 % removal of dimers per hour after a UV dose of 60 J/m 2. The inactive HML alpha is repaired as efficiently as MAT alpha following irradiation in G 2 whereas repair of HML alpha is less efficient in the other stages. Thus differential repair is observed in G 1 and S but not in G 2. Apparently, in G 2 a chromatin structure exists in which repair does not discriminate between transcriptionally active and inactive DNA or, alternatively, an additional repair mechanism might exist which is only operational during G 2...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method has}} been {{developed}} to easily isolate the mutants with high lipid yield after <b>irradiating</b> oleaginous <b>yeast</b> cells with carbon ions of energy of 80 MeV/u. Pre-selection of the mutants after ion irradiation was performed with culture medium in which the concentration of cerulenin, a potent inhibitor of fatty acid synthetase, was at 8. 96 mu mol/l. Afterwards, lipid concentration in the fermentation broth of the pre-selected colonies was estimated by the sulfo-phospho-vanillin reaction instead of the conventional methanol-chloroform extraction. Two mutants with high lipid yield have been successfully selected out by the combined method. This easy and simple method is much less time-consuming but very efficient in the mutant isolation, and it has demonstrated great potential on mutation breeding in oleaginous microorganism...|$|R

40|$|This {{experimental}} study evaluates {{the effects of}} low power microwave radiation on {{the growth rate of}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains type II, exposed to the microwaves (MW) at the frequencies of 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz and the selected powers of - 10 dBm, 0 dBm and 17 dBm using the Transverse Electro-Magnetic (TEM) cell. A comparative analysis of changes, induced by MW exposures at the particular frequencies and powers, on the growth rate of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> cells vs. control group was performed. The findings reveal that the selected MW exposures affected the rate of yeast cells growth. To evaluate the dependence of yeast cell growth rate on MW exposures&# 039; frequency and power, Chi-square Test was performed.

40|$|The {{most stable}} DNA-lesions {{generated}} by irradiation with ultraviolet light (254 nm) {{are two kinds}} of pyrimidine dimers (PDs), cylobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6 - 4) photopro-ducts (6 - 4 PP) (1). Blockage of DNA-polymerase from Thermus aquaticus (Taq polymerase) at PDs has been applied in primer extension assays for photofootprinting (2) and for mapping PDs at nucleotide resolution (3, 4). These assays depend on an efficient and precise blockage at PDs. Using plasmid DNA with a site specific CPD or 6 - 4 PP and <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> DNA, we report here that Taq DNA polymerase is indeed completely blocked at PDs. Furthermore, we show that the signal depends on the local sequence and on whether the DNA was pretreated with T 4 -endonuclease V (T 4 -endoV) or with T 4 -endoV and DNA-photolyase. These results justify the use of primer extension protocols for quantitation of PDs and they point out som...|$|E
40|$|DNA double-strand breaks can be {{repaired}} by illegitimate recombination without extended sequence homology. A distinct mechanism namely microhomology-mediated recombination occurs between a few basepairs of homology that {{is associated with}} deletions. Ionizing radiation and restriction enzymes have been shown to increase the frequency of nonhomologous integration in yeast. However, the mechanism of such enhanced recombination events is not known. Here, we report that both ionizing radiation and restriction enzymes increase the frequency of microhomology-mediated integration. <b>Irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> cells displayed 77 % microhomology-mediated integration, compared to 27 % in unirradiated cells. Radiation-induced integration exhibited lack of deletions at genomic insertion sites, implying that such events are likely to occur at undamaged sites. Restriction enzymes also enhanced integration events at random non-restriction sites via microhomology-mediated recombination. Furthermore, generation of a site-specific I-SceI-mediated double-strand break induces microhomology-mediated integration randomly throughout the genome. Taken together, these results suggest that double-strand breaks induce a genome-wide microhomology-mediated illegitimate recombination pathway that facilitates integration probably in trans at non-targeted sites and might be involved in generation of large deletions and other genomic rearrangements...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{measured}} ultra-violet {{light on}} the yeast S. cerevisiae have been studied. Methods of culturing and <b>irradiating</b> the <b>yeast,</b> of estimating {{the nature and extent}} of the changes produced, and the means used in producing and measuring the radiation are given. No evidence of a stimulative action was observed. The absorbed energy did not produce an all or none effect; arbitrary criteria must be used for judging the various inhibitory and lethal effects. With increase in the incident energy diverse effects were produced until abnormal cell growth and "death" of the cells resulted. Changes in the rate of oxygen consumption did not occur until after a high proportion of the irradiated cells were so damaged that they produced abnormal cells. The shape of the curves relating effect to energy are similar for various wave-lengths but different energies are required to produce the same effect at each of the wave-lengths studied. The similarity of the curves to that for a first order reaction is noted, but attention is called to the modifying influence of accessory factors such as the age of the cells. A comparison is made of the morphological and metabolic changes on the basis of energy requirements, and their relative value as criteria in judging the effects of ultra-violet light on yeast and physiologically similar microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Microarrays {{have become}} {{extremely}} useful for analysing genetic phenomena, but establishing a relation between microarray analysis results (typically {{a list of}} genes) and their biological significance is often difficult. Currently, the standard approach is to map a posteriori the results onto gene networks in order to elucidate the functions perturbed {{at the level of}} pathways. However, integrating a priori knowledge of the gene networks could help in the statistical analysis of gene expression data and in their biological interpretation. Results We propose a method to integrate a priori the knowledge of a gene network in the analysis of gene expression data. The approach is based on the spectral decomposition of gene expression profiles with respect to the eigenfunctions of the graph, resulting in an attenuation of the high-frequency components of the expression profiles with respect to the topology of the graph. We show how to derive unsupervised and supervised classification algorithms of expression profiles, resulting in classifiers with biological relevance. We illustrate the method with the analysis of a set of expression profiles from <b>irradiated</b> and non-irradiated <b>yeast</b> strains. Conclusion Including a priori knowledge of a gene network for the analysis of gene expression data leads to good classification performance and improved interpretability of the results. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{researcher}} {{plans to}} determine if solar radiation affects the growth of yeast. The <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> was obtained from a sample exposed in space during a Space Shuttle flight of September 9 - 20, 1994. Further, the control groups were held at: (1) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland; and (2) South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. The procedure used {{was based on the}} fact that yeast is most often used in consumable baked goods. Therefore, the yeast was incorporated into a basic Betty Crocker bread recipe. Data was collected by placing measured amounts of dough into sample containers with fifteen minute growth in height measurements collected and recorded. This researcher assumed the viability of yeast to be relative to its ability to produce carbon dioxide gas and cause the dough to rise. As all ingredients and surroundings were equal, this researcher assumed the yeast will produce the only significant difference in data collected. This researcher noted the approximate use date on all sample packages to be prior to arrival and experiment date. All dates equal, it was then assumed each would act in a similar manner of response. This assumption will allow for equally correct data collection...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} article (1) evidence was pre-sented of increased susceptibility to chloroform poisoning {{produced in the}} albino rat by injection of crystalline thyroxin. The present study was undertaken to obtain data that might throw light on the mechanism of this phenomenon, and was centered on two points. First: Is the increased susceptibility to chloroform poisoning in the hyper-thyroid rat {{due to the fact}} that the glycogen con-tent of the liver is diminished in the presence of hyperthyroidism? Second: Does a high protein diet afford the same protection against chloroform poisoning to the liver of a hyperthyroid rat that it does to the normal liver? To test the hypothesis that a low glycogen con-tent of the liver is responsible for the increased susceptibility to chloroform poisoning in rats fol-lowing the administration of thyroxin, the problem was approached in two ways. In one set of ex-periments an attempt was made to maintain a nor-mal glycogen content of the liver in animals re-ceiving thyroxin, and their susceptibility to chloro-form poisoning was then tested. In another series the liver glycogen was reduced by means other than administration of thyroxin, and the suscepti-bility to chloroform poisoning of this group was contrasted with that of animals whose liver gly-cogen had been reduced by administration of thyroxin. METHOD AND MATERIALS The experiments were carried out on male albino rats having an initial weight of between 150 grams and 175 grams. The standard diet consisted of Purina Dog Chow (Ralston Purina Company). This was modified in some of the experiments by the addition of carbohydrate in the form of 6 grams of sucrose daily; and in others by the addition of 0. 4 gram of Squibb's yeast or 3. 0 grams of Fleischmann's dried <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast,</b> number IF- 39, daily (presented by the Fleischmann Laboratories).

After of reactivate the pure culture, this it went under laser irradiation getting as a result an inoculum which was subsequently planted and harvested in Airlift (2. 0 L) bioreactors. The first, second and third bioreactor samples were worked with S. cerevisiae non - irradiated in grapeâs juice supplemented with residual of brewery yeast (LRC) to 100 mg/L, 150 mg/L and 250 mg/L respectively and the fourth, fifth and sixth bioreactor samples with S. cerevisiae irradiated. Similar methology was done to the fish left over waste fish water. During 34 hours the bioprocesses were exposed for three times to the pH: 4, 0; 22 + 1 ÂºC; 0, 5 vvm. The production of biomass was evaluated through the counting method in the Neubauer camera for viable yeast, being obtained that a 100 mg/L the biomass was 8. 17 E+ 08 cÃ©l/mL y ï­ de 0. 224 a 200 mg/L being these the highest values. However, S. cerevisiae irradiated and cultivated in waste fish water. However, the S. cerevisiae irradiated with laser (UVA) grown in fish water to 0. 15 mL/L showed a biomass of 7. 98 E+ 08 and ï­ 0. 174 at 0. 10 mL/L; so, this amount was higher than the non -irradiated culture In the same habitat or even to the <b>irradiated</b> <b>yeast</b> and grown in LRC. The results show that the S. cerevisiae MIT-L 51 is able to obtain and use the nutrients derived from LCR with a great efficiency and effectiveness according to the fish water, That which to great scale, it would contribute significantly to diminish the contamination, besides generating extremely useful products that they would bring economic development at level of the north region of our country. But also the laser irradiation (UVA), generates abnormal dimmers in the genetic material. And this would be decreasing in its ï­. Using the statistical analysis, it was found the existence of significant differences, which was confirmed by the comparison of average test. En la presente tesis doctoral, se evaluÃ³ la utilidad de los desechos industriales Sanguaza y Levadura Residual de CevecerÃ­a (LRC) sobre la producciÃ³n de biomasa de Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. ellipsoideus MIT-L 51 irradiada con lÃ¡ser ultravioleta (UVA), a travÃ©s de su Velocidad EspecÃ­fica de Crecimiento (Âµ). Para lo cual, el cultivo puro previamente reactivado, fue sometido a irradiaciÃ³n lÃ¡ser; obteniÃ©ndose un inÃ³culo que posteriormente fue sembrado y cosechado en biorreactores Airlift (2. 0 L). Los biorreactores 1, 2 y 3 se trabajaron con S. cerevisiae no irradiada en mosto de uva suplementado con LRC a 100 mg/L, 150 mg/L y 250 mg/L respectivamente y los biorreactores 4, 5 y 6 con S. cerevisiae irradiada. Similar metodologÃ­a se llevÃ³ a cabo con la Sanguaza. Los bioprocesos se realizaron por triplicado a pH: 4, 0; 22 + 1 ÂºC; 0, 5 vvm, durante 34 horas. Los resultados obtenidos, mediante el mÃ©todo de recuento en cÃ¡mara de Neubauer para levaduras viables, muestran que a 100 mg/L de LRC, la biomasa fue de 8. 17 E+ 08 cÃ©l/mL y ï­ de 0. 224 a 200 mg/L; siendo estos los valores mÃ¡s altos. Sin embargo, S. cerevisiae irradiada y cultivada en Sanguaza a 0. 15 mL/L, alcanzo una biomasa de 7. 98 E+ 08 de y ï­ de 0. 174; valor que fue mayor al del cultivo sin irradiar en el mismo medio e incluso al de la levadura irradiada y cultivada en LRC. Los resultados obtenidos, evidencian que S. cerevisiae MIT-L 51 es capaz de obtener y utilizar los nutrientes contenidos en LRC con una mayor eficiencia y eficacia con respecto a la Sanguaza. Lo cual a gran escala, contribuirÃ­a significativamente a disminuir la contaminaciÃ³n, ademÃ¡s de generar productos sumamente Ãºtiles que traerÃ­an desarrollo econÃ³mico a nivel de la regiÃ³n norte de nuestro paÃ­s. Por otro lado, la irradiaciÃ³n (UVA), genero dÃ­meros anÃ³malos a nivel del material gÃ©nico de la levadura en cuestiÃ³n, lo que estarÃ­a ocasionando una disminuciÃ³n en la producciÃ³n de su biomasa y su Âµ.
