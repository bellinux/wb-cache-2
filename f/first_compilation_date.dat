50|$|According to Wojciech Paszyński {{the black}} legend about Nowe Ateny has survived until these days, {{even in the}} {{academic}} circles. Attempts {{have been made in}} order to overcome, at least partially, some of the prejudices and misconceptions that have been accumulated around Nowe Ateny for the last two centuries. Even though the encyclopedia is not particularly innovative in the context of European learning at that time, one cannot simply regard it as an example of obscurantism. The book represents a typical scientific approach characteristic of the pre-Enlightenment period. Chmielowski himself was far from being a noncritical compiler; he was rather a creative author who pioneered in quite a few forms of contemporary journalism. It certainly cannot be denied that he had a great erudition and a talent for writing. The authors to whom he referred were not, as it was commonly believed, medieval authors, but they belonged to the scientific elite of the 16th and 17th centuries. The reverend has numerous merits such as: providing the <b>first</b> <b>compilation</b> of <b>dates</b> and events in the Polish history as well as presenting valuable information about libraries and academies of that time. One should also notice Chmielowski’s empirical approach in the process of proving numerous theories. The author’s original style of writing also attracts the reader’s attention. Although numerous attempts have been made in order to rehabilitate the encyclopedia, it is still associated with negative judgements, also in the serious literature of the subject. Today the encyclopedia remains in the first place the symbol of ignorance of the Saxon times in Poland (rule of Wettin dynasty).|$|R
40|$|It {{is evident}} from studies of Proverbs that the book {{has a number of}} authors and was {{compiled}} {{over an extended period of}} time. Bible scholars differ in their opinions concerning the authorship and <b>date</b> of <b>compilation</b> of the book. There are a number of critics who believe that references to the names of some authors of Proverbs are symbolic. There are others who believe that the final <b>compilation</b> <b>date</b> of the book was around the 2 nd century B. C. On the other hand, there are those who believe that the names of the authors in question are literal and denote actual persons who really existed. There are also some who refute the 2 nd century <b>date</b> of final <b>compilation</b> and instead advocate a final <b>compilation</b> <b>date</b> of around the 7 th century B. C. Evidence would favour literal names for the authors in question and an earlier final <b>compilation</b> <b>date</b> of around 7 th century B. C as opposed to symbolic names and final <b>compilation</b> <b>date</b> of the 2 nd century. It is the purpose of this paper to present evidence to support literal names and final <b>compilation</b> <b>date</b> in the 7 th century...|$|R
