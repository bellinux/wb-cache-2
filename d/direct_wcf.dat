40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of focused direct written corrective feedback (WCF) {{on the use of}} two functions of articles in the written narratives of 43 lower-intermediate Malaysian ESL learners. Using a simplified adaptation of Sheen’s 2007 study, this study used three intact ESL classes to form three groups: direct-only WCF (DCF, n= 16), direct metalinguistic WCF (DME. n= 12), and the control group (n= 15). The study had a pretest-treatment-posttest-delayed posttest configuration with four CF treatment sessions and a short questionnaire survey with both experimental groups. This study found that receiving focused <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> does help improve students’ written accuracy in the use of two functions of English articles. However, no difference was found between receiving direct-only WCF (DCF) and <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> with metalinguistic comments (DME). In terms of students’ perceptions of its usefulness, both experimental groups indicated that receiving focused <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> made it easier for them to notice their errors and that it made them think about the errors they made. However, the participants who received <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> with metalinguistic comments (DME) significantly preferred receiving their form of WCF and that they also thought it was much easier to notice their errors when corrected that way...|$|E
30|$|Amrhein and Nassaji (2010) {{investigated}} the L 2 teachers’ and learners’ viewpoints about {{the implementation of}} WCF. The data obtained through the questionnaire revealed that the students and teachers were of the same opinions about {{the positive effect of}} focused WCF and <b>direct</b> <b>WCF.</b> The learners expressed that they preferred <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> coupled with a metalinguistic explanation. In this case, the learners shunned the responsibility of peer WCF and indirect WCF that is in marked contrast with the goal of L 2 learning pedagogy which aims at helping learners to reach autonomy. Additionally, the learners preferred WCF on form-focused errors like grammatical and lexical errors.|$|E
40|$|With {{the higher}} demand of {{accuracy}} on students 2 ̆ 7 writing in university level, {{the present study}} examines the effect of direct and indirect written corrective feedback (WCF) on students 2 ̆ 7 L 2 writing accuracy. The {{study was conducted in}} a six-week period with 43 Indonesian university student participants majoring IT. The results of the pre- and post-writing tests showed that 1) the writing accuracy improvement of the students receiving <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> was statistically significant while the writing accuracy improvement of the students given the indirect WCF treatment was not; 2) the accuracy improvement in the untreatable error rate of the <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> group was the most significant compared to all types of error in both WFC student groups. The study concludes that considering the students 2 ̆ 7 current English proficiency level and learning setting with limited English exposure, written corrective feedback, especially the direct one, helps the university students improve their writing accuracy...|$|E
30|$|In a {{more recent}} {{research}} study, Nemati et al. (2017) studied 311 elementary, intermediate, and upper-intermediate and advanced language learners’ perceptions, beliefs, and preferences about teachers’ feedback practice in Iranian classrooms. The results showed some similarities and differences across the three proficiency levels. They all {{were in favor of}} <b>direct</b> unfocused <b>WCF.</b> However, they had different viewpoints on the satisfaction with their teachers’ WCF strategy and practice; need to revise their writing after receiving teacher’s WCF; the targeted structures on which teachers should give WCF; and their feeling after receiving WCF. The findings also indicated some discrepancies between research findings, teacher’s WCF practice, and learners’ preferences.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of {{written corrective feedback}} (WCF) in the improvement of language learners' grammatical accuracy has been a topic of interest in SLA studies {{for the past couple of}} decades. The present study reports the findings of a three-month study investigating the effect of <b>direct</b> unfocused <b>WCF</b> on the grammatical accuracy of elementary students in an EFL context. The researchers selected two intact classes totaling 33 students, and assigned each to a direct feedback group (n = 16) and a control group (n = 17). The students produced eight pieces of writing (a pretest, three writing tasks along with their revisions, and a posttest) from which their grammatical accuracy was obtained. The results indicated that while the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in the revision of the three writing tasks, no significant difference was found when the two groups produced a new piece of writing after a one-month interval. The study concludes that accuracy improvement caused by unfocused WCF during the revision process does not extend to EFL learners' future writing when no feedback is available, at least at the elementary level...|$|R
40|$|Written Corrective Feedback (WCF) is a {{controversial}} topic among theorists and researchers in L 2 studies. Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, and Takashima (2008) identify two dominant dichotomies in this regard, that is focused vs. unfocused <b>WCF</b> and <b>direct</b> vs. indirect <b>WCF.</b> This study considered both dichotomies in a matrix format, {{resulted in the}} recognition of four types of operationally defined WCF, and aimed at: (1) investigating the effects of four types of WCF (i. e., focused direct CF, unfocused direct CF, focused indirect CF, and unfocused indirect CF) on intermediate EFL learners’ writing performance; (2) finding out the most effective type of WCF for intermediate EFL learners’ writing performance; (3) determining learners’ attitudes toward the effectiveness of using WCF and the types which they had received. After conducting Nelson English Language Test (Test 300 D), out of 140 male and female Iranian EFL learners, 120 of them were selected as intermediate learners, aging from 14 - 18. The subjects were then assigned randomly to four homogeneous groups (each group including 30 participants). The pre-test and post-test both included a writing test which assessed learners’ writing performance, and then their scores were analyzed by using analytic marking scale. The results indicated that, learners outperformed {{in all of the}} four groups, validating WCF as an effective technique which can be used in EFL classes. A clear implication of the study is that WCF types (specially unfocused direct CF) should be emphasized as an essential tool for developing writing ability of intermediate EFL learners.

40|$|Error {{correction}} {{is probably}} the most widely used technique for responding to students’ writing. Although many studies have attempted to investigate the efficacy of providing error correction through different types of written corrective feedback (WCF), there has been relatively little research on any one new approach to writing pedagogy in foreign language learning which is called dynamic WCF. The purpose of the current research was to test the effect of WCF on the improvement of writing abilities of EFL learners. Two groups of EFL students who were learning English as a foreign language participated in this study. Both groups (A and B) were given treatments. Core components of the treatment included having the students to write a composition every session (twice a week) and the teacher providing the students with feedbacks (dynamic WCF or <b>direct</b> <b>WCF)</b> on their writing tasks. Group A (n= 24) was instructed through dynamic WCF because it was intended to improve L 2 writing ability in general by raising linguistic awareness of learners through the error corrections performed by the teacher.   On the other hand, group B (n= 22) received <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> on their writings. Four essential characteristics were taken into consideration for the error correction, i. e. feedback needed to be manageable, meaningful, timely and constant. The data obtained for Group A and Group B was analyzed using paired sample test and the results indicated that both groups had improved on their writing abilities. Also, administrating an independent sample T-test the findings revealed that Group A which received dynamic WCF could outperform Group B...|$|E
30|$|The {{second part}} of the {{questionnaire}} was about teachers’ WCF strategies. The first section of this part was devoted to teachers’ WCF strategies and practice in their classrooms. The data analysis revealed {{that a majority of the}} teachers employed unfocused <b>direct</b> <b>WCF.</b> They sometimes gave metalinguistic explanations either in Persian or English. Almost none of them used the Internet nor software about writing and correction or grammar in giving WCF. Approximately, half of the teachers used peer WCF only sometimes by asking the peers about correct usage when giving WCF on their classmate’s writing. More than 70 % of the teachers responded that they did not ask the learners to revise their writing based on the WCF given either by teacher or peer.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{mounting}} {{evidence on the}} effectiveness of WCF does not fully discredit Truscott’s doubts on WCF. To date, many studies trying to validate the effectiveness of WCF have been small and short-term accounts, and they have tended to offer close-up treatments to relatively straightforward grammatical structures such as article and past-tense usage in English (Liu and Brown 2015). There are also considerable discrepancies among WCF studies. For instance, while some studies have reported a major effect of indirect WCF that only identifies grammatical errors (e.g., Chandler 2003; Ferris 2006), others have reported similar or more positive effects offer by <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> in error identification and correction (e.g., Bitchener 2008; Bitchener and Knoch 2008). Similarly, some studies (e.g., Ellis et al. 2008; Sheen 2007; Yang and Lyster 2010) have found that WCF focused on a single linguistic feature is most effective. Conversely, other studies have advocated the use of WCF on a variety of linguistic challenges (e.g., Bitchener et al. 2005; Evans et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{the third}} {{research}} question, as the data indicated, the teachers {{could not give}} comprehensive WCF on the writing samples. Moreover, the data indicated that the teachers mostly gave unfocused <b>direct</b> <b>WCF,</b> they did not use any software or technology in writing instruction, {{and most of them}} did not ask the learners to revise the texts which received WCF. Finally, they mentioned that they read only graded short stories, novels, and teaching methods to develop their English and teaching proficiency. Unfortunately, some of the teachers gave incorrect feedback which may be harmful for learners. Furthermore, most of the teachers’ WCF was on mechanics while the learners need feedback on other aspects of writing too. Each of these issues needs more research because these findings are in contrast with the research findings. More research is needed to investigate why Iranian teachers are not willing to use other types of WCF, why they hardly use technology in their writing teaching, and more importantly, why they do not ask their students to revise their writing after receiving teacher’s WCF. It seems that these issues would be due to lack of teachers’ expertise and gaps in their pedagogical knowledge. However, we need more mixed methods and longitudinal research to support the findings of this study. Furthermore, we need to use other research instruments such as observation and interviews with teachers to triangulate the data.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was three-fold: 1) to examine the general {{efficacy}} of different types of WCF on the errors of the target structure (past simple tense) in the short and long term, 2) to compare the possible difference in the effect that different degrees of explicitness of WCF might have on improving the target structure in the short and long term, and 3) to investigate the effect of the different degrees of explicitness of WCF on explicit and implicit knowledge of the past simple tense in the short and long term. One hundred and five EFL Iranian learners participated in this quasi-experimental study. They were divided into four experimental groups (20 in each) that received different degrees of explicit WCF, that is, metalinguistic, direct, indirect, reformulation and a control group (n= 20) that did not receive any feedback. The effects of the WCF types were measured by Picture Description Test and Error Correction Test as a pre-test, an immediate post-test, and a delayed post-test. It was found that both metalinguistic and <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> could affect the participants’ explicit knowledge of the past simple tense in the short and long term; the indirect WCF on the other hand, could only affect it in the short term and the reformulation was the only kind of WCF that didn’t have any effect on the explicit knowledge of the past simple tense. Moreover, all the experimental groups’ implicit knowledge improved in the short term, but this improvement was sustained in the long term for the metalinguistic and indirect group. So, the results suggest that there was a difference in the effect that different degrees of explicit WCF had on the development of the learners’ explicit and implicit knowledge of the past simple tense. These findings are discussed from the perspective of both...|$|E
40|$|Cohesion in second/foreign {{language}} {{writing has}} been studied from a theoretical standpoint since the late 1970 s; however, {{little research has been}} conducted to investigate how cohesion can be improved. There is research that indicates that teacher feedback contributes to the improvement of cohesion in EFL leaners’ writing (Lee, 2002; Tangkiengsirisin, 2010); however, there is little empirical research examining the effect of teacher feedback on cohesive devices in learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) ’s writing, which calls for further research to delve into this issue. ^ The present study investigated whether or not written corrective feedback (WCF) increases the number of cohesive devices in lower-level JFL learners’ writing. The subjects received one of the following WCF: direct feedback that explicitly corrects errors, indirect feedback that provides the location of errors with underlines and error codes, or no feedback on cohesive devices. They wrote four short expository essays (250 to 300 letters) about a different topic and revised them as their homework. The long-term effect was investigated by comparing a pre-test writing and a post-test writing 2, which was assigned after the treatment. In addition, the pre-test writing and a post-test writing 1, which was assigned a month later, were compared to investigate whether there were short-term effects. Furthermore, {{the extent to which the}} number of each type of cohesive device (reference, substitution, ellipsis, or conjunction) increased was examined. ^ The results indicated that WCF did not have a statistically significant effect on the use of cohesive devices for either the short-term effect or the long-term effect; nevertheless, significant increases for referential and conjunctive cohesive devices within groups were found. In addition, it was found that more than 90 % of the subjects in the <b>direct</b> <b>WCF</b> group and more than 60 % in the coded group succeeded in revising their first drafts based on WCF, indicating that WCF was effective for them into editing their errors on cohesive devices. ...|$|E
