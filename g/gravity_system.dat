50|$|Effluent pumping sewers {{have small}} {{diameter}} pipes that follow the contour {{of the land}} and are only buried a metre or two underground. While an effluent sewer can use gravity to move waste, the ability to move waste with a pressure system can be a big advantage in places where a <b>gravity</b> <b>system</b> is impractical. Compared to conventional sewer systems, effluent sewer systems can be installed at a shallow depth and do not require a minimum wastewater flow or slope to function.|$|E
50|$|Effluent sewer systems, {{also called}} septic tank {{effluent}} drainage (STED) or solids-free sewer (SFS) systems, have septic tanks that collect sewage from residences and businesses, and the effluent {{that comes out}} of the tank is sent to either a centralized sewage treatment plant or a distributed treatment system for further treatment. Most of the solids are removed by the septic tanks, so the treatment plant can be much smaller than a typical plant. In addition, because of the vast reduction in solid waste, a pumping system can be used to move the wastewater rather than a <b>gravity</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{aqueduct}} {{was constructed}} between 1913 and 1916 to carry sewage from Geelong to an ocean outfall at Black Rock. Of reinforced concrete construction, it is {{a structure of}} unusual design, and listed on the Victorian National Estate Register. The designer was an engineer Edward Giles Stone who erected many daring structures in reinforced concrete. It has 14 cantilever spans covering more than 760 m. The viaduct was decommissioned in 1993, with the land and river underneath fenced off from public access due to falling debris, the deterioration due {{to the loss of}} calcium from its concrete.

50|$|Effluent sewer systems, {{as well as}} all sewer systems, can use {{two methods}} to {{transport}} wastewater to a treatment facility. These methods are gravity and pumping, also called pressure <b>systems.</b> <b>Gravity</b> <b>systems</b> use pipes that are laid on a slight downhill slope to transport wastewater. Effluent pumping systems have pipes that are buried at a constant depth, such as a metre and a half, and rely on pumping stations that create pressure to move the waste to a treatment facility. An effluent sewer that uses gravity may be called a septic tank effluent <b>gravity</b> (STEG) <b>system,</b> while a pumping system may be called a septic tank effluent pumping (STEP) system. It is also possible to have a hybrid <b>system</b> that uses <b>gravity</b> and pumping. Gravity and pumping effluent sewer systems both have advantages and disadvantages. The best type of system to use depends on the area it will be serving. Factors such as population size, topography, groundwater level, as well as locations for pumping stations and the treatment plant, must be taken into account. STEG systems {{should not be confused with}} traditional sewer <b>systems</b> that use <b>gravity</b> to transport untreated sewage to a wastewater treatment plant, which are typically referred to as <b>gravity</b> sewer <b>systems.</b>|$|R

50|$|Effluent sewers also {{currently}} serve {{fewer people}} than septic systems, which also use septic tanks, but simply {{dispose of the}} effluent by draining it into a leach field. About one quarter of United States homes dispose of their wastewater with septic tanks. However, effluent sewers are being looked at as a sewage treatment solution in areas where gravity sewer systems are not well-suited or when the high capital cost to build a <b>gravity</b> <b>system</b> is prohibitive. Areas that are less than ideal for gravity systems include areas that are large, but extremely flat and areas that require long-distance pumping, such as where homes are widely spread out or when several small villages or towns connect their sewage systems so that a centralized plant can be built.|$|E
