5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores her questions. The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself,</b> also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

60|$|Q. But may not faith {{come to a}} {{man without}} <b>he</b> <b>see</b> <b>himself</b> to be first in this condition?--A. It is God's {{ordinary}} way to convince men of this their sad condition before he revealeth to them the righteousness of faith, or work faith in them to lay hold of that righteousness (John 16:9-11; Gal 3:23-25).|$|R

25|$|Chigurh kills without {{compassion}} or remorse, {{but always}} with deliberation. He {{is described as}} having his own set of morals, however twisted they may be. While he does not kill at random or without purpose, his reasons are at times abstract. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> as a hand of fate; an instrument who exacts what is supposed to happen upon those he sees accountable. He gives many of his victims he faces a chance to survive by making deals either personally, or by flipping coins in making decisions. In the novel, he is depicted as having {{a great deal of}} endurance, such as being capable of withstanding pain from multiple shotgun blasts or from a fractured arm.|$|E

Colonel Staquait (Jim Cummings) â€“ A vicious, scar-faced Colonel in the French Foreign Legion. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> on {{the right}} side of the law, but his {{draconian}} means do not justify his actions, putting him at odds with Tarzan. He acts as judge and executioner, and has made it his goal to hunt down Hugo and Hooft because they refused his order to burn down a village full of women and children. Tarzan helped fake their demise, but eventually the Colonel learned the truth and imprisoned them. Tarzan ended up imprisoned in Fort Doom as well, then after allowing Hugo and Hoof to escape, he was sentenced to be hanged, but was released after Renard impersonated a French magistrate, which Staquait doesn't notice as the heroes safely returned to Africa by steamship.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{provides}} {{a variety of}} female characters to explore some of the ramifications of the novels being set in a patriarchal society. Martin says that he wrote all characters as human beings with the same basic needs, dreams and influences, and that his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits like the males. Martin claims to identify with all point-of-view characters {{in the writing process}} despite significant differences to him, be it gender or age. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> neither as misogynistic or a promoter of feminism, although he acknowledged that some values inoculated within childhood can never be fully abandoned, even those consciously rejected. He says that he appreciates the discussions whether the series is feminist or anti-feminist, and is very gratified of the many female readers and how much they like {{at least some of the}} female characters. He says that he does not presume to make feminist statements in either way. Martin's books frequently depict and refer to rape and humiliation, most cases of which are perpetrated upon women.|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me. Don't you think we should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E

500|$|Economically, Morales' {{policies}} have sometimes been termed [...] "Evonomics" [...] and {{have focused on}} creating a mixed economy. Morales' presidential discourse has revolved around distinguishing between [...] "the people", of whom <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> as a representative, and the oppressive socio-economic elite and the old political class, whom he believes have mistreated [...] "the people" [...] for centuries. Morales sought to make Bolivia's representative democracy more direct and communitarian, through the introduction of referendums and a citizen-led legislative initiative. George Philip and Francisco Panizza claimed that like his allies Correa and ChÃ¡vez, Morales should be categorized as a populist, because he appealed [...] "directly to the people against their countries' political and economic order, divided the social field into antagonistic camps and promised redistribution and recognition in a newly founded political order." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> as a rebel {{and wants}} desperately to be a man, {{but he is}} {{incapable}} of manly aggression or courage; this, for Mailer, is a cardinal sin: courage and risk-taking are key to psychic growth.
