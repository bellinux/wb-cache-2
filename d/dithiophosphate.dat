40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} on the antioxidant activity of sulphur-containing compounds, with particular reference to nickel dialkyldithiophosphates and their corresponding di sulphides, were studied in polyolefins under melt, thermal and photo-oxidative conditions. These compounds were evaluated both at low (normal) and high (concentrates) concentrations. In general, the <b>dithiophosphates</b> {{were found to}} be very efficient melt stabilisers at normal concentrtion levels, and compare quite favourably with the best commercially available systems. The nickel <b>dithiophosphates</b> were also found to be very efficient thermal stabilisers for polyolefins, but their activity is highly dependent on the alkyl substituent in the molecule. The corresponding disulphides on the other hand showed very little activity under thermal oxidative conditions, and this was attributed to their inefficiency in scavenging alkyl peroxyl radicals since both compounds possess similar peroxidolytic activity. Furthermore, the nickel <b>dithiophosphates</b> {{were found to be}} excellent photo stabilisers for mildly-processed polyolefins while the corresponding disulphides only offer slight protection to the polymer. Oxidative processing of the disulphide, however, results in a dramatic improvement in their photo antioxidant activity. Thionophospho-ric acid, a major oxidation product of <b>dithiophosphates,</b> was also shown to have photo antioxidant activity {{similar to that of the}} disulphides. A combination of a U. V. absorber with the nickel complex and/or the disulphide resulted in a synergistic stabiliser system which was further augmented by oxidative processing. Moreover, the dilute analogues of such multicomponent stabiliser concentrates also showed excellent melt, thermal and photo-stabilising activity. The mechanistic studies carried out on the nickel complex and the corresponding disulphide clearly identified the thionophosphoric acid a a major transformation product although various triesters were formed as reaction intermediates. The mechanisms of the antioxidant action of the <b>dithiophosphates,</b> which is believed to involve a cyclical process similar to that shown for simple alkyl sulphides and nitroxyls, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Metal nanoparticles, {{especially}} gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), {{have been}} extensively studied {{due to their}} interesting optical properties and potential applications in emerging technologies like drug delivery, cancer therapy, catalysis, chemical and bio-sensing and microelectronics devices. Alkyl thiol ligands {{in the form of}} self assembled monolayers are often used to stabilize and functionalize the gold nanoparticles while other types of ligands have been rarely employed and the properties of AuNPs protected by different types of ligands have not been studied comprehensively and comparatively. This dissertation reports the first comparative studies on the thermal and chemical stability of AuNPs protected by alkyl thiolates, alkyl selenolates, dialkyl dithiophosphinates, and dialkyl <b>dithiophosphates</b> (Chapters 2 and 3). AuNPs protected by dialkyl dithiophosphinates and dialkyl <b>dithiophosphates</b> are unprecedented. All AuNPs were prepared from amine protected precursor AuNPs by ligand exchange to ensure similar size, size distribution, and chemical composition. They were extensively characterized by solution 1 H-NMR and UV-VIS spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. For the first time, thermal stability was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that provided more accurate decomposition temperatures and enthalpies, whereas chemical stability was tested as the availability of the gold surface towards etching with cyanide in different solvents. Surprisingly, alkyl selenolate protected AuNPs are thermally less stable than alkyl thiolate protected AuNPs despite their proposed stronger binding to the gold surface and a much more crystalline monolayer, which suggests that different decomposition mechanisms apply to alkyl thiolate and alkyl selenolate protected AuNPs. Dialkyl dithiophosphinates and dialkyl <b>dithiophosphates</b> protected AuNPs are thermally least stable, although dialkyl <b>dithiophosphates</b> bind as bi-dentate ligands and are most stable towards cyanide etching. In contrast, dialkyl dithiophosphinates show mixed mono- and bi-dentate binding that generates loosely packed monolayers of low degree of crystallinity. Another part of this thesis (Chapter 4 and 5) employs AuNPs and silver particles as fillers to improve the electrical and thermal conductivities of polyurethane composites. High anisotropic electrical conductivity of thin composite films are obtained after curing at unprecedentedly low gold contents, which is reasoned with the coagulation of AuNPs to conductive gold networks in domains of high concentration of AuNPs. Silver particles and flakes of sizes between 20 nm and 1. 5 micron were dispersed in polyurethane to investigate the effect of their size, morphology, aggregation, and dispersion on the thermal conductivity of the composites. Unexpectedly, composites filled with micron sized silver particles outperformed those filled with silver nanoparticles in thermal conductivity and stability. Finally, PdNPs were synthesized in the presence of thiolate ligands of different conical bulk (single phase surfactant free approach) to study the influence of the different ligands on their size (Chapter 6). No systematic effect was observed in contrast to a similar study on AuNPs, which is reasoned with a weaker binding of ligands to the Pd surface...|$|R
50|$|In this example, {{hydrazine}} converts oxygen, {{a common}} corrosive agent, to water, {{which is generally}} benign. Related inhibitors of oxygen corrosion are hexamine, phenylenediamine, and dimethylethanolamine, and their derivatives. Antioxidants such as sulfite and ascorbic acid are sometimes used. Some corrosion inhibitors form a passivating coating on the surface by chemisorption. Benzotriazole is one such species used to protect copper. For lubrication, zinc <b>dithiophosphates</b> are common - they deposit sulfide on surfaces.The suitability of any given chemical for a task in hand depends on many factors, including their operating temperature.|$|R

50|$|Catalyst {{poisoning}} {{occurs when}} the catalytic converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces, so that they cannot contact and react with the exhaust. The most notable contaminant is lead, so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can run only on unleaded fuel. Other common catalyst poisons include sulfur, manganese (originating primarily from the gasoline additive MMT) and silicon, which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak that allows coolant into the combustion chamber. Phosphorus is another catalyst contaminant. Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline, it (and zinc, another low-level catalyst contaminant) was until recently widely used in engine oil antiwear additives such as zinc <b>dithiophosphate</b> (ZDDP). Beginning in 2004, a limit of phosphorus concentration in engine oils was adopted in the API SM and ILSAC GF-4 specifications.|$|E
50|$|Hydrolysis {{explains}} why basic salts such as basic zinc acetate and basic zinc carbonate, Zn3(OH)4(CO3)•H2O {{are easy to}} obtain. The reason for the hydrolysis is the high electrical charge density on the zinc ion, which pulls electrons away from an OH bond of a coordinated water molecule and releases a hydrogen ion. The polarizing effect of Zn2+ {{is part of the}} reason why zinc is found in enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase.No fluoro complexes are known, but complexes with the other halides and with pseodohalides, ZnX3− and ZnX42− can be prepared. The case of the thiocyanate complex illustrates the class A character of the zinc ion as it is the N-bonded isomer, Zn(NCS)42−in contrast to Cd(SCN)42− which is S-bonded. Being a class-A acceptor does not preclude the formation of complexes with sulfur donors, as is shown by zinc <b>dithiophosphate</b> and the zinc finger complex (below).|$|E

5000|$|All {{the current}} {{gasoline}} categories (including the obsolete SH) have placed {{limitations on the}} phosphorus content for certain SAE viscosity grades (the xW-20, xW-30) due to the chemical poisoning that phosphorus has on catalytic converters. Phosphorus is a key anti-wear component in motor oil and is usually found in motor oil {{in the form of}} zinc <b>dithiophosphate</b> (ZDDP). Each new API category has placed successively lower phosphorus and zinc limits, and thus has created a controversial issue of obsolescent oils needed for older engines, especially engines with sliding (flat/cleave) tappets. API and ILSAC, which represents most of the world's major automobile/engine manufacturers, state API SM/ILSAC GF-4 is fully backwards compatible, and it is noted that one of the engine tests required for API SM, the Sequence IVA, is a sliding tappet design to test specifically for cam wear protection. Not everyone is in agreement with backwards compatibility, and in addition, there are special situations, such as [...] "performance" [...] engines or fully race built engines, where the engine protection requirements are above and beyond API/ILSAC requirements. Because of this, there are specialty oils out in the market place with higher than API allowed phosphorus levels. Most engines built before 1985 have the flat/cleave bearing style systems of construction, which is sensitive to reducing zinc and phosphorus. For example, in API SG rated oils, this was at the 1200-1300 ppm level for zinc and phosphorus, where the current SM is under 600 ppm. This reduction in anti-wear chemicals in oil has caused premature failures of camshafts and other high pressure bearings in many older automobiles and has been blamed for premature failure of the oil pump drive/cam position sensor gear that is meshed with camshaft gear in some modern engines.|$|E

The use of oil-soluble molybdenum dithiocarbamates as lubricant additives for reducing friction and wear, increasing load-carrying capacity, and promoting fuel economy and as antioxidants has been related to their structures and chemical properties [6]. Synergistic effect on frictional characteristics due to a combination of molybdenum dithiocarbamates and zinc dialkyl <b>dithiophosphates</b> has been studied in detail by many workers [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Junbin has investigated the antiwear synergism of borates and cadmium diamyl dithiocarbamate [16]. Boron-based dithiocarbamates have been recently found as good antiwear, friction modifier, thermally stable, miscible in oils, and environment-friendly additives compared to commercial additives, such as zinc dialkyl <b>dithiophosphates</b> [8]. A few reports are also available on tribological properties of lanthanide dialkyl dithiocarbamates [17] and their phenanthroline adducts [5, 18, 19].
