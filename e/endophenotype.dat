The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether there are common genetic and environmental factors influencing this cluster in a general population of twin pairs. Materials and methods A multivariate genetic analysis was performed on nine <b>endophenotypes</b> associated with the metabolic syndrome from 625 adult twin pairs of the GEMINAKAR study of the Danish Twin Registry. Results All <b>endophenotypes</b> showed moderate to high heritability (0. 31 – 0. 69) and small common environmental variance (0. 05 – 0. 21). In general, genetic and phenotypic correlations between the <b>endophenotypes</b> were strong only within sets of physiologically similar <b>endophenotypes,</b> but weak to moderate for other pairs of <b>endophenotypes.</b> However, moderate correlations between insulin resistance indices and either obesity-related <b>endophenotypes</b> or triacylglycerol levels indicated that some common genetic backgrounds are shared between those components.

40|$|Mathematics {{learning}} {{difficulties are}} a highly comorbid and heterogeneous set of disorders linked to several dissociable mechanisms and <b>endophenotypes.</b> Two of these <b>endophenotypes</b> consist of primary deficits in number sense and verbal numerical representations. However, currently acknowledged <b>endophenotypes</b> are underspecified regarding {{the role of}} automatic vs. controlled information processing, and their description should be complemented. Two children with specific deficits in number sense and verbal numerical representations and normal or above-normal intelligence and preserved visuospatial cognition illustrate this point. Child H. V. exhibited deficits in number sense and fact retrieval. Child G. A. presented severe deficits in orally presented problems and transcoding tasks. A partial confirmation of the two <b>endophenotypes</b> {{that relate to the}} number sense and verbal processing was obtained, but a much more clear differentiation between the deficits presented by H. V. and G. A. can be reached by looking at differential impairments in modes of processing. H. V. is notably competent in the use of controlled processing but has problems with more automatic processes, such as nonsymbolic magnitude processing, speeded counting and fact retrieval. In contrast, G. A. can retrieve facts and process nonsymbolic magnitudes but exhibits severe impairment in recruiting executive functions and the concentration that is necessary to accomplish transcoding tasks and word problem solving. These results indicate that typical <b>endophenotypes</b> might be insufficient to describe accurately the deficits that are observed in children with mathematics learning abilities. However, by incorporating domain-specificity and modes of processing into the assessment of the <b>endophenotypes,</b> individual deficit profiles can be much more accurately described. This process calls for further specification of the <b>endophenotypes</b> in mathematics learning difficulties...|$|R

40|$|Autism and {{schizophrenia}} are neurodevelopmental disorders {{which both}} have highly disabling negative and cognitive symptoms with few effective treatments. A challenge to developing effective therapeutics is {{a dearth of}} pre-clinical models. Part of the difficulty in developing predictive models is that the symptoms being treated are complex, and difficult to reduce to a simple behavioral task. Therefore, the use of <b>endophenotypes</b> from methods such as EEG presents a new promising avenue for a model of complex human behaviors pre-clinically. New evidence suggests that autism and schizophrenia have reliable electrophysiological <b>endophenotypes,</b> {{some of which have}} been correlated to negative and cognitive symptoms. These <b>endophenotypes</b> therefore represent a possible new pathway for understanding the disrupted circuits in both diseases and developing treatments. Evidence has been accumulating for glutamate disruption in both schizophrenia and autism; accordingly, pre-clinical models are being developed around NMDA receptor (NMDAR) disruption to examine both diseases. NMDA disruption models have been used for many behavioral tasks, but only a few possible electrophysiological <b>endophenotypes</b> such as ERP amplitudes have been investigated. Investigating pre-clinical models of established clinical <b>endophenotypes</b> could lead to better translational biomarkers of diseas...|$|R

The Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene has been consistently associated with risk for, and cause of, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and other mental illnesses. More recently, DISC1 has been associated with social anhedonia within the general population. Tomppo (2009) identified a specific DISC1 allele that is associated with an increase in characteristics of social anhedonia. They also identified a DISC1 allele associated with decreased characteristics of social anhedonia, that was found to be preferentially expressed in women. More research needs to be conducted, but social anhedonia may be an important intermediate phenotype (<b>endophenotype)</b> between genes associated with risk for schizophrenia and phenotype of the disorder.
