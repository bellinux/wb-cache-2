5|$|Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, {{and were}} <b>described</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, have been {{attributed}} to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption. The difficulty with this interpretation is that in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c. 1539–1514 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642–1540 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} {{from a few}} dozen {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils are referred to Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each <b>described</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of a single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars {{on each side of}} the lower and upper jaws.|$|E

5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe <b>described</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was <b>described</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{basis of}} a fragmentary right {{mandible}} (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is {{in the collection of}} the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were <b>described</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga {{as a kind of}} wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
