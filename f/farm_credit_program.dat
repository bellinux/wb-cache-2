40|$|This study investigates {{a number}} of factors {{influencing}} technical efficiency of Greek farms participating in the 1994 European Union (EU) <b>farm</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program.</b> Technical efficiency measures are obtained within the framework of a parametric stochastic frontier. Factors showing a positive effect on technical efficiency are value of liabilities, number of hours of mechanical operation, large land size, and rental land, whereas those showing a negative effect are value of EU product subsidies, value of off-farm family income, and hired labor. The value of investments incurred by farms because of their participation in the 1994 <b>farm</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> does not show any significant effect on technical efficiency. The predicted levels of technical efficiency indicate that the average technical efficiency of farms 3 years after participating in the 1994 <b>farm</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program</b> is lower than the average technical efficiency of the same farms the year before participating in the program. Thus, the program has failed to increase the efficiency of farms. <b>farm</b> <b>credit</b> <b>program,</b> stochastic frontier, technical efficiency, Q 10, Q 12, Q 16, Q 19,...|$|E

40|$|Farmers’ {{decision}} and perceptions to {{be a member}} of agricultural cooperatives in the South Eastern Anatolian Region were investigated. Factors affecting the probability of joining the agricultural cooperatives were determined using binary logit model. The model released that most of variables such as education, high communication, log of gross income, farm size, medium and high technology variables play important roles in determining the probability of entrance. Small farmers are likely expected to join the agricultural cooperatives than the wealthier farmers are. Small farmers may wish to benefit cash at hand, input subsidies, and services provided by the agricultural cooperatives since the risks associated with intensive high-returning crops are high. Some important factors playing pole role in abstention of farmers towards agricultural cooperatives are gross income and some social status variables. In addition, conservative or orthodox farmers are less likely to join agricultural cooperatives than moderate farmers are. We also found that the direct government <b>farm</b> <b>credit</b> <b>programs</b> mainly should be objected to providing farmers to better access to capital markets and creating the opportunity to use with allocation of capital inputs via using modern technology...|$|R

40|$|Interest rate volatility, funding costs, {{and balance}} sheet {{management}} {{have long been}} important concerns for financial intermediaries. Asset/liability management concentrates on addressing and controlling these issues. One {{of the most important}} areas for control is that of the net interest margin or spread. Control of the net interest margin is key to profit maximization for any financial institution. Currently, <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> Services of Northeast Kansas, PCA maximizes profit by obtaining funds through the <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> System, pricing those funds at higher rates to borrowers, and controlling other costs. Funds within the <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> System are generated by the sale of Federal <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> bonds which are priced on the national market. District associations receive these funds and then price them to local associations like <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> Services of Northeast Kansas. Because Federal <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> bonds are priced nationally, they account for risk in the entire agricultural sector. Bond prices are not adjusted for risk by <b>Farm</b> <b>Credit</b> district or geographical location which may elevate prices for areas of lower relative risk.
