40|$|The <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> {{system is}} an {{important}} part of a high-speed railway track. It is always critical to the operational safety and comfort of railway vehicles. Therefore, the condition detection of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> system, looseness or absence, {{is an important}} task in railway maintenance. However, the vision-based method cannot identify the severity of rail fastener looseness. In this paper, the condition of <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> system is monitored based on an automatic and remote-sensing measurement system. Meanwhile, wavelet packet analysis is used to analyze the acceleration signals, based on which two damage indices are developed to locate the damage position and evaluate the severity of rail fasteners looseness, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment is performed on a high-speed railway experimental platform. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective to assess the condition of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> system. The monitoring system significantly reduces the inspection time and increases the efficiency of maintenance management...|$|R

Another one is the Vossloh Tension Clamp.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To date, {{there is}} a {{tendency}} for the implementation of high-speed trains on the territory of the Ukrainian Railways, which requires increasing the strength and stability of the construction of the railway track. At the same time requirements for intermediate <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> have increased and widened. It is on trackwork and repair of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> labor costs during the operation are from 10 to 18 %. One of the main types of fastening, which after long operational observations was included in the permanent operation (5 th. km.) is an intermediate fastening, type КПП- 5. Data from previous theoretical studies reliably prevented clear science-based answers and results of the <b>rail</b> <b>fastening.</b> Therefore, the aim is to develop a methodology and rationale for the theoretical research work of <b>rail</b> <b>fastening,</b> type КПП- 5 with a detailed assessment of the appearance of stress state places in its elements from the effects of rolling stock. Methodology. The basis of study methods of theoretical research work of the intermediate <b>rail</b> <b>fastening,</b> type КПП- 5 (with a detailed assessment of the state of stress in its intermediate elements from the effects of the rolling stock) is the theory of finite elements method (FEM). Findings. Using the FEM it was found that one of the main elements of the intermediate <b>rail</b> <b>fastening,</b> which first perceives share {{of the value of the}} lateral force transmitted from the effects of rolling stock are elastic type terminals, type КП- 5. Analyzing the data set, the bars in the terminal voltages at the inner side of the rail thread 53, 1 - 56 % are greater than the stresses on the outside of rail thread. Originality. A mathematical model of railway track with intermediate <b>rail</b> <b>fastening,</b> type КПП- 5 under the action of rolling stock for the study of the stress state in the elements of fastening was developed. This mathematical model let take into account the physical and mechanical properties of the test elements and geometrical fixing fastenings as constructive and operational characteristics of the entire <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> in general. Practical value. The obtained results in this work of FE simulations allow reflecting and exploring the most likely places of the stress state appearance in the elements of the fastening, type КПП- 5, in which damages and defects can be in the future. This in general will affect the operation stability of the railway track as a whole...|$|R

50|$|At 7 am, three {{carriages}} {{arrived at}} Alajuela and left 30 minutes later. Further stops {{were made and}} three more carriages were added at Heredia. Despite this many people were unable to board the train, and it even missed out a later stop as it was too crowded to allow any more on. At 8:20 the train began to cross the bridge which lay on a left-hand curve. A combination of a poorly <b>fastened</b> <b>rail</b> and the excessive weight of the train caused the last carriage to derail and pulled two further carriages from the track, one of which plunged 190 feet to the river below, killing 248, including Professor Alizago. The rescue work continued into the evening, several trains returning to Alajuela and Heredia with the bodies, which were left at the stations for identification by friends and families. The government declared three days of national mourning; flags flew at half mast; cinemas, bars and other places of entertainment were closed.|$|R

40|$|Tram {{system is}} a {{backbone}} of public transportation in the City of Zagreb. In the last decade, its fleet has been renewed by 142 new low-floor trams. Shortly after their introduction, {{it was observed that}} they {{have a negative impact on}} the exploitation behavior of tram infrastructure, primarily on the durability of <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> systems. Because of that, it was decided to modify existing <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> systems to the new track exploitation conditions. When the (re) construction of tram infrastructure is carried out by applying new systems and technologies, it is necessary to take into account their impact on the future propagation of noise and vibration in the environment. This paper gives a short overview of the characteristics of the two newly developed <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> systems for Zagreb tram tracks, their application in construction of experimental track section, and performance and comparison of noise and vibration measurements results. Measured data on track vibrations and noise occurring during passage of the tram vehicles is analyzed in terms of track decay rates and equivalent noise levels of passing referent vehicle. Vibroacoustic performance of new fastening systems is evaluated and compared to referent fastening system, in order to investigate their ability to absorb vibration energy induced by tram operation and to reduce noise emission...|$|R
