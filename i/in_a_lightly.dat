5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Glenda (JTWC designation: 20S, {{also known}} as simply Cyclone Glenda) of March 2006 was among the strongest {{tropical}} cyclones to threaten Western Australia, though it weakened considerably before landfall and moved ashore <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated region. It began as a tropical low on 15 March in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The precursor disturbance drifted over Top End and later across the northeastern portion of Western Australia, and after emerging into the Indian Ocean it strengthened into a tropical storm. Aided by favourable environmental conditions, Glenda rapidly intensified to reach Category5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and with a peak intensity of 910mbar it was among the strongest cyclones on record within the Australia region. On 30 March it moved ashore near Onslow as a Category3 cyclone, {{and the next day}} it degenerated into a remnant tropical low over land.|$|E
5|$|The twin pylons rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{is frequently}} {{described as having}} released more radioactivity than the Three Mile Island accident that occurred four months earlier and was the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history. The spill contaminated groundwater and rendered the Puerco unusable by local residents. The governor of New Mexico refused the Navajo Nation's request that the site be declared a federal disaster area, limiting aid to affected residents. The event received less media coverage than that of Three Mile Island, likely because it occurred <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated, rural area. Some scholars suggest there were elements of class and racism to the neglect as well, since it affected primarily poor Native Americans.|$|E

25|$|NY425 heads {{away from}} Lower Mountain Road, {{following}} a due north track that the route retains until its north end. The road crosses both NY104 (Ridge Road) and NY93 in close succession <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> developed residential {{area near the}} western end of their concurrency. The rural surroundings return north of NY93 and follow NY425 into the town of Wilson, the last on NY425's routing. A few miles beyond NY93, it finally reaches the village of Wilson, located on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. NY425 becomes Lake Street and serves as the main north–south route through the densely populated community. It continues north to the Lake Ontario shoreline, where it ends at a junction with NY18 (Ontario Street).|$|E
25|$|The {{residential}} {{section of}} Schenectady {{is served by}} a single exit for Michigan Avenue, a local street that connects to NY146 at a junction two blocks north of I-890. From here, the freeway passes under NY146 before curving {{to the south and}} exiting the city limits. Now back in the town of Rotterdam, I-890 runs parallel to NY146 to an interchange with NY7. The state route joins I-890, following the highway as it narrows to four lanes and crosses back over the Hudson Subdivision rail line. I-890 and NY7 connect to High Bridge Road (County Route48) at exit8, the last junction in a residential area and the last in Schenectady County. Exit9, located just south of the Albany County line <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> developed commercial area, serves as the end of NY7's its wrong-way concurrency with I-890; the southbound exit also links to NY146 by way of a long ramp connecting to the state route. I-890 ends a short distance south of the exit at the toll booths for exit25 of the New York State Thruway.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{intersecting}} Nellis Road, NY342 {{turns to}} follow a linear, southeasterly routing into the town of Le Ray. The rural surroundings remain until the hamlet of Calcium, where NY342 meets US11 north of the community's center <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> populated residential area just southwest of the Fort Drum Military Reservation. The route continues on, running along the southwestern edge of Fort Drum to a junction with NY283. At this point, NY342 curves to the south, bypassing the village of Black River to the west as it heads through another undeveloped area consisting of little more than open fields. The route ends roughly [...] {{to the south of}} NY283 at an intersection with NY3 southwest of the village.|$|E

60|$|The wooden {{buildings}} rose very slowly, {{though he}} several times urged the jaded horses. They {{had made a}} long haul that day, and the man, who had trudged at their head since early morning, was almost as weary. On the odd days that they had spent in the stable he had toiled arduously on his house and half-finished barn, beginning with the dawn and ceasing at dark. Now he was grimed with dust and dripping with perspiration, and a tantalizing cloud of flies hovered over him. All this was a decided change from driving a few hours daily <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> loaded wagon, but what at first had appeared an almost unexplainable liking for the constant effort had grown upon him.

6000|$|Mrs. Amy Somers, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> {{floating}} tea-gown of singularly becoming {{texture and}} color, employs the last moments of expectance {{before the arrival}} of her guests in marching up and {{down in front of the}} mirror which fills the space between the long windows of her drawing-room, looking over either shoulder for different effects of the drifting and eddying train, and advancing upon her image with certain little bobs and bows, and retreating from it with a variety of fan practice and elaborated courtesies, finally degenerating into burlesque, and a series of grimaces and [...] "mouths" [...] made at the responsive reflex. In the fascination of this amusement she is first ignorant, and then aware, of the presence of Mr. Willis Campbell, who on the landing space between the drawing-room and the library stands, hat in hand, in the pleased contemplation of Mrs. Somers's manoeuvres and contortions as the mirror reports them to him. Mrs. Somers does not permit herself the slightest start on seeing him in the glass, but turns deliberately away, having taken time to prepare the air of gratification and surprise with which she greets him at half the length of the drawing-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "From the tramp standpoint, the constabulary of the {{township}} was particularly rotten, and I proceeded {{to open the}} eyes of the good people. It is a proposition, mathematically demonstrable, that it costs the community more to arrest, convict, and confine its tramps in jail, than to send them as guests, for like periods of time, to the best hotel. And this I developed, giving the facts and figures, the constable fees and the mileage, and the court and jail expenses. Oh, it was convincing, and it was true; and I did it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> humorous fashion which fetched the laugh and left the sting. The main objection to the system, I contended, was the defraudment and robbery of the tramp. The good money which the community paid out for him should enable him to riot in luxury instead of rotting in dungeons. I even drew the figures so fine as to permit him not only to live in the best hotel but to smoke two twenty-five-cent cigars and indulge in a ten-cent shine each day, and still not cost the taxpayers so much as they were accustomed to pay for his conviction and jail entertainment. And, as subsequent events proved, it made the taxpayers wince.|$|E

Materials and methods: Healthy, full-term infants and toddlers aged 1 – 36 months were enrolled. <b>In</b> study 1, <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> fragranced natural baby hair and body wash (n= 30), <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> fragranced natural baby shampoo (n= 30), or <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> fragranced natural baby lotion (n= 32) were assessed over 2 weeks. <b>In</b> study 2, <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> fragranced natural baby hair and body wash and <b>a</b> <b>lightly</b> fragranced natural baby lotion (n= 33) were assessed as a regimen over 4 weeks. The wash and shampoo were used three or more times per week, {{but not more than}} once daily. Lotions were applied in the morning or after a bath. Clinicians assessed the arms, legs, torso, or scalp for erythema, dryness, peeling/flakiness (study 1 only), tactile roughness, edema (study 1 only), rash/irritation (study 2 only), and overall skin condition (study 2 only) at baseline, week 1, and weeks 2 or 4. Parents completed skin assessment questionnaires. In study 2, stratum corneum hydration was measured. Subjects were monitored for adverse events. Results: No significant changes in clinical grading scores were observed, indicating that all products were well tolerated. By the end of each study, > 90 % of parents/caregivers believed each product was mild and gentle. In study 2, improvement in stratum corneum hydration was observed (+ 37 % at week 1 and + 48 % at week 4, P< 0. 05 for both). In study 1, one baby experienced mild erythema on the neck and scalp after using the shampoo (possibly related to treatment). In study 2, there were no product-related adverse events. Conclusion: The natural baby skin-care products were well tolerated by infants and toddlers when used alone or as part of a skin-care regimen.
