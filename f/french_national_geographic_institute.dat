This database consists in three information layers: Digital Elevation Model at 1 arc-second resolution, High Resolution Orthoimage (1 / 6 of arc-second) and Quality Masks. Wide coverage (Dec. 05 : 11 millions km; annual raise of 7 M km) and tough requirements (circular horizontal accuracy better than 16 m for 90 % {{of the points}} and vertical accuracy better than 10 m for 90 % of the points) are Reference 3 D key advantages. An innovative tool was designed and implemented to produce orthorectified images thanks to Reference 3 D data.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the generation of}} a ground-level digital elevation model (DEM) by merging airborne elevation data and a top-of-canopy DEM. The study area {{is located in a}} dense equatorial forest setting in French Guiana, for which it is assumed that no topographic map is available. The data used consist of airborne laser data distributed along flight lines spaced at 500 m (with a data interval every 7 m) and a top-of-canopy DEM obtained by merging a stereoradargrammetric DEM with airborne laser data. Generation of the ground-level DEM involves the following steps: (i) selecting ground points from the airborne data and deducing a pseudo canopy height for these points, (ii) characterizing the canopy height from a statistical and geostatistical standpoint, (iii) kriging the canopy height and subtracting the resulting model from the top-of-canopy DEM to obtain a DEM corresponding to a ground-level DEM, and (iv) validation. Validation consists of comparing the results with topographic maps and a local heliborne DEM and studying the relationship between the configuration of the airborne trials, in terms of flight-line spacing, and accuracy of the resulting kriged DEM. The results show that the accuracy of the kriged ground-level DEM is significantly better than that of the initial radargrammetric DEM. The standard deviation of elevation errors is reduced from 21. 2 to 11. 9 m or from 25. 3 to 11. 1 m, depending on the validation source adopted (<b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> <b>Institute</b> spot heights and local heliborne DEM, respectively).

40|$|International audienceShallow {{landslides}} {{are among}} the most frequent natural hazards in the Pays d'Auge plateau (Normandy, France) but no study has yet focused on the functioning of these phenomena at a detailed scale. This study aims to identify the structure and mechanical properties of a representative case study in the region. The main objective is to understand landslide dynamics and behaviour in order to assess triggering conditions and quantify triggering thresholds. The results will help complement the regional landslide hazard mapping based on landslide statistical susceptibility mapping and quantification of triggering thresholds. The landslide morphology and internal structure were identified using a multi-method approach. A morphodynamic map was produced in the field using car-tographic GPS to depict the surface morphology and map the estimated landslide activity. These field measurements were completed by an analysis of all available aerial-photo images from the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> <b>Institute</b> (IGN) to identify the occurrence dates and possible landslide reactivations. The landslide structure was defined using multiple electrical tomography profiles, boreholes, augerings and penetration tests. Despite the overall low electrical resistivity of the landslide materials (i. e. ± b 80 Ω·m), the electrical profiles showed good agreement with the interpreted structure based on direct observations (augerings and penetration tests). The landslide slip surface, internal morphology and palaeotopography were identified. A finite slope model was used to calculate the landslide safety factor based on the internal structure and geotechnical data. The evolution of this safety factor according to the rainfall and the groundwater levels shows that the landslides are more likely to occur after long episodes of high cumulative precipitations with an important role being played by the preliminary conditions {{and the rise of the}} surficial groundwater table level...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} proposes {{an original}} and generic method {{to estimate the}} urban heat island (UHI) intensity both spatially and temporally. This method is based on two processing chains composed of :• three data types :– air temperature data measure by some networks located in several French cities,– meteorological data (such as wind speed, solar radiation, etc.) provided by the French institute of meteorology,– geographical data (such as building shape, position and height or satellite images) provided by the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> <b>Institute</b> (IGN),• two free open source softwares (OFSS) :– OrbisGIS, a GIS platform used for geographical calculation and mapping,– Python, a programming language used for meteorological data manipulation and calculationA first processing chain is used to calibrate empirical models to estimate temporal and spatial variations of the UHI intensity. Temporal models are used to estimate the UHI intensity difference between two days. Air temperature measurement and meteorological data are combined using Python scripts to create multiple linear regressions explaining the temporal variations of the UHI. Spatial models are used to estimate the UHI intensity difference between two locations of the city. First, geographical indicators are calculated according to OrbisGIS scripts (SQL language) to characterize the morphological and the land type context {{of each of the}} air temperature network stations. Then air temperature measurement and geographicalindicators are combined using Python scripts to create multiple linear regressions explaining the spatial variations of the UHI. The second processing chain is used to verify the model performances. A new air temperature measurement network is used to compare estimated values to observed values. Temporal UHI variations are estimated using Python scripts, temporal model equations and meteorological data. Spatial UHI variations are estimated using Python scripts, spatial model equations and geographical indicators calculated according to OrbisGIS scripts from geographical data. The same processing chain may then be applied to any French city to estimate the urban heat island intensity for any location and any day. The scripts are run with free softwares and data available and homogeneous for any French city. It makes the method applicable by any research team (open science). This work allows several potential future developments regarding the data and the methods used. Internationally homogeneous open data may be used instead of the French one in order to apply the method to any city in the world. A user-friendly tool may be realized to connect all types of data and softwares in order to be easily applied by the operational world...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{technique}} of photogrammetric survey {{has seen in}} recent years some significant progress. It is now possible to calculate three-dimensional models almost fully automatically from digital images. Preventive archaeology often requires exhaustive recording of huge datasets in a limited period. Digital photogrammetry enables to record complex elements in a simple and costless way. The originality of the implemented solution resides {{in the use of}} a free and open-source software and in the use of a low-cost hardware for photographic acquisition. The <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> <b>Institute</b> (IGN) has developed a software package dedicated to photogrammetry. This software is free and under open-source license. It is dedicated to scientific use and can generate three-dimensional models similar to those obtained by commercial softwares. The software package is well documented and has an active community of developers and users. Preventives excavations are documented with conventional techniques by topographic surveys, manual drawings and photographs. But when the amount and complexity of the structures make it difficult for a classic recording, then a photogrammetric survey is performed. The objective is to record and document the excavation as quickly as possible. An aerial photogrammetric survey is able to complete or replace a topographic survey and classical drawing operations (stone by stone). Unfortunately, using an UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) is often unthinkable for security issues, administrative permissions and cost. This is why a pole is used to perform detailed vertical recordings of excavation sites. The pole is initially designed to sound recording. It is equipped with a two axes head permitting to correctly adjust the vertical position of the camera. It has the advantage of being handy and light, allowing the activation of a remote triggering system while holding the pole in position. Point clouds can then be exploited by archaeologists with CloudCompare. It is a free and open-souce software for processing point clouds. It was originally designed to make comparisons between clouds, but now has a whole toolbox. It is main interest arises from it is ability to process large point clouds. Orthophotographs are georeferenced and come with a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) which enables direct measurement of the altitude of the elements through a GIS (Geographic Information System) interface. The GIS software used at INRAP is the free and open-source software QuantumGIS. Orthophotographs are directly integrated into the GIS, in addition to traditional surveying and vectorized manual drawings. This methodology of acquisition and processing is now commonly used at INRAP and more particularly in Corsica. Indeed preventives excavations, in this offshore region, involve some logistical problems. The interest of this methodology is also the use of a completely free and open-source professional software suite and a low-cost hardware. Ultimately, this methodology tends to be used in other regions, when the use of an UAV is not possible...|$|E
