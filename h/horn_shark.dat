5|$|Over 97% of {{all known}} fish are oviparous, that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish, cichlids, tuna, and eels. In the {{majority}} of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the <b>horn</b> <b>shark,</b> and oviparous rays, such as skates. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} abundances of the <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> and the swellshark (Centroscyllim ventriosum), which {{shares the}} same habitat, are negatively correlated because horn sharks prefer temperatures warmer than 20 C while swellsharks are more cold-tolerant.

50|$|The French {{biologist}} Charles Frédéric Girard {{published the}} first scientific {{description of the}} <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> under the name Cestracion francisci in 1855, in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This species was later placed in the genus Gyropleurodus, which was eventually synonymized with the genus Heterodontus. The specific epithet francisci is a reference to San Francisco, although {{the range of the}} <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> does not extend that far north. The type specimen from Monterey Bay has since been lost. The scientific name for this species has been given erroneously as Heterodontus californicus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> captures prey via suction, {{created by}} {{expanding}} its buccal cavity. Its labial cartilages are modified {{so that the}} mouth can form a tube, facilitating the suction force. Once the prey is drawn into the mouth, it is secured with the sharp front teeth and then ground into pieces by the flat lateral teeth. To extract buried or affixed prey, the <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> grips it and adopts a vertical posture with the head and pectoral fins against the substrate and the tail arched above. The shark then acts as a lever with its pectoral fins as the fulcrum: with a downward stroke of the tail, it forces its head upwards and pulls the prey loose; this mode of feeding has not been observed in any other shark. The <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> is also capable of protruding its upper jaw up to 15% the length of its head; this motion takes only 20 milliseconds to accomplish and allows the shark to use its upper jaw like a chisel to dislodge firmly attached prey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> (Heterodontus francisci) is {{a species}} of {{bullhead}} shark, in the family Heterodontidae. It is endemic to the coastal waters off the western coast of North America, from California to the Gulf of California. Young sharks are segregated spatially from the adults, with the former preferring deeper sandy flats and the latter preferring shallower rocky reefs or algal beds. A small species typically measuring 1 m in length, the <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> can be recognized by a short, blunt head with ridges over its eyes, two high dorsal fins with large spines, and a brown or gray coloration with many small dark spots.|$|E
5000|$|Other prey {{items of}} adults include peanut worms, sea stars, cephalopods, and small bony fishes. Juveniles feed {{primarily}} on polychaete worms, sea anemones, and small clams, {{and have been}} known to [...] "pounce" [...] on anemones to bite off tentacles before they can be retracted. Off southern California, <b>horn</b> <b>sharks</b> are known to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. In the summer, diurnally active fishes, in particular the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), are especially abundant and are easily captured at night when they lie dormant. In the winter, the sharks scavenge on market squid (Loligo opalescens), which die {{by the tens of thousands}} after their mass spawning event. <b>Horn</b> <b>sharks</b> hunt mainly using their sense of smell. Although electroreception certainly plays a role in locating prey, this species has only 148 ampullae of Lorenzini. This is much fewer than in most other sharks, which may have over 2,000. Like other <b>sharks,</b> the <b>horn</b> <b>shark's</b> teeth are regularly replaced; it takes 4 weeks for a dropped tooth to be replaced.|$|R
50|$|The Oceanarium {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of creatures from across the globe, including:green sea turtles, clownfish, piranha, guitar fish, bass, bream, regal tang, lionfish, moray eel, pufferfish, southern stingrays, cownose rays, <b>horn</b> <b>sharks,</b> zebra sharks, red devil cichlids, upside-down catfish, spiny-tailed lizards.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} sharks {{to exhibit}} parental care, female <b>horn</b> <b>sharks</b> in the wild pick up their eggs in their mouths and wedge them into crevices. However, in captivity the eggs are simply dropped {{on the bottom and}} may later be cannibalized. The eggs hatch in 6 - 10 months; at {{emergence}} the young measure 15 - 17 cm long. Newly hatched sharks are provisioned with an internal yolk sac and do not have to feed until they are a month old, though they are capable of feeding and will accept food during this period. <b>Horn</b> <b>sharks</b> grow slowly and at a highly variable rate that does not correspond to their size; this has frustrated attempts to determine their aging process. Males mature at a length of 56 - 61 cm and females at a length of at least 58 cm. Individual sharks have lived to over 12 years old in captivity, and there exists an unconfirmed report of a shark reaching 25 years of age.|$|R
50|$|The <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> is preyed upon by larger fishes and the {{northern}} elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), which consumes adults, juveniles, and egg cases. In addition, they are captured and eaten by bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at Catalina Island, and large marine snails are able to drill into their egg cases to extract the yolk. The tough skin and spines of this species confer some protection; a Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica) has been filmed engulfing a juvenile <b>horn</b> <b>shark,</b> only to spit it out due to its spines. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bajaensis and Acanthobothrium puertecitense, the copepod Trebius heterodonti, and the nematode Echinocephalus pseudouncinatus, which spends its larval stage inside potential prey such as scallops and sea urchins.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent authors moved {{this species}} to the genera Gyropleurodus and Molochophrys before {{placing it in}} Heterodontus. The type {{specimen}} is a 68-cm-long female caught off Australia. This shark may also {{be referred to as}} crested shark, crested bull shark, crested <b>horn</b> <b>shark,</b> and crested Port Jackson shark.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> is a clumsy, {{sporadic}} swimmer that {{prefers to}} use its flexible, muscular pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom. It is usually solitary, though small groups have been recorded. During the day, horn sharks rest motionless, hidden inside caves or crevices, or within thick mats of algae, though they remain relatively alert and will swim away quickly if disturbed. After dusk, they roam actively above the reef in search of food. Horn sharks maintain small home ranges of around 1000 m2, which they may remain faithful to for over a decade, returning to the same shelter every day. The shelter is usually located {{at the edge of}} the resident shark's foraging area. The longest documented movement for an individual <b>horn</b> <b>shark</b> is 16 km.|$|E
50|$|The body is cylindrical, {{with two}} high, {{somewhat}} falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fins bearing stout spines at the front. The fin spines of reef-dwelling <b>horn</b> <b>sharks</b> are shorter than {{those living in}} algal habitats, as their spines become worn down on rocks from the sharks' movements. The first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the large pectoral fins, while the second dorsal fin originates slightly anterior to the free rear tips of the pelvic fins. The caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a long, broad upper lobe with a strong notch near the tip. The <b>horn</b> <b>shark's</b> dermal denticles are small and smooth, numbering some 200/cm2 on the back in adults. The dorsal coloration consists of various shades of gray or brown with many small dark spots, though these may be absent in older sharks; the underside is yellowish. There is a dark patch of small spots below the eye. This species may reach a length of 1.2 m, though most individuals do not exceed 1 m.|$|R
50|$|Slow-moving, {{generally}} solitary predators, <b>horn</b> <b>sharks</b> hunt {{at night}} inside small home ranges and retreat to a favored shelter during the day. Their daily activity cycles {{are controlled by}} environmental light levels. Adult sharks prey mainly on hard-shelled molluscs, echinoderms, and crustaceans, which they crush between powerful jaws and molar-like teeth, while also feeding opportunistically {{on a wide variety}} of other invertebrates and small bony fishes. Juveniles prefer softer-bodied prey such as polychaete worms and sea anemones. The shark extracts its prey from the substrate using suction and, if necessary, levering motions with its body. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying up to 24 eggs from February to April. After laying, the female picks up the auger-shaped egg cases and wedges them into crevices to protect them from predators.|$|R
40|$|Two {{paradigms}} for piscine heart function are: i) that elasmobranch heart filling {{is dependent}} upon a strongly negative pericardial pressure and, ii) in all fishes, atrial systole is the exclusive determinant of ventricular end-diastolic volume (Farrell and Jones, 1992). Both of these principles are now being challenged by studies with a diversity of species, varied experimental approaches, and modern instrumentation. That "normal cardiac function depends upon strongly negative pericardial pressure " has been a cornerstone of elasmobranch physiology for over a century. However, chronic pressure measurements in <b>horn</b> <b>sharks</b> (Heterodontus) reveal that although strongly negative {{at the time of}} surgery, pericardial pressure rises steadily and is near ambient in post-operated, resting sharks.

40|$|Activity onsets of <b>horn</b> <b>sharks,</b> Heterodontus francisci, {{were studied}} in the natural {{environment}} at Santa Catalina Island, California.

40|$|During July-September 1993 and May 1996, {{a survey}} of the {{metazoan}} parasites of 817 elasmobranchs from the Gulf of California, representing 42 species, was conducted at 14 sites along the western portion of the Gulf of California. Elasmobranchs were obtained from local commercial fishers. In this paper, we report all digeneans collected during the survey, excluding the gorgoderids, which will be presented in a subsequent paper. Four species from three hemiuroid families were collected, none of which was known previously from the Gulf of California. Syncoelium vermilionensis sp. n. (Syncoeliidae), a species that differs most notably from its congeners by having more testes, is described from the gills and gill arches of Mobula thurstoni and M. japonica. Paronatrema vaginicola (Syncoeliidae) is reported from the cloaca, gill arches, and buccal cavity of Prionace glauca (blue shark) and Alopias pelagicus (pelagic thresher shark). These hosts represent new host records for the species, {{and this is the first}} record of the parasite from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Observations of uterine morphology in S. vermilionensis and P. vaginicola along with published descriptions of other species in Syncoeliidae indicate that all members of this family obtain a diagnostically thick outer shell of their eggs within a thick-walled section of the uterus rather than in the ootype, as in other digenean groups. Otodistomum veliporum (Azygiidae) is reported from the stomach of Squatina californica (angel shark), from the body cavity of Mustelus helei (brown smoothhound), and from the stomach of two species of <b>horn</b> <b>sharks</b> (Heterodontus francisci and H. mexicanus).

50|$|In western Oregon's ocean, the new Cascadia {{subduction}} zone laid {{the foundations for}} Oregon's modern Coast Range and improved ocean productivity, prompting diversification among the state's fauna. At least 25 species of mollusk, including several snails, are known from the Fern Ridge Dam area alone. Other marine invertebrates include echinoderms, foramenifera, brachiopods, scaphopods, shrimp, and crabs. Shark teeth from over a dozen genera have been found {{at a variety of}} sites, including the Rocky Point Quarry {{to the west of the}} Nehalem River. These genera include dogfish, <b>horn</b> <b>sharks,</b> comb-toothed sharks, makos, tiger sharks, white sharks, and an archaic basking shark. Bony fish included mahi mahi, conger eels, rattails, ancestral billfish, cod, hake, and rockfish. Marine birds in the area included auks, the local species Hydrotherikornis oregonus, and the pelican-like Phocavis maritimus. The state's only known fossil egg was found in associated rock formations.The {{subduction zone}}'s volcanic activity also formed the Cascade volcanic arc, which blocked moist air from the Pacific and created the state's High Desert. This is when Oregon's fossil-rich John Day Fossil Beds were first laid down. The earliest fossils in John Day indicate a subtropical terrestrial environment. The assemblage is rich in fossil seeds, fruit nuts, and associated woods, and is one of the few places in the world where all three are preserved in a single location. The flora included cinnamon, cycads, palms, the primitive sycamore Platanophyllum angustilobus, walnuts, magnolias, figs, grapes, coffee trees, cashews, and bananas. The state's earliest known land mammals—including the rhinoceros Hyrachyus, the early horse Orohippus, and the brontothere Telmatherium—browsed these flora. Among the area's predators was Patriofelis, a cat-like oreodont. These mammals shared the ecosystem with crocodiles in the genus Pristichampsus and the tortoise Hadrianus.In the transition from the late Paleogene to the Neogene period, Oregon's climate became drier and its environments became more similar to those of the modern day. Grasses appeared and spread across the landscape, leaving fossilized leaves in the John Day beds. Metasequoia occidentalis, a conifer closely related to modern redwoods, flourished across the state during this time. Mammals and other fauna diversified and became more common. Early additions included camels such as Paratylopus and Gentilicamelus and pecora such as Hypertragulus. Later additions included perissodactyls such as Merychippus, Parahippus, Protapirus, and Diceratherium, artiodactyls such as Dromomeryx and Blastomeryx, and proboscids like Gomphotherium and Platybelodon. Rodents including the burrowing beaver Palaeocastor and horned gopher Mylagaulus. Predators in this time period included bear-dogs such as Amphicyon, cat-like nimravids, enteldonts, and early canids such as Cormocyon. Remains of the early primate Ekgmowechashala have also been found in the John Day fossil beds.|$|R

40|$|This project {{explored}} {{and analyzed}} the strain {{and structure of}} elasmobranch jaws, particularly the hyoid arch. The cartilaginous element tested was the hyomandibula in four individuals each of the angel shark, Squatina squatina, spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, and sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus. We put them through trials that tested for strain and we performed geometric morphometric analyses on the results. ! Chondrichthyans have a modified gill arch called the hyoid arch that they use during prey capture and mastication. In all our tested shark species, the cartilaginous hyoid arch expands the buccal cavity. This expansion functions to create negative pressure in the mouth to draw in prey for suction feeders, and allows a wide buccal area to take in as much prey as possible for bite feeders. The hyoid arch in elasmobranchs consists of the ceratohyal, basihyal, and hyomandibula cartilages. The hyomandibula is significant since it connects the ceratohyal to the chondrocranium, connecting functions of {{the upper and lower}} jaws. ! Teleosts and elasmobranchs evolved different jaw structures, especially in the hyoid region: teleosts have craniums ossified with dermal bone, with the hyoid arch incorporated into the suspensorium and opercular series. The hyoid expands laterally in teleosts, as shown in previous research with Amia calva and Micropterus salmoides (Wilga 2008), while it compresses in elasmobranchs, except in mako and sandbar sharks (Wilga 2008). Lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks have long, posteriorly oriented hyomandibulae to make room for a wide buccal cavity. Previous research done on buccal pressure shows that lamniform and carcharhiniform sharks do not rely much on suction feeding, but rather on bite feeding (Wilga 2008). Suction feeders, in particular the whitespotted bamboo shark, laterally compress their buccal cavity to generate negative pressure to draw the prey in (Wilga & Sanford 2008). Even the very large megamouth shark uses negative pressure by pulling its basihyal cartilage posteriorly and ventrally rotating its hyoid arch to expand its buccal cavity (Tomita et al 2011). ! All chondrichthyan skeletons are cartilaginous, yet many readily feed on bony teleosts. Some, like the <b>Horned</b> <b>shark,</b> Heterodontus francisci, are durophagous, even with cartilaginous jaws (Huber et al. 2005). Since cartilage is more malleable than bone, the question is brought up as to how chondrichthyans can feed on durable, hard prey with cartilaginous jaws. Hence, our project focuses on the strain levels of the hyoid arch elements in sharks and rays. We tested the hyoid arch since it swings the lower jaw ventrally from the chondrocranium to expand the buccal cavity and experiences much of the pressure from mastication. ! We also examined cartilage mineralization. One suggestion in literature was that the mineralization of cartilage makes it stiffer and therefore more resistant to strain (Porter et al. 2007). Mineralization occurs in chondrichthyan jaws as prismatic or globular calcification in the form of blocks called tesserae. They form around the perichondrium, the outer layer of the extracellular matrix (Dean and Summers 2006). Since the calcified tesserae add another layer to the cartilage, one of our hypotheses was that cartilage elements with more mineralization would be more resistant to strain than those that had a thinner layer of mineralization. ! Our second hypothesis was that shorter, more square-like hyomandibulae would deform less than longer, thinner hyomandibulae. We obtained data on hyomandibulae shape by measuring their length and cross-sectional areas, and used length data to test this hypothesis. We predicted that long, thin specimens had more area to deform than short, squat specimens, leading to a higher Poisson’s ratio of strain. Our third hypothesis was that mineralized area and hyomandibula cross-sectional area were correlated, since a thicker layer of mineralization would add to the extracellular matrix area of the cartilage. Significant correlations would suggest that larger hyomandibulae are more resistant to strain than smaller ones...|$|R
