50|$|<b>Facetectomy</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure which involves decompression of a spinal nerve root. For example, {{it can be}} performed in severely resistant cases of cervical rhizalgia, where the cervical nerve roots within the intervertebral foramina are decompressed.|$|E
50|$|An {{artificial}} facet replacement is a {{joint prosthesis}} intended to replace the natural facets and other posterior elements of the spine, restoring normal (or near-normal) motion while providing stabilization of spinal segments. It is typically used {{as an adjunct to}} laminectomy, laminotomy, neural decompression, and <b>facetectomy,</b> in lieu of standard lumbar fusion. The prosthesis is indicated for back and leg pain caused by central or lateral spinal stenosis, degenerative disease of the facets with instability, and grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis with objective evidence of neurological impairment.|$|E
40|$|<b>Facetectomy</b> is an {{important}} intervention for spinal stenosis but may lead to spinal instability. Biomechanical knowledge for <b>facetectomy</b> can be beneficial when deciding whether fusion is necessary. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the biomechanical effect of different grades of <b>facetectomy.</b> A three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model of L 3 –L 5 was constructed. The mobility of the model and the intradiscal pressure (IDP) of L 4 -L 5 for standing were inside the data from the literature. The effect of graded <b>facetectomy</b> on intervertebral rotation, IDP, facet joint forces, and maximum von Mises equivalent stresses in the annuli was analyzed under flexion, extension, left/right lateral bending, and left/right axial rotation. Compared with the intact model, under extension, unilateral <b>facetectomy</b> increased the range of intervertebral rotation (IVR) by 11. 7 % and IDP by 10. 7 %, while the bilateral <b>facetectomy</b> increased IVR by 40. 7 % and IDP by 23. 6 %. Under axial rotation, the unilateral <b>facetectomy</b> and the bilateral <b>facetectomy</b> increased the IVR by 101. 3 % and 354. 3 %, respectively, when turned to the right and by 1. 1 % and 265. 3 %, respectively, when turned to the left. The results conclude that, after unilateral and bilateral <b>facetectomy,</b> care must be taken when placing the spine into extension and axial rotation posture from the biomechanical point of view...|$|E
30|$|Although the {{instrumentation}} type differed, similar {{techniques were}} used to perform the deformity correction and to achieve a solid arthrodesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Seventeen fresh {{segments}} of cadaveric lumbar spines {{were tested in}} flexion, extension, and axial rotation. The resulting angular rotations were measured {{with the use of}} a goniometer and a three-dimensional system of video analysis. Measurements of flexibility were made, in order, in the intact spine; after decompression (bilateral total laminectomies, partial medial <b>facetectomies,</b> and foraminotomies); after exci-sion of the capsule and cartilage of the facets; and after cancellous bone had been packed into the facet defects. Decompression resulted in a slight increase in the sagittal and axial ranges of motion. Subsequent exci-sion of the capsule and cartilage of the facets, as in preparation for an arthrodesis of the facets, resulted in a significant increase in both the sagittal (5. 7 ± 2. ...|$|R
40|$|Background. Degenerative lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} (DLSS) {{is a common}} cause of low back and leg pain in the elderly. Conservative treatment seldom results in sustained improvement. Methods. Fifty-six patients (33 women, 23 men) older than 50 years (mean 67 years, range 51 to 82 years) and with no prior low back surgery were treated from 1993 to 1999 for clinical and radiologic evidence of DLSS. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe the results of decompressive laminectomy with or without fusion in terms of reoperation, severity of back pain, leg pain and patient satisfaction. Answers to Swiss {{spinal stenosis}} questionnaires completed before surgery and one to five years afterwards were evaluated. Seven patients (12. 5 %) with degenerative spondylolisthesis, scoliosis and/or more radical <b>facetectomies</b> received fusion. Results. Of the 56 patients in the original cohort, two were deceased and two had undergone reoperation by follow-up. Forty-eight patients answered questionnaires. Average duration of follow-up was 2. 5 years. More than 70 percent of the respondents had no or only mild back or buttock pain at follow-up and more than 60 percent were able to walk more than 500  m. Added fusion reduced the incidence of low back pain and pain frequency, and increased walking distance (ANOVA). Conclusions. Eighty-one percent of patients were satisfied with the results of surgery and 87. 5 % would choose to have the operation again if they had the choice. Decompressive laminectomy for DLSS yields best results if instrumented fusion is included in the procedure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Degenerative lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} {{is the most}} common reason for lumbar surgery in patients in the age of 65  years and older. The standard surgical management is decompression of the spinal canal by laminectomy and partial <b>facetectomy.</b> The effect of this procedure on the shear strength of the spine has not yet been investigated in vitro. In the present study we determined the ultimate shear force to failure, the displacement and the shear stiffness after performing a laminectomy and a partial <b>facetectomy.</b> Eight lumbar spines of domestic pigs (7  months old) were sectioned to obtain eight L 2 –L 3 and eight L 4 –L 5 motion segments. All segments were loaded with a compression force of 1, 600  N. In half of the 16 motion segments a laminectomy and a 50 % partial <b>facetectomy</b> were applied. The median ultimate shear force to failure with laminectomy and partial <b>facetectomy</b> was 1, 645  N (range 1, 066 – 1, 985) which was significantly smaller (p =  0. 012) than the ultimate shear force to failure of the control segments (median 2, 113, range 1, 338 – 2, 659). The median shear stiffness was 197. 4  N/mm (range 119. 2 – 216. 7) with laminectomy and partial <b>facetectomy</b> which was significantly (p =  0. 036) smaller than the stiffness of the control specimens (median 216. 5, 188. 1 – 250. 2). It was concluded that laminectomy and partial <b>facetectomy</b> resulted in 22 % reduction in ultimate shear force to failure and 9 % reduction in shear stiffness. Although relatively small, these effects may explain why patients have an increased risk of sustaining shear force related vertebral fractures after spinal decompression surgery...|$|E
40|$|Hemorrhagic juxtafacet {{synovial}} cysts {{have rarely}} {{been reported in}} the literature. We reviewed case records of eight patients with hemorrhagic juxtafacet cysts treated surgically. Back pain and acute radicular pain were the presenting features in the all patients. The possible cause for hemorrhage could be indentified in only three patients. Six patients had medial <b>facetectomy</b> and hemilaminectom and two patients with stenosis had medial <b>facetectomy</b> and laminectomy. Following surgery there was immediate relief from pain with significant improvement of the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Six patients had an excellent outcome while the remaing two patients had a good outcome. During the follow-up there was no progression of slippage, no segment instability, and no recurrence.

40|$|Study Design. The {{range of}} motion (ROM) of lumbar cadaver spines was {{measured}} during flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending following graded fac-etectomies and implantation of an X STOP interspinous spacer implant. Objective. The study was performed undertaken to understand better {{the influence of the}} interspinous spacer implant on the kinematics of the lumbar spine following graded facetectomies. Summary of the Background Data. Lateral lumbar spi-nal stenosis is often treated with a unilateral or bilateral <b>facetectomy</b> procedure. Previous biomechanical research has shown that a <b>facetectomy</b> may increase the ROM during flexion and axial rotation. Methods. Seven cadaver spines (L 2 –L 5) were tested in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending, and the individual ROM of each motion segment was mea-sured. Specimens were tested intact and following 3 graded facetectomies (i. e., unilateral medial <b>facetectomy</b> [UMF], unilateral total <b>facetectomy</b> [UTF], and bilateral total <b>facetectomy</b> [BTF]), with and without the X STOP. Results. A BTF caused a significant increase in ROM during flexion and axial rotation but not extension and lateral bending. The UMF and UTF did not affect the ROM during any of the 4 motions. The interspinous implant: (1) significantly decreased the flexion ROM for the intact, UMF, UTF, and BTF treatments; (2) significantly de-creased the extension ROM for the intact, UMF, and BTF treatments but not the UTF (P 0. 13); (3) had no signifi-cant effect on the axial rotation ROM; and (4) significantly increased the lateral bending ROM for the UMF, UTF, and BTF treatments. Conclusions. The results suggest that the implant may be used in conjunction with a UMF or UTF. However, the X STOP should not be used in conjunction with BTF...|$|E
30|$|Anteroposterior {{surgery was}} {{performed}} in the hybrid instrumentation group when the thoracic curve magnitude exceeded 70 °, thoracolumbar curves 100 °, or in the immature patient to prevent crankshaft phenomenon. Anteroposterior surgery in the PSI group {{was performed in}} extreme curves of 100 ° with less than 25  % correction on traction films and in none {{for the prevention of}} crankshaft phenomenon. Anteroposterior surgery was performed in 12 (80  %) patients of the hybrid group (nine of them staged surgeries) and in two (12  %) patients of the pedicle screw group (p <  0.001). Briefly, the anterior approach was thoracotomy for the lower thoracic spine and thoracoabdominal for the Th 12 -L 2 area. The patient is laid in a lateral decubitus position. Segmental vessels in the anterior fusion area were ligated unilaterally to allow wide and safe exposure of the spine, including anterior longitudinal ligament. Multilevel discectomies were performed for release of the rigid spinal deformity. Anterior spinal fusion was obtained through autologous rib grafting of the disc spaces. Then, the patient is turned prone and posterior elements of the spine are exposed carefully with electrocautery. Five (33  %) patients in the hybrid and 16 (94  %) patients in the pedicle screw groups underwent the Ponte procedure [17], consisting of wide <b>facetectomies</b> with resections of the spinous process (pedicle to pedicle), ligamentum flavum, and inferior and superior laminar borders (p <  0.001). Apical vertebral column resection (VCR) was performed for three patients in both groups. Patients in the hybrid group underwent VCR using a combined anteroposterior approach and patients in the pedicle screw group underwent VCR using an all-posterior approach according to previously described techniques [7]. All patients received morselized allogenic bone grafting when iliac fixation was performed.|$|R
40|$|Flattening of the {{preimplantation}} rod contour in the {{sagittal plane}} influences thoracic kyphosis (TK) restoration in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) surgery. The effects of multilevel <b>facetectomy</b> and screw density on postoperative changes in spinal rod contour {{have not been}} documented. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of multilevel <b>facetectomy</b> and screw density on changes in spinal rod contour from before implantation to after surgical correction of thoracic curves in patients with AIS prospectively. The concave and convex rod shapes from patients with thoracic AIS (n = 49) were traced prior to insertion. Postoperative sagittal rod shape was determined by computed tomography. The angle of intersection of the tangents to the rod end points was measured. Multiple stepwise linear regression {{analysis was used to}} identify variables independently predictive of change in rod contour (Δθ). Average Δθ at the concave and convex side were 13. 6 ° ± 7. 5 ° and 4. 3 ° ± 4. 8 °, respectively. The Δθ at the concave side was significantly greater than that of the convex side (P < 0. 0001) and significantly correlated with Risser sign (P = 0. 032), the preoperative main thoracic Cobb angle (P = 0. 031), the preoperative TK angle (P = 0. 012), and the number of <b>facetectomy</b> levels (P = 0. 007). Furthermore, a Δθ at the concave side ≥ 14 ° significantly correlated with the postoperative TK angle (P = 0. 003), the number of <b>facetectomy</b> levels (P = 0. 021), and screw density at the concave side (P = 0. 008). Rod deformation at the concave side suggests that corrective forces acting on that side are greater than on the convex side. Multilevel <b>facetectomy</b> and/or screw density at the concave side have positive effects on reducing the rod deformation that can lead to a loss of TK angle postoperatively...|$|E

40|$|Study Design Experimental study. Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} stepwise resection of posterior spinal ligaments, facet joints, and ribs on thoracic spinal flexibility. Summary of Background Data Posterior spinal ligaments, facet joints and ribs are removed to increase spinal flexibility in corrective spinal surgery for deformities such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Reported clinical results vary and biomechanical substantiation is lacking. Methods Ten fresh-frozen human cadaveric thoracic spinal specimens (T 6 -T 11) were studied. A spinal motion simulator applied a pure moment of ± 2. 5 Nm in flexion, extension, lateral bending (LB) and axial rotation (AR). Range of motion (ROM) was measured for the intact spine and measured again after stepwise resection of the supra/interspinous ligament (SIL), inferior facet, flaval ligament, superior facet, and rib heads. Results SIL resection increased ROM in flexion (10. 2 %) and AR (3. 1 %). Successive inferior <b>facetectomy</b> increased ROM in flexion (4. 1 %), LB (3. 8 %) and AR (7. 7 %), and flavectomy in flexion (9. 1 %) and AR (2. 5 %). Sequential superior <b>facetectomy</b> only increased ROM in flexion (6. 3 %). Rib removal provided an additional increase in flexion (6. 3 %), LB (4. 5 %) and AR (13. 0 %). Extension ROM increased by 10. 5 % after the combined removal of the SIL, inferior facet and flaval ligament. Conclusions Posterior spinal releases in these non-scoliotic spines led to an incremental increase in spinal flexibility, but each sequential step had less effect. As compared to SIL resection with inferior <b>facetectomy,</b> additional superior <b>facetectomy</b> did not improve flexibility in AR and LB and only 6. 3 % in flexion. The data presented from this in vitro study should be interpreted with care, as no representative cadaveric spine model for AIS was available, However, the results presented here at least question the benefits of performing routine complete facetectomies (i. e. Ponte osteotomies) to increase spinal flexibility in scoliosis surgery...|$|E

40|$|Background Surgery {{for same}} level multi-focal {{extruded}} lumbar disc herniations is technically challenging and the optimal method controversial. The subarticular disc herniation may pose {{the most challenging}} subtype requiring partial or complete <b>facetectomy</b> with or without fusion. The far-lateral disc herniation, often treated using a Wiltse approach, can also be difficult to access especially in the obese patient. When both the subarticular and far-lateral subtypes are simultaneously present {{at the same level}} with or without a paracentral disc herniation, a total <b>facetectomy</b> and interbody fusion (TLIF) or a total disc replacement (TDR) may be necessary.

The intraforaminal herniations were contained or extruded in 52 % and sequestrated in 47 %; for extraforaminal herniation the proportions were 66 % and 33 %, respectively. There was additional posterolateral protrusion or spinal stenosis {{at the level}} of the lateral herniation in seven and four cases, respectively. The patients were reviewed at three months and two years after surgery. Radiographs showed three grades of facetectomy: grade I, removal of 50 % or less, grade II, excision of 51 % to 75 %, and grade III, subtotal or total <b>facetectomy.</b> For intraforaminal herniations the results were excellent or good in 88 % of patients when reviewed at three months and in 91 % at two years.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the American population will experience low-back pain during their lifetime. With this debilitating condition affecting more people every day, a solution is required to help the population. One {{of the causes of}} low-back pain is facet degeneration.

40|$|Background. Several {{different}} techniques {{exist to}} address the pain and disability caused by isolated nerve root impingement. Failure to adequately decompress the lumbar foramen may lead to failed back surgery syndrome. However, aggressive treatment often causes spinal instability or may require fusion for satisfactory results. We describe a novel technique for decompression of the lumbar nerve root and demonstrate its effectiveness in relief of radicular symptoms. Methods. Partial <b>facetectomy</b> was performed by removal of the medial portion of the superior facet in patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis. 47 patients underwent the procedure from 2001 to 2010. Those who demonstrated neurogenic claudication without spinal instability or central canal stenosis and failed conservative management were eligible for the procedure. Functional level was recorded for each patient. These patients were followed {{for an average of}} 3. 9 years to evaluate outcomes. Results. 27 of 47 patients (57 %) reported no back pain and no functional limitations. Eight of 47 patients (17 %) reported moderate pain, but had no limitations.

40|$|Background: Global fusion is {{recommended}} in sub-axial cervical spine injuries with retrolisthesis, translation rotation injuries associated with end plate or tear drop fractures. We propose {{a modification of}} Stellerman′s algorithm which we have used where in patients are primarily treated via anterior decompression and fixation. Global fusion was done only in cases where post-decompression traction does not achieve reduction in cases with locked facets. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and thirty consecutive patients with sub-axial cervical spine injuries were studied in a prospective trial over a 7 year period. Seven cases with posterior compression alone were not subjected to our protocol. Of the other 223 cases, 191 cases who on radiological evaluation needed surgery were initially approached anteriorly. Decompression was effected through a corpectomy in 14 cases and a single or multiple level disc excisions were performed in the others. Cases with cervical listhesis (n= 36) where on table reduction could not be achieved following decompression were subjected to progressive skeletal traction for 48 h. Posterior <b>facetectomy</b> and global fixation was done for patients in whom reduction could not be achieved despite post-decompression traction (n= 11). Results: Of the 223 cases, 20 cases were managed conservatively, 12 cases expired pre-operatively, and the remaining 191 cases needed surgical intervention. Out of the 154 cases of distraction/rotation/translation injuries on table reduction could be achieved in 118 cases (76. 6 %). Thirty-six patients had locked facets (23 cases were bifacetal, 13 cases unifacetal) and of these 36 cases reduction could be achieved with post-anterior decompression traction in 25 patients (16. 2 %); however, only 11 cases (7. 1 %) - 8 bifacetal and 3 unifacetal dislocations-needed posterior <b>facetectomy</b> and global fusion. One hundred and forty-three patients were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. One hundred and twenty-six patients showed evidence of complete fusion (88. 1 %) while the remaining 17 (11. 8) showed evidence of partial fusion. There were no signs of instability on clinical and radiological evaluation {{in any of the}} cases. Reduction of graft height was noted in 18 patients (12. 5 %). There were eight cases of immediate postoperative mortality and two cases of delayed mortality in our series of cases. Conclusion: We feel that on table decompression and reduction followed by anterior stabilization can be used as the initial surgical approach to manage most types of cervical injuries. In rotation/translational cases where reduction cannot be achieved, monitored cervical traction on the decompressed spine can safely achieve reduction and hence avoid the need for a posterior <b>facetectomy</b> in a large percentage of cases...|$|E

Despite the laminotomy for spinal stenosis {{on the right}} side at the L 4 - 5 level, her leg pain did not improve. Careful review of computed tomography scans and coronal source images of magnetic resonance myelography revealed foraminal stenosis {{on the right side}} at the L 5 vertebra. Because of medical problem, she underwent isthmus resection on the right side at the L 5 level instead of total <b>facetectomy</b> and fusion. After surgery, her leg pain was markedly improved. Isthmus resection showed successful result for this medically compromised elderly patient with unilateral foraminal stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Context: Approaches {{suggested}} {{for treatment of}} neglected dislocations in the subaxial cervical spine (SACS) include only anterior approach (a), only posterior approach (b), posterior-anterior approach, posterior-anterior-posterior approach, and anterior-posterior-anterior-posterior approach. No protocol is suggested in literature to guide surgeons treating neglected dislocations. Aim: To describe a protocol {{for the treatment of}} neglected dislocation in the SACS. Settings and Designs: Retrospective case series and review of literature. Materials and Methods: Six consecutive patients of neglected dislocation (presenting to us more than 3 weeks following trauma) of the SACS were operated as per the protocol suggested in this paper. A retrospective review of the occupational therapy reports, patient records, and radiographs was performed. Only cases with time lapse of more than 3 weeks between the time of injury and initial management have been included in the review. Results: Closed reduction (CR) was achieved in three patients following cervical traction and these were managed by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Open reduction via posterior approach and soft tissue release was required to achieve reduction in two patients. Following reduction posterior instrumented fusion was done in them. One patient with preoperative neurological deficit needed a <b>facetectomy</b> to achieve reduction. Following short-segment fixation, ACDF was also performed in this patient. None of the patients deteriorated neurologically following surgery. Fusion was achieved in all patients. Conclusions: Preoperative and intraoperative traction have a role in the management of neglected dislocations in the cervical spine. If CR is achieved the patient may be managed by ACDF. If CR is not achieved, posterior soft tissue release may be done to achieve reduction and partial <b>facetectomy</b> must be reserved for cases in which reduction is not achieved after soft tissue release. A treatment protocol for management of neglected dislocation in the SACS has been suggested in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Following an L 5 –S 1 SB Charité disc III implantation, a 37 -year-old female patient {{developed}} intractable radicular pain in {{the left}} L 5 distribution. The patient underwent a minimally invasive foraminotomy, and her symptoms improved significantly. However, following recurrence of radicular pain, she showed signs of an L 5 –S 1 facet degeneration and recurrent nerve root compression from hypertrophied synovium. A partial <b>facetectomy</b> was then performed to completely decompress the L 5 root with supplemental posterior dynamic stabilization using a pedicle-based flexible titanium rod system. To date, the patient remains free of symptoms. Although posterolateral fusion {{would have been a}} viable option, the application of a posterior dynamic system permitted segmental motion preservation.

Introduction. Spinal schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors. Completely extradural schwannomas of the lumbar spine are extremely rare lesions, accounting for only 0, 7 – 4, 2 % of all spinal NSTs. Standard open approaches {{have been used to}} treat these tumors, requiring extensive muscle dissection, laminectomy, radical foraminotomy, and <b>facetectomy.</b> In this paper the authors present the case of a minimally invasive resection of a completely extradural schwannoma. Operative technique literature review is presented. Material & Methods. A 50 -year-old woman presented with progressive complains of chronic right leg pain an...|$|E
40|$|Synovial chondromatosis (SC) in {{the spine}} is rare. There are few reports of {{associated}} cervical radiculopathy {{and there has}} not been a case reported of regrowing cervical SC. Here we report a 21 -year-old man with a SC of a cervical facet joint that extended into the intervertebral foramen and compressed the cervical nerve root. The same symptom developed three years following the first operation. Computed tomography (CT) scans and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple calci-fied nodules anterior to the right facet joint of C 6 - 7 that extended into the intervertebral foramen. A mass removal was per-formed just as in the previous operation with a subtotal <b>facetectomy.</b> When vertebral SC is suspected, complete removal involving the bone and synovium should be considered as the standard treatment option...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} anatomically accurate two-motion segment model (C 4 -C 5 -C 6) of {{the human}} cervical spine was developed to study the biomechanics under intact and surgically altered conditions. Linear and nonlinear analyses were conducted. The linear model was validated with experimental data under physiologic compression, flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial torsion. This linear model was used to study the responses due to change in geometrical and material characteristics of the spine during graded <b>facetectomy,</b> laminectomy with graded <b>facetectomy,</b> anterior interbody fusion and pediatric cervical spine developmental process. The internal response (stress) of a spinal component was more sensitive to geometrical and material property changes compared to the external response (overall strength). These results {{provide a basis for}} clinical observations regarding spinal development and degeneration. The linear model was refined to develop a complex detailed nonlinear model based on spinal component sensitivity analysis which demonstrated that the soft tissue material properties were the critical parameters affecting the responses. The accurate details of the soft tissues were obtained by conducting an anatomical study to quantify the three-dimensional geometrical details of the uncovertebral joint and a pilot finite element study of different modeling approaches to better define the components of the facet joint. The quantified geometrical data of the uncovertebral joint, a better fluid modeling approach to simulate the facet joint, nonlinear material definition of ligaments, and composite nature of anulus fibrosis and incompressible behavior of nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc, were incorporated in the nonlinear model. This model was validated in terms of external response, such as overall force-displacement response, and internal response such as microstrain data on the vertebra with experimental data under compression, flexion, extension, compression-flexion and compression-extension loading. The validated nonlinear model was used to study the effect of varying loading conditions. The overall external response was not affected due to a change in loading conditions, but the nature and magnitude of the internal responses varied significantly as the loading conditions changed...|$|E
