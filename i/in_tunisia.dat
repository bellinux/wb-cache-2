5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{has been}} used in falconry for centuries and was favoured by Emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605) of the Mughal Empire. There is a tradition of using migrant Eurasian sparrowhawks to catch common quail <b>in</b> <b>Tunisia</b> and Georgia, where there are 500 registered bazieri (sparrowhawkers) and a monument to bazieri in the city of Poti. Eurasian sparrowhawks are also popular in Ireland. At Cap Bon <b>in</b> <b>Tunisia,</b> and in Turkey, thousands are captured each year by falconers and used for hunting migrant common quails. Although they were formerly released {{at the end of the}} season, many are now kept because of the scarcity of migrants.|$|E

5|$|With the {{initiative}} {{back with the}} Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the Allies out of North Africa. At the Battle of the Kasserine Pass his forces gave the Allies a beating, {{but in the end}} strong Allied resistance and a string of Axis errors stopped the advance.

An Allied offensive in April finally broke through, leading to a collapse of the Axis position <b>in</b> <b>Tunisia.</b> Some 275,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken.

5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Tripoli in January 1943, the {{remaining}} Axis forces retreated to prepared defences in Southern Tunisia, {{in front of the}} Mareth Line built by France before the war. Here in March, Horrocks carried out one of his most successful actions. His corps, composed of the 1stArmoured Division, a Free French brigade and the attached New Zealand Corps (which included the 2nd New Zealand Division and the British 8th Armoured Brigade), was ordered to attack as part of Operation Supercharge after XXXCorps failed to breach the line. He carried out a flanking manoeuvre through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable, rendering the Mareth position untenable and forcing the Axis into another retreat. Three Italian divisions were destroyed, and the German 15th and 21stPanzer Divisions and the 164thDivision were heavily depleted. Horrocks was then transferred to the First Army to take over IXCorps after its previous commander, Lieutenant-General John Crocker, was wounded in a training accident. He led this corps in the final Allied offensive <b>in</b> <b>Tunisia</b> during April and May 1943, capturing Tunis and accepting the surrender of the remnants of Rommel's Army Group Africa.
