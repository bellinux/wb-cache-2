500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do <b>I</b> <b>place</b> myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E
500|$|Leopold {{died in the}} {{presence}} of Caroline and two nurses; his youngest legitimate child Princess Clémentine, who had been barred from entering his palace before, was still not allowed to go into his room despite his weakening condition. Princesses Louise and Stéphanie also traveled to Brussels for a hoped-for reconciliation with their father and changes to the king's will, but Leopold turned them away. Caroline claimed that right before his passing, Leopold turned to his aide Baron Auguste Goffinet and said [...] "I present you my widow. <b>I</b> <b>place</b> her under your protection during the few days she'll spend in Belgium after my death". Hochschild speculates that it is likely the king said this or something similar, as he was well-aware how much his daughters and the public loathed her, particularly when they discovered just how much he had left her and their sons.|$|E
500|$|In Cosmas's writing, {{the saint}} was named [...] "Jovan from Vladimir"; {{his father was}} Nemanja (historically, Grand Prince of Raška from 1166 to 1196), and his {{grandfather}} was Simeon (Bulgarian Tsar from 893 to 927). He married a daughter of Samuel, the tsar of Bulgaria and Ohrid. He succeeded his father as emperor of Albania, Illyria, and Dalmatia. After Byzantine Emperor Basil defeated Tsar Samuel, Emperor Jovan defeated Basil. He also fought against the Bogomil and Messalian heretics. From his early youth, Jovan Vladimir longed for the Kingdom of God. After he was married, he prayed day and night, and abstained from intercourse with his wife. She was a heretic like her brother, whom she incited to kill Jovan. When the two brothers-in-law rode together, accompanied by soldiers, the heretic suddenly struck Jovan with a sword at a mountain pass named Derven, but could not cut him. Only when Jovan gave him his own sword was the murderer able to cut off his head. Jovan caught {{it in the air}} and rode on to the church he had built near Elbasan. There he put his head down, saying, [...] "Lord Jesus Christ, in your hands <b>I</b> <b>place</b> my spirit," [...] and died; it was AD899. He was buried in the church, which then became the scene of many miracles. The saint's beneficent power is described in the hagiography: ...|$|E

2500|$|Asked in 2003 if Proposition 54 could derail school {{integration}} {{efforts in}} California, Connerly said: [...] "I don't care {{whether they are}} segregated or not… kids need to be learning, and <b>I</b> <b>place</b> more value on these kids getting educated than I do on whether we have some racial balancing or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1877, she {{had another}} success as Dona Sol in Hernani, a tragedy written 47 years earlier by Victor Hugo. Her lover {{in the play}} was her lover off-stage, as well, Mounet-Sully. Hugo himself was in the audience. The next day, he sent her a note: [...] "Madame, you were great and charming; you moved me, me the old warrior, and, at a certain moment when the public, touched and enchanted by you, applauded, I wept. The tear which you caused me to shed is yours. <b>I</b> <b>place</b> it at your feet." [...] The note was {{accompanied}} by a tear-shaped pearl on a gold bracelet.|$|E

2500|$|Religious imagery {{depicting}} the Sacred Heart is frequently featured in Roman Catholic, {{and sometimes in}} Anglican and Lutheran, homes. Sometimes images display beneath them a list of family members, indicating that the entire family is entrusted {{to the protection of}} Jesus in the Sacred Heart, from whom blessings on the home and the family members are sought. The prayer [...] "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, <b>I</b> <b>place</b> all my trust in Thee" [...] is often used. One particular image has been used as part of a set, along with an image of the Virgin Mary. In that image, Mary too was shown pointing to her Immaculate Heart. The dual images reflect an eternal binding of the two hearts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 she {{proposed}} a similar idea {{to the same}} gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramović would {{stand in front of}} the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. [...] "From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. <b>I</b> <b>place</b> the gun to my temple. I pull the trigger." [...] The performance had two possible outcomes.|$|E

Yes, <b>I</b> <b>place</b> my trust in Adalgisa: {{he will come}} back repentant, imploring, full of love.") Then Clotilde arrives with news that Adalgisa has failed to persuade Pollione to return. Although Norma {{questions}} whether she should have trusted her, she then learns from her servant that Adalgisa is returning and wishes to take her vows at the altar and that the Roman has sworn to abduct her from the temple. In anger, Norma strikes a gong-like shield as a summons to war. Trumpets sound and Oroveso and the Druids all rush in, demanding {{to know what is}} happening. They hear Norma's answer and the soldiers take up the refrain: Guerra, guerra! / [...] "War, war!", while Norma proclaims [...] "Blood, blood! Revenge!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd George {{accepted}} the challenge by return of post, writing; [...] "As all delay is fatal in war, <b>I</b> <b>place</b> my office without further parley at your disposal." [...] Asquith had anticipated this response, but {{was surprised by}} a letter from Arthur Balfour, who until that point {{had been removed from}} the crisis by illness. On its face, this letter merely offered confirmation that Balfour believed that Lloyd George's scheme for a smaller War Council deserved a chance and that he had no wish to remain at the Admiralty if Lloyd George wished him out. Jenkins argues that Asquith should have recognised it as a shift of allegiance. Asquith discussed the crisis with Lord Crewe and they agreed an early meeting with the Unionist ministers was essential. Without their support, [...] "it would be impossible for Asquith to continue." ...|$|E
