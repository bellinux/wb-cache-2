5000|$|It was dammed up ca. 1765 by Peter Hasenclever of The American Company to {{increase}} the size of the lake for water power used downstream at the Long Pond Ironworks. [...] The original dam was located even with is today's Fox Island, with most of the lake extending north of the state line. In 1837, the lake was again dammed, but at the location of the current dam, this time by the Morris Canal & Banking Company to supply water to the Pompton Feeder of the Morris Canal. The enlarged lake now flooded the Succor Brook at the northern end, forming the East Arm, surrounded [...] "Lime Ridge" [...] to create Chapel Island, and flooded the extreme southern end, including parts of Belcher Creek. The enlarged lake began to attract tourists. The Montclair and Greenwood Lake Railway reached the lake at Awosting around 1874, and the [...] "State Line" [...] (later Sterling <b>Forest)</b> <b>depot</b> was established around 1876. (This railway later became the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, and then the Greenwood Lake Division of the Erie Railway.) During its resort era, several steamboats operated on the lake, including the Greenwood Lake Transportation Company's Arlington, Milford, and their side-wheeler, Montclair, built in 1876, which had two decks and is reported to have been capable of carrying from 200 to 400 passengers. [...] There were also other steamers that were privately run, such as the Pioneer and the Anita, and smaller steam launches, such as the Wilhemina, the Carrie T., and the Ferncliff, run by specific hotels. These steamboats met the trains and took passengers to the various resorts around the lake in both states.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{ascertain}} the degradation which is effective on logs in forest enterprise depots and to determine the effects of it on log stack sale prices. The research was carried out at Central Altınpınar <b>forest</b> <b>depot</b> of Torul Forest Enterprise Management in Trabzon Regional Forest Management in 2010. As a material, 41 stacks of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) logs were investigated and cross section of wood were measured for exposure to blue stain. Investigated timber stacks, with respect to damaged log number and volume degradation groups, are compared for sales prices and rate of appraised value. As a result, it has been found out that the degradation of blue stain at log stacks decreased the rate of appraised value and sale prices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wood {{destroying}} insects {{were investigated}} in <b>forest</b> <b>depots,</b> imported timbers, and wood products {{in use in}} Düzce province. In the collection of insect material trap logs, storage decks, and samples of wooden materials were used. In total, 63 insect species belonging to 31 families of 4 orders were found, and 34 of the identified species were categorized as pest species. In <b>forest</b> <b>depots,</b> the most common insects were bark beetles and longhorned beetles. Several wood-destroying insects were found in imported timbers, such as Platypus cylindrus (Fabricius), Xyleborus sp., and Lymexylon navale (Linnaeus). In addition, the Coleopteran species Lyctus brunneus (Stephens), Hylotrupes bajulus (Linnaeus), Anobium punctatum (De Geer), and Xestobium rufovillosum (De Geer), which are economically very important, were found in wood products...|$|R

It was collected on stored wood of Anogeissus latifolia, Chloroxylon swietenia, Ougeinia oojeinensis, Shorea robusta and Terminalia tomentosa from <b>forest</b> <b>depots</b> of Chhattisgarh, India. The species is being re-described on the basis of morphology, anatomy and cultural characters...|$|R
50|$|The Red Electric {{substation}} in Lake Oswego {{was later}} converted into apartments {{that are still}} in use today. The <b>Forest</b> Grove <b>depot</b> was purchased by a grass seed broker in 1948 and still exists today. The McMinnville Red Electric depot, similar in structure to the <b>Forest</b> Grove <b>depot,</b> is still in operation, as is the Hillsboro depot. They {{are the only two}} original depots that still exist on the old Red Electric route. As of 1994, the former substation in Dundee was being used as a garage. The abandoned substation in McCoy, built in 1916, still exists.|$|R
5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans has {{a mostly}} circumboreal {{distribution}} in the north temperate zone, and {{has been found in}} North Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. Outside of this region, it has been recorded from Australia, and Oceania. In North America, where it can be found as far north as the Northwest Territories in Canada, it is more common in the eastern and southwestern part of the continent. In Europe, its northern distribution extends to Porsanger in Norway. Reported for the first time from India in 2011, it was found in <b>forests</b> <b>depots</b> of Chhattisgarh, growing on the stored logs of several native trees: Anogeissus latifolia, Chloroxylon swietenia, Desmodium oojeinense, Shorea robusta, and Terminalia elliptica.|$|R
50|$|Terrey Hills is {{also home}} to the <b>Forest</b> Coach Lines <b>depot,</b> which {{provides}} regular bus services to the city and to close suburbs such as Belrose, Davidson and Frenchs Forest as well as the surrounding area. There is also a regular bus to Macquarie University and Macquarie shopping centre. Buses also run to Chatswood and Gordon railway stations, enabling passengers to access train services.|$|R
5000|$|Cedar {{is a small}} unincorporated {{community}} at [...] {{at the corners of}} sections five, six, seven and eight. It was founded in approximately 1885 by lumberman Benjamin Boughey. He named it Cedar City because it was in a cedar <b>forest.</b> The <b>depot</b> on the Manistee and Northeastern Railroad continued to be known as Cedar City, long after the post office named simply Cedar was established on August 15, 1893. The Cedar post office, with ZIP code 49621, serves most of Solon Township as well as a large part of Centerville Township to the north, and smaller portions of Cleveland Township to the northwest, Kasson Township to the west, and Elmwood Township to the east. [...] In 1905, the Cedar State Bank was begun, which survived the Great Depression in 1933, but was closed later in the decade. The bank building was later used for the offices of the Leelanau Telephone Company. Each year in July, Cedar is host to the annual Cedar Polka Festival, which began in 1975.|$|R

5|$|By 1778, Isaac Parsons (1752–96) was in {{ownership}} of Lot Number 17. The parcel was later resurveyed for David Hunter by surveyor John Mitchel on April17, 1788. Lot Number 17 {{was bound to}} the west by the Yellow Banks and the South Branch Potomac River below, to the north by Lot Number 20, and to the south by Lot Number 16. Most of the western area of the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney were located within Lot Number 17. Lot Number 17's eastern boundary stretched between the present-day Savilla-Vale and Wirgman Hill neighborhoods of Romney. The location of Valley {{was not included in}} surveyor John Mitchel's plan for Romney dated June 30, 1790, and the <b>forested</b> lands of <b>Depot</b> Valley remained undeveloped into the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|After {{the escape}} in 1952 of John Straffen, who murdered a local child, the {{hospital}} {{set up an}} alarm system, which is activated to alert people in the vicinity, including those in the surrounding towns of Sandhurst, Wokingham, Bracknell and Bagshot, when any potentially dangerous patient escapes. It is based on World War II air-raid sirens, and a two-tone alarm sounds across the whole area {{in the event of}} an escape. It is tested every Monday morning at 10 am for two minutes, after which a single tone 'all-clear' is sounded for a further two minutes. All schools in the area must keep procedures designed to ensure that in the event of a Broadmoor escape no child is ever out of the direct supervision of a member of staff. Sirens are located at Sandhurst School, Wellington College, Bracknell <b>Forest</b> council <b>depot</b> and other sites. Following the Peter Fallon QC inquiry into Ashworth Special Hospital which reported in 1999, and found serious concerns about security and abuses resulting from poor management, it was decided to review the security at all three of the special hospitals in England. Until this time each was responsible for maintaining its own security policies. This review was made the personal responsibility of Sir Alan Langlands, who at the time was chief executive of the English National Health Service. The report that came out of the review initiated a new partnership whereby the Department of Health sets out a policy of safety, and security directions, that all three special hospitals must adhere to.|$|R

Construction of the rail line began immediately. Completed in 1884, it spanned a length of 16.29 mi. The original southern terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line and the Romney Depot were built {{at the southern end of}} Depot Valley, around which Valley developed. The South Branch line formally opened for traffic on September 1, 1884. It was at this time that Depot Valley received its name from the Romney Depot. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad continued to operate the South Branch line and later acquired the property outright by deed on November 20, 1912.|$|R
