5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief {{from the heat and}} avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Another {{commonly}} considered {{model is}} the heat pump or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the hot reservoir. The <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> body passes heat to the hot reservoir, but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir. Then, by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir. It can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle.|$|E

25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of <b>hot</b> <b>working).</b> For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E
2500|$|Hot {{extrusion}} is a <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> process, {{which means}} it is done above the material's recrystallization temperature to keep the material from work hardening {{and to make it}} easier to push the material through the die. Most hot extrusions are done on horizontal hydraulic presses that range from [...] Pressures range from , therefore lubrication is required, which can be oil or graphite for lower temperature extrusions, or glass powder for higher temperature extrusions. The biggest disadvantage of this process is its cost for machinery and its upkeep.|$|E

60|$|If Joan {{struggled}} at all, it {{was only}} slightly, when she writhed and slipped, like a snake, to get her arm under his as it clasped her neck. Then she let herself go. He crushed her to him. He bent her backward--tilted her face with hard and eager hand. Like a madman, with <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> lips, he kissed her. She felt blinded--scorched. But her purpose was as swift and sure and wonderful as his passion was wild. The first reach of her groping hand found his gun-belt. Swift as light her hand slipped down. Her fingers touched the cold gun--grasped with thrill on thrill--slipped farther down, strong and sure to raise the hammer. Then with a leaping, strung intensity that matched his own she drew the gun. She raised it while her eyes were shut. She lay passive under his kisses--the devouring kisses of one whose manhood had been denied the sweetness, the glory, the fire, the life of woman's lips. It was a moment in which she met his primitive fury of possession with a woman's primitive fury of profanation. She pressed the gun against his side and pulled the trigger.|$|E
50|$|The {{lower limit}} of the <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> {{temperature}} is determined by its recrystallization temperature. As a guideline, the lower {{limit of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> temperature of a material is 60% its melting temperature (on an absolute temperature scale). The upper limit for <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> is determined by various factors, such as: excessive oxidation, grain growth, or an undesirable phase transformation. In practice materials are usually heated to the upper limit first to keep forming forces {{as low as possible}} and to maximize the amount of time available to hot work the workpiece.|$|E

50|$|In a {{stress-strain}} curve, {{the onset}} of dynamic recrystallization can be recognized by a distinct peak in the flow stress in <b>hot</b> <b>working</b> data, due to the softening effect of recrystallization.
