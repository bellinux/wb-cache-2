50|$|When {{adopting}} a European strategy {{it is important}} that a franchisor takes expert legal advice. Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space, which is not so significant a factor in the USA. This is where the <b>franchise</b> <b>broker,</b> or the master franchisor, plays an important role. Cultural factors are also relevant, as local populations tend to be heterogeneous.|$|E

5000|$|Consultants' {{services}} are [...] "free" [...] {{to the potential}} buyer or franchisee {{only to the extent}} payment goes from the franchisee to the franchise company then into the brokers pocket, but these <b>franchise</b> <b>brokers</b> receive a substantial commission of up to 50% or more of the franchise fee the buyer pays to the franchise company. The potential buyer would pay exactly the same franchise fee as he or she would pay if they had contacted the same franchise on their own. It is illegal for the franchisor to charge anything additional for the use of a Franchise Consultant, unless this is disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD). So why would a franchisors work with franchise consultants? They do because franchise consultants screen out all of the under qualified candidates and only introduce to them highly screened quality candidates that fit their business model. Quality franchises are not concerned with paying the consultant a percentage of the initial franchise fee because they are looking at the long term residual value of on-going royalties from the franchisee. Of course, there are a substantial number of franchises that use <b>franchise</b> <b>brokers</b> (misleadingly called [...] "franchise consultants") as a way to sell a large number of franchises in a network where maximizing franchise sales is paramount over franchise network survival.|$|R
5000|$|Much like a {{real estate}} agent, the {{franchise}} [...] "recruitment consultant" [...] typically charges no upfront fees to [...] "buyers" [...] (franchisees); instead, he or she receives {{the bulk of his}} or her income from [...] "sellers" [...] (franchisers) and thus operates as a biased conduit between the two. It is important to understand that franchisors do not employ franchise consultants, but they do employ <b>franchise</b> <b>brokers</b> who call themselves franchise consultants. They establish relationships with these franchise consulting firms. The role of the franchise consultant is to build a win-win relationship between the franchisor and the potential franchisee. Quality franchise consulting firms that have a large footprint in the franchising industry and help screen out the franchises that don't meet the high standards that are set by franchise experts.|$|R

5000|$|Promoters, {{such as a}} Roth IRA broker of a self-directed IRA LLC, {{or small}} {{business}} financing, aggressively market IRS ROBS arrangements to prospective entrepreneurs and business owners for funding for a business as small business financing. In the case of most ROBS facilitators, {{there is a very}} close relationship between the promoter/facilitator and the franchise industry, seeking to sell and promote business [...] "opportunities" [...] and seeking funding sources for these sales and promotions. Most ROBS [...] "promoters" [...] and facilitators pay substantial referral fees to the <b>franchise</b> <b>brokers</b> who refer business to the promoters. Rarely are these fees disclosed to the entrepreneur. Fees charged by most [...] "promoters," [...] consequently, are in excess of the fees that would be charged by attorneys and accountants for the same services who are prohibited from paying referral fees. Some companies offering ROBS plans do not pay referral fees to brokers, and charge lower fees as a result. There remains a substantial question whether such referral fees are illegal under ERISA and the U.S. Criminal Code: Offer, Acceptance, or Solicitation to Influence Operations of Employee Benefit Plan (18 U.S.C. Section 1954).|$|R
5000|$|... 'Franchise consulting' {{traditionally}} {{meant the}} same consultant-to-client relationship {{as any other}} industry wherein the consultant charges a 'fee for services'. But, as of the late 1990s the term 'consultant' was adopted by <b>franchise</b> salesmen and <b>brokers</b> that began representing themselves as [...] "free" [...] consultants to prospective franchise buyers. These 'free consultants' provide introduction services for franchise opportunity sellers with whom they have worked out a pay-for-sale agreement. Therefore, they are driven {{by the desire to}} connect the 'client' to a particular franchise.|$|R
