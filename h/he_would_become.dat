The music incorporated soul, jazz, pop, and Irish folk sounds into songs about finding spiritual renewal and redemption in worldly matters such as nature, music, romantic love, and self-affirmation.|$|E

John was elected emperor of the Latin Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who would marry John's daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin would rule the Latin lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> sole emperor only after John's death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit Epirus and Macedonia, but the two regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.|$|E

5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E

The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on {{a job well done}} and rode on. Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer War hero Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a military officer instead of a minister.|$|E

5|$|Henn decided, {{before taking}} on a spiritual career, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a teacher.

5|$|In December 1952, Kurosawa {{took his}} Ikiru screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded {{residence}} at an inn {{to create the}} screenplay for his next movie, Seven Samurai. The ensemble work was Kurosawa's first proper samurai film, the genre for which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in Sengoku period Japan that hires a group of samurai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.|$|E

McGregor reprised his role for a brief return from 20 May 2013, before making a permanent return on 5 February 2014.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the main}} characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>become,</b> is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also a liar and a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.|$|E
