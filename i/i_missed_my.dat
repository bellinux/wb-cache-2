6000|$|... "Well, I {{have been}} told a strange tale. Before {{starting}} in search of her I called up Charley, my stable lad. <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> pistols the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Six minutes {{will see}} me through it," [...] Sir Henry promised, making for the door. [...] "Come {{to think of}} it, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> lunch. I think I'll manage it in five." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emelianenko has famously {{said of his}} {{fighting}} prowess, [...] "My punches {{are like}} electric trains, if <b>I</b> <b>miss,</b> <b>my</b> opponent would catch a cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he ain't got his {{shoulder}} broke then <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> guess," [...] muttered the Yankee gunner. [...] "Larry! Larry! Can't ye speak to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll have to {{take care}} how we pitch our tent to-night," [...] was Whopper's comment. [...] "Unless <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> guess, we'll have rain by to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must repeat," [...] Sir John said, [...] "that I much regret {{disturbing}} you {{at such an}} unseemly hour. My only excuse is that <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> way here, and I am leaving Paris early to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} rather that I meant to strike him; for he avoided me, or else <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> aim. He only gave {{the money and}} went away, evidently with a high opinion of me. He left me with a very low one of myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|One last little {{incident}} is cherished as most expressive of her. When it became {{time for me}} to leave, she took me in her carriage to the station. As we were almost there, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> gloves, and said, 'I must have left them; but there is not time to go back.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look there, will you?" [...] cried Randy {{a moment}} later, {{as he pointed}} out in the stream. [...] "If that isn't a chicken-coop then <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> guess!" ...|$|R
50|$|One of the songs, <b>I</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>My</b> Sweet Embrace, co {{written by}} Comedian Richard Lett, {{was awarded a}} MuchFACT grant and a video was shot, {{directed}} by Neill Blomkamp.|$|R
6000|$|... “Unless <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> guess, {{they have}} {{had some sort of}} quarrel among themselves,” remarked Phil. “They were disputing over {{something}} early this morning and again just before dinner.” ...|$|R
60|$|At {{about twelve}} o'clock <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> partner's voice and looking about saw {{only two of}} the packhorses following. Hitching those beside the trail, I {{returned}} to find Burton seated beside the lame horse, which could not cross the slough. I examined the horse's foot and found a thin stream of arterial blood spouting out.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{from behind}} I heard a tumult of howls, and sharp, {{piercing}} barks--much {{the sound that}} a pack of wolves raises when in full cry. Involuntarily I glanced backward to discover {{the origin of this}} new and menacing note with the result that <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> footing and went sprawling once more upon my face in the deep muck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely; I'm up from Kansas City {{to see the}} big 'round up,' as {{they call}} it. Here's my card. I {{represent}} what our Alliance friends call the 'plutocratic press.'" [...] His card stated that his name was Mr. Davis, and that he represented the Chronicle. [...] "I'm afraid the parade must be over by this time, but <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> train. Perhaps we had better step along a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Dan, we're {{ready for}} him," [...] {{announced}} Randy. [...] "Now then, fellows, if there isn't some fun when Asa Lemm enters his room, then <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> guess." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If I Drop Names of Exotic Towns That You'll Never See, in the Songs That I Write, It's That That's All I Have When <b>I</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>My</b> Girl & You're Taking Yours Home Tonight" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It Will {{be a tough}} job," [...] growled the assassin; [...] "for if <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> blow, <b>I</b> may esteem myself but a dead man. All Perth rings {{with the}} smith's skill and strength." ...|$|R
6000|$|Further--In {{writing to}} Coleridge he says: 'I parted from M---- on Monday afternoon, about six o'clock, {{a little on}} this side Rushyford. Soon after <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> road {{in the midst of}} the storm.... Between the {{beginning}} of Lord Darlington's park at Raby, and two or three miles beyond Staindrop, I composed the poem on the opposite page ['The Pilgrim's Dream,' &c.]. I reached Barnard Castle about half-past ten. Between eight and nine evening I reached Eusemere.' [Memoirs, i. pp. 181-2.] ...|$|E
60|$|Lake Leman {{will never}} seem so lovely again as when Laddie and I roamed about its shores, floated on its bosom, or laid splendid {{plans for the}} future in the sunny garden of the old chateau. I tried it again last year, but the charm was gone, for <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> boy with his fun, his music, and the frank, fresh affection he gave his 'little mamma,' as he insisted on calling the lofty {{spinster}} who loved him like half-a-dozen grandmothers rolled into one.|$|E
6000|$|... "My God, yes!" [...] he answered, with {{a sudden}} fire. [...] "I suffer the tortures of the damned {{sometimes}} because <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> chance! There! I'm telling you this just so that you shall think a little differently, if you can. You and I between us have made an infernal mess of things. It was chiefly my fault. And as regards Palliser--well, I am sorry. Only the fellow--he may have been lovable to you, {{but he was a}} coward and a sneak to me--and he paid. I am sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Recommending? Not at all, <b>miss.</b> Ted--that's <b>my</b> son--Ted said a fellow-draughtsman of his had {{a sister}} {{who wanted to}} be doing {{something}} in the world, and I mentioned it to the housekeeper, that's all. Ay, <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> son very much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{but not so}} easily! Don't you see," [...] Strether demanded [...] "where my interest, {{as already}} shown you, lies? It lies in my not being squared. If I'm squared where's <b>my</b> marriage? If <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> errand <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> that; and if <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> that <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> everything--I'm nowhere." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the 2012 Olympics, Yi {{said she}} planned to take a {{vacation}} and spend time with her family. [...] "I have been {{away from home for}} more than a year and now <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> family a lot," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mortimer, {{the very}} same. Oh, it was {{difficult}} at first. <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> mallet, and long to steady the ball with my foot and use the toe of the club. Wherever there was a direction post I aimed at it automatically. But I conquered my weakness. I practised steadily. And now Mr. McMickle says my handicap {{would be a good}} twenty-four on any links." [...] She smiled apologetically. [...] "Of course, that doesn't sound much to you! You were a twelve when I left you, and now I suppose you are down to eight or something." ...|$|E
60|$|Unhappily, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> footing in {{the obscure}} light, {{and fell on}} the open ground beyond the stream. When I had gained my feet once more, Stanwick had {{disappeared}} among the trees which marked the boundary of the park beyond me. I could see nothing of him, and I could hear nothing of him, when I {{came out on the}} high-road. There I met with a laboring man who showed me the way to the village. From the inn I sent a letter to Miss Laroche's aunt, explaining what had happened, and asking leave to call at the Hall on the next day.|$|E
60|$|The mouse {{eventually}} retired, and {{by and by}} I was sinking to sleep, when a clock {{began to}} strike; I counted till it was done, {{and was about to}} drowse again when another clock began; I counted; then the two great RATHHAUS clock angels began to send forth soft, rich, melodious blasts from their long trumpets. I had never heard anything that was so lovely, or weird, or mysterious--but when they got to blowing the quarter-hours, they {{seemed to me to be}} overdoing the thing. Every time I dropped off for the moment, a new noise woke me. Each time I woke <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> coverlet, and had to reach down to the floor and get it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "As if {{that was}} much comfort," [...] said Edmund, half smiling, then again sighing, [...] "when even for <b>my</b> own {{concerns}} <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> uncle's advice at every turn. And probably I {{may have to go}} on foreign service next year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{if you say}} so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," [...] {{said the}} {{stranger}} with deference. [...] "Still, I confess that <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you please," [...] he said, with stolid good-humor. [...] "Don't be offended. I {{came here}} with ladies--and they wouldn't let me smoke. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> smoke. <b>I</b> thought I'd slip away a bit and have it. All right! I'll play." ...|$|R
6000|$|While she {{was still}} looking round in dismay, Mademoiselle Perrot came {{up to her and}} said, 'Ah! Madame, you may well wonder! I never saw Maitre Benoit there so cross; the poor man did but offer to sell little Fanchon the elizir that secures a good husband, and old Benoit descended on him like a griffin enraged, would scarce give him time to compute his charges or pack his wares, but hustled him forth like a mere thief! And <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> bargain for that muffler that had so taken my fancy. But, Madame, he spoke to me apart, and said you were an old {{customer}} of his, and that rather than the little angel should suffer with her teeth, which surely threaten convulsions, he would leave with you this sovereign remedy of sweet syrup--a spoonful to be given each night.' ...|$|E
60|$|To {{complete}} my misfortunes <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> way going {{downstairs and}} strayed {{to and fro}} like a lost lamb until I found myself confronted by a green baize door which reminded me of something. I stood staring at it till suddenly a vision arose before me of myself following a bell wire through that very door {{in the darkness of}} the night when in search for the late Mr. Savage upon a certain urgent occasion. Yes, there could be no doubt about it, for look! there was the wire, and strange it seemed to me that I should live to behold it again. Curiosity led me to push the door open just to ascertain if my memory served me aright about the exact locality of the room. Next moment I regretted it for I fell straight into the arms of either Polly or Dolly.|$|E
60|$|We {{were both}} {{affected}} by the whisky we had drunk. I was ashamed to find that when I put out my hand to take my glass, or to strike a match, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>my</b> mark, and fumbled; my hands seemed hardly to belong to me, and my feet were not much more sure. Yet I was acutely conscious of every change in myself and in him; {{it seemed as if}} I could make my body drunk, but could never intoxicate my mind, which roused itself and kept the sharpest guard. George was frankly half drunk: his eyelids sloped over his eyes and his speech was thick; when he put out his hand he knocked over his glass, and the stuff was spilled all over the table; he only laughed. I, too, felt a great prompting to giggle on every occasion, and I marvelled at myself.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{forged a}} bond of mutual bad girl respect...that lasted through the years, {{including}} {{the production of}} the 1993 March and the work to create Stonewall 25. <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> colleague in crime. The worst part of growing older is that such missing grows right along with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not only a dandy, Roger, but, unless <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> <b>my</b> guess, {{it will be}} a {{monument}} to the skill and ingenuity of the Mentor Construction Company. I've been reading up on all kinds of bridges, and I think the construction of this particular bridge goes ahead of most of them." ...|$|R
50|$|The Long Way is {{the ninth}} studio album {{released}} by American country music artist Doug Stone. It {{was his only}} release for the Audium Entertainment label, and its only single ("POW 369", also recorded by Darryl Worley on his 2002 album <b>I</b> <b>Miss</b> <b>My</b> Friend) failed to enter the Billboard country music charts.|$|R
