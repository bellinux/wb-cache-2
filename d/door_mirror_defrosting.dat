40|$|A driver feels {{discrepancy}} between the actual measured aerodynamic noise generated from an automobile <b>door</b> <b>mirror</b> and own impression. In order to clarify the mechanism of the gap on {{the sense of the}} noise, we estimated quantitatively the influence of assembly quality of the <b>door</b> <b>mirror</b> on the aerodynamic noise in the wind tunnel experiment. The aerodynamic noise of the <b>door</b> <b>mirror</b> is analyzed based on Curle’s equation using the characteristics of the wake structure. The clearance between the panel of the body and base of the <b>door</b> <b>mirror</b> affects the noise level in the high frequency domain, whereas the clearance between the base and visor influences the noise level in the low frequency domain. We analyzed the mechanism of the aerodynamic noise as the noise level becomes large due to the increase of the wake width when the clearance between the base and visor is increased...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} apply the hot-film sensor for the {{analysis}} of the aerodynamic noise source, we measured the noise source around anautomobile <b>door</b> <b>mirror.</b> CAA (Computational Aeroacoustics) was usedfor the comparison on thequantitative noise source. We clarified that the one of the features of the aerodynamic noise generated from the actual automobile <b>door</b> <b>mirror</b> by the wind tunnel test was the low frequency noise. The low frequency noise sources inthe CAAwereformed by the perturbation of the long wave length formed at the tip side of the <b>door</b> <b>mirror.</b> The friction velocitymeasured by the hot-film probe in the low frequency domain indicated the same tendency tothe CAA analysis...|$|R
