25|$|The Fellows' Garden, {{situated}} behind Pepys Building, {{included a}} Roman-era <b>flood</b> <b>barrier</b> bank which became today's Monk's Walk, a raised footpath {{leading from the}} south side of Pepys Building to the exit of the Fellows' Garden on Chesterton Lane. At the time of the college's establishment in 1428, the Fellow's Garden was a series of fishponds. The fishponds were filled between 1586 and 1609, {{but it was not until}} the 1660s that plans to cultivate a garden on the land were realised. Most of the trees planted in the original plan of the garden were chopped down and replaced in a renovation in the early 1900s, under the instruction of botanist Walter Gardiner. Most of the newly planted trees were black poplars and its variant, Lombardy poplars. Some fruit trees, such as quince, cherry and plum trees, were later planted in the 1980s-90s. Squirrels, and the occasional woodpecker may be spotted in the garden; there are also a few flowerbeds in the garden in which the gardeners grow seasonal flowers.|$|E
25|$|After another {{crossing}} {{under the}} railway, the river skirts {{the eastern edge}} of Bramford and circles a hill, on top of which is Sproughton Manor, a grade II listed house built for Col Henry Phillipps in 1863 by the architect William Eden Nesfield. Sproughton Lock and mill are {{at the bottom of the}} hill. The mill is built in red brick and dates from the late eighteenth century. The mill race passes below the mill, which was operational until 1947, but all the machinery has been removed. Parts of the adjacent mill house date from around 1600. After passing under the A14 road, the river briefly heads north-east, through Chantry Cut, where Chantry Lock is situated, to pass under the railway. There are two bridges, as the railway line forks on the south side of the river. A <b>flood</b> <b>barrier</b> has been installed below the first bridge. Now passing through Ipswich, the river also forks, with the eastern branch being the River Gipping, and the western branch forming the start of the River Orwell. A modern sluice is located on the Orwell just below the junction. A final weir marks the position of Handford Sea Lock, below which the two channels rejoin. An outfall is situated below the junction, beyond which the river is tidal.|$|E

BIG opened a permanent New York office, and became committed to further work in New York. [...] By mid-2012 that office had a staff of 50, which they used to launch other projects in North America. In 2014 Ingels's design for an integrated flood protection system, the DryLine, was a winner of the Rebuild By Design competition created by the Department of Housing and Urban Development {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Sandy. The DryLine will stretch Manhattan's shoreline on the Lower East Side, with a landscaped <b>flood</b> <b>barrier</b> in East River Park, enhanced pedestrian bridges over the FDR drive, and permanent and deployable floodwalls north of East 14th Street.|$|E

A metal <b>flood</b> <b>barrier</b> was erected around the terminal to prevent flood-borne debris from causing damage to the structure.

2500|$|The [...] "brownfield" [...] {{industrial}} {{area of the}} Port Lands, {{on the east side}} of the harbour, is one area planned for redevelopment. Formerly a marsh that was filled in to create industrial space, it was never intensely developed, its land unsuitable for large-scale development, because of flooding and unstable soil. It still contains numerous industrial uses, such as the Portlands Energy Centre power plant, some port facilities, some movie and TV production studios, a concrete processing facility and various low-density industrial facilities. The Waterfront Toronto agency has developed plans for a naturalized mouth to the Don River and to create a <b>flood</b> <b>barrier</b> around the Don, making more of the land on the harbour suitable for higher-value residential and commercial development. A former chemicals plant site along the Don River is slated to become a large commercial complex and transportation hub.|$|E
2500|$|The {{middle section}} of the Medway above Tonbridge, {{partly because of the}} various tributaries {{entering}} the river in this stretch — in particular the River Eden — has always been subject to extensive flooding. Tonbridge has suffered frequent flooding over the centuries – {{so much so that the}} higher part of the town to the north is called [...] "Dryhill". Flood protection measures have therefore been taken. In 1981, a <b>flood</b> <b>barrier</b> was constructed downstream from Leigh to protect Tonbridge, which had been severely affected by the flooding of 1968. During periods of high flow, the flow is controlled by impounding the water and allowing up to [...] of farmland upstream of the barrier to flood. However this did not prevent significant flooding in Tonbridge in winter 2013-14. However, in recent years the town of Yalding, about 12km downstream at the confluence with the River Beult, has been more famous for flooding than Tonbridge.|$|E
