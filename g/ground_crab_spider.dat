50|$|Thomisus is a genus of <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> (family Thomisidae) {{with almost}} 150 species described. The genus {{includes}} species that vary widely in their ecology, {{but the best}} known <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> are those species that people call the flower <b>crab</b> <b>spiders,</b> because they are ambush predators that feed on insects visiting flowers. The flower <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> are the species for which the popular name was coined, because of their crab-like motion and their way of holding their front legs in an attitude reminiscent of a crab spreading its claws as a threat.|$|R

40|$|Some <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> reflect UV-light, thereby {{creating}} a deceptive signal that attracts {{prey to the}} flowers that they sit on. We conducted a survey of several Australian and European species of <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> and found that UV-reflection is common in Australian species but absent from European species. Furthermore, honeybees are attracted to UV-reflecting Australian spiders while they are either indifferent to or repelled by European <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b> We {{do not know if}} UV-reflection evolved once or several times independently in <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> endemic to Australia or whether UV-reflective spiders arrived in Australia more recently. 14 page(s...|$|R

25|$|Misumena vatia is {{a species}} of <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> with holarctic distribution. In North America, where {{it is the largest}} and best-known flower spider, it is called the {{goldenrod}} <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> or flower (<b>crab)</b> <b>spider,</b> because it is commonly found hunting in goldenrod sprays in the autumn. Young males in the early summer may be quite small and easily overlooked, but females can grow up to 10mm (excluding legs); males reach 5mm at most.|$|R

50|$|For example, in the Thomisus spectabilis species, {{the method}} of {{camouflage}} {{is similar to the}} Misumena vatia except the Thomisus spectabilis blend in with their environment while being visible to their prey, but not their predators. This species of <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> are UV reflective while the flower is UV absorbing creating a contrast between the spider and flower {{through the eyes of the}} pollinator. The contrast created greatly attracts pollinators such as honeybees. This evolutionary method of camouflage increased the likelihood the <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> encountered prey, which in turn effects the fitness of the <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b> Due to the increased encounter rate of prey the spiders are able to focus energy on reproduction therefore leading to increased fitness in the spiders. The evolutionary method of camouflage greatly increases the survivability and fitness of <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceMimicry is used widely by {{arthropods}} {{to survive}} in a hostile environment. Often mimicry is associated with the production of chemical compounds such as pigments. In <b>crab</b> <b>spiders,</b> the change of color is based on a complex physiological process that still is not understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and quantify the ommochrome pigments and precursors responsible for the color change in the mimetic <b>crab</b> <b>spider</b> Misumena vatia (Thomisidae). A modified high performance reverse phase ion-pair chromatography technique enabled us to separate and quantify the ommochrome pigments, their precursors, and related metabolites in individual spiders. Compounds such as tryptophan, kynurenine, and kynurenic acid occurred only or mainly in white <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b> In contrast, compounds such as 3 -hydroxy-kynurenine, xanthommatin, and ommatin D occurred only or mainly in yellow <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b> Factor analysis ranked the different color forms in accordance with their metabolites. The biochemical results enabled us to associate the different phases of formation of pigment granules with specific metabolites. Yellow <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> contain many unknown ommochrome-like compounds not present in white <b>crab</b> <b>spiders.</b> We also found large quantities of decarboxylated xanthommatin, whose role as precursor of new pathways in ommochrome synthesis needs to be assessed. The catabolism of ommochromes, a process occurring when spiders revert from yellow to white, warrants further study...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of ultraviolet (UV) light by spiders {{has so far}} been only demonstrated in salticids. <b>Crab</b> <b>spiders</b> (Thomisidae) hunt mostly on flowers and need to find appropriate hunting sites. Previous studies have shown that some <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> that reflect UV light use UV contrast to enhance prey capture. The high UV contrast can be obtained either by modulation of body colouration or active selection of appropriate backgrounds for foraging. We show that <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> (Thomisus sp.) hunting on Spathiphyllum plants use chromatic contrast, especially UV contrast, to make themselves attractive to hymenopteran prey. Apart from that, they are able to achieve high UV contrast by active selection of non-UV reflecting surfaces when given a choice of UV-reflecting and non-UV reflecting surfaces in the absence of odour cues. Honeybees (Apis cerana) approached Spathiphyllum plants bearing <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> on which the spiders were high UV-contrast targets with greater frequency than those plants on which the UV-contrast of the spiders was low. Thus, <b>crab</b> <b>spiders</b> can perceive UV and may use it to choose appropriate backgrounds to enhance prey capture, by exploiting the attraction of prey such as honeybees to UV...|$|R
