40|$|We use Australian data to {{test the}} Conditional Capital Asset Pricing Model (<b>Jagannathan</b> <b>and</b> Wang, 1996). Our results are {{generally}} supportive: the model performs well compared {{with a number of}} competing asset pricing models. In contrast to the study by <b>Jagannathan</b> <b>and</b> Wang, however, we find that the inclusion of the market for human capital does not save the concept of the time-independent market beta (it remains insignificant). We find support for the role of a small-minus-big factor in pricing the cross-section of returns and find grounds to disagree with <b>Jagannathan</b> <b>and</b> Wang's argument that this factor proxies for misspecified market risk.

This measure is priced over all time periods covered in this study. In contrast {{to the view that}} {{the main part of the}} <b>Jagannathan</b> <b>and</b> Wang's model is the inclusion of human capital, however, we find that human capital remains insignificant in most tests. Our results revive the importance of beta instability risk in conditional CAPM of <b>Jagannathan</b> <b>and</b> Wang's model and suggest that the beta instability drives this model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Jagannathan</b> <b>and</b> Wang (1996) derive the {{asymptotic}} {{distribution of the}} Hansen-Jagannathan distance (HJ-distance) proposed by Hansen <b>and</b> <b>Jagannathan</b> (1997), <b>and</b> develop a specification test of asset pricing models based on the HJ-distance. While the HJ-distance has several desirable properties, Ahn and Gadarowski (2004) find that the specification test based on the HJ-distance overrejects correct models too severely in commonly used sample size to provide a valid test. This paper proposes to improve the finite sample properties of the HJ-distance test by applying the shrinkage method (Ledoit and Wolf, 2003) to compute its weighting matrix. The proposed method improves the finite sample performance of the HJ-distance test significantly.  This paper was accepted by Journal of Empirical Finance...|$|R
