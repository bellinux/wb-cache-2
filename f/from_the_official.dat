Three years later, at the 117th IOC Session, the first major programme revision was performed, which resulted in the exclusion of baseball and softball <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>official</b> programme of the 2012 London Games. Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports, the 2012 programme featured just 26 sports.
