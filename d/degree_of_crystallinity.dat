25|$|Pulp {{chemistry}} has {{a significant}} influence on nanocellulose microstructure. Carboxymethylation increases the numbers of charged groups on the fibril surfaces, making the fibrils easier to liberate and results in smaller and more uniform fibril widths (5–15nm) compared to enzymatically pre-treated nanocellulose, where the fibril widths were 10–30nm.

25|$|Polymers with a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> {{approaching}} zero or {{one will}} tend to be transparent, while polymers with intermediate degrees of crystallinity {{will tend to}} be opaque due to light scattering by crystalline or glassy regions.

25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be loosely {{described as}} crystalline if it contains regions of three-dimensional ordering on atomic (rather than macromolecular) length scales, usually arising from intramolecular folding and/or stacking of adjacent chains. Synthetic polymers may consist of both crystalline and amorphous regions; the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> may {{be expressed in}} terms of a weight fraction or volume fraction of crystalline material. Few synthetic polymers are entirely crystalline.|$|E
50|$|Low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> (0-20%) are {{associated}} with liquidlike-to-elastomeric properties.

40|$|The {{process of}} breccia {{formation}} by viscous sintering {{in the absence}} of pressure, advanced by Simonds (1973), is examined in detail. The limitations on the standard model for such sintering are considered. The competing process of crystallization is analyzed kinetically in terms of time-temperature-transformation curves corresponding to various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity.</b> The analysis is applied to Lunar Composition 15418 to illustrate the approach. The results indicate that close constraints can be placed on the thermal histories of lunar breccias, particularly breccias with modest <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity,</b> from microstructural observations and kinetic measurements...|$|R
30|$|Structural {{relationships}} between the amorphous regions and crystallites within the cow dung {{are responsible for the}} sharpness of the transition and the temperature at which each occurs.

25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{alleviate}} {{this is to}} use a copolymer. Comonomers such as CHDM or isophthalic acid lower the melting temperature and reduce the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> of PET (especially important when the material is used for bottle manufacturing). Thus, the resin can be plastically formed at lower temperatures and/or with lower force. This helps to prevent degradation, reducing the acetaldehyde content of the finished product to an acceptable (that is, unnoticeable) level. See copolymers, above. Another way to improve the stability of the polymer is to use stabilizers, mainly antioxidants such as phosphites. Recently, molecular level stabilization of the material using nanostructured chemicals has also been considered.|$|E

40|$|Poly(l-lactide) electrospun mats with {{random and}} aligned fiber {{orientation}} and films {{have been produced}} with <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> ranging from 0 up to nearly 50 %. The overall surface roughness is practically constant irrespective of the sampling areas (1 × 1 µm to 20 × 20 µm) for <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> below 30 %, increasing for higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> for the larger sampling areas. Further, due to fiber confinement, surface roughness variations are smaller in electrospun mats. Samples with 50 % <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> show the lowest osteoblast and the highest fibroblast proliferation. Therefore, it is verified that higher roughness promotes lower osteoblast but higher fibroblast proliferation. The overall results indicate the relevant role of the sub-microenvironment variations associated to the microscale roughness in determining the different cell responses.

For intermediate crystallinities two endothermic peaks assigned to enthalpy recovery could be detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on heating, indicating the existence of two distinct glass transition dynamics. The morphology at different length scales was characterized using WAXS, SAXS, and polarized light microscopy to correlate the DSC results to the microstructure. The low-temperature process {{was assigned to the}} bulklike glass transition whereas the high-temperature one was attributed to the restricted motions of the amorphous phase confined by the crystalline structures. The position and broadness of the two endotherms were found to be essentially independent of the spherulitic content of the samples.

5000|$|Crystallization of {{polymers}} is {{a process}} associated with partial alignment of their molecular chains.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, we {{investigate}} the Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) efficiency of methylene blue (MB) molecules deposited on gold nanostripes which, {{due to their}} fabrication by electron beam lithography and thermal evaporation, present various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallinity</b> and nanoscale surface roughness (NSR). By comparing gold nanostructures with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> roughness and <b>crystallinity,</b> we show that the NSR has a strong effect on the SERS intensity of MB probe molecules. In particular, the NSR features of the lithographic structures significantly enhance the Raman signal of MB molecules, even when the excitation wavelength lies far from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the stripes. These results are in very good agreement with numerical calculations of the SERS gain obtained using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The influence of NSR on the optical near-field response of lithographic structures thus appears crucial since they are widely used {{in the context of}} nano-optics or/and molecular sensing. I...|$|R
