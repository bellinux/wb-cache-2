40|$|Abstract. The {{number of}} {{applications}} based on the dc-link voltage source converter is in a continuous growth. Due {{to the fact that}} the power level increases more energy is stored in the dc-link. Even with an active protection, a high power IGBT still has a risk of exhibiting a violent rupture in the case of a fault. In order to avoid the rupture a possible solution is to use a <b>fuse</b> <b>protection</b> of the converter. From failure analysis of a three-phase inverter, a dc-link location for fuses might assure a protection against all faults. Experiments made with 400 A, 1200 V IGBT switches show that rupture can be avoided by the use of high-speed <b>fuse</b> <b>protection.</b> The problem of added inductance in existing High-Speed Fuses is discussed, and new IGBT Typower fuses in the dc-link circuit are treated. Finally, some considerations about current distribution in dc-link fuses and spectral analysis of these currents are discussed when high-frequency components are present in the current...|$|E

40|$|Current {{limiting}} fuses {{are widely}} used to protect the thyristors in DC drive systems. One very important problem is {{the choice of the}} correct voltage rating for fuses protecting regenerative DC drives, where many types of fault may occur, which makes <b>fuse</b> <b>protection</b> difficult. In the event of a commutation failure while regenerating, the fuses need to interrupt the loop supplied by the AC and DC voltages acting in series, which is the most difficult case for protection by fuses.

The effect of varying the motor time constant, supply impedance, number of fuses used to clear the fault and DC machine rating on the total transient response is studied.

40|$|When fuses are {{subjected}} to current pulses, cyclic stress is induced owing to temperature variations. Damage in the fuse elements is gradually accumulated and results in resistance increase. Consequently, current-time characteristics shift to effect early operation during the normal service period.

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Homogeneous {{excitation}} at field strengths {{as high as}} 9. 4 T {{is achieved}} by RF shimming approaches using parallel transmission through an array of independent RF coils. An actively detunable transmit array with 16 -elements arranged in two rows of 8 -elements each was built for this purpose[1]. Receive-only coil arrays constructed using close fitting helmets provide significant gain in SNR over volume coils[2]. In this work, we design a 31 -channel receive-only head array which operates {{in combination with the}} 16 -element transmit array[1]. Subjects and Methods: Experiments were performed on a Siemens 9. 4 T whole body MR scanner with a head gradient insert. 31 -receive elements were arranged in 4 rows on a tight fitting helmet. The top 2 rows have 10 -elements each and there were 7 -elements on the 3 rd row and 4 -elements on the 4 th row. 10 mm spacing was provided between the elements of the same row and they were decoupled inductively. The bottom row was rotated {{in such a way that}} it could be geometrically overlapped with 2 adjacent elements from the top row(Fig. 1). Even though our scanner is equipped with 32 -receive channels, an additional element was not added to one of the bottom 2 rows to preserve the left-right symmetry in the receive array. In addition to a <b>protection</b> <b>fuse,</b> the coil elements have 6 fixed and one variable capacitor. Low noise, small footprint preamplifiers (WanTcom Inc. USA) were installed on the coil. The coil is matched to 50 -Ohms using a tissue equivalent phantom. Cable traps were incorporated before and after the preamplifier and an additional trap was installed on each of the 8 -channel receive cable. Results: Unloaded-Q of a single isolated loop was 158. The coil is sample noise dominated and the QUL/QL was 10 or more depending on the distance to the load. Active detuning during transmit was better than - 33 dB. Maximum coupling measured in the loaded condition was - 12. 2 dB. The low impedance preamplifier provided - 21 dB of decoupling [3].

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{accomplish}} two goals. The {{first one is}} to investigate the sensitivity of MEMS to ESD stress events thereby answering the question how big a threat ESD is to the reliability of MEMS. ESD {{is one of the}} newer and less understood problems in MEMS technology, with little published literature at the start of this thesis work, as compared to better-studied issues like creep, fatigue, charging, stiction etc. This has motivated the largely experimental and exploratory work performed in the framework of this PhD. The work involved setting up test procedures and failure criteria for ESD testing in MEMS, measuring the sensitivity levels and understanding unique failure mechanisms in MEMS during ESD stress. The investigations are performed on two main electrostatically actuated MEMS test vehicles  the torsional micromirror and the capacitive RF MEMS switch, and a few other related test structures. The second objective is to propose solutions for better ESD reliability of MEMS. This has been achieved either by improving the intrinsic ESD robustness through better ESD-aware MEMS design or by implementing on-chip ESD protection strategies. Both CMOS and MEMS-based ESD protection solutions are explored in the context of both CMOS-integrated and stand-alone MEMS applications. A MEMS device can typically be subjected to ESD during many stages of its production like processing, assembly, packaging, shipping and handling, and even during normal operation. Unlike semiconductor ICs, MEMS have movable components separated by air-gaps. As a consequence, two effects can occur during an ESD event. The high voltage build-up across the air-gap during ESD might make the component move causing the air gap to reduce and eventually close. When the gap closes during the ESD event, breakdown and resulting thermal damage between the electrodes can occur, causing catastrophic failure of the MEMS. When the electrical contact remains open during the ESD event, air gap breakdown or field emission can occur causing charging of the device or even permanent damage. Which of these effects occur, depends a lot on the robustness/stiffness of the MEMS. The reliability threat of ESD is {{complicated by the fact that}} it is a randomly occurring event. Therefore to study the reliability threat under ESD stress in MEMS, standard test models which simulate real-life ESD events such as the Human Body Model (HBM) were performed at the wafer level on poly-SiGe micromirrors and Al-alloy capacitive RF MEMS switches to measure their ESD sensitivity. The voltage during the ESD event was used to monitor failure, because of the high impedance of the capacitive MEMS devices. Based on these electrical measurements which detect a change in the device resistance during failure, the micromirrors and the switches were classified as extremely ESD-sensitive Class 0 devices with a failure level < 250 V. All these test devices suffered catastrophic damage upon failure. However, since MEMS are designed for different non-electrical functionalities, such as optical, mechanical, motion-based, chemical, thermal etc, the correct point of failure can be determined only by comparing their functionality measurements before and after ESD stress. It was noticed through measurements that RF MEMS switches often suffered functional failure at ESD stress levels lower than the catastrophic failure level detected electrically. It is therefore mandatory that functionality tests on MEMS be performed during and after ESD to conclusively detect failure. Customized test setups were built for this purpose by integrating a portable probe-mountable HBM ESD tester with a Laser Doppler vibrometer for out-of-plane motion measurements. Simultaneous measurements of out-of-plane displacement, current and voltage in the MEMS DUT were performed in-situ during ESD stress using this setup which enabled improved failure detection and deeper understanding of the failure mechanisms in MEMS during ESD. The test setup was also used together with a pressure controlled vacuum chamber to study the effect of pressure on the ESD sensitivity, which is of importance when testing for example resonators which have to function in vacuum. The ESD reliability of capacitive MEMS switches was found to be worse in vacuum than at atmospheric pressure. Having explored the ESD sensitivity and failure mechanisms in MEMS in the first part of the PhD as described above, the focus of the second part was on improving ESD robustness and implementing ESD protection for these devices. It is shown that the intrinsic ESD robustness of MEMS can be improved by varying design parameters to increase their mechanical stiffness since a direct correlation was found between the mechanical robustness of the MEMS, the pull-in voltage and the ESD failure level. The new structures showed a 200 % increase in ESD robustness for micromirrors and a much larger improvement for the RF MEMS switches with intrinsic HBM robustness of up to 650 V. However, this comes at the expense of an increased pull-in voltage which is undesired in most applications. Commonly implemented customer requirements in industry require at least 2 kV HBM robustness for the shipped product in the case of consumer applications. For MEMS integrated in a CMOS chip or package to survive this high level of ESD stress, design improvements alone as described above are insufficient. ESD protection is therefore essential if the MEMS are to enter the market in a commercial application. Designing ESD protection or adapting from conventional CMOS ESD protection structures is challenging, because MEMS operate at high voltages and in both voltage polarities, have unique packaging and processing requirements and impose severe area and cost constraints on the ESD protection designer. To demonstrate the concept, ESD protection was implemented on a MEMS-on-CMOS process by adapting the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR), commonly used for ESD protection in CMOS devices, to a high trigger voltage and connected in parallel with a MEMS switch. The fabricated device improved the MEMS ESD robustness from 140 V (Class 0) to 5 kV. Other advanced bi-directional ESD protection devices with high turn-on voltages may be used in a similar manner in the future taking advantage of slower turn-on time requirements for MEMS and lower area constraints. In a pioneering concept, small torsional devices with fast response time to ESD stress and pre-defined trigger voltages were designed and developed as on-chip MEMS-based one-time ESD <b>protection</b> <b>fuses.</b> The purpose of these devices is to provide a MEMS process-compatible basic level ESD protection for stand-alone MEMS devices during handling between manufacturing and assembly into an electronic circuit. However, MEMS-based ESD protection to be used in standalone MEMS applications made entirely on a MEMS processing platform needs further development in order to compete with the ESD protection levels offered by CMOS devices. In conclusion, the ESD reliability threat in MEMS devices is real but can surely be overcome by a combination of smart design and processing, good choice of materials and a better understanding of failure mechanisms. The magnitude of the ESD challenge is more significant and exciting in the context of newer and smaller MEMS applications with increasing functionalities in the future. nrpages: 274 status: publishe...|$|R
