In this study {{the potential of}} material recovery to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was assessed. The study was divided into two phases. In the first phase the material recovery concepts used in Finland were identified and approximate greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> calculations were conducted {{for some of the}} concepts. In the second phase two promising concepts were chosen as case studies for a more detailed assessment, both of which are documented in detail in this report. In the first concept plastic waste is reprocessed into plastic profiles and in the second waste textile is reprocessed into oil absorbent mats. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) methodology was used for calculating the greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>savings.</b> The <b>emission</b> <b>saving</b> potential was assessed by comparing the emissions from the product made of recycled material with the emissions from the lifecycle of a reference product. The reference product is made for the same application of use but manufactured from virgin raw material. Impregnated wood was chosen as the reference product for the plastic profile and oil absorbent mat made from virgin polypropylene fibre was used as the reference product for the oil absorbent mat made from textile waste. When assessing the overall greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> from material recovery, only comparing the emissions from the recycled and the reference product lifecycles is insufficient. Thus, the emissions avoided by material and energy recovery were also included in the calculations. The results show that the greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of material recycling is highly case-specific and <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> can not always be obtained. In this study recovery of textile waste showed the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, plastic waste recycling only generates greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> under certain conditions. The emission reduction potential greatly depends on the reference product chosen. This study concentrated solely on greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|This thesis uses a computable general {{equilibrium}} {{model to}} evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions consequences of the United States’ Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate for corn based ethanol. The RFS can reduce emissions if the potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings,</b> that result as ethanol displaces gasoline, are greater than the resulting carbon leakage, which occurs because markets and sectors adjust to the increased consumption of ethanol or the decreased US consumption of gasoline. The general equilibrium framework allows {{for the impact of}} the expanded RFS on behavior in each of the major US sectors (transportation, fuel production and agriculture) and international markets (crude oil and land) to be measured and mapped to greenhouse gas emissions. Estimating emissions in the general equilibrium framework differs from previous studies that estimate the carbon leakage from ethanol consumption. In contrast to studies that rely on world agricultural models (Searchinger et al. (2008); Tokgoz et al. (2008)), this framework is able to capture the impact of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) on the domestic market for blended fuel, and the international crude oil market. Compared to lifecycle analysis (Farrell et al. (2006); Hill et al. (2006)), which links sectors using fixed behavioral relationships that are based on the flow of material and energy, the general equilibrium framework is able to incorporate both behavioral adjustments and emissions from sectors that do not necessarily fall in the standard lifecycle boundaries. We find that the Renewable Fuel Standard mandate directly reduces gasoline consumption by 0. 6 % and 2. 5 % relative to baseline levels in 2009 and 2015 respectively. These reductions lead to potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> of 6. 5 TgCO 2 e (roughly 0. 1 % of total US emissions) in 2009 and 26. 32 TgCO 2 e (0. 5 % of total US emissions) in 2015. These savings are very small because we project the baseline consumption of ethanol to increase to levels close to mandated levels had the RFS not been implemented. We also find that these potential savings are totally offset by carbon leakage in other markets. In 2009, approximately 50 % of the potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> is offset by domestic leakage. The main sources of leakage domestically are the expansion of ethanol production, which offsets 21 % of potential savings, and the expansion and intensification of the agricultural sector, which offsets 22 % of potential savings. A smaller leakage, 6 % of potential savings, occurs in the domestic fuel market because the price of blended fuel falls in response to the RFS. In 2015, the domestic leakages are smaller and offset 40 % of potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings.</b> The main sources of leakage are again fuel production and domestic agriculture, which offset 21 % and 22 % of potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings.</b> However, we find that the price of blended fuel increases in response to the mandate leading to addition <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> of 1 % in domestic fuel markets. Internationally, the magnitudes of the leakages are substantially larger. As the RFS depresses the world price of crude oil, the consumption of crude oil increases and results in a leakage that offsets 168 % of potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> in 2009 and 257 % of the potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> in 2015. In addition, the RFS reduces US crop exports and causes a small expansion of world agricultural production on to previously uncultivated land. The carbon emitted {{as a result of this}} expansion is at least 1800 % greater than the potential <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> of the Renewable Fuel Standard for each year between 2009 and 2015. We also find that our estimation of the emissions consequences of the RFS deviate from the results of standard lifecycle analysis (LCA) because of contrasting behavioral assumptions. Compared to our general equilibrium analysis, standard LCA methods estimate similar reductions in transportation emissions and similar increases in fuel production emissions. Incorporating behavioral adjustments in these two sectors leads to projected <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> that are 15 % below LCA estimates in 2009 and 1 % higher than LCA estimates in 2015. We also find that compared to our general equilibrium analysis, LCA overestimates the increase in corn production due to the RFS, which leads to an underestimate of total <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> of close to 25 %. However, by not incorporating the expansion of cropland on to CRP, LCA overestimates <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> by a similar percentage (approximately 27 %). Finally, we find that the assumption in most LCA analyses, that the use of ethanol has no impact on international crude oil or land markets, will cause LCA to overestimate <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> relative to the general equilibrium estimates by more than 285 % and 3000 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|We show {{carbon leakage}} {{depends on the}} type of biofuel policy (tax credit versus mandate), the {{domestic}} and foreign gasoline supply and fuel demand elasticities, and on consumption and production shares of world oil markets for the country introducing the biofuel policy. The components of carbon leakage – market leakage and <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> – are counteracting: carbon leakage increases with market leakage but decreases with <b>emissions</b> <b>savings.</b> We also distinguish domestic and international leakage where the latter is always positive, but domestic leakage can be negative with a mandate. The IPCC definition of leakage omits domestic leakage, resulting in biased estimates. Leakage with a tax credit always exceeds that of a mandate, while the combination of a mandate and tax credit generates lower leakage than a tax credit alone. In general, a gallon of ethanol (energy equivalent) is found to replace 35 percent of a gallon of gasoline – not 100 percent as assumed by life-cycle accounting. This means ethanol emits 13 percent more carbon than a gallon of gasoline if indirect land use change (iLUC) is not included in the estimated <b>emissions</b> <b>savings</b> effect and 43 percent more when iLUC is included. biofuels, tax credit, mandate, market leakage, carbon leakage, <b>emissions</b> <b>savings,</b> domestic leakage, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 27, Q 41, Q 42, Q 54,...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to estimate biomethane market potential by analysing biogas markets and their relative environmental and economic advantages. This potential is then combined with greenhouse gas emission values for different feedstock shares (farm-fed and waste-fed systems) and different application share to determine the possible contribution of biomethane to national greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>saving</b> goals. Markets that are considered are Germany and the UK being the biggest emitters of CO 2 eq in the European Union. The current use was compared with the scenarios (i) market projection, derived from literature study and (ii) reasonable potential, derived from environmental and economic calculations. The current market status is presented to show the past market development until the present date and associated greenhouse gas savings. Additionally the potential of biomethane to contribute to greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> is extensively described. Results indicate that the share of application in Germany is more environmental beneficial than the one in the UK achieving higher greenhouse gas savings at comparable feed-in level. In contrast, the UK has a higher share of waste-fed systems to produce biomethane. The use of biomethane in CHP plants achieves the highest GHG <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> and if organic waste is used as feedstock the possible savings are even higher. With an increase of biomethane used in CHP plants and a decrease of biomethane used for direct heating the savings in the UK could increase up to 52 %. Current savings of 2446 ktCO 2 eq (Germany) and 606 ktCO 2 eq (UK) can be extended to 4483 ktCO 2 eq (Germany) and 1443 ktCO 2 eq (UK) respectively. Scenario results were determined based on the environmental and economic advantageousness development of the existing biogas market. In this way positive future market development as well as improved shares of feedstock and application can contribute to further greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>savings</b> of Germany and the UK...|$|R
