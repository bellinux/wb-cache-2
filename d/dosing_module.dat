40|$|A {{new concept}} for miniaturised {{analysis}} systems, {{based on a}} modular assembly of silicon system components on a anodically bonded base plate containing fluid channels, is presented The proposed configuration allows the separate development of the different system elements {{as well as an}} easy modification of the system setup. Besides micropumps and flow-sensors, for detection, different ISFET-based chemical sensors for cations are presented. Using covalent attachment of all membrane components to the polymer matrix, a durable CHEMFET system is obtained.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, fabrication, testing, {{and analysis of}} a disposable drug delivery reservoir single <b>dose</b> <b>module</b> that can be inserted into a miniature drug delivery system. Designed to deliver drugs, such as insulin, via subcutaneous delivery, this miniaturized assembly is primarily intended to increase diabetes patient compliance by offering a more conveniently sized and semi-autonomous apparatus. The materials of silicon, Sylgard 184 PDMS-based elastomer, acrylic, and Kapton HN polyimide were chosen as the fabrication materials based on their mechanical and biomechanical properties, as well as availability. ^ Drug delivery reservoirs have been successfully designed, fabricated, and tested. Reservoirs have been evaluated for their fluid retention and fluid extraction performance when stored {{for up to three}} weeks at 4, 21, and 37 degrees C. Diffusion coefficients though the silicone membrane have been calculated from the fluid retention data and suggest a strong temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient, but minimal membrane stress and internal pressure dependence. Experimentally measured diffusion coefficients, deformed membrane geometry, and internal pressure have been compared with theoretically calculated, published, and simulated results and show good agreement. This, therefore, demonstrates first proof-of-concept for the proposed reservoir and lays the foundation for future studies focused on optimization of reservoir materials and geometry for reliability and manufacturability, as well as validation of reservoir functionality and performance using physiologically-relevant drug solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results achieved in the joint research project {{in the field of}} modelling of radioactive releases and their propagation through the living environment. Various pathways of radionuclide transport to human body are taken into account including local, regional or national specific features of the problem. Primary concern is given to localisation of atmospheric, hydrological and food-chain and <b>dose</b> <b>modules</b> of European decision support system RODOS. Main endpoint is to achieve harmonisation of the off-site nuclear emergency management methodology with EU conventions and integration of the Czech Republic within international cooperation. Status of customisation of the RODOS system is shortly described with accent on online connection with meteorological data. At the same time additional research results being in progress in IITA are presented, which are focused on special particular scenarios having character of “worst cases ” when looking from view of radiological burden of population. 1 Customisation of RODOS system for its use in nuclear emergency management in CR Reliability of predictions depends both on sophisticated algorithms of mathematical modelling and on relevant input data, which has to reflect all local-specific features. The RODOS system demands large amount of local input data for modelling of radioactive releases into atmosphere and hydrosphere with successive propagation of radioactivity through food-chain pathway in direction to human body. It concerns model parameters, geographical information, radiological and meteorological online data and various environmental characteristics. The customisation activities are running under cooperation o...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new fast {{radiotherapy}} planning algorithm which determines approximatively optimal gantry and table angles, kinds of wedges, leaf positions and intensities simultaneously {{in a global}} way. Other parameters are optimized only independently of each other. The algorithm uses an elaborate field management and field reduction. Beam intensities are determined via a variant of a projected Newton method of Bertsekas. The objective function is a standard piecewise quadratic penalty function, but it is built with efficient upper bounds which are calculated during the optimization process. Instead of pencil beams, basic leaf positions are included. The algorithm is implemented in the new beam modelling and <b>dose</b> optimization <b>module</b> Homo OptiS. ...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{electron}} beam dose calculation models for radiation treatment planning systems require {{the input of}} a phase space beam model to configure a clinical {{electron beam}} in a computer. This beam model is a distribution in position, energy, and direction of electrons and photons in a plane {{in front of the}} patient. The phase space beam model can be determined by Monte Carlo simulation of the treatment head or from a limited set of measurements. In the latter case, parameters of the electron phase space beam model are obtained by fitting measured to calculated dosimetric data. In the present work, data for air fluence profiles and water depth doses have been presented for electron beams without an applicator for a medical linear accelerator. These data are used to parameterize the electron phase space beam model to a Monte Carlo <b>dose</b> calculation <b>module</b> available in the first commercial (MDS Nordion, now Nucletron) Monte Carlo treatment planning for electron beams...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{biological}} dosimetry is {{the calculation of}} the dose {{and the range of}} uncertainty to which an accident victim was exposed. This process requires the use of the maximum likelihood method for the proper fitting of an in vitro calibration curve, a procedure which is not implemented in popular, commercially available statistical computer programs. Several laboratories have produced their own curve fitting programs for internal use but these are frequently not user-friendly and not available to outside users. Consequently, a new freely available computer program for fitting a linear-quadratic dose-response relationship by the method of maximum-likelihood and estimating a dose from the number of aberrations observed has been developed by the authors. The program, called CABAS, consists of (i) the main curve-fitting and <b>dose</b> estimating <b>module,</b> (ii) a module for calculating the dose in cases of partial body exposure, (iii) a module for estimating the minimum number of cells necessary to detect a given dose of radiation, and (iv) a module for calculating the dose {{in the case of a}} fractionated or protracted exposure.

40|$|Abstract Background The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the effectiveness of integrating the use of cell-phones into a routine malaria prevention and control programme, to improve the management of malaria cases among an under-served population in a border area. The module for disease and treatment monitoring of malaria (DTMM) consisted of case investigation and case follow-up for treatment compliance and patients' symptoms. Methods The module combining web-based and mobile technologies was developed as a proof of concept, in an attempt to replace the existing manual, paper-based activities that malaria staff used in treating and caring for malaria patients in the villages for which they were responsible. After a patient was detected and registered onto the system, case-investigation and treatment details were recorded into the malaria database. A follow-up schedule was generated, and the patient's status was updated when the malaria staff conducted their routine home visits, using mobile phones loaded with the follow-up application module. The module also generated text and graph messages for a summary of malaria cases and basic statistics, and automatically fed to predetermined malaria personnel for situation analysis. Following standard public-health practices, access to the patient database was strictly limited to authorized personnel in charge of patient case management. Results The DTMM module was developed and implemented at the trial site in late November 2008, and was fully functioning in 2009. The system captured 534 malaria patients in 2009. Compared to paper-based data in 2004 - 2008, the mobile-phone-based case follow-up rates by malaria staff improved significantly. The follow-up rates for both Thai and migrant patients were about 94 - 99 % on Day 7 (Plasmodium falciparum) and Day 14 (Plasmodium vivax) and maintained at 84 - 93 % on Day 90. Adherence to anti-malarial drug therapy, based on self-reporting, showed high completion rate for P. falciparum -infected cases, but lower rate for P. vivax cases. Patients' symptoms were captured onto the mobile phone during each follow-up visit, either during the home visit or at Malaria Clinic; most patients had headache, muscle pain, and fatigue, and some had fever within the first follow-up day (day 7 / 14) after the first anti-malarial drug <b>dose.</b> Conclusions The <b>module</b> was successfully integrated and functioned as part of the malaria prevention and control programme. Despite the bias inherent in sensitizing malaria workers to perform active case follow-up using the mobile device, the study proved for its feasibility and the extent to which community healthcare personnel in the low resource settings could potentially utilize it efficiently to perform routine duties, even in remote areas. The DTMM has been modified and is currently functioning in seven provinces in a project supported by the WHO and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to contain multi-drug resistant malaria on the Thai-Cambodian border. </p...|$|R
