40|$|Varying {{with the}} heating rate of rapid thermal {{annealing}} (RTA), room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) could be observed in the 31016 cm- 2 Si+-implanted 400 -nm-thick SiO 2 films after RTA at 1150 oC in dry nitrogen and the respective PL peak was located in the range between blue band to near-infrared band. At the heating rate of 100 oC/s, the PL peaks was shifted from 2. 6 eV to 1. 7 eV <b>for</b> <b>the</b> isothermal RTA <b>durations</b> from 5 seconds to 20 seconds and no obvious shift was further found since <b>the</b> RTA <b>duration</b> of 20 seconds. However, after the heating rate was decreasing to 25 oC/s, no significant shift of PL peak {{could be seen in}} the films after <b>the</b> isothermal RTA <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> ≥ 1 second. Like the shift of PL peak, the average rate of the FTIR peak change at ~ 1100 cm- 1, reflecting the repaired condition of SiO 2 structure, from the as-implanted films after RTA <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> ≤ 20 seconds were quicker than those <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> ≥ 20 seconds at the heating rate of 100 oC/s, and near a constant <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RTA <b>durations</b> ≥ 1 second at that of 25 oC/s. The above PL and FTIR phenomena should be attributed to the Si+ re-crystals and the improvement of the broken structure in the RTA-treated as-implanted SiO 2 films In comparison with the isothermal conventional thermal annealing method, the RTA method saves vast dosages of Si+-implantation, thermal budget an...|$|R

40|$|We study {{correlations}} between various hardness ratios of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and investigate {{if there are}} any differences between the two classes of the objects in the distributions of the ratios. The study shows that: (1) almost all hardness ratios of GRBs are mutually correlated; (2) the most obvious correlation <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> short and long duration classes is that between log HR 41 and log HR 42, where HRij is the fluence in channel i divided by the fluence in channel j; (3) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short <b>duration</b> class, log HR 21 and log HR 32 as well as log HR 31 and log HR 43 are not correlated, while <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long <b>duration</b> class, log HR 21 and log HR 42 as well as log HR 21 and log HR 43 are not correlated; (4) those most significant correlations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long <b>duration</b> class are more obvious than that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short <b>duration</b> class; (5) <b>the</b> data of hardness ratios <b>for</b> <b>the</b> long <b>duration</b> class are more concentrated, while that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> short <b>duration</b> class are more scattered; (6) the sources of the two classes are distributed in different areas in the hardness ratio—hardness ratio plot. These results suggest that, statistically, the slope of the higher part of the spectrum of <b>the</b> long <b>duration</b> bursts {{has nothing to do with}} that of the lower part; emissions at higher energy bands from the bursts of both short and long duration classes must be significantly different fo...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{real-time}} dependable systems {{is dominated by}} the need to meet real-time deadlines. In this paper we present a methodology for analyzing durations in real-time dependable systems and <b>for</b> estimating <b>the</b> probabilities that real-time deadlines will be met. The probability density functions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> of composite operations are obtained by convolving the probability density functions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>durations</b> of simpler operations. These probability density functions may be correlated, and such correlations must be handled correctly when the convolutions are performed. Example applications of the methodology are given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Totem multicast group communication protocols. Keywords: Real-time, dependable, probability density function. 1 Introduction Traditionally, real-time systems have been defined by requirements that specific events, typically input or output operations, must occur at or before precisely defined moments in time [2, 4, 7, 8, 17, 18, 19, 21].
