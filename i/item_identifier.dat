We will compare pilot test data to data from a single, later time point using three sets of candidates: 10, 000 US-educated first time test takers, 10, 000 non-US educated first time test takers, and 10, 000 non first time test takers. <b>Item</b> responses, <b>item</b> <b>identifiers,</b> final score, and item {{response times}} will be needed for each candidate.

The smaller the collector current, the larger is the positive differential temperature coefficient. At high current levels, the current gain dependence on temperature is significantly reduced.

40|$|In {{the past}} years, {{there have been}} several {{improvements}} in lossless image compression. All the recently proposed state-of-the-art lossless Image compressors can be roughly divided into two categories: single and double-pass compressors. Linear prediction is rarely used in the first category, while TMW [7], a state-of-the-art double-pass image compressor, relies on linear prediction for its performance. We propose a single-pass adaptive algorithm that uses context classification and multiple linear predictors, locally optimized on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Locality is also exploited in the entropy coding of the prediction error. The results we obtained on a test set of several standard images are encouraging.

40|$|A {{new theory}} is {{developed}} {{in this paper}} to explain the collapse of current gain in multifinger power AlGaAs/GaAs Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBT's). The reasons behind this unwanted phenomenon are fully clarified using a simple model to investigate the thermoelectrical interaction between the fingers. The existence of multivalue equilibrium points in model's constitutive equations is shown to be the necessary condition for the collapse of current gain to appear. For a N finger device,Y different patterns of collapse exist. The criterion to select the global stable pattern is given. The method {{has been used to}} predict the collapse in AlGaAs/GaAs HBT's and the agreement is excellent. The method also predicts that the collapse can happen far earlier than is normally expected in multifinger highpower devices.

40|$|Abstract—Identifier-locator {{separation}} is a mechanism {{that has been}} used successfully to support fine-grain object mobility and persistence. Support for legacy identification systems is seen as critical for the rapid adoption of the IoT. Thus, network-based identifier resolution and meta-data discovery services are already widely {{recognized as one of the}} core ingredients of the IoT architecture. This paper introduces a secure and scalable approach for the provision of such services derived as an application of the Handle System, which is extended with the components required for ID/Locator resolution on the IoT. This scheme is applicable to practically any IoT-based ID/Locator specification incorporating those established for different flavors of RFID and wireless sensor networks, and supersedes previous proposals such as the Object Naming and the OID Resolution Service. To highlight its advantages, we deploy our scheme to the long-standing artifact identification scheme specified under ISO/IEC 9834. In particular, we introduce a mapping for embedding OID Unique <b>Item</b> <b>Identifiers</b> in the Handle address space; several new HDL data-types defined so as to address common information provision needs in this context; and outline operational and use considerations. We conclude that the approach proposed here supports object mobility, fine-grain security compatible with international IoT requirements, especially with regards to governance, and multiple domains of control at the item level combined with superior scalability both with regard to identifier address space and system size.

40|$|Abstract—On {{a stream}} of two {{dimensional}} data items (x, y) where x is an <b>item</b> <b>identifier,</b> and y is a numerical attribute, a correlated aggregate query requires us to first apply a selection predicate along the second (y) dimension, followed by an aggregation along the first (x) dimension. For selection predicates of the form (y c), where parameter c is provided at query time, we present new streaming algorithms and lower bounds for estimating statistics of the resulting substream of elements that satisfy the predicate. We provide the first sublinear space algorithms for a large family of statistics in this model, including frequency moments. We experimentally validate our algorithms, showing that their memory requirements are significantly smaller than existing linear storage schemes for large datasets, while simultaneously achieving fast per-record processing time. We also study the problem when the items have weights. Allowing negative weights allows for analyzing values which occur in the symmetric difference of two datasets. We give a strong space lower bound which holds even if the algorithm is allowed up to a logarithmic number of passes over the data (before the query is presented). We complement this with a small space algorithm which uses a logarithmic number of passes. I...|$|E

When s receives a read command for x from c, it returns the current value of x (or the most up-to-date value if the database is multiversion) and its corresponding version. Write commands are locally stored by c. It is only during transaction termination that updates are propagated to the servers.|$|R

Also, when the items are frequently updated, the traditional way of counting support in sequential pattern mining may lead to incorrect (or, at least incomplete), conclusions. For example, if we are looking for the support of the sequence A.

Therefore, accounting for them would underestimate the support of the sequence A. B. The problem gets more involved if we are interested in categorical sequential patterns. In light of the above, in this paper we propose to revise the classic notion of support in sequential pattern mining, introducing the concept of temporal support of regular expressions, intuitively defined as the number of sequences satisfying a target pattern, out {{of the total number of}} sequences that could have possibly matched such pattern, where the pattern is defined as a RE over complex items (i. e., not only <b>item</b> <b>identifiers,</b> but also attributes and functions). ...|$|R
