25|$|The Tiger can {{be fitted}} with various armaments {{including}} rockets, cannons, {{and a range}} of air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, controlled via a dedicated weapons control computer. Munitions for anti-ground warfare include the nose-mounted 30mm Nexter turret; an assortment of <b>external</b> <b>gun</b> pods, anti-tank missiles, and up to four launchers for 70mm and 68mm rockets can be mounted on the Tiger's stub wings. When deploying missiles such as the Mistral, the Tiger is capable of taking advantage of the munition's off-boresight capabilities. A guided 70mm rocket will be developed for the Tiger based on the Roketsan Cirit.|$|E
500|$|The castle {{comprised}} a tall, square keep {{made from}} stone, with a semi-circular gun platform on the seaward side, {{protected by a}} [...] moat and a wooden breakwater; {{it would have been}} similar in design to the contemporary fortification of West Cowes Castle. A survey in 1559 reported that the castle was heavily armed, with its artillery comprising two iron culverins, an iron demi-culverin, two iron sakers, two bases, an iron falcon, an iron falconet and a quarter sling. The lighter guns would probably have been placed {{on the roof of the}} keep, with two heavy weapons lower down and the remainder on the <b>external</b> <b>gun</b> platform. It also held handguns, bows and hand weapons for close defence.|$|E
5000|$|Strf 9040A: Strf 9040 {{upgraded}} {{with extensive}} chassis modifications and <b>external</b> <b>gun</b> stabilisation on turret front. More storage and better emergency exits reduced the seats to {{seven in the}} troop compartment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>External</b> mixing <b>guns</b> have {{a nozzle}} {{spraying}} {{water as a}} stream and air nozzles shooting air through this water stream to break it up into much smaller water particles. These guns are sometimes equipped {{with a set of}} internal mixing nozzles that are known as nucleators. These help create a nucleus for the water droplets to bond to as they freeze. <b>External</b> mixing <b>guns</b> are typically tower guns and rely on a longer hang time to freeze the snow. This allows them to use much less air. <b>External</b> mixing <b>guns</b> are usually reliant on high water pressure to operate correctly so the water supply is opened completely, though in some the flow can be regulated by valves on the gun.|$|R
5000|$|The attack version A 21R added 14.5 cm attack rockets {{placed under}} the middle wing. Furthermore, an {{alternative}} <b>external</b> machine <b>gun</b> pod was created. A big sensation {{was that it was}} possible to fire all 13 weapons at the same time. This was an interesting [...] "sensation" [...] for the pilot as well.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, <b>external</b> flash <b>guns</b> have {{integrated}} autofocus assist lamps that {{replace the}} stroboscopic on-camera flash. Another way to assist contrast based AF systems in low light is to beam a laser pattern {{on to the}} subject. The laser method is commercially called Hologram AF Laser and was used in Sony Cybershot cameras around the year 2003, including Sony's F707, F717 and F828 models.|$|R

50|$|The M2HB {{has been}} in service with the Israel Defense Forces since its {{establishment}} and has served in all of Israel's wars, operations and conflicts. In 2012 the IDF upgraded its M2HB machine guns to the M2HQCB model, with heavy quick change barrel. Today the M2 serves as an infantry crew-served heavy machine gun, as a remote-controlled <b>external</b> coaxial <b>gun</b> on Merkava main battle tanks, as the main weapon on the Samson RCWS and as a secondary weapons on Israeli Sea Corps gunboats and missile boats.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the work}} carried out on the {{submarines}} was underpinned by results of measurements made using Tradewind, which had been modified in July 1945 - September 1946 to become an acoustic trials submarine, with <b>external</b> tubes and <b>guns</b> removed, the bridge faired, the hull streamlined and some internal torpedo tubes blanked over.|$|R
5000|$|The GAU-22/A is {{the latest}} {{application}} of the GAU-12/U, which is a four-barrel version designed for use on the F-35 Lightning II. [...] The CTOL version of the aircraft will carry the gun internally, while the STOVL and CV versions {{use it as an}} <b>external</b> podded <b>gun.</b> The GAU-22/A's major difference is the use of four barrels, rather than the five barrels on the GAU-12/U. The GAU-22/A is lighter, has a reduced rate of fire of 3,300 rounds per minute and an improved accuracy of 1.4 milliradians as compared to the GAU-12. [...] This system is undergoing intensive testing and qualification. The weapon is currently produced by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems.|$|R
50|$|The GAU-18/A, is a {{lightweight}} {{variant of the}} M2/M3, and is used on the USAF's MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons do not use the M2HB barrel, and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pavehawks that use the EGMS (<b>External</b> <b>Gun</b> Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right hand charge but vary between left and right hand feed depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A feed chute adapter {{is attached to the}} left or right hand feed pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a feed chute system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.|$|E
5000|$|The HACS {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1920s and began to appear on RN ships in January 1930, when HACS I went to sea in [...] HACS I {{did not have any}} stabilization or power assist for director training. HACS III which appeared in 1935, had provision for stabilization, was hydraulically driven, featured much improved data transmission and it introduced the HACS III Table. The HACS III table (computer) had numerous improvements including raising maximum target speed to 350 knots, continuous automatic fuze prediction, improved geometry in the deflection Screen, and provisions for gyro inputs to provide stabilization of data received from the director. The HACS was a control system and was made possible by an effective data transmission network between an <b>external</b> <b>gun</b> director, a below decks fire control computer, and the ship's medium calibre AA guns.|$|E
50|$|Mentor to the Seven Guns and {{designer}} of the <b>external</b> <b>gun</b> attachment that the group utilised in their crime-fighting. The team witnessed Frank's apparent death {{at the hands of}} crooked cops years earlier. However, John Horus' actions have brought Frank out of hiding. Struck by the danger the team could pose, he had faked his own death to work on countermeasures for the government. He is convinced he is saving the world from them. In the intervening years, he has improved upon the technology within the Seven Guns and assembled both operational and covert-ops tactical teams of new model gun soldiers, the latter in secret. Assigning a soldier to kill Tom, he comes along personally to apologise for the necessity of the killing, and for the unintended murder, during an earlier attempted hit on Tom, of Laura Tarrant for whom Frank had felt sincere fondness.|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{upgrading}} present {{heavy particle}} accelerators {{has led to}} study of EBIS as a possible source of high Z ions, e. g,, Ar{sup + 18 }. The present work has been motivated primarily by the results reported by CRYEBIS, which indicate that a space charge neutralized, <b>external</b> electron <b>gun</b> can achieve current densities of 10 {sup 5 } A/cm{sup 2 }. Scaling relationships are developed {{as a basis for}} understanding CRYEBIS operation. The relevance of collective effects to beam equilibrium and stability is pointed out, Single electron impact ionization scaling and beam neutralization scaling indicate that higher beam voltage may be the easiest way of increasing both ionization rate and particle intensity. Consideration of radial ion confinement suggests that beam collapse to high current density {{may be related to the}} highest charge state which is energetically accessible...|$|R
50|$|Internal {{armament}} {{consists of}} a gun mount installed on the chin of the aircraft (likely to be of 30mm calibre). Two stub wings provide attachment points for <b>external</b> ordnance or <b>gun</b> pods. The guns are mounted either in the chain gun form, or in the turret. All guns on the Z-10 can be used either against ground targets or aerial targets, and can be directly aimed by pilots’ HMS. In the turret form, automatic grenade launcher can also be housed next to the machine gun in the same turret.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for positioning {{and holding}} material specimens {{is a major}} subsystem of a system for impact testing of the specimens at temperatures up to 1, 500 C. This apparatus {{and the rest of}} the system are designed especially for hot impact testing of advanced ceramics, composites, and coating materials. The apparatus includes a retaining fixture on a rotating stage on a vertically movable cross support driven by a linear actuator. These components are located below a furnace wherein the hot impact tests are performed (see Figure 1). In preparation for a test, a specimen is mounted on the retaining fixture, then the cross support is moved upward to raise the specimen, through an opening in the bottom of the furnace, to the test position inside the furnace. On one side of the furnace there is another, relatively small opening on a direct line to the specimen. Once the specimen has become heated to the test temperature, the test is performed by using an instrumented <b>external</b> pressurized-gas-driven <b>gun</b> to shoot a projectile through the side opening at the specimen...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{injection}} of additional electrons from an <b>external</b> electron <b>gun</b> into the plasma of a Penning ionization gauge (PIG) ion source, a test bench for the external electron-beam enhancement of the PIG (E-PIG) ion source was set up. A source magnet assembly {{was built to}} satisfy the request for magnetic field configuration of the E-PIG ion source. Numerical calculations have been done to optimize the magnetic field configuration so as to fit the primary electrons to be fed into the PIG discharge chamber along the spreading magnetic field lines. Many possible methods for improving the performance and stability of the PIG ion source {{have been used in}} the E-PIG ion source, including the use of multicrystal LaB 6 cathode and optimized axial magnetic field. This article presents a detailed design of the E-PIG ion source. Substantial enhancement of ion charge state is expected to be observed which demonstrates that the E-PIG is a viable alternative to other much more costly and difficult to operate devices for the production of intense ion beams of higher charge state...|$|R
50|$|In a {{conventional}} set, voltage {{is used to}} control {{the brightness of the}} image, not its color, something that the new design also had to achieve. To address these competing needs, the color selection was provided by an <b>external</b> mechanism. The <b>gun</b> was modulated as it would be in a B&W set, with increasing power producing a brighter spot on the screen. A set of fine wires placed behind the screen provided the extra energy needed to select a particular color layer. Since the phosphors were relatively opaque, the system required very high accelerating voltages, between 25 and 40 kV. An improved version was introduced that used transparent phosphor layers and thin insulating layers between them that reduced the required voltages. The dielectric ensured that stray electrons, either off-voltage from the guns or secondary emission from the phosphors themselves, were stopped before they reached the screen.|$|R
5000|$|The Israeli Defense Forces used American M4 Shermans {{as early}} as in the 1948 war. Israel {{obtained}} her first Shermans through stealing them, buying them in the Philippines or getting demilitarized ones from scrapyards around Europe. The first one, nicknamed Meir, was obtained in May 1948; the British Army intended it for destruction, but soldiers handed it over to Hagana instead, that fitted it with a 75mm gun. One more was found at scrapyard in Israel and armed initially with an <b>external</b> mounted 20mm <b>gun</b> (the tank was named [...] "Tamar") and later a 75mm gun. Other similar covertly acquired ex-British Sherman tanks were named [...] "Ada" [...] and [...] "Ruth II". In November 1948 35 more were purchased from Italian scrapyards. All these were non-operational, only 4 were completely repaired {{until the end of}} the war and 14 by November (some necessitated re-arming with the Krupp 75 mm field gun). By late 1953 Israel had 76 operational Shermans and 131 nonoperational.|$|R
40|$|Polarized {{electron}} beams {{generated by}} DC guns are routinely available at several accelerators including JLAB, Mainz and SLAC. These guns operate with a cathode bias {{on the order}} of - 100 kV. To minimize space charge effects, relatively long bunches are generated at the gun and then compressed longitudinally <b>external</b> to the <b>gun</b> just before and during initial acceleration. For linear colliders, this compression is accomplished using a combination of rf bunchers. For the basic design of the International Linear Collider (ILC), a 120 kV DC photocathode gun is used to produce a series of nanosecond bunches that are each compressed by two sub-harmonic bunchers (SHBs) followed by an L-band buncher and capture section. The longitudinal bunching process results in a significantly higher emittance than produced by the gun alone. While high-energy experiments using polarized beams are not generally sensitive to the source emittance, there are several benefits to a lower source emittance including a simpler more efficient injector system and a lower radiation load during transport especially at bends as at the damping ring. For the ILC, the SHBs could be eliminated if the voltage of the gun is raised sufficiently. Simulations using the General Particle Tracer (GPT) package indicate that a cathode bias voltage of {ge} 200 kV should allow both SHBs to be operated at 433 or even 650 MHz, while {ge} 500 kV would be required to eliminate the SHBs altogether. Simulations can be used to determine the minimum emittance possible if the injector is designed for a given increased voltage. A possible alternative to the DC gun is an rf gun. Emittance compensation, routinely used with rf guns, is discussed for higher-voltage DC guns...|$|R
40|$|This file {{contains}} three final reports: 1. ion detector CoMA: Within {{the developmental}} {{frame of the}} CoMA-experiment which was planned to fly on the CRAF mission an ion detector was developed for the Design Verification Unit (DVU). It was shown that an ion detector with sufficient time resolution (2 ns) could be realized. The detector system consists of 2 units which are mechanically integrated: Dual Multichannelplate Detector; Nonlinear Preamplifier Unit. Among others, the following topics especially important under space flight aspects have been covered: finalizing investigations on the problem area of multiple pulses, development of an ESD protection circuitry, investigations on lifetime and of redundancy concepts, pulse-width coding of double pulses. 2. ion optics of the primary ion source: The COMA (Cometary Matter Analyzer) - instrument is a high mass resolution time - of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. The DVU (design verification unit) has been constructed and the TOF - section has been tested successfully using an <b>external</b> pulsed ion <b>gun.</b> In the DVU, the principal direction of the primary beam is parallel {{to that of the}} secondary beam due to mechanical design constraints. Therefore, the primary beam has to be deflected out of the main direction in order to hit the target in front of the secondary extraction lens. As in all high resolution TOF - SIMS, the primary beam pulse length should be of the order of a few nanoseconds. In addition, the COMA design goal for the primary beam spot size is 10 - 20 #mu#. The pre-target primary beam deflection therefore has to be designed for local and temporal beam crossover at the target position. Two basic deflection geometries have been suggested for this purpose: (a) a 'symmetric reflectron loop' consisting of two symmetrically situated parallel - plate condensors as 'ion mirrors' separated by drift spaces; and (b) an electrostatic sectorfield preceded by a transversal buncher, compensating to first order, the energy dispersion of the sector. 3. Components of the primary ion source CoMA: This last report contains a compilation of operating data on liquid metal indium ion emitters. The compilation covers operating experience on single emitters and on single emitter - and multi -emitter ion source modules obtained during ground tests as well as during flight tests on the space station MIR.
