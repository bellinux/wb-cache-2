North Shore is a brand new 'Student Hub' for the academic year 2010/11 and encases a <b>green</b> <b>centre,</b> bar & grill, theatre and nightclub.|$|E
25|$|Development works include land {{development}} (including excavation), construction of visitors' orientation area, three wooden bridges and a steel bridge for sightseers, a <b>green</b> <b>centre,</b> nursery building, children's interactive learning centre, environmental education centre, bamboo pavilions, signages and exhibits. The <b>green</b> <b>centre</b> has been planned in the erstwhile fisheries building near Ramakrishna Mutt Road. An audio visual room, environmental education centre, library to document creek activities, laboratory to check water quality, a souvenir shop, coffee corner, all {{form part of}} the centre. The CRRT had to excavate 150,000 tonnes of construction debris and garbage from the site to create a water body embellished with earthen pathways, wooden bridges, signage and bamboo pavilions. A total of 266,000 cubic metres of earth {{was removed from the}} site to create a park. The Phase I of the park has 136,560 plants of 172 indigenous species with about 1,000 name boards with inscriptions of the botanical names. It also includes solar-powered lights, seven water tanks, PVC pipes for a length of 3,100 m, and roads and pathways stretching 4km on the 58-acre campus. The environmental clearance for the Adyar Poonga was obtained from the Union ministry of environment and forests in mid-January 2011. The park was opened to public on 22 January 2011. One fourth of the 58-acre park would be the conservation zone to which public would have no access. A ticket plaza has been built near Brodies Castle Road.|$|E

As a result, examining the antecedents to approaches for <b>greening</b> data <b>centres</b> in order to facilitate their widespread adoption is critical. This study aims to identify the antecedents to the adoption of technologies and techniques (including those that are commonly accepted to produce successful outcomes, i. e. best practices) in <b>greening</b> data <b>centres.</b> A conceptual framework is proposed for explicating the conditions that might influence the adoption of the best practices in <b>greening</b> data <b>centres.</b> The conceptual framework is partially explored through two case studies. A series of theoretical propositions that are rooted in institutional, motivation-ability and utilitarian theories are proposed. The findings show that organisational propensity to adopt <b>greening</b> data <b>centre</b> best practices is based on institutional pressure, organisational and environmental efficiency motivations, organisational ability to take on greener practices and performance and effort expectancy...|$|R
