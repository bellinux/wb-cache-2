5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the <b>fingertips</b> touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E

40|$|The {{images of}} the {{mechanical}} responses were analysed when the <b>fingertip</b> was pressed against a plateau plate, {{and the influence of}} the contact angle on the loading pressure and the mechanical responses was investigated. As a result, as the contact angle was smaller, the change ratios due to the loading pressure were significantly larger in the contact length, the contact width and the distortion of lateral-view area. These parameters were thought to be useful in clinical medicine as indices for the degrees of mechanical responses of the <b>fingertip.</b> The length of the central axis and the maximum width of the <b>fingertip</b> were inappropriate as the parameters to represent the mechanical responses of the <b>fingertip.</b> The maximum width of the <b>fingertip</b> scarcely changed.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new method of tactile sensing for a <b>fingertip</b> of robotic hand {{based on the}} {{analysis}} of the mechanical constraints imposed to the contact between the <b>fingertip</b> and the contacting object. Using a simple <b>fingertip</b> with soft surface cover and a six-axis force/torque sensor, a new function is developed to measure direction of local geometry of a class of objects when the <b>fingertip</b> contacts with them. The developed function is useful not only to plan strategies for stable grasp and dexterous manipulation but also to recognize a geometrical shape of an object. Two necessary components, a six-axis force/torque sensor and a soft skin, are commercially available. They will neither restrict design of a robotic <b>fingertip</b> nor badly affect essential functions of stable grasping and manipulation.

5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless <b>fingertips.</b> Squeezing the branch between the <b>fingertips</b> generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing <b>fingertips.</b> The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{started in}} the semi-final game against the United States on August 6, in what many have called a {{controversial}} match. In the 78th minute of the game, Canada was leading, 3–2, when the referee ruled that McLeod had held the ball {{for more than six}} seconds, going by a rule that is rarely enforced, and gave an indirect free kick inside the penalty area to the United States. McLeod faced no challenge with the free kick; however, the referee then called a penalty after the ball struck Canadian player Marie-Eve Nault on the arm. American striker Abby Wambach took the penalty kick, and it went past McLeod. The match went into extra time, with Alex Morgan heading in the ball past McLeod's <b>fingertips</b> in the 123rd minute, resulting in a win for the United States.|$|E

5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the <b>fingertips,</b> and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings of}} bats are much thinner and consist of more bones {{than that of}} birds, {{allowing}} bats to maneuver more accurately and fly with more lift and less drag.

The surface of their wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called Merkel cells, also found on human <b>fingertips.</b> These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the center, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and collect information about the air flowing over its wings, and to fly more efficiently by changing the shape of its wings in response.|$|E
5|$|Infamous Second Son is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective. Players control the main character Delsin Rowe, who can parkour-style climb vertical surfaces like high-rise buildings. Delsin is a Conduit, which allows him to use superpower abilities by manipulating materials such as smoke, neon, video, and concrete. These materials can be weaponized (such that Delsin can perform melee attacks or fire projectiles from his <b>fingertips)</b> or used to deftly navigate the game world (such as using neon to dash up buildings). Using powers depletes a meter in the head-up display (HUD), which can be replenished by drawing from power sources such as smoke from exploded vehicles. Delsin earns new powers as he progresses through the story, which sees him fight against the Department of Unified Protection (D.U.P.) during missions. Each time Delsin gains a new power set he must destroy D.U.P. Core Relays to learn the basic abilities that correspond to it. Delsin upgrades and acquires new abilities by spending Blast Shards that have been collected, they are scattered throughout Seattle. Players become more powerful in combat by expanding Delsin's suite of abilities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new {{method of detection}} and measurement of <b>fingertip</b> slip {{on the surface of}} a manipulated object in a multi-fingered precision manipulation with rolling contact. Due to the fact that slip sensors are still in a basic research phase and no slip sensor is compatible with the actual <b>fingertip</b> manipulation, our method is based on the multi-sensor fusion of vision, joint-encoders of the fingers, and finger-tip force/torque sensors. Position of the contact between the object and the <b>fingertip</b> is computed in realtime from the measured pose of the object and the <b>fingertip</b> position. Slip displacement of the <b>fingertip</b> contact is then separated from the displacement by rolling motion of the <b>fingertip.</b> Reliability of the slip detection from the noisy data is improved using the tangential-to-normal ratio of the measured force at the contact and the mutual relationship between the tangential force and the direction of the contact displacement.

The <b>fingertip</b> detection approach consists of two stages. First, based on the grid sampling and the analysis of sampled hand contour, the <b>fingertip</b> was detected roughly. Then, the location of <b>fingertip</b> was localized precisely based on circle feature matching. Experiments suggest that the proposed <b>fingertip</b> detection method is capable of detecting <b>fingertip</b> in a reliable manner even in a complex background under different light conditions without any markers.

40|$|SUMMARY The digital vasospastic phenomena, {{which are}} induced by / 8 -adrenergic-blocking agents, suggest a / 3 -adrenergic finger {{vasodilator}} mechanism. We measured <b>fingertip</b> total blood flow with venous occlusion plethysmography and studied nutritional blood flow with Na"'I clearance. During <b>fingertip</b> vasoconstriction caused by brachial artery infusion of norepinephrine or angiotensin, intra-arterial isoproterenol caused a sustained increase in <b>fingertip</b> total blood flow. Furthermore, propran-olol significantly potentiated the vasoconstrictdon caused by mtra-arterial norepinephrine and atten-uated the vasodilator action of isoproterenol. No change in brachial artery blood pressure occurred {{to explain the}} changes in <b>fingertip</b> blood flow. Isoproterenol did not change nutritional flow, implying fi-adrenergic vasodilation solely of the <b>fingertip</b> arteriovenous shunts. When <b>fingertip</b> vasoconstriction was induced by reflex sympathetic nerve action during environmental cooling and mental stress, or by norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves caused by intra-arterial tyramine infusion, isoproter-enol and propranolol {{had no effect on}} <b>fingertip</b> total blood flow. This effect is probably specific for the /J-reeeptor agonist, since intra-arterial histamine caused a large increase in finger blood flow during environmental cooling.
