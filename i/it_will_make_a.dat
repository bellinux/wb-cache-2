5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
500|$|The episode's cold open {{was filmed}} {{in a water}} tank, using a replica P-51 Mustang plane which had been {{designed}} by the art director. Bowman also needed to direct {{a scene in which}} Gillian Anderson would react to a memory of playing with her sister as a child; the scene involved digitally compositing the children playing into Anderson's footage. Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going to tell everybody I can that you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to walk past the camera and continue off-screen. Feeling this was not effective, he replaced this with a walking shot which continued straight towards and into the camera, noting that [...] "Nick will jump in front of a truck if he think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scene better".|$|E

The latter is the fact but I am afraid <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> tremendous hole in our constitutional system." ...|$|E

[...] Being out on the right flank one day, just {{out of sight of}} the troops, I came upon a beautiful covey of grouse. [...] They were so tame I could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I could not hit them. [...] So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. [...] The right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. [...] The skirmishers thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. [...] He very sternly asked. [...] ‘Mr. Strahorn, did you do that firing?" [...] Upon my answering, [...] "Yes sir," [...] he still more gruffly asked, [...] "At Indians, or what?" [...] "Not at Indians, Colonel, but at grouse," [...] I answered. [...] "I was so hungry for grouse that I just couldn’t help it, so I’m ready to pay the penalty. [...] What is it?’ [...] Be it remembered that I was in the Colonel’s mess, and he replied quietly on the side, ‘Well, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> damn sight of difference whether you got a grouse.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|When General Sherman {{decided to}} send the Kiowa war chiefs to Jacksboro for trial, he wanted an example made. [...] What he did not want, and what happened, was that the trial became a circus. [...] First, the two {{attorneys}} appointed to represent the two Kiowa actually represented them, instead of participating {{in the kind of}} civics lesson which the Army had wanted. [...] Their trial strategy of arguing that the two Chiefs were simply fighting a war for their people's survival attracted worldwide attention, and galvanized opposition to the entire process. [...] Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs also opted to oppose the entire process, and also argued that the two chiefs were not subject to civilian jurisdiction since their people were at war with the United States. [...] Nor were the Indians apologetic. [...] At his trail Satanta warned what might happen if he was hanged: [...] " [...] I am a great chief among my people. If you kill me, it will be like a spark on the prairie. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> big fire – a terrible fire!" [...] Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, as was Big Tree; but Edmund Davis, the Governor of Texas, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment for both was changed to life imprisonment. [...] Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. [...] Thanks to the stubborn behaviour of Guipago, who forced the U.S. Government to agree seriously threatening a new bloody war, Satanta and Big Tree were freed after two years of imprisonment at the Huntsville State Penitentiary in Texas.|$|E
