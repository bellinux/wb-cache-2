40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPb(0. 9) Sn(0. 1) Se thin films were deposited on cleaved CaF(2) and BaF(2) substrates by vacuum evaporation methods. The as-deposited films were not photosensitive. Photoconductivity was observed after the films had been isothermally annealed in Pb-Sn rich vapor {{to reduce their}} carrier concentrations. Blackbody (500 ° K) response measurements were made to determine the responsivity and detectivity of the thin-film samples. Blackbody responsivities as high as 60 volts per watt were measured. Thin films with singlecrystal (lOO) -oriented structure were more sensitive than the films with either single-crystal (111) or polycrystalline mixed (111) and (100) structure. The wavelengths of photoconductive thresholds were determined by spectral response measurement and were in good agreement with the fundamental absorption edges.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the optic phonons of a GaAs/GaAlAs {{superlattice}} (d//G//a//A//s equals 55 Angstrom, d//G//a//A//l//A//s equals 175 Angstrom using resonance Raman spectroscopy.

We have observed several optic modes that are confined to the GaAs layers, whose energies agree well with neutron scattering measurements of bulk GaAs phonon dispersion. In this sample {{there is no clear}} evidence for modes confined to the GaAlAs layers. We have also observed in the region of the AlAs-like modes of the GaAlAs layers and additional broad band intermediate in energy between the LO and TO modes.

40|$|GaAs–GaAlAs double-heterostructure {{injection}} lasers {{consist of}} several epilayers of <b>GaAs</b> and <b>GaAlAs</b> grown on a GaAs substrate. The need for cleaved end mirrors may be eliminated in these lasers by incorporating internal periodic corrugation which provide feedback. This distributed feedback relies on Bragg reflection from the periodic perturbation, {{and thus the}} lasing wavelength is directly proportional to the corrugation period. Such corrugated laser structures are compatible with the fabrication of monolithic optical circuits and seem to be most suitable as light sources for integrated optics. Our group prepared corrugated structures by ion milling or chemical etching through a photoresist mask which was generated by the interference of two laser beams. We observed laser emission from GaAs–GaAlAs double heterostructures with internal corrugation when pumped electrically at 77 °K. Theoretical considerations indicate that such lasers should have a very low threshold current and a good wavelength selectivity. Further experimental work on these devices is now in progress...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{recombination}} velocity (S sub rec) for bare GaAs is typically as high as 10 to the 6 th power to 10 to the 7 th power cm/sec, which dramatically lowers the efficiency of GaAs solar cells. Early attempts to circumvent this problem by making an ultra thin junction (xj less than. 1 micron) proved unsuccessful when compared to lowering S sub rec by surface passivation. Present day GaAs solar cells use an GaAlAs window layer to passivate the top surface. The advantages of GaAlAs in surface passivation are its high bandgap energy and lattice matching to <b>GaAs.</b> Although <b>GaAlAs</b> is successful in reducing the {{surface recombination}} velocity, it has other inherent problems of chemical instability (Al readily oxidizes) and ohmic contact formation. The search for new, more stable window layer materials requires a means to compare their surface passivation ability.

40|$|The {{results of}} heteroepitaxial growth of <b>GaAs</b> and <b>GaAlAs</b> {{directly}} on Si are presented, and applications to new cell structures are suggested. The novel {{feature is the}} elimination of a Ge lattice transition region. This feature not only reduces the cost of substrate preparation, but also makes possible the fabrication of high efficiency monolithic cascade structures. All films to be discussed were grown by organometallic chemical vapor deposition at atmospheric pressure. This process yielded reproducible, large-area films of GaAs, grown directly on Si, that are tightly adherent and smooth, and are characterized by a defect density of 5 x 10 (6) power/sq cm. Preliminary studies indicate that GaAlAs can also be grown in this way. A number of promising applications are suggested. Certainly these substrates are ideal for low-weight GaAs space solar ells. For very high efficiency, the absence of Ge makes the technology attractive for GaAlAs/Si monolithic cascades, in which the Si substrates would first be provided with a suitable p/n junction. An evaluation of a three bandgap cascade consisting of appropriately designed GaAlAs/GaAs/Si layers is also presented...|$|R

We find that the splitting energy of the excited state is larger and less dependent on the position of the impurity than that of the ground state. Our results are useful for the application of Rashba spin-orbit coupling to photoelectric devices. In the framework of effective-mass envelope–function theory, excluding the relativity effect, the electronic states have been studied for a hydrogenic donor impurity in quantum wells (QWs) [1 – 5] and its important application in the photoelectric devices. The relativity effect introduces evidence of Rashba effects in the semiconductor materials. In recent years, spin-dependent phenomena was also proposed using spin field-effect transistor {{based on the fact that}} spin precession can be controlled by an external field due to the spin-orbit interaction [6]. Gvozdić et al. studied efficient switching of Rashba spin splitting in wide modulation-doped quantum wells [7].

40|$|Direct {{observation}} of optical emission from H‐related complexes in {{molecular beam epitaxy}} grown bulk <b>GaAs</b> and <b>GaAlAs,</b> as well as InGaAs/GaAs strained multiquantum wells (MQWs), is obtained from liquid He photoluminescence experiments. Hydrogenation is achieved by low‐energy ion irradiation from a Kaufman source. The volume incorporation of hydrogen, for equal treatment, is dependent upon the density of impurities and defects where H can bind. For moderate H treatment, in addition to passivation of shallow acceptors, in GaAs we observe novel emission bands, δ, peaking at 1. 360, and γ, peaking at 1. 455 eV. After heavy hydrogen treatment in GaAs of low radiative efficiency−even p type originally−there appears a deeper structure α at ∼ 1. 20 eV, of the kind known for ‘‘internal’’ transitions in the Ga vacancy‐donor complex. Equivalent bands are found in bulk GaAlAs and also in InGaAs/GaAs MQWs. The results allow an approximate estimate of the various optically active Ga‐vacancy levels, as affected by the different degrees of hydrogenation of the dangling bonds, and a comparison with theoretical values. Moreover, they provide evidence {{for the creation of}} a H‐related donor whose binding energy is of order 25 meV. Finally, the γ band is suggestive of a transition between localized conduction and valence states associated with the local distortion that is introduced in the lattice when H binds to impurities, defects, and lattice atoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis is a study of {{thermally}} activated conduction, Hall effect, and Far-Infrared absorption in n-InP. Accurate measurements of threshold energies are deduced from the temperature dependence of these effects, after correction for Fermi level variations, and it is shown that the threshold for electrical conduction is higher than for Hall effect, or cyclotron resonance. An explanation is given in terms of the long range impurity potential fluctuations. The second part of this thesis presents measurements of the thermopower in heterostructures for the GaInAs - InP, GaInAs - InAlAs, and <b>GaAs</b> - <b>GaAlAs</b> systems, with and without magnetic field, for temperature varying from 2 K to 10 K. In high magnetic fields, strong oscillations of the thermopower are seen, with the same phase as the Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations in the resistivity, in accordance with theory. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the thermopower are mostly as predicted for the superlattice but those of the heterojunctions disagree with the predictions. A discussion of the cause of this disagreement is given. In the final part, the value of the relative energy shift between different valleys of the conduction band of a thin film of PbTe grown on BaF 2 is obtained. This will be used to obtain the deformation potential of PbTe. </p...|$|R
