Other attendees included Lostpedia and Television Without Pity. The event highlighted six popular fan-run websites focused on current media. [...] One participant remarked that [...] "The Paley Center itself is trying <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> figure out what this whole blogging thing is, and doesn’t quite get it, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that no urls appeared in the program for the event." ...|$|E
500|$|Rogen {{has been}} outspoken about {{awareness}} of Alzheimer's disease. No {{one in his}} biological family has it but it runs in his wife's side, and has affected her mother for several years. [...] "Ithink until you see it firsthand, it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> conceive of how brutal it is," [...] Rogen said to CNN. [...] "Until I saw it, you just don't get kind of how heartbreaking it can be." [...] During the interview, he talked about how he tries to be emotionally supportive and around {{as much as he}} can for Miller's mother. Both he and Miller spoke to Larry King for ALarry King Special, Unthinkable: The Alzheimer's Epidemic, which aired in April 2011. Rogen testified about the disease and his charity before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services on February 26, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Randy Jackson {{contributed to}} four tracks on the album, {{and said it}} was [...] "the most real and honest record she's made. She didn't care what anyone thought of the lyrics. They were only {{important}} to her." [...] Carey included a cover of [...] Def Leppard's song [...] "Bringin' On the Heartbreak". During the photo shoot for Charmbracelet at Capri, Carey happened to listen to Def Leppard's greatest hits album [...] (1995), which contains the song, and decided to cover it. In an interview with Billboard, Carey said that the song is [...] "an example of her musical diversity". Jackson also worked on [...] "My Saving Grace", which Carey said describes her thoughts about the writing, recording and mastering process. While working in Capri, Carey's father became ill with cancer and she returned to New York {{to spend some time with}} him; he died soon after. In his memory, Carey wrote and produced the song [...] "Sunflowers for Alfred Roy". Carey said that the song represents [...] "his side of the family and is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> talk about." [...] The song proved to be [...] "very emotional" [...] for Carey, and she sang it only once in the studio. DJ Quik also produced songs for the album, but none of them were included.|$|E

500|$|Will Smith {{signed on}} to play Robert Neville in April 2006. He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like [...] "Gladiator [...] Forrest Gump—these are movies with wonderful, audience-pleasing elements, but also uncompromised artistic value. [...] always felt like it had those {{possibilities}} to me." [...] The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001). He said that [...] "when you're on your own, it is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find conflict." [...] The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes. To prepare for his role, Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia. He also met with {{a person who had}} been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war. Smith compared Neville to Job, who lost his children, livelihood, and health. Like the Book of Job, I Am Legend studies the questions, [...] "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?" [...] He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks' performance in Cast Away (2000).|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we were going to put it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has {{interacted with}} the crowd during the band's concerts. Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. During {{the early part of}} Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage {{lighting}} rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E

It is the <b>hardest</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> work <b>to</b> be cheerful and see only the bright side of things when your stomach is empty. But once fill that empty stomach, and {{everything}} is changed. It was just that way with Mrs. Quack.

2500|$|Throughout the {{development}} of the album Lewis explained that she wanted to make an album that is [...] "timeless". In June 2011, when asked about the upcoming album, Lewis described it as [...] "energetic, deep, [...] unique". She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her [...] "heart into [...] lyrics". She cited Tracy Chapman, Kate Bush and Tears for Fears as the album's primary influences. Lewis spoke on the sound of the album saying [...] "Well, when I was on tour, we mixed a lot of dancer beats on it – my cousin actually reproduced a lot of the ballads. I've taken more of that sound into the album; we've got a lot of piano and live instrumentation. I've a song called 'Fireflies' which I really, really love and hope we get to do as a single. it's a really good one. And it's got a guy on it!" [...] She explained [...] "So the album is such an eclectic mix. I've really got to delve into every kind of music that I love, really try everything and make the best of everything. Because I love so many different genres, it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> just pick one thing to do, so I just did everything!" ...|$|E

60|$|NEXT day, towards night, we laid {{up under}} a little willow towhead out in the middle, {{where there was a}} village {{on each side of the}} river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and {{tiresome}} to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it WAS <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> have to lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs) logic blocks have undergone constant evolution {{to the point}} where both the basic soft logic blocks that implement combinational logic and the fixed-function hard blocks contain complex interconnects, hierarchy and modes. The goal of this thesis is to both support that complexity and enable future architecture exploration of even increased complexity and new <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> functionality. <b>To</b> accomplish this, a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) flow that can map a user circuit to an FPGA with these complex blocks is needed. We propose a new language that can describe these complex blocks and a new area-driven tool for the packing stage of that CAD flow. The packing stage groups components of a user circuit into the complex blocks available on the FPGA. We conduct experiments to illustrate the quality of the packing tool and to demonstrate the newly-enabled architecture exploration capabilities...|$|R
40|$|In dynamic {{ubiquitous}} environments, {{end users}} {{may need to}} create services by causing two or more devices or resources to interoperate together in ad-hoc circumstances. In general, users can find this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> process <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> manage. At the same time, existing UI architectures are not well suited to supporting such activities. It is proposed that a good basis for addressing these and related problems in a principled, scaleable way is the principle of Direct Combination (DC). The principle is summarized, and analytical arguments are presented that predict that DC can {{reduce the amount of}} search required by the user. Other things being equal, such a reduction in search would be expected to offer interactions which are faster, less frustrating, and impose less mental load on the user. We present a proof-of-concept implementation, and a small-scale evaluation of a DC interface. Within the limitations of a preliminary evaluation, consistent support is offered across several measures for the analytical predictions...|$|R

Also, the study showed that the anchoring effect is present when detecting phishing.

The cutting force of the flat-end-milling cutter is analyzed to explain the reason why X-axiss cutting force is greater in up-milling than in down-milling, yet Y-axiss is smaller. The formulation of cutting force is derived from orthogonal method. Rules are provided for optimizing cutting parameters in milling of stainless steel...|$|R
40|$|Churchill and Churchill’s {{editorial}} discusses negative (health) {{effects of}} commercialism {{in the provision}} of health care and nutrition. Three parts of their argument are commented: the claim that the fundamental problem of markets is the decomposition of the whole into parts (“reductionism”); the call for individual responsibility; and the notion of holism. On the three aspects the commentary concludes thus: Because provision of health and food must be controlled and managed in some form, an alternative to some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> decomposition is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see. The call for individual responsibility is controversial due to its lack of attention to socioeconomic inequalities.
