5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain</b> that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
25|$|Butanol {{may be used}} as a fuel in an {{internal}} combustion engine. Because its longer <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain</b> causes it to be fairly non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. Butanol has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification. It has a four link <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Converting {{a mixture}} of H2 and CO into {{aliphatic}} products obviously should be a multi-step reaction with several sorts of intermediates. The growth of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain</b> may be visualized as involving a repeated sequence in which hydrogen atoms are added to carbon and oxygen, the C–O bond is split and a new C–C bond is formed.|$|E

40|$|The 2 H NMR {{transverse}} relaxation {{rates of}} a deuterated phospholipid bilayer reflect slow motions in the bilayer membrane. A study of dimyristoyl lecithin specifically deuterated at several {{positions of the}} <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> indicates that these motions are cooperative and are confined to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> of the lipid bilayer. However, lipid head group interactions do {{play an important role}} in modulating the properties of the cooperative fluctuations of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> (director fluctuations), as evidenced by the effects of various lipid additives on the 2 H NMR transverse relaxation rates of the dimyristoyl lecithin bilayer...|$|R
50|$|Saturated fats have <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> {{which can}} be most readily aligned. The <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> in trans fats align more readily than those in cis fats, but less well than those in {{saturated}} fats. In general, {{this means that the}} melting points of fats increase from cis to trans unsaturated and then to saturated. See the section about the chemical structure of fats for more information.|$|R
25|$|At 178-180°C, {{the melting}} point of nylon 12 {{is the lowest}} among the {{important}} polyamides. Its mechanical properties, such as hardness, tensile strength, and resistance to abrasion, {{are similar to those}} of nylon 6 and nylon 66. Low water absorption and density, 1.01 g/mL, result from its relatively long <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain</b> length, which also confers it dimensional stability and an almost paraffin-like structure. Nylon 12 is also chemical resistant and insensitive to stress cracking.|$|E

Plans are underway to market a fuel that is 85% Ethanol and 15% Butanol (E85B), so existing E85 internal combustion engines can run on a 100% renewable fuel {{that could be made}} without using any fossil fuels. Because its longer <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain</b> causes it to be fairly non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. Butanol has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification.|$|E
25|$|Arginine's {{side chain}} is amphipathic, because at {{physiological}} pH {{it contains a}} positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, {{at the end of}} a hydrophobic aliphatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain.</b> Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the hydrophilic head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein.|$|E

25|$|Cholesterol, {{given that}} it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is {{required}} to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids, while the bulky steroid and the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chain</b> are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells {{do not need to}} build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.|$|E

40|$|Both {{membranes}} of Mycoplasma laidlawii {{and water}} dispersions of protein-free membrane lipids exhibit thermal phase transitions {{that can be}} detected by differential scanning calorimetry. The transition temperatures are lowered by increased unsaturation in the fatty acid residues, but in each case {{they are the same}} for membranes and lipids. The transitions resemble those observed for synthetic lipids in the lamellar phase in water, which arise from melting of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> within the phospholipid bilayers. Such melts are cooperative phenomena and would be greatly perturbed by apolar binding to protein. Thus the identity of membrane and lipid transition temperatures suggests that in the membranes, as in water, the lipids are in the bilayer conformation in which the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> associate with each other rather than with proteins. Observations of morphological changes indicate that osmotic imbalance occurs when the membrane transition temperature exceeds the growth temperature, and that for transport processes to function properly the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> must be in a liquid-like state...|$|R

40|$|Fully {{hydrated}} dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) undergoes liquid crystalline to metastable Pβ, {{phase transition}} in cooling. A small angle x-ray scattering {{study has been}} performed for obtaining further evidence about the structure of this phase. From a high-resolution observation of x-ray diffraction profiles, a distinct multipeak pattern has become obvious. Among them the (01) reflection in the secondary ripple structure is identified clearly. There are peaks assigned straightforwardly to (10) and (20) reflections in the primary ripple structure and peaks assigned to (10) and (20) reflections in the secondary ripple structure. Therefore the multipeak pattern is due to superposition of the reflections cause by the primary and secondary ripple structures. The lattice parameters are estimated as follows: for the primary ripple structure a = 7. 09 nm, b = 13. 64 nm, and γ = 95 °, and for the secondary ripple structure a = 8. 2 nm, b = 26. 6 nm, and γ = 90 °. The lattice parameters thus obtained for the secondary ripple structure are not conclusive, however. The <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> in the primary ripple structure have been reported as being tilted against the bilayer plane and, on the other hand, the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> in the secondary ripple structure {{are likely to be}} perpendicular to the bilayer plane. This fact seems to be related to a sequential mechanism of phase transitions. On heating from the Lβ, phase where the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> are tilted the primary ripple structure having tilted <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> takes place and on cooling from the Lα phase where the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> are not tilted the secondary ripple structure with untilted chains tends to be stabilized. It appears that the truly metastable ripple phase is expressed by the second ripple structure although {{in the course of the}} actual cooling transition both the secondary and primary ripple structures form and coexist...|$|R

40|$|This article reviews recent {{progress}} {{in the development of}} lectin-based biosensors used for the determination of glucose, pathogenic bacteria and toxins, cancer cells, and lectins. Lectin proteins have been widely used for the construction of optical and electrochemical biosensors by exploiting the specific binding affinity to carbohydrates. Among lectin proteins, concanavalin A (Con A) is most frequently used for this purpose as glucose- and mannose-selective lectin. Con A is useful for immobilizing enzymes including glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) on the surface of a solid support to construct glucose and hydrogen peroxide sensors, because these enzymes are covered with intrinsic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains.</b> Con A-modified electrodes can be used as biosensors sensitive to glucose, cancer cells, and pathogenic bacteria covered with <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains.</b> The target substrates are selectively adsorbed to the surface of Con A-modified electrodes through strong affinity of Con A to <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains.</b> A recent topic in the development of lectin-based biosensors is a successful use of nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes, for amplifying output signals of the sensors.

Infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy was used to estimate the content of secondary structure of the apolipoprotein, and the orientation of its alpha-helices with respect to the lipid <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains.</b> In addition, the infrared spectra were analyzed in terms of the conformation and organization of different regions of the lipid molecules in the rHDL particles. The results indicate that the overall organization and conformation of lipid molecules in a lipid bilayer is preserved in the rHDL particles, but that progressive increases in apolipoprotein content straighten the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>chains</b> and decrease their packing order in the gel state, and decrease their mobility in the liquid-crystalline state. The presence of apolipoprotein also affects the conformation of the lipids {{at the level of the}} ester bonds and the head group of the phospholipid.
