40|$|The {{influence}} of an <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> on ventilation rate was experimentally investigated in a multispan glass-covered greenhouse {{equipped with a}} continuous roof vent, located at the University of Thessaly near volos in the coastal area of eastern Greece. Microclimate variables {{as well as the}} ventilation rate were measured during summer. Two measuring techniques were used for the determination of ventilation rate: (1) the decay rate tracer gas technique, using N 2 O as tracer gas, and (2) the water vapor balance technique. The {{influence of}} the <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> on ventilation rate was studied using a wind-related coefficient identified by fitting a simple linear model to the experimental values. The two measuring techniques gave similar results, but the water vapor balance technique provided a better fit to the experimental data. The wind-related coefficient significantly decreased when an <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> covered the vent. Finally, the influence of the <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> on the discharge coefficient was investigated. The discharge coefficient was correlated to the aerodynamic properties of the screen using porous media flow analysis...|$|R

50|$|Bronze <b>insect</b> <b>screening</b> is {{much more}} expensive, but gives much longer service than either {{aluminum}} or fiberglass. When first installed, it has a bright gold color; this weathers to an unobtrusive dark charcoal {{within a year or}} less. Weathered bronze darkens the external appearance of windows to approximately the same degree as charcoal or black aluminum. Bronze is somewhat more resistant to denting than aluminum. Less common screen fabrics include copper, brass, stainless steel, and galvanized steel. For coastal locations, corrosion resistance usually requires the use of bronze or synthetic screening fabric.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} natural convection across a window cavity with an <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> {{was performed in}} order to investigate the effects of changing several variables on the heat transfer through the system. A two-dimensional, laminar model was created using the Computational Fluid Dynamics software FLUENT. The system was approximated by three rectangular zones, the largest representing the open room, a smaller area with an isothermal wall representing the window cavity and a thin area representing the <b>insect</b> <b>screen,</b> which connected the two other zones. The <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> {{was assumed to be}} a porous media with a known pressure drop taken from experimentation and the Darcy-Forchheimer equation was applied to this zone. The factors that were changed in order to examine the effects were two window cavity heights and two widths, five different screen porosities and a variety of window, screen and ambient temperature combinations. The model was compared to analytical solutions for a vertical flat plate, as well as a qualitative analysis done through a simple flow visualization experiment for a midrange porosity of 0. 5. It was found that the model matched the analytical solution very well and exhibited the same flow patterns as in the experiment. First a non-heated screen was used, simulating nighttime conditions. Velocity vector and temperature plots were created in order to see the changes in flow patterns as the porosity of the screen was decreased for the various geometries and as the temperature between the window and screen increased. Several flow patterns were observed. For small screen/window spacing, 0. 0127 m, the flow is fairly uniform for all porosities and follows {{the entire length of the}} cavity, slowing in velocity for decreasing porosities. For larger spacing, 0. 0254 m, there are recirculation zones present, one back up the screen, and one in the bottom corner which causes the flow to exit the cavity before it reaches the bottom. The results were then non-dimensionalized and the heat transfer rates were examined by comparing the local and average Nusselt and Rayleigh number for each model. The results showed the effects of the flow patterns on the heat transfer, with end effects jumping the Nusselt number as the flow navigates the bottom corner. These effects are lessened with decreasing porosity. The average Nusselt number also followed the same trend as flat plate correlations, but with less heat transfer. Finally, a methodology was proposed to approximate the heat transfer as resistor network in order to simplify the heat transfer calculations into a 1 -D transfer analysis for building sciences applications. Each element of the system, the window, <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> and open room, was reduced to an isothermal layer in order to describe the system solely by temperature differences in order to find the heat transfer rates. This final step was done in conjunction with ongoing research at the University of Waterloo Solar Thermal Research Lab...|$|R
50|$|A window screen (also {{known as}} <b>insect</b> <b>screen,</b> bug screen, fly screen, wire mesh) is {{designed}} to cover {{the opening of a}} window. It is usually a mesh made of metal wire, fiberglass, or other synthetic fiber and stretched in a frame of wood or metal. It serves to keep leaves, debris, insects, birds, and other animals from entering a building or a screened structure such as a porch, without blocking fresh air-flow. Most houses in Australia, the United States and Canada {{and other parts of the}} world have screens on the window to prevent entry of flying insects such as mosquitoes, flies and wasps. In some regions such as the northern United States and Canada, screens were required to be replaced by glass storm windows in the winter, but now combination storm and screen windows are available, which allow glass and screen panels to slide up and down.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{limitations}} to using night flushing, such as usability, security, reduced indoor air quality, and poor room acoustics. For natural night flushing, the process of manually opening and closing windows every day can be tiresome, especially {{in the presence of}} <b>insect</b> <b>screens.</b> This problem can be eased with automated windows or ventilation louvers, such as in the Manitoba Hydro Place. Natural night flushing also requires windows to be open at night when the building is most likely unoccupied, which can raise security issues. If outdoor air is polluted, night flushing can expose occupants to harmful conditions inside the building. In loud city locations, the opening of windows can create poor acoustical conditions inside the building.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to experimentally investigate the influence of vent type (side, roof or both) and of an anti-aphid <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> used to prevent insect intrusion on the ventilation rate of a round arch with vertical side walls, polyethylene covered greenhouse. The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up vents and a flap roof vent located at the University of Thessaly near Velestino in the continental area of Eastern Greece. Microclimate variables {{as well as the}} airflow rate were measured during summer. Two measuring methods were used for the determination of ventilation rate: (a) the decay rate 'tracer gas' method, using nitrous oxide N 2 O as tracer gas, and (b) the greenhouse 'energy balance' method. In order to study the effect of vent type on ventilation rate, in a greenhouse with an anti-aphid <b>insect</b> <b>screen</b> in the vent openings, airflow was determined during periods with ventilation being performed by: (i) roof, (ii) side or (iii) both roof and side vents. Furthermore, in order to study the effect of <b>insect</b> proof <b>screen</b> on airflow, measurements were also carried out during periods that ventilation was performed by side vents without a screen in the openings. A good correlation was found between the air exchange rate values calculated using the two methods, with the values obtained by the tracer gas method being slightly lower than those obtained by the energy balance method. Furthermore, the data of ventilation rate obtained by the tracer gas method fitted better to the model used for the prediction of ventilation rate. In addition, the use of anti-aphid screen in vent openings caused a 33 % reduction in greenhouse ventilation rate. From greenhouse ventilation performance point of view, {{it was found that the}} most effective vent configuration was the combination of roof and side vents, followed by side vents only (46 % reduction in ventilation), while the least effective was roof vent (71 % reduction ventilation). © 2006 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{experimentally}} investigate the effect of three different shading and insect proof nets on pepper crop development and production. Three screenhouses were used; two of them were covered by a 50 mesh <b>insect</b> proof <b>screen</b> with shading intensity of about 15 % and 35 % and the third one was covered by a green shading net (not insect proof) with shading intensity of about 35 %. The experiments were carried out from May to October 2012 in the experimental farm of the University of Thessaly in Velestino, Central Greece. Seedlings of sweet pepper plants were transplanted during May in three screenhouses and outside and measurements of crop development, production and quality, along with climate measurements inside and outside the screenhouses were performed. The results showed that compared to outside, plants grown under the green shading net were about 17 % higher and produced about the same number of fruit with about 7 % higher total fruit yield. The highest fruit number and total fruit yield was observed under the 15 % shading <b>insect</b> proof <b>screen</b> (about 7 kg m- 2) which was about 80 % higher compared to outside and about 35 % higher than that observed under the <b>insect</b> proof <b>screen</b> with the higher shading intensity. Marketable fruit yield for all screenhouses was more than 90 % of the total yield, while for the open field crop the marketable fruit production was about 60 % of the total.

40|$|Due {{to rising}} energy prices {{as well as}} supply and {{ecological}} concerns, {{there is a strong}} interest in reducing the energy used in buildings. As such, it is desirable to model the operation of a building and predict its future energy use. In predicting the energy use of a building, the heat gain/loss through windows is an important factor. In order to accurately model this heat gain/loss, the convective heat transfer coefficient of any <b>insect</b> <b>screens</b> mounted adjacent to the windows needs to be known. This thesis describes an investigation into the heat transfer from <b>insect</b> <b>screens</b> mounted towards the indoor side of a window. The convective heat transfer coefficient of an insect screen varies based on several parameters. For implementation in building energy modelling software, it is desirable to be able to predict the convective heat transfer coefficient for an arbitrary insect screen. Due to the number of variables and the large dynamic range of the details required for modelling, direct simulation of a range of whole <b>insect</b> <b>screens</b> was not completed. Instead, a range of numerical models representing small sections of an insect screen were created. By comparing results from these to available correlations for simpler geometries, such as cylinders and flat plates, estimates for the heat transfer coefficient of a screen can be obtained.

40|$|Background Chagas {{disease is}} the most {{important}} vector-borne disease in Latin America. Regional initiatives based on residual insecticide spraying have successfully controlled domiciliated vectors in many regions. Non-domiciliated vectors remain responsible for a significant transmission risk, and their control is now a key challenge for disease control. [br/] Methodology/Principal Findings A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses. Demographic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to two years of field data from the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. The predictive value of the model was tested on an independent data set before simulations examined the efficacy of control strategies based on residual insecticide spraying, <b>insect</b> <b>screens,</b> and bednets. The model accurately fitted and predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found effective when 50 mg/m 2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season. The > 80 % reduction in bug abundance was not improved by larger doses or more frequent interventions, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. Alternatively, the use of <b>insect</b> <b>screens</b> consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. [br/] Conclusion/Significance Control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, because it would require yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. <b>Insect</b> <b>screens</b> appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases...|$|E

The greenhouse was equipped with two side roll-up vents and a flap roof vent. A tomato crop planted in double rows was cultivated inside the greenhouse. The three components of air velocity were measured by a 3 -D sonic anemometer, and the air temperature and relative humidity were, simultaneously recorded at several positions inside the greenhouse. Concerning the effect of <b>insect</b> <b>screens,</b> {{it was found that}} the mean value of the normalized air velocity was 58 % lower in the greenhouse with <b>insect</b> <b>screens</b> on the side vent openings than in the case of a greenhouse without screens. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of the microclimate variables was reduced with screens in the vent openings. When the ventilation was provided by side openings only, the air velocity inside the greenhouse was characterized by a strong air current near the greenhouse ground and low air velocity near the roof; when the ventilation was provided by roof vents, a circulating current prevailing at the center of the greenhouse was observed. The combined use of roof and side openings increased air velocity and decreased air temperature inside the greenhouse but also increased the spatial heterogeneity of the greenhouse microclimate compared to the cases with side or roof vents only. The most homogeneous climate conditions were achieved with the use of roof openings only. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the plant environment behavior under different vent configurations and a high-resolution database for validating on-going efforts with computer simulations...|$|E
