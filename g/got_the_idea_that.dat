[...] She also drew on her parents' {{marriage}} for inspiration—her father spent the bulk of each week traveling. Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; [...] "She's radically different.

500|$|Ion Creangă's {{sense of}} humor was {{instrumental}} in forging the unprecedented characteristics of his work. American critic Ruth S. Lamb, the writer's style merges [...] "the rich vocabulary of the Moldavian peasant" [...] with [...] "an original gaiety and gusto {{comparable to that of}} Rabelais." [...] According to George Călinescu: [...] " [...] <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he was a clever man, like all men of the people, and therefore used irony to make himself seem stupid." [...] In Călinescu's view, the author's antics had earned him a status equivalent to that of his Wallachian Junimist counterpart Caragiale, with the exception that the latter found his inspiration in urban settings, matching [...] "Nasreddinisms" [...] with [...] "Miticism". Z. Ornea sees the main protagonists in Creangă's comedic narratives as, in effect, [...] "particularized incarnations of the same symbolic character", while the use of humor itself reflects the traditional mindset, [...] "a survival through intelligence, that of a people with an old history, whose life experience has for centuries been concentrated into gestures and words." ...|$|E
500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew pretty much what I was doing, and they sort of <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E

5000|$|Édouard René Lefèbvre de Laboulaye (...) (18 January 1811 - 25 May 1883) was a French jurist, poet, {{author and}} anti-slavery activist.

2500|$|In 1987, Martin {{published}} {{a collection of}} short horror stories in Portraits of His Children. During this same period, Martin continued working in print media as a book-series editor, this time overseeing the development of the multi-author Wild Cards book series, which takes place in a shared universe in which a small slice of post–World War II humanity gains superpowers after the release of an alien-engineered virus; new titles are still being published in the ongoing series from Tor Books. In Second Person, Martin [...] "gives a personal account of the close-knit role-playing game (RPG) culture that gave rise to his Wild Cards shared-world anthologies". An important element {{in the creation of the}} multiple author series was a campaign of Chaosium's role-playing game Superworld (1983) that Martin ran in Albuquerque. Admitting he became completely obsessed with the game, he stopped writing literature for about a year, but his shrinking bank accounts made him realize he had to come up with something, and <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> perhaps the stories and characters created in Superworld could somehow become profitable. Martin's own contributions to Wild Cards have included Thomas Tudbury, [...] "The Great and Powerful Turtle", a powerful psychokinetic whose flying [...] "shell" [...] consisted of an armored VW Beetle. As of June 2011, 21 Wild Cards volumes had been published in the series; earlier that same year, Martin signed the contract for the 22nd volume, Low Ball (2014), published by Tor Books. In early 2012, Martin signed another Tor contract for the 23rd Wild Cards volume, High Stakes, which was released in August 2016.|$|E

He was not very tall, he had a round face, cheeks that were generally, I should think, rather high-coloured, brown eyes and dark hair, almost black. He wore a thick gold ring on the finger of one hand, and although he spoke good English, I <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> somehow <b>that</b> he was either a foreigner or had lived abroad.

50|$|Jock (Clive Russell) is {{a builder}} who was renovating the barn behind Sal's {{house in the}} third series. Sal had been ignorant of the {{planning}} application (Tash had seen it but ignored it), and took her ire out on Jock. Jock, having an abrasive, no-nonsense personality, ignored all protests. Rosie, on speaking to Jock, <b>got</b> <b>the</b> mistaken <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house was being built as a hideaway residence for Charles Dance. The thought of a celebrity in the village removes local opposition to the build, leaving Sal without support. Jock, over time, becomes friendly with Sal, eventually becoming her love interest. When it dawns on Sal and Tip that Charles Dance will not be appearing at the local Ladies meeting, it's Jock who saves the day.|$|R

Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011.

60|$|On my {{way back}} to Bath I had a day at Bristol.

I amused myself strolling about and watching the people, and as train after train came in late in the day discharging loads of humanity, mostly young men and women from the surrounding country coming in for an evening's amusement, I noticed again the peculiarly Welsh character of the Somerset peasant--the shape of the face, the colour of the skin, and, above all, the expression.|$|E
6000|$|No; {{all that}} Pym {{saw was a}} pasty-faced boy sixteen years old, and of an {{appearance}} mysteriously plain; hair light brown, and waving defiance to the brush; nothing startling about him but the expression of his face, which was almost fearsomely solemn and apparently unchangeable. He wore his Sunday blacks, of which the trousers might with advantage have borrowed from the sleeves; {{and he was so}} nervous that he had to wet his lips before he could speak. He had left the door ajar for a private reason; but Pym, misunderstanding, thought he did it to fly the more readily if anything was flung at him, and so concluded that he must be a printer's devil. Pym had a voice that shook his mantelpiece ornaments; he was all on the same scale as his ink-pot. [...] "Your Christian name, boy?"

60|$|A {{temporary}} compromise was effected {{between the}} two parties by the securing for James of a post as assistant-master at Harrow House, the private school of one Blatherwick, M.A., the understanding being that if he could hold the job he could remain in England and write, if it pleased him, in his spare time. But if he fell short in any way as a handler of small boys he was to descend a step in the animal kingdom and be matched against the West Australian sheep. There was to be no second chance in the event of failure. From the way Uncle Frederick talked James almost <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he attached a spiritual importance to a connexion with sheep. He seemed to strive with a sort of religious frenzy to convert James to West Australia. So James went to Harrow House with much the same emotions that the Old Guard must have felt on their way up the hill at Waterloo.|$|E
