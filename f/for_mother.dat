For example, Ido does not derive {{the word for}} {{waitress}} by adding a feminine suffix to waiter, as Esperanto does to derive it from neutral to only feminine.

There are only two exceptions to this rule: First, patro for father, matro <b>for</b> <b>mother,</b> and genitoro for parent, and second, viro for man, muliero for woman, and adulto for adult.|$|E
