5|$|In an African desert {{millions}} of years ago, a tribe of hominids is driven away from its water hole by a rival tribe. They awaken to find a featureless black monolith has appeared before them.

5|$|The {{environment}} {{must be used}} to the player's advantage {{more often}} as the game progresses. The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> to scale the colossi and attack their weak points. However, {{the majority of the}} following fourteen battles require that some aspect of the battlefield be used.|$|E
5|$|N2K {{deliberately}} biased {{its search}} towards closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets (Hot Jupiters) in {{the orbit of}} metal-rich stars, as the consortium hoped to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> the mass of a planet relates to its host star's metal content. Initially, HD 154672 was noted as a host to a short-orbit Hot Jupiter, although additional observations revealed that the prospective planetary body had a longer orbit than previously expected, as revealed by the Magellan Telescopes at Chile's Las Campanas Observatory.|$|E

5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe that is what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
5|$|On the {{practical}} side, microbes {{have been used}} in activities from biological warfare to fermentation in food processing; bread, beer and wine have been produced by yeasts from the dawn of civilisation, such as in ancient Egypt. Microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses are important as pathogens, causing disease to humans, crop plants, and domestic animals. Fermentation is an important source of chemicals, as industrial chemists <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including enzymes and bioactive molecules such as hormones and competitive inhibitors for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as ethanol and methane; fuels may also be produced by algae. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in sewage treatment. In scientific research, yeasts serve as model organisms especially in genetics and related fields.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, everyone in the office is excited when international promos for the documentary surface, but are soon horrified to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> much candid filming has taken place. While everyone panics about their secrets being revealed, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reflects upon how much she and Jim (John Krasinski) have changed over the past nine years. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) makes Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) jealous when he starts dating a Brussels sprout farmer. Meanwhile, at Athlead's office in Philadelphia, Jim and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) have a big meeting with baseball player Ryan Howard, who pitches a bizarre sci-fi sports movie about himself.|$|E

25|$|In June 2002, RNIB Pears Centre for Specialist Learning (then {{known as}} RNIB Rushton School and Children's Home), an RNIB school based in Kettering, Northamptonshire, {{relocated}} to the Exhall Grange campus. However, the two schools remain independent organizations. Also in 2002, {{researchers from the}} University of Warwick worked with pupils at the school {{in a series of}} experiments that involved using ferrets to help <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> blind children perceive space.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{few studies}} have been {{conducted}} on the adults of this species in comparison to those on larval development, mostly due to the importance of blow fly larvae in determining the post mortem interval (PMI) of corpses during investigations by forensic entomologists. For this reason, many researchers have done studies to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> various environmental factors will affect the duration time of larval development in this species (as well as many others).|$|E

25|$|Space {{medicine}} is a developing medical practice that studies {{the health of}} astronauts living in outer space. The main purpose of this academic pursuit is to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> well {{and for how long}} people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can re-adapt to the Earth's environment after returning from space. Space medicine also seeks to develop preventative and palliative measures to ease the suffering caused by living in an environment to which humans are not well adapted.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the recent}} advent of {{non-invasive}} medical techniques, brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> language {{works in the}} brain. For example, severing the corpus callosum (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of epilepsy. Researchers could then study {{the ways in which}} the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.|$|E

It puts together 9 real cases of AIDS discrimination from 1991 to 2006, in which readers can <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> the AIDS infected {{as well as their}} family members fought back against discrimination from outsiders. This book also reveals the hardship faced by the Foundation while it strives for equality for the AIDS infected throughout these years.

25|$|In 2009, Oscar {{and other}} leaders of the Marulu Project {{approached}} the George Institute for Global Health (The George) regarding the possibility of conducting {{a study on the}} prevalence of FASD in Fitzroy Valley. The George had previously developed Yajilarra (2009), a documentary film on Oscar’s group of Aboriginal women’s campaign to limit alcohol consumption in Fitzroy Valley, and was considered a suitable organisation to provide medical research services to the project. The {{purpose of the study was}} to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> many children were affected by FASD, attract funding and resources to provide care for the children affected, and prevent the disorder from occurring.|$|E
25|$|Ms Frizzle's {{class is}} going {{with her on}} the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> {{interesting}} things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises {{up in the air and}} into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.|$|E
25|$|Established in October 2010, the Language and Genetics Department {{is headed}} by Simon E. Fisher. The {{department}} {{takes advantage of the}} latest innovations in molecular methods to <b>discover</b> <b>how</b> the human genome helps to build a language-ready brain. It aims to uncover the DNA variations which ultimately affect different facets of human communicative abilities, not only in children with language-related disorders but also in the general population. Crucially our work attempts to bridge the gaps between genes, brains, speech and language, by integrating molecular findings with data from other levels of analysis, including cell biology, experimental psychology and neuroimaging. In addition, it hopes to trace the evolutionary history and worldwide diversity of key genes, which may shed new light on language origins.|$|E
