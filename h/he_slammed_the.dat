5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
25|$|Egil (Egill)'s boyhood foreshadowed {{his future}} rebelliousness and poetic prowess. His {{unbridled}} behavior and strength beyond his age {{earned him a}} stay at home when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egil's maternal grandfather). Egil defiantly rode a horse to attend, and composed his first skaldic verse at age three. At {{the age of seven}} while playing in the ball games, he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egil was twelve very few grown men could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> friend dead against the ground. Egil was so upset he killed one of his father's favorite workers, and the two were not on speaking terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E
6000|$|MALISE. [With strange, almost {{noiseless}} ferocity] You've run her to earth; your job's done. Kennel up, hounds! [And {{in their}} faces <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> door] ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{being chased}} about, Daffy {{eventually}} turns {{the tables on}} the villains and traps them inside a hallway closet. <b>He</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> door shut on them and [...] with sustained fire from a Tommy gun.|$|R
60|$|With this <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> down <b>the</b> {{lid of the}} chest, and {{the noise}} made them all wink. While they were winking the workman disappeared, tools and all.|$|R
2500|$|Joe Maxson, who {{had been}} hired to replace Lamphere in February 1908, awoke {{in the early hours}} of April 28, 1908, smelling smoke in his room, which was on the second floor of the Gunness house. He opened the hall door to a sheet of flames. Maxson screamed Gunness' name and those of her {{children}} but got no response. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door and then, in his underwear, leapt from the second-story window of his room, barely surviving the fire that was closing in around him. He raced to town to get help, but by the time the old-fashioned hook-and-ladder arrived at the farm at early dawn, the farmhouse was a gutted heap of smoking ruins. Four bodies were found inside the house. [...] One of the bodies was that of a woman who could not immediately be identified as Gunness, since it had no head. The head was never found. The bodies of Gunness' children were found still in their beds. County Sheriff Smutzer had somehow heard about Lamphere’s alleged threats; he took one look at the carnage and quickly sought out the ex-handyman. Leliter came forward to recount his tale about Gunness' will and how she feared Lamphere would kill her and her family and burn her house down.|$|E
2500|$|Hart was {{notorious for}} pulling {{elaborate}} [...] "ribs" [...] (pranks) on fellow wrestlers. During a shoot interview Tony Norris, who wrestled in the WWF during the mid-90's as Ahmed Johnson and faced Hart {{in the ring}} on many occasions, stated that he had {{received a phone call}} saying he was to be featured as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. After spending a large amount of money on new clothes for the occasion, he was told a limousine was to pick him up and deliver him to the studio. After waiting a seemingly long time, he says that Hart appeared and asked him why he wasn't at the show yet. Norris, suspicious as to how Hart could've known about his guest appearance as he had not told anyone, said that Hart was then on the ground laughing; he then realized that Hart was behind the ruse and there was no guest spot on The Tonight Show. Despite this, Norris spoke very highly of Hart and said that he had loved working with him. During the segments of wrestlers sharing stories about Hart during the RAW IS OWEN broadcast following his death, Shane McMahon mentions Hart and himself taking his brother Bret's wrestling boots and hiding them in a shower. Shane mentioned he was fearful of what Bret would do when he found out. In his autobiography, his brother Bret spoke of a time when he, their father Stu, and Bret's oldest daughter Jade were in a hotel room during the WrestleMania IV weekend when Stu received a phone call apparently from former bodybuilder and wrestler Reg Park, who said that he was calling from the hotel's lobby. [...] Having been acquaintances before, Stu was originally cordial until Park supposedly began accusing him of cowardice and challenging him to a confrontation. [...] Bret mentions Stu becoming extremely irritated to the point of anger and was ready to meet Park face to face until <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> phone down, mentioning that it was Owen all along.|$|E
2500|$|At 21:04 (UTC+3), on 8 June 2016, two {{perpetrators}} {{dressed in}} suits and ties {{arrived at the}} Max Brenner Cafe in the Sarona Market complex near HaArba'a Street in Tel Aviv. They inspected the area and then sat down on chairs outside, ordering desserts. At 21:27 the perpetrators stood up and fired at the diners until one of the perpetrators' firearms jammed. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> firearm {{on the floor and}} the perpetrators started to run away from the site. The perpetrators wounded 11 people. Four were critically wounded, and later succumbed to their wounds. Two others were in severe condition, two in moderate condition and four in light condition. An additional 14 people suffering from symptoms of anxiety received medical attention at the scene and at the hospitals. The two did not have an escape plan, an official of the Israel Security Agency said, after investigation, that they [...] "trusted in Allah". The perpetrators fled and split up, and at 21:40, one of the perpetrators was wounded and neutralized after a gunfight with a civil guard of Kol Yisrael and was taken to Ichilov Hospital in serious condition. The other unarmed perpetrator ran in a nearby street, near the Tel Aviv Cinematheque. He encountered an off-duty policeman (who was in plainclothes) and asked him for a glass of water and the unsuspecting policeman invited him into his home with his family. The man then rushed {{to the scene of the}} attack, leaving the perpetrator in his home. The family tried to speak to the perpetrator but he didn't respond and was stressed. The wife of the policeman said she didn't suspect anything and that she thought he was a man who ran from the attack. When the policeman saw the other perpetrator was dressed just like the man he invited into his home, he rushed back to his home and captured the perpetrator who tried to escape. While arresting him, one of the policemen called in to help entered the home with his weapon drawn. When he saw that the perpetrator was already captured, he returned his weapon to its sheath, at which point it discharged a bullet and one of the policemen was wounded from shrapnel.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{hell you}} say!" [...] Belllounds flared up, with scarlet in his face, with sneer of amaze, with promise of {{bursting}} rage. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> down <b>the</b> gun.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mebbe I was drowsing, with Seth running <b>the</b> engine; but <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> on <b>the</b> brakes so sudden {{hard that}} I darn near {{went through the}} cab window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Come along in," [...] {{exploded}} the lieutenant. He {{made the}} same gesture of savage surrender. And <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> into <b>the</b> office, {{the rest of us}} at his heels.|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> gate, Anne {{ran down}} the steps calling his name. He paused, and she caught his sleeve.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> {{door and}} re-entered the room. The boy was there, sitting upon the office stool {{hard at work}} {{with a pair of}} compasses.|$|E
60|$|He {{put his arm}} {{about them}} both. She obeyed silently. There was {{something}} irresistible in his frank, clear eyes, his sunny smile, his strong brown hand. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door behind them.|$|E
50|$|In this {{variation}} of a powerbomb, the attacking wrestler falls to a seated position as <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> opponent down. Some wrestlers remain in seated position to pin the opponent, while others choose not to. The move {{can either be}} performed as a standard powerbomb or as a gutwrench powerbomb. The move was popularized by Jushin Liger, who {{used it as a}} finisher, known as the Liger Bomb. Matt Morgan briefly used it in WWE. It was also famously used by Batista as the Batista Bomb.|$|R
5000|$|Palpatine's Last Moment - Palpatine finally {{realizes the}} true meaning of life and tries {{to make the best of}} his {{situation}} before <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> into <b>the</b> Millennium Falcon's windshield and ends up a frozen, naked corpse in space.|$|R
50|$|During {{the actual}} filming, he {{contracted}} pneumonia and {{was suffering from}} a fever, which intensified his anger over the video. Fenske says he did not notice, but allows that he was nervous and busy since {{it was the first}} video he had directed and he had many other things to pay attention to. According to Hagar, the scene where he folds his arms and refuses to sing, and the end of <b>the</b> video where <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> dressing room door were not staged - he was genuinely angry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came forward}} to follow him, and at the noise of my {{movement}} he stopped dead. I did so too, startled by his quickness of ear. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> house door in my face.|$|E
6000|$|Victor exploded. [...] "Get out," [...] he shouted. [...] "If {{you come}} back here again I'll throw you down the stairs." [...] Thereupon <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door in their faces and {{returned}} to his mother.|$|E
60|$|His large mouth {{expanded}} gradually {{from ear}} to ear after this reply. The elderly gentleman's face became scarlet and his nose purple, and retreating two paces, <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door violently in the rough's face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> went out, <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> {{door behind}} him. Hal watched {{him from the}} window, and saw him turn down Broad Street.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile Gaurav's BMW {{is found}} and the thief is {{revealed}} to be Dharmaa. Gaurav's men track Dharmaa and they capture him and take him to Gaurav, who wants him killed. But Dharmaa attacks <b>the</b> driver and <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> car on to Krishna's sister, thus killing her. Dharmaa escapes and vows to take revenge against Gaurav. Hearing this story from Dharmaa, Krishna too reveals to Dharmaa that his second target is Gaurav and they both decide {{to help each other}} and kill Gaurav. But Krishna silently plots his revenge against Dharmaa too, who happened to kill his sister in the accident.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't think I {{care what}} you do,' he answered, as he flung himself out of <b>the</b> door. <b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> it behind him, and <b>he</b> also <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> front door {{to show that he}} was a man of high principles. And even George Washington when he said, 'I cannot tell a lie; I did it with my little hatchet,' did not feel so righteous as George Griffith at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "You go {{on about}} your business!" [...] roared the New York boy; and as Fred, {{followed}} by Jack, attempted to enter the room, <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door in their faces and shot the bolt into place.|$|E
60|$|But I {{had no time}} {{to finish}} my sentence. He struck at me with both hands like an angry cat, and, {{springing}} back into the room, <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door with a crash in my face.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a moment}} he faced a new possibility. Suppose they could not get back! Suppose the {{mischief}} was done! Suppose that when <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door behind him it locked, and was locked against him for ever! ...|$|E
5000|$|Busch, in his post-race media {{availability}} in the Charlotte Motor Speedway deadline room, {{was asked}} if Dillon's fuel strategy move surprised him, to which he replied [...] "I'm not surprised about anything.

5000|$|Godard then asks Allen {{about the}} {{influence}} of television on his work, saying that Allen's shots of New York City buildings in Hannah and Her Sisters seem to owe something to the way television portrays things. Finding the question obtuse, Allen instead rhapsodizes on his youthful experience of the cinema. In an epilogue, Godard is seen rifling through ephemera and a stack of books on a table. Suddenly, declaring that [...] "the meeting is finished," [...] <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> stack of books down on the table, slowing down the gesture in post production, so that <b>the</b> <b>slam</b> of <b>the</b> books hitting the table has a low, ominous tone. The final intertitle, displayed longer than the others, declares: [...] "Meeting's Over." ...|$|R
50|$|In Rick Ellis' {{theatrical}} {{adaptation of}} the Barry-Pearson novel, Black Stache (portrayed in the original production by Christian Borle, who won a Tony Award for the role) is a witty, poetical, but psychotic pirate prone to malapropisms and the occasional pratfall. Similar to the Disney film character, Black Stache resembles both a dangerous villain and a comic buffoon. The last {{of a line of}} villains, he seeks to become a great villain by fighting a great hero, and finds one in Peter. His hand is cut off not by Peter, but accidentally severed when <b>he</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> lid of a trunk in a fit of a rage.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> {{door just}} in time to prevent a cup from flying {{straight}} into his smiling eyes. After a moment of silent laughter, and with a wink at the men in the [...] "office," [...] he reopened the door and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door, {{and went}} clod, clod, clod, [...] But {{while in the}} porch she bides, He squealed so fierce, 'twas {{as much as she}} could [...] To keep from {{cracking}} her sides, her sides, [...] To keep from cracking her sides.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Mr. Brinsmade, {{with as much}} {{severity}} as he {{was ever}} known to use, [...] "sir, I honor that young man for this more than I can tell you. Nicodemus, you may drive on." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
60|$|And {{with these}} words <b>he</b> went out, <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> door after him. Tom had made an enemy at the very start of {{his career as a}} cadet.|$|R
50|$|The Soldier {{with the}} Green Whiskers is {{suddenly}} overcome by a violent stomach cramp from eating too many pickles. <b>He</b> <b>slams</b> into <b>the</b> control {{panel of the}} Oztober, causing it to take off.

500|$|Daniel Simpson Day – Landis {{remarks in}} a voiceover that D-Day {{has been the}} hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his {{whereabouts}} ranging from a Buddhist monastery in Nepal to the Yukon Territory. Landis eventually approaches a house in Modesto, California, where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, [...] "I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>slams</b> <b>the</b> door in Landis' face and then bursts {{out of the garage}} in a car. He pulls out onto the street to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off.|$|R
