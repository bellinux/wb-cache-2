40|$|Background: Increasing {{the x-ray}} <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance</b> (FFD) has been {{advocated}} {{as an effective}} method to reduce the patients’ radiation dose. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the efficacy of this technique in patients' dose and image quality in pediatric chest x-ray. Material and methods: Sixty pediatric patients were x-ray imaged at FFDs of 100 and 130 cm. Dose measurements were performed using thermo-luminescent dosimeters (GR 200). The quality of images was independently assessed using the anatomical criteria recommended by the European guidelines. Results: Increasing the FFD from 100 to 130 cm has reduced the entrance skin dose (ESD) of patients by 32. 2 % (p 0. 05). Conclusion: Increased FFD to 130 cm reduce the pediatric radiation dose with no significant changes in image quality...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} carried out {{as a part of}} a {{comprehensive}} project to establish a national diagnostic reference level (NDRL), for the first time, in Saudi Arabia. Seven of the most common X-ray examinations (10 projections) were included. This study consisted of 200 patients who were referred for X-ray examinations at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH). The selected X-ray examinations were skull (PA), kub (AP and LAT), ankle (AP and LAT), foot (AP/OBL and LAT/OBL), hib (AP and LAT) and sinuses paranasal (AP). Mean patient information and exposure parameters for these seven radiographic examinations were recorded at KKUH. Some of these radiographic examinations were compared with their corresponding values at other national places [Security Forces Hospital (SFH); King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) ] in Saudi Arabia. We found that the patient mean dose values recorded at KKUH were varied from those recorded at other national places. Wide variations in patient dose arising from a specific type of X-ray examination at different national places suggests that significant reductions in patient dose would be possible without affecting image quality. Furthermore, variations in patient dose may emerge from the examination technique, clinical condition, radiologist skill, tube current, tube potential and <b>focus</b> <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance.</b> The data of this study will be useful for the formulation of NDRLs, and it is also provides local diagnostic reference levels for some diagnostic X-ray examinations at KKUH and other national places in Saudi Arabia...|$|E

To confirm aspects of the proposed model, the behaviour of 001 slices of initially single-domain RTA, patterned with periodic Ag electrodes of spacing 38 mm, as for periodic poling in non-linear optics, were investigated using synchrotron X-ray section topography with the electric field applied in situ while under X-ray illumination at the ID 19 topography beamline of the ESRF, Grenoble. The results of white-beam section topography as both a function of crystal <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance,</b> and under DC voltage are reported, confirming that there is a bending of the planes in the near-surface region. The strain in the near-surface region was examined directly using high-resolution monochromatic X-ray section topography.

40|$|Background and Aim: The basic aim in {{radiography}} is {{to acquire}} a good image from the body organs, but never {{the issue of the}} patient's protection against the harmful effects of ionizing radiation should be neglected. One of the most important factors for assessing the radiation risk is the dose received by sensitive organs such as gonads. Radiation damage to the gonads can be lead to genetic damages at the progeny of the radiated individuals, and that damage can be transmitted to the next generation. Materials and Methods: In this study the thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to measure the entrance skin dose. DAP values for each examination and also the patients information such as age,  size, weight and machine setting like that mA, time, kVp and focal spot <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance</b> were recorded. By means of PCXMC software version 2 gonadal doses were calculated. Results: The maximum dose received by the testicles was for the pelvis AP projection, 0. 45 mGy and for the ovaries maximum dose was for abdomen PA, 0. 306 mGy. The minimum dose received by the testicles and ovaries was for lumbar LAT 0. 065, 0. 101 respectively. Conclusion: One of the ways for patient and gonadal dose reduction is to use appropriate shields for radiosensitive organs such as gonads. Hence its recommended to use appropriate shields for gonads because of their high radiosensitivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The dose of {{radiation}} emitted by an X-ray source and delivered on a target depends on the source tube peak potential (kVp), the current time (mAs) and the source <b>to</b> <b>film</b> <b>distance</b> (FFD). There could be an harmful health effect on the patient if these exposure technique factors are not appropriately selected by the operators of these sources. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study is to survey the choice of these technique factors in X-ray departments in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, while undertaking some common diagnostic X-ray examinations. The common and mostly requested examinations considered were, Chest (PA), Skull (AP), Pelvis (AP) and Abdomen (AP). A total of 48 personnel, 952 adult volunteers in X-ray departments in nine Hospitals took part in the survey. The adults were age between 20 - 75 yrs and body weight 70 ± 13 kg. Variations in the technique factors selected for the different examination were observed when compared with the values in CEC guidelines on quality criteria. The mean tube potential of 125 kVp selected for chest examination in this study is low compared to 180 kVp in the CEC. The mean mAs varies while some departments employed constant mAs for all examination and all patients not taking into account the body thickness of the patient. In skull and pelvis examination, some departments used lower kVps while some selected tube potentials within the CEC range of 70 - 85 kVp and 75 - 90 kVp respectively the mean FFD (162. 0 cm) for chest i...|$|R
