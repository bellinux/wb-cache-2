50|$|An {{issue in}} {{organizational}} technoethics {{in the medical}} field that is an increasing matter is the privacy issue with electronic medical records. To start, some advantages of EMRs are that they can minimize errors, keep <b>records</b> <b>safe</b> in the database, it is cost efficient, translates into a better treatment for the patients and can even give some control over health records to the patients. On the other hand, EMRs have brought upon some disadvantages mainly around privacy issues. First, it threatens a patient's privacy. Having a patient's medical history recorded in the database loses the confidentiality between the doctor and patient since anyone who {{has access to the}} system is able to retrieve these files.|$|R

A&M's Jerry Moss thought the content too risqué for his daughter's ears. This, plus Leonard Grant's severance as manager, added to the discontent. The band instead turned to Bob Krasnow, who was then working for Kama Sutra Records; he recruited them to record for the company's new subsidiary label, Buddah.|$|R

5000|$|Despite his {{middling}} {{grades and}} test scores, Parsons {{was admitted to}} Harvard University's class of 1969 {{on the basis of}} a strong admissions essay. Although he claimed to have studied theology (an oblique reference to his close friendship with his residential tutor, Harvard Divinity School graduate student Jet Thomas) in subsequent interviews, Parsons seldom attended his general education courses before departing after one semester in early 1966. However, he did not become seriously interested in country music until his time at Harvard, where he heard Merle Haggard for the first time. In 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the International Submarine Band. They relocated to Los Angeles the following year, and after several lineup changes signed to Lee Hazlewood's LHI Records, where they spent late 1967 <b>recording</b> <b>Safe</b> at Home. The album contains one of Parsons' best-known songs, [...] "Luxury Liner", and an early version of [...] "Do You Know How It Feels", which he revisited later on in his career. Safe at Home would remain unreleased until mid-1968, by which time the International Submarine Band had broken up.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{several key}} factors that determine nurses' ability {{to complete the}} Botswana Obstetric Record (BOR), an instrument that should help with early diagnosis of problems during pregnancy, labour, delivery and the puerperium. Using a national sample of 309 nurses working in hospitals, clinics and health posts under the local government authority in Botswana, {{the study found that}} a nurse's ability to complete the BOR was significantly related to midwifery training, level of basic nursing training, age group, level of income, job satisfaction, adequacy of equipment, attendance of refresher courses, overall level of in-service training, reliance on workshops and seminars, peer reliance and self-reliance for information on new nursing practices. Multivariate analyses indicated that the most competent nurse in completing the BOR was one trained as a midwife, working in an adequately equipped health facility, and who often consulted with peers as well as attended workshops and seminars. The study concludes that {{it is more important to}} train all nurses to become midwives than to upgrade enrolled nurses to become registered nurses if the plan for safe motherhood is to be advanced. Further research is needed to establish the objective competence of nurses who claim to be comfortable completing the BOR.

Objective: The aim of the study was to assess the views of physiCians, patients and nurses of medical records services and physicians' views on the use of electronic medical records. Methods: The study was conducted With physiCians, nurses and patients selected randomly from the Military hospital in Riyadh. The data was collected via a self- administered, pilot-tested, internally consistent questionnaire. Results: On the staff of medical records, the highest mean score was obtained for confidentiality (2. 92), and the lowest for the training of medical staff (1. 88). On medical record documents, the highest mean score was reported for ''information is confidentially maintained" (2. 70), and the lowest for the organization of files within file sections (2. 28). On the Medical Records Department, the highest mean score was reported for overstaffing (2. 89), and the lowest for receptiveness of receptionists (2. 27).

40|$|Abstract: The study {{represents}} {{a novel approach}} taken towards car detection, feature extraction and classification in a video. Though many methods have been proposed to deal with individual features of a vehicle, like edge, license plate, corners, no system has been implemented to combine features. Combination of four unique features, namely, color, shape, number plate and logo gives the application a stronghold on various applications like surveillance recording to detect accident percentage(for every make of a company), authentication of {{a car in the}} Parliament(for high security), learning system(readily available knowledge for automobile tyro enthusiasts) with increased accuracy of matching. Video surveillance is a security solution for government buildings, facilities and operations. Installing this system can enhance existing security systems or help start a comprehensive security solution that can keep the building, employees and <b>records</b> <b>safe.</b> The system uses a Haar cascaded classifier to detect a car in a video and implements an efficient algorithm to extract the color of it along with the confidence rating. An gadabouts trained classifier is used to detect the logo (Suzuki/Toyota/Hyunadai) of the car whose accuracy is enhanced by implementing SURF matching. A combination of blobs and contour tracing is applied for shape detection and model classification while number plate detection is performed in a smart and efficient algorithm which uses morphological operations and contour tracing.

The Violations group were at the other extreme, and the Accidents group intermediate. Hence the Safe group appeared more prompt in detecting danger, but less abrupt in responding to it, than did the groups with infractions. In terms of consistency across six hazards or 10 baselines, reliability (Cronbach's alpha) ranged from 0. 48 to 0. 99.
