The algorithm allows to obtain a {{crack growth rate}} diagram in terms of creep stress intensity factor. The proposed algorithm is realized on steel compact tension specimens (12 Х 1 MF). Crack growth rate was determined on standard compact specimens under temperature 550 °C. The waveforms for the loading and unloading portions were trapezoidal, and the loading/unloading times were held constant – 5 s. A hold time of predetermined duration, 60 s, was superimposed on the trapezoidal waveforms at maximum load. The potential drop and the unloading compliance methods were used to monitor crack length during the creep–fatigue tests.
