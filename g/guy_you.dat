[...] In addition, Mustaine announced on Twitter that producer Johnny K was [...] "suddenly struck ill", and the band had ceased recording for the time being. However, the band resumed recording a few days later, with K having apparently recovered.

Speedie {{introduced}} himself to Brown, only to be told, [...] "Yes, I know. You're the one who went to Canada." [...] Speedie's friends and former teammates lobbied repeatedly for his inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but Speedie believed that his conflict with Brown was keeping him out even as numerous former teammates, including Otto Graham, Dante Lavelli and Marion Motley were inducted. He was placed on an old-timers' list of nominees for induction into the hall in the mid-1980s, but ultimately was passed over.

You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the script}} for Strange Days was {{completed}} in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role [...] "required somebody who had {{a tremendous amount of}} intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply." [...] Cameron, however, felt that a [...] "glibber and slicker" [...] actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny [...] "a sexier character—a <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> can care about very much." [...] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.|$|E

500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> want to see fight. Then you work {{your way to the}} time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 2005, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, co-stars of The Ring Two (2005), {{were cast}} as Wendy Christensen and Kevin Fischer.

Wong {{said that he had}} originally intended for Wendy to be a [...] "perky blonde" [...] and reworked the character slightly after Winstead was cast; he believed the actors were right for their roles. On Winstead, he said that [...] " [...] a kind of soulfulness to her role as Wendy" [...] and her character [...] "is deeply affected by the accident, but she's strong, and fights to maintain control". On Merriman, he said that [...] "the moment [...] came in I thought he was the right guy to play Kevin" [...] and described the character as [...] "the kind of <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> want to hang out with, your goofy best buddy, but also someone who could rise to the occasion and become a hero".|$|E
500|$|Thome's {{friendly}} personality {{has been}} the subject of much attention. In a 2007 poll of 464 MLB players, he tied with Mike Sweeney for second-friendliest player, behind Sean Casey. After Thome hit his 600th home run, Twins closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "He is the world's nicest man." [...] Teammate Michael Cuddyer added, [...] "He is the nicest, gentlest, kindest <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> will ever meet... to everything except the baseball, he still hits that really hard." [...] His kindness comes up in conversations with many MLB players. When he signed with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. cited Thome's constant positive attitude as a main reason for his signing. As an exercise in remaining humble, he annually visited his high school prior to spring training. A Sports Illustrated article said that Thome frequently signs autographs for fans and that he is [...] "endlessly patient with requests". In a piece for Philadelphia magazine discussing Thome's Baseball Hall of Fame prospects, sportswriter Stephen Silver wrote, [...] A fan poll in The Plain Dealer in 2003 named him the most popular athlete in Cleveland sports history.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work.

500|$|... "Sweet Dreams" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed {{for its use}} of electronic bassline, which some critics compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Beat It" [...] because of its electropop sound. [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] is derived from contemporary R and incorporates influences from the classic 1980s funk. [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] is a midtempo piano ballad. Its production and melody is backed by strings and a drum machine beat. According to Spence D. of IGN Music, [...] "Hello" [...] comes off like another ballad that [...] "populate {{the first part of}} the album." [...] It contains the Jerry Maguire line – [...] "You had me at hello" [...] – as part of its chorus. It essentially consists of [...] "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies." [...] According to critics, [...] "Video Phone" [...] contains lyrics that are in reference to [...] "a celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, for a <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> just met at the club".

Musically the song consists of simple lyrics, with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Beyoncé and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. [...] "Disappear" [...] consists of [...] "sweet guitar-picking and delicate harmonies". [...] "That's Why You're Beautiful" [...] is a slow-tempo soft rock and rock power ballad, which consists of a [...] "grungy" [...] guitar riff and stuterring drums.

Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant <b>guy,</b> <b>you</b> can do the things that no one else wants to do.
