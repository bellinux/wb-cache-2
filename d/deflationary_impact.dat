As a benchmark, we show that under perfect wage-price flexibility `uncertainty irrelevance' holds, when monetary uncertainty is appropriately defined. The introduction of wage stickiness causes future monetary uncertainty to raise the nominal interest rate, with a <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> on current price and output, for plausible parameterizations.

40|$|Based on a post-Keynesian {{model of}} the {{relationship}} between wages, prices and employment, this paper begins by studying the extent to which unit labour cost trends have been responsible for disinflation and deflationary tendencies in Germany and Europe. Thereafter, the reasons for the deflationary development of unit labour costs in recent years, in particular in Germany, are analysed. Finally, the impact of deflationary wage policies on German and European stagnation are discussed and it is concluded that the excessive wage restraint in Germany not only exacerbates stagnation and deflationary tendencies in Germany but might also have a <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> on the other EMU countries.

40|$|A {{question}} featuring {{prominently in}} policy {{debates over the}} last few years is whether Australia can gain from having smaller government. Proponents have stressed beneficial impacts on the supply side of the economy; opponents have stressed the <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> from possible reductions in demand. This article provides a quantitative assessment of this essentially empirical question, namely, whether supply or demand responses would dominate. It suggests that over the short term, demand contraction may be important. In the longer term, increased incentives can expand Australia's productive capacity, although incentives to work longer appear less important than incentives created for capital accumulation. But the longer term expansion may be crucially dependent on foreign investor acquiescence to increased involvement in the Australian economy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the international transmission effects that a positive supply shock in emerging economies {{may have on}} inflation in developed economies. We construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model for three countries and analyze {{the impact of a}} supply shock in an emerging economy, the People's Republic of China (PRC), on inflation rates in two developed economies, the United States (US) and Japan. We demonstrate that the assumed asymmetric trade structures among the three countries and the PRC&'s choice of exchange rate regime influence the international transmission of a supply shock in the PRC. Specifically, Japan is under a greater deflationary pressure than the US because of its vertical trade specialization vis- 0 -vis the PRC and the PRC's USdollar- pegged regime. This outcome suggests that, even though Japan and the US may face common positive supply shocks from emerging economies, the <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> of the shock is greater for Japan...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the emerging belief among early modern economic historians that sixteenth-century inflation was primarily caused by monetary factors. The Scottish case study reveals a strong relationship between coinage debasement and rising prices, a contention strengthened {{by the fact that}} the Scottish experience of inflation was high in European terms, and, in particular, stands at a considerable distance from the English pattern. This study includes the first scholarly examination of prices during the 1540 s, and reveals that substantial inflation first emerged during this hitherto neglected decade. Prices plateaued during the 1550 s, and rose consistently from 1560 to 1585. Meanwhile real wages declined during the 1540 s and from 1560 onwards. This article is methodologically innovative in constructing two baskets of commodities, designed to represent the elite experience, alongside a more traditional basket based on a working household. These reveal the divergent experiences of the price rise within Scotland: rising prices hit the poor harder than the rich due to the high cost of domestic agricultural goods in the subsistence basket and the <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> of wages and luxury goods upon the overall elite basket...|$|E
40|$|The co-movement of US {{stock markets}} and the dollar The {{relationship}} between US stock {{markets and the}} dollar {{has been the subject}} of increased interest recently. In part, this interest reflects the view that portfolio flows may have exerted an important influence on recent movements of the major exchange rates (BIS (2000)). Indeed, while fixed income securities still account for the bulk of cross-border financial transactions, equities markets are playing an increasing role in such transactions. In 1995, cross-border transactions in bonds into and out of the United States amounted to 110 % of US GDP, more than five times the corresponding ratio for equity flows. In 1999, cross-border transactions in bonds rose to 126 % of US GDP, while transactions in equities tripled and reached 75 % of US GDP. From a policy point of view, the interest in this topic reflects in part concerns about the current high valuation of the US stock market and the consequent global <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> should the dollar fall along with that market. The co-movement of returns on US stock markets and the dollar along with other related statistics are reported in Table III. 1.

40|$|Of all the {{institutional}} arrangements for monetary union in Europe, the fiscal convergence criteria have proved {{the most difficult}} to achieve and the most controversial because of their presumed <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> on economies already suffering high unemployment. This paper examines what fiscal corrections would be necessary in the four largest European economies to reach the 3 % deficit criterion by 1999, and to maintain that criterion thereafter. It argues that because these criteria are defined as ratios, a change in the policy mix is required – not simply fiscal contractions. The interaction between fiscal and other policies is the crucial factor therefore. The change in policy mix might involve monetary relaxation, a currency depreciation, or perhaps most effectively, wage restraint to boost competitiveness. Certainly some action is needed to maintain (or boost) the ratio’s denominator, since fiscal cuts will otherwise cut both the numerator and denominator and leave the ratio unchanged. But, because there is also a debt criterion and it is most unlikely that the deficit and debt criteria are reached simultaneously, {{it is very hard to}} reach the deficit criterion and stay there without accompanying policies designed to maintain output. Fiscal cuts will otherwise continue to deflate the economy, and hence inflate the deficit ratio, in an attempt to reach the required debt ratio. To offset this there must be reform of the tax regime as well. These results point to growth and the design of the tax regime as being the key features of the fiscal side of a successful monetary union. Convergence Criteria; Monetary Union; Policy Mix...|$|E
40|$|An ideal {{system of}} {{international}} payments should {{be characterized by}} stability and balance: stability in exchange rates {{and the absence of}} sudden crises, and balance in the sense that individual national economies should suffer neither from the deflationary effects of chronic external deficits nor the distorting consequences of chronic external surpluses. Both requirements are essential to the efficient international movement of capital. Yet neither requirement appears to have been met by the current dollar-based reserve currency system. Recurrent crises in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and chronic and growing U. S. payments deficits (with their associated <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact)</b> are long-standing characteristics of the current system. This chapter argues that the problems just described are fundamental aspects of the present system and that, without reform, they will continue to plague the global economy. However, a simple set of institutional reforms {{would go a long way}} toward alleviating these difficulties. In order to understand the need for and nature of these reforms, we begin by analyzing the dynamics of the current system using a simple global macroeconomics framework. Within this context, we examine a number of proposed explanations for current imbalances and ultimately focus on a small number of potentially responsible factors. They bear a striking similarity to those which Keynes cited in connection with the failure of the pre-Bretton Woods system. The chapter then lays out reforms designed to alleviate these problems. Finally, it ends with a broader analysis of the costs and benefits of such a reformed system...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether the euro area Phillips curve is nonlinear. There has recently been a great deal of discussion and studies concerning the same question in the US context. The data set includes most of the euro area countries, namely Austria, Germany, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Estimation is made both with pooled data and with country-specific models. The results give a clear indication of nonlinearity of the Phillips curve in many euro countries. The curve is asymmetric in the sense that, with a positive output gap (actual output is greater than potential output), its impact on inflation is positive, but, with a negative output gap, the <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> is very small and not significant as a rule. The Phillips curve has been especially asymmetric in Germany, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. An important result of the study is the strong negative influence of inflation uncertainty on GDP in the euro countries during the estimation period, 1976 - 1997. This effect was very strong in pooled data but also at country level. This result is new in the sense that a Lucas-type supply function and especially nonlinear versions of it have not been estimated very often. Another interesting result is that Phillips curves can be estimated with good success using OECD Secretariat forecast data for inflation expectations. A very important result for monetary policy are the large differences between countries as regards the slope and shape of the Phillips curve. The policy implication of nonlinearity is clear. The costs of unduly expansive monetary policy could be high in the euro area in the medium term. Nonlinearity also means that inflation pressure in the euro area is dependent not only on the average demand situation but also on how economic activity is distributed across the region.

40|$|There {{is a new}} {{approach}} to modeling business cycles that is gaining acceptance. It appears that there is good evidence that this approach may have a great deal to offer in understanding the causes and processes of major economic business cycles associated with financial crisis. This paper does not intend to define a mathematical model but instead describes the ideas and theories behind this {{new approach}}. In addition, this paper addresses a few of the unique challenges officials within the United States face with the current global crisis. The new approach has at its core the belief that the structure of our current economy, as well as many European economies, has changed significantly. Starting around 1983 - 1985 a structural break occurred that resulted in a period where changes in GDP, consumption and inflation ceased to experience high volatility. This period has been dubbed “The Great Moderation” and it is significant. It is thought that these new economies have specific characteristics that generate endogenous financial business cycles. That is, these cycles are not triggered by exogenous supply or demand shocks that throw an economy off of a steady state but instead are an endogenous force within the gears of the system itself that creates imbalances that can build up without any noticeable increase in inflation - the traditional parameter typically used to monitor imbalances. The main characteristic of this new era of Great Moderation is rapidly rising growth coupled with low and stable prices which is highly correlated with an increase in the probability of episodes of financial instability (Borio 2003). In fact, within these new economies inflation shows up first as excess demand within credit aggregates and asset prices rather than in the traditional goods and services markets. This means that a financial crisis could occur without inflation ever having occurred within the broader economy. If asset bubbles are left unattended the resulting implosion of the bubbles can create virulent deflationary episodes. And it is the unwinding of the financial imbalances caused by the bubbles that are the source of financial instability. And {{it is worth noting that}} minimizing the <b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> will not stop the necessary unwinding and required rebalancing. Again, this paper does not intend to define a model but instead simply lays out the ideas and theories behind this new modeling approach. This paper will first compare the traditional to the new modeling approach by first describing the economic environment that creates the business cycle. Secondly it will compare the two paradigms and explain how each generates different questions and answers in monitoring and explaining economic stability. Finally, I touch on a few of the unique challenges facing our current crisis within the United States. ...|$|E
40|$|Whether or not {{to provide}} {{financial}} assistance to GMH (Holden) and other manufacturers in Australia is the wrong question to ask. The industry is just too strategically important to lose. What would happen if government withdrew financial assistance to industry as the ‘free marketeers’ advocate? They argue that it {{would result in a}} more efficient allocation of resources, ensuring that only the most profitable and productive companies survive and flourish. They say that government must unleash businesses from the shackles of dependency and set them free to sink or swim in the global market place. Fierce competition in a world where companies minimise their labour costs and maximise their profits is the free market dream. We will all be winners, won’t we? The problem with free marketeerism is that it imagines a strangely utopian self-leveling world where any effort to support the free movement of labour and capital generates optimal economic outcomes. A real world example for this is the debate over the future of GMH (Holden) in Adelaide. There are two schools of thought prevailing. One says don’t provide any further assistance and see what happens. If GMH goes it will free up labour and capital to be more efficiently utlised in other industries. The other school of thought argues that government assistance to industry generates benefits well beyond those captured directly by GMH. In other words, the existence of a technologically sophisticated manufacturing facility like GMH fosters technological innovation throughout the region in which it exists, sustaining a high skill workforce that in turn underpins a higher standard of living than would otherwise be the case. The free marketeers reject this, arguing that resources once devoted to the auto industry would be more profitably employed elsewhere, in mining or other industries with strong growth prospects. The problem with this is that mining is equipment intensive, generating relatively few jobs, particularly when minerals are processed off shore. It also has fewer downstream benefits for other sectors, fostering less innovation than manufacturing operations. Increased reliance on mining also has a perverse impact on the exchange rate as we are witnessing at the moment with a sustained high Australian dollar. This is damaging the competitiveness of non-mining export industries. The free marketeers pleas for the abandonment of industry assistance ignores fundamental realities about the role of government in industry development since the industrial revolution. Industrialists have always been the beneficiaries of government investment and governments the beneficiaries of industry development. The forms of government assistance to industry might have changed over the last 100 years but {{there has never been a}} time when that assistance was withdrawn entirely. Some forms of industry assistance are perverse just as some corporate tax breaks are – they can have little impact on productivity and jobs. Assistance to the automotive industry has changed radically over the last 20 years from the blunt instrument of high tariffs on imported vehicles to targeted support for auto industry rationalisation and transformation to more fuel-efficient green cars. If free marketeers had their way on industry assistance we would lose the heart of our manufacturing industry to China and India in the vein hope that other industries fill the hole that is left. Lets just focus on the auto industry for a minute. Imagine filling a hole that was once occupied by a $ 4 billion per year components supply sector, a $ 4 billion per year vehicle and components export business, a sector generating 60, 000 jobs and $ 5 billion in wages and salaries and investments in R&D of over $ 700 million. This is a big hole that mining industry growth will not fill. Just how big a hole might the loss of GMH create if it were to close its operations in Adelaide? It employs around 2700 people and purchased around $ 530 million from a range of suppliers. My colleague, Associate Professor Barry Burgan for the Department of Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade Resources and Energy, recently undertook modeling of the significance of the industry to South Australia. The Burgan report reveals that GMH’s activities involve total expenditure in South Australia of around $ 930 million, contribute $ 520 million to economic growth and support around 5600 jobs. The total economic activity associated with GMH operations was estimated to be $ 1. 1 billion and around 11, 700 jobs. Taking into account any potential benefits that might flow from closure (<b>deflationary</b> <b>impact</b> on wages and housing costs) the closure could lead to losses of between $ 500 million to $ 1. 5 billion per annum in economic activity and 5950 to 16, 100 jobs in South Australia. The State Budget could be hit by losses ranging from $ 25 million to $ 83 million. Lets put all of this in the context of the industry assistance debate surrounding GMH. The best estimate of the level of assistance GMH might be seeking is between $ 150 million to $ 200 million over four years. Weighting the gains up against the losses suggests that targeted assistance to GMH is a smart investment so long as it is part of a wider strategy to help sustain the automotive industry in Australia. The signals to the industry have been mixed over the last few years with the abandonment of the Green Car Innovation Fund generating unhelpful policy uncertainty. Meanwhile the Coalition is divided in its view about whether to provide financial support to manufacturing industry at all. They have been captured by the Productivity Commissions scorched earth view that government should withdraw financial support from the automotive industry. The free marketeers dominate our major public policy institutions to our great detriment, fuelling the propagation of naïve and populist views in the hallways of Canberra and among the Third Estate. As commentators dissected Kevin Rudd’s Washington resignation speech for nuance and meaning, one contacted me to ask what was the significance of his remarks about pressures facing manufacturing industry in Australia. There is a long and short answer to this question. The short is that he announced the Green Car Innovation Fund that was axed by the Gillard Government to make budget savings. Rudd made that announcement with former Industry Minister, Kim Carr who was demoted in a Cabinet reshuffle by Julia Gillard. Former Australian Manufacturing Workers Union National Secretary, Doug Cameron was among the few to speak out in support of Kevin Rudd in the head of the leadership contest. He called for an inquiry into manufacturing industry last year – a call rejected by his leader. Given the pressures facing manufacturing in Australia including job losses of around 100, 000 nationally over the last four years we might just see a review of Australian manufacturing policy in the near future. Julia Gillard would benefit from it. – John Spoehr Photo: Flickr / brizzle born and bre...|$|E
