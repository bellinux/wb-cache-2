50|$|Radiotherapy aims to {{minimize}} the size of tumors and kill cancer cells with high energy. The source of high energy arises from x-rays, gamma rays, charged particles and heavy particles. The therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy for cancer treatment {{is related to the}} maximum radiation dose by which death of cancer cells is locally controlled and the minimum radiation dose by which cells in normal tissues have low acute and late morbidity. Both of parameters have sigmoidal dose-response curves. Thus, a favorable outcome in dose-response curve is the response of tumor tissue is greater than that of normal tissue to the same dose, meaning that the treatment is effective to tumors and does not cause serious morbidity to normal tissue. Reversely, overlapping response of two tissues is highly likely to cause serious morbidity to normal tissue and ineffective treatment to tumors. The mechanism of radiation therapy is categorized into direct and indirect radiation. Both of direct and indirect radiations induce DNAs to have a mutation or chromosomal rearrangement during its repair process. Direct radiation creates a free DNA radical from radiation energy deposition that damages DNA. Indirect radiation occurs from radiolysis of water, creating a <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical,</b> hydronium and electron. Then, hydroxyl radical transfers its radical to DNA. Or together with hydronium and electron, a <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> can damage base region of DNA. Cancer cells have imbalance of signals in cell cycle. G1 and G2/M arrest are found to be major checkpoints by irradiation in human cells. G1 arrest delays repair mechanism before synthesis of DNA in S phase and mitosis in M phase, suggesting key checkpoint to lead survival of cells. G2/M arrest occurs when cells need to repair after S phase before the mitotic entry. It was also known that S phase is the most resistant to radiation and M phase was the most sensitive to radiation. p53, a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in G1 and G2/M arrest, enabled the understanding of the cell cycle by radiation. For example, irradiation to myeloid leukemia cell leads to an increase in p53 and a decrease in the level of DNA synthesis. Patients with Ataxia telangiectasia delays have hypersensitivity to radiation due to the delay of accumulation of p53. In this case, cells are able to replicate without repair of their DNA, prone to incidence of cancer. Most cells are in G1 and S phase and irradiation at G2 phase showed increased radiosensitivity and thus G1 arrest has been on focus for therapeutic treatment.Irradiation to a tissue creates response to both irradiated and non-irridiated cells. It was found that even cells up to 50-75 cell diameter distant from irradiated cells have phenotype of enhanced genetic instability such as micronucleation. This suggests the effect of cell-to-cell communication such as paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Normal cells do not lose DNA repair mechanism whereas cancer cells often lose during radiotherapy. However, the nature of high energy radiation can override the ability of damaged normal cell to repair, leading to cause another risk for carcinogenesis. This suggests a significant risk associated with radiation therapy. Thus, it is desirable to improve the therapeutic ratio during radiotherapy. Employing IG-IMRT, protons and heavy ions are likely {{to minimize}} dose to normal tissues by altered fractionation. Molecular targeting to DNA repair pathway can lead to radiosensitization or radioprotection. Examples are direct and indirect inhibitors on DNA double-strand breaks. Direct inhibitors target proteins (PARP family) and kinases (ATM, DNA-PKCs) that are involved in DNA repair. Indirect inhibitors target proteins tumor cell signaling proteins such as EGFR and insulin growth factor.|$|E

In Parkinson's disease, {{there appears to}} be selective degeneration of the most heavily pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra, and this process has been linked to the presence of neuromelanin. It has been postulated that neuromelanin could increase the risk of oxidative stress reactions. On the other hand, melanin is usually considered to be an efficient antioxidant. Here we analyze experimental conditions that stimulate, or inhibit, antioxidant properties of neuromelanin. Using electron spin resonance (ESR) - spin trapping technique and salicylate hydroxylation assay, we monitored the formation of <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> generated by a Fenton system in the presence of varying concentration of dopamine-melanin, a synthetic model for neuromelanin. Our data clearly indicate that the antioxidant action of neuromelanin is predominantly due to its ability to sequester redox-active metal ions such as iron. Using direct ESR spectroscopy, we have shown that ferric complexes with neuromelanin are resistant to reduction by mild biological reductants such as ascorbate. We have demonstrated that dopamine-melanin saturated with ferric ions, could enhance the formation of <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> by redox activation of the ions. Thus, under the conditions that stimulate the release of accumulated metal ions, neuromelanin may actually become an efficient prooxidant.

40|$|The use of dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) as {{a measure}} of {{reactive}} oxygen species was studied in aqueous media. Hydrogen peroxide oxidized DCFH to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF), and the oxidation was amplified by the addition of ferrous iron. Hydrogen peroxide-induced DCF formation in the presence of ferrous iron was completely inhibited by deferoxamine and partially inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, but was augmented by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Iron-peroxide-induced oxidation of DCFH was partially inhibited by catalase but not by horseradish peroxidase. Nonchelated iron-peroxide oxidation of DCFH was partially inhibited by several hydroxyl radical scavengers, but was independent of the scavenger concentration, and this suggests that <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> is not involved in the oxidation of DCFH in this system. Superoxide anion did not directly oxidize DCFH. Data suggest that H 2 O 2 -Fe 2 + -derived oxidant is mainly responsible for the nonenzymatic oxidation of DCFH. In addition, peroxidase alone and oxidants formed during the reduction of H 2 O 2 by peroxidase oxidize DCFH. Since DCFH oxidation may be derived from several reactive intermediates, interpretation of specific reactive oxygen species involved in biological systems should be approached with caution. However, DCFH remains an attractive probe as an overall index of oxidative stress in toxicological phenomena. © 1992, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved...|$|E

Intracellular defense systems that protect cells from ROS-induced damage include glutathione reductase (GR), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), superoxide dismutase (Sod), and catalase (Cat) [2]. Sod and Cat constitute an evolutionary conserved ROS defense system against superoxide; Sod converts superoxide anions to H 2 O 2, and Cat prevents <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> formation by breaking down H 2 O 2 into oxygen and water [2]. As a consequence, they are important effectors in the life span determination of the fly Drosophila[3 – 7]. ROS defense by TrxR and GR is more indirect. They transfer reducing equivalents from NADPH to thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG), respectively, resulting in Trx(SH) 2 and glutathione (GSH), which act as effective intracellular antioxidants [2, 8]. TrxR and GR {{were found to be}} molecularly conserved [9]. However, the single GR homolog of Drosophila[10, 11] specifies TrxR activity [12], which compensates for the absence of a true GR system for recycling GSH [12].

Non-thermal plasmas also have been used in the other medical field like tissue treatment, blood coagulation, surface modification, and treatment of skin cancer. Some of these processes also are accompanied by sterilization. Compared to the conventional water sterilization methods such as irradiation, heat, chemicals (like chlorination, ozonation), high pressure, filtration, plasma sterilization has its own merit, for example, high efficiency, low cost and less by-product. the most recently investigation represented that plasma sterilization can be more efficient in acidic environment then distilled water.

40|$|Despite {{a wealth}} of {{experimental}} evidence concerning {{the efficacy of the}} biocidal action associated with the TiO 2 photocatalytic reaction, our understanding of the photochemical mechanism of this particular biocidal action remains largely unclear. It is generally accepted that the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which is generated on the surface of UV-illuminated TiO 2, plays the main role. However, our understanding of the exact mode of action of the hydroxyl radical in killing microorganisms is far from complete, and some studies report that other reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H 2 O 2 and O 2 ·−, etc.) also play significant roles. In particular, whether hydroxyl radicals remain bound to the surface or diffuse into the solution bulk is under active debate. In order to examine the exact mode of action of ROS in inactivating the microorganism, we tested and compared the levels of photocatalytic inactivation of MS- 2 phage and Escherichia coli as representative species of viruses and bacteria, respectively. To compare photocatalytic microbial inactivation with the photocatalytic chemical degradation reaction, para-chlorobenzoic acid, which rapidly reacts with a hydroxyl radical with a diffusion-limited rate, was used as a probe compound. Two different hydroxyl radical scavengers, tert-butanol and methanol, and an activator of the bulk phase hydroxyl radical generation, Fe 2 +, were used to investigate their effects on the photocatalytic mode of action of the hydroxyl radical in inactivating the microorganism. The results show that the biocidal modes of action of ROS are very different depending on the specific microorganism involved, although {{the reason for this is}} not clear. It seems that MS- 2 phage is inactivated mainly by the <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> in the solution bulk but that E. coli is inactivated by both the free and the surface-bound hydroxyl radicals. E. coli might also be inactivated by other ROS, such as O 2 ·− and H 2 O 2, according to the present results...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation:	FENTON & FENTON-LIKE REACTIONS: THE NATURE OF OXIDIZING INTERMEDIATES INVOLVED Nixon Ogendi	 Mwebi, Doctor of Philosophy, 2005 Dissertation Directed by:	Professor Neil V. Blough Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical and peroxy radicals {{are involved in the}} pathophysiology of aging and a multitude of diseases such as cancer, as well as neurodegenerative disorders. These ROS are believed to result in part from Fenton and Fenton-like reactions mainly involving reactions between metal ions or metal complexes and hydrogen peroxide. The exact nature of oxidizing intermediates involved in these Fenton reactions remains uncertain and is still a matter of considerable interest. Although many studies have been conducted examining the nature of these intermediates, a number of these have been inconclusive due to experimental artifacts in the analytical techniques involved. A highly sensitive and selective technique is hereby employed to quantify the magnitude of species involved in these reactions. The intermediate species involved in the Fenton and Fenton-like reactions have been shown to react with both dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and (for the first time) methane to yield methyl radicals. A comparison of the product yields in the DMSO and methane experiments performed under identical conditions yield product ratios close to those expected for <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> (OH). Competition studies between the primary OH scavengers, DMSO or methane with nitroxide and benzoic acid yield product distributions typical of those expected for free OH, clearly indicating free OH involvement. Free OH involvement is manifested both at acidic pH (4. 2) and neutral pH (7. 4) in Fenton reactions with both organic and inorganic metal complexes of iron. The yield of product II associated with free OH is found to decrease with increasing pH possibly due to competing side reactions. Fenton reactions in the presence of ferric ions indicate that the species formed in the reaction of OH with Fe (III), (possibly ferryl species, FeIV) oxidize DMSO to yield methyl radicals, but fail to oxidize methane, thereby providing a simple method to discriminate between free OH and the high valent metal species...|$|E

In patiens we detected whether preemptive analgesia had a positive effect on acute postoperative pain. Objective evaluation of pain intensity is a long-term problem because the objectification of using electrophysiological and imaging methods is currently difficult and expensive, and therefore in laboratories in the Czech Republic and many other places are used the evaluation by means biochemical methods. We implemented large experimental studies using mechanical, inflammatory and visceral nociception and we found out in particular that nitroxid and <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> and singlet oxygen increased significantly after nociceptive stimulation. This increase can be suppressed by antioxidants. At the same time, we showed that some parameters of metabolism lipids, carbohydrates and proteins have also been changed.

40|$|The {{sequential}} univalent {{reduction of}} oxygen {{gives rise to}} very reactive intermediate products including superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals.</b> Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is severely limited; however, if oxygen free radicals are produced {{in excess of the}} capacity of the tissues to eliminate them, they may cause serious damage. The biochemistry and possible sources of free radical generation in animal models of ischemic/reperfusion injury are reviewed. The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals to improve mechanical, mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic/reperfusion injury suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial injury in these models. Future research should be directed at establishing the relevance of oxygen radical-mediated myocardial injury in the experimental setting to analogous clinical situations...|$|R
40|$|La mia tesi di dottorato tratta problematiche inerenti alla risposta cellulare al danno al DNA in linee cellulari di pazienti affetti da Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T), una sindrome genetica dovuta alla mutazione del gene ATM codificante per una proteina essenziale per il mantenimento della stabilità genomica. Questa malattia manifesta aspetti clinici molto gravi come la predisposizione al cancro e la neurodegenerazione. Ho affrontato la questione attraverso due punti di vista analizzando, cioè, la sensibilità di queste cellule sia alle radiazioni che allo stress ossidativo in termini di induzione di danno primario al DNA e formazione di aberrazioni cromosomiche. Nel primo caso ho anche saggiato il ruolo della proteina p 53 (un target di ATM nella risposta cellulare al danno al DNA) nella riparazione delle rotture a doppia elica (DSBs). Nel secondo ho comparato l’effetto della LCarnitina, una molecola coinvolta nel processo di formazione di energia per la cellula, con quella del Mannitolo, un noto {{scavenger}} di radicali liberi ossidrilici, nel tentativo di ridurre gli effetti deleteri dello stress ossidativo nelle cellule A-T. Abbiamo dimostrato che la proteina p 53 interviene nel processo di riparazione delle DSBs in cellule A-T, favorendo il processo di “rejoining” delle estremità rotte. Inoltre abbiamo riscontrato che il pre-trattamento con L-Carnitina riduce il livello di stress ossidativo in cellule A-T in modo più marcato rispetto al Mannitolo agendo a tempi precoci dopo la formazione della lesione. DNA {{damage is}} one of the most critical threats to cellular homeostasis and life. In order to activate multiple signalling pathways at once, sophisticated sensing and transduction systems evolved to convey the damage signal simultaneously to multiple effectors. The ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein plays a central role in such a system. This protein kinase, identified as the product of the gene that is mutated (lost or inactivated) in the human genetic disorder Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T), is responsible for sounding the alarm throughout the cell announcing the presence of one of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions, the double-strand break. Cells from A-T patients exhibit chromosomal instability and extreme sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents such as ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals. Notwithstanding, several features of the clinical and cellular phenotypes of A-T, in particular neurodegeneration and premature aging, suggest that defective cells may chronically suffer from increased oxidative stress. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that ATM-deficient cells are unusually sensitive to the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide. In this thesis we try to elucidate the mechanisms of DNA damage response in A-T cell lines handling this issue from two point of view. First, we analysed the the modulating effect of pre-treatment with L-carnitine (L-C) on oxidative stress-induced DNA damage both in normal and ATM-deficient lymphoblastoid cell lines. To understand the mechanism of action of L-carnitine, its effect in reducing the extent of both primary DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations, was compared with that of mannitol, a well known scavenger of the <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical.</b> On the other hand, using a chemical inhibitor of p 53 (PFT-α), the role of this protein in radiation-induced DNA damage on normal and A-T cell lines exposed to ionising radiations, was investigated. Our results suggest that L-C enhanced the extent and the rate of DNA repair of oxidative stress-induced lesions in A-T cell lines, at the very early recovery time; L-C has an effect also in reducing the formation of oxidative stress-induced chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, L-C pre-treatment has a more pronounced effect in enhancing DNA repair of oxidative damage as compared to Mannitol. This could represent a tool for further research on the possible pharmacological applications of L-C in the A-T therapy. In addition, we demonstrated a role of p 53 protein in “double-strand breaks repair” in A-T cells. In particular, our results suggests that p 53 has a direct role in the NHEJ pathway, attending the phase of “DNA free-ends rejoining”. Howewer, if the activation of p 53 is defective as in one of the A-T cell line studied, PFT-α seems to stimulate HR that is the pre-eminent repair process in G 2 phase of cell-cycle. This unexpected effect of PFT-α on HR was confirmed in experiment performed with a CHO cell line defective for NHEJ treated with mitomycin-C. These findings suggest that the differential radiosensitivity of ATM-deficient cells depends both on the different mutations carried by the ATM gene and the activation of its downstream targets.

40|$|Radical induced {{modification}} of DNA {{plays an important}} role in many pathological pathways like cancer development, aging, etc. In this work, we quantify radical-induced DNA damage that causes transitions from double to single stranded DNA using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The plasmid pBR 322 is attacked by <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> that are produced by Fenton's reaction; the strength of the radical attack is controlled via the ratio of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radical</b> molecules to DNA base pairs. The extent of DNA modification is assessed by AFM tapping mode (TM) imaging of the plasmids (after adsorption onto PAH-functionalized mica) in air. As single stranded DNA chains (height similar to 2 angstrom) are much smaller than intact DNA strands (similar to 5 angstrom), their fraction can be quantified based on the height distribution, which allows a simplified data analysis in comparison to similar AFM-based approaches. It is found that the amount of damaged DNA strands increases with increasing strength of radical attack, and decreases if ROS scavengers like sodium acetate are added. Competition curves are calculated for the interaction of <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> with DNA and sodium acetate, which finally allows calculation of relative rate constants for the respective reactions...|$|R
40|$|Background. When {{a liquid}} is {{irradiated}} with high intensity and low-frequency ultrasound, acoustic cavitation occurs. The existence of particles in a liquid provides nucleation sites for cavitation bubbles {{and leads to}} {{a decrease in the}} ultrasonic intensity threshold needed for cavitation onset. Materials and Methods. The study was designed to measure <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> in terephthalic acid solutions containing gold nanoparticles in a near field of a 1 [*]MHz sonotherapy probe. The effect of ultrasound irradiation parameters containing mode of sonication and ultrasound intensity in <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> production have been investigated by the spectrofluorometry method. Results. Recorded fluorescence signal in terephthalic acid solution containing gold nanoparticles was higher than the terephthalic acid solution without gold nanoparticles. Also, the results showed that any increase in intensity of the sonication would be associated with an increase in the fluorescence intensity. Conclusion. Acoustic cavitation in the presence of gold nanoparticles has been introduced as a way for improving therapeutic effects on the tumors in sonodynamic therapy. Also, the terephthalic acid dosimetry is suitable for detecting and quantifying <b>free</b> <b>hydroxyl</b> <b>radicals</b> as a criterion of cavitation production over a certain range of conditions in medical ultrasound fields...|$|R

By linking to both hemicellulose and cellulose, it creates a barrier to any solutions or enzymes and prevents the penetration of lignocellulolytic enzymes into the interior lignocellulosic structure.
