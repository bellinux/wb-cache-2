40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the difference between having financial assistance and not having financial assistance on grade point average, program completion, and having secured <b>employment</b> <b>related</b> to training on postsecondary career education students from selected Iowa area schools and community colleges;Scope of the study. The sample included 598 full-time students from three Iowa area school/community college postsecondary career education programs. Of the 598, 154 received financial assistance from Basic Education Opportunity Grant (BEOG) and/or Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds and 444 did not receive BEOG and/or CETA financial assistance;Conclusions. Analysis of the data disclosed the following conclusions: (1) There was no significant difference between the financially assisted and the nonfinancially assisted students earned grade point average. (2) The frequency of program completion was independent of financial assistance or nonfinancial assistance. (3) A significant difference was not found in the proportion of financially assisted and nonfinancially assisted students having secured <b>employment</b> <b>related</b> to training within sixty days of leaving or completing the program. (4) A highly significant relationship existed between grade point average and program completion. (5) Grade point average made a significant contribution to having secured <b>employment</b> <b>related</b> to training within sixty days of completing or leaving the program. (6) The frequency of having secured <b>employment</b> <b>related</b> to training within sixty days of leaving or completing the program was independent of the program completion. (7) The variables of age and age with financial assistance made a significant contribution to the earned grade point average.

Beyond examining differences between non-working and part-time working students, we distinguish between student <b>employment</b> <b>related</b> and unrelated to the field of study. Our results show significant positive labour market returns of ‘earning while learning’ only for student <b>employment</b> <b>related</b> to the field of study.
