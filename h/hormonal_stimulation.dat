25|$|In general, {{hematocrit}} is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the starry flounder exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from <b>hormonal</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of hypoxia inducible factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Heterozygous {{carriers}} of Robertsonian translocations generally {{have a normal}} phenotype but present reproductive failure. In cattle, the t(1; 29) Robertsonian translocation is very common and carriers show a 3 – 5 % decrease in fertility. Some data suggest that female carriers have a higher decrease than male carriers but no direct studies of the chromosome content of oocytes from a t(1; 29) carrier cow have been performed so far. Four heterozygous carrier cows underwent <b>hormonal</b> <b>stimulations</b> and follicles punctions and about 800 oocytes were matured in vitro. Six hundred metaphase II preparations were obtained and analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridization with bovine chromosome 1 and 29 painting probes. Proportions {{of different kinds of}} oocytes were as-sessed: 74. 11 % (292 / 394) were normal and balanced, 4. 06 % (16 / 394) unbalanced and 21. 83 % (86 / 394) diploid. For all cows, the number of normal oocytes was not significantly different from the number of translocated oocytes but the diploidy and unbalanced rate were significantly different between them. As found in bulls, the meiotic segregation pattern in cows has shown a preponderance of alternate products. However, the frequency of unbalanced gametes determined in females (4. 06 %) was significantly higher than the frequency observed in males (2. 76 %). The divergence in the rate of diploid gametes (0. 04 % vs. 21. 83 %) is mainly explained by the difference between males and females...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Endometriosis befalls {{in one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} gynecologic diseases. It manifests itself by the presence and growth of focus of endometrium out of the uterus cavum that reacts to <b>hormonal</b> <b>stimulations</b> as the normal uterus endometrium does. Hyperstimulation and induction of ovulation together with intrauterine insemination (IUI) are the most frequently used treatments of unexplained infertility in patients with mild type endometriosis. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of stimulation using human menopausal gonadotrophine (hMG) in the patients with mild type endometriosis to the patients with infertility of unknown ethiology. Methods. The study included 50 patients with unexplained infertility (group N), as well as 50 patients with mild type endometriosis (group E) confirmed by laparoscopy. Within the same therapeutic protocole hMG stimulation and horionic gonadotrophine induction (hCG) were used. Results. In the group E ovulation occurred in 74 % of the patients during the first stimulation, in 77. 78 % during the second cycle, and in 75 % of the patients during the third one. Regarding the group N, ovulation appeared in 82 % of the patients during the first stimulation.

40|$|Synopsis – France {{is one of}} the Western {{countries}} in which the development of NRTs – and specially in vitro fertilization (IVF) – is most important, spectacular, and rapid. But the interests of the NRT’s practitioners are far from being those of women wanting to have a child. Thus, the practitioners generally do not say how low the success rates are, even in the best centers. Instead of measuring success rates by the number of deliveries per attempt, they use different ways to present their results: ways that are much more favorable for them. Furthermore, in order to increase the reproductive market, there is a trend to declare “infertile ” and treat as such many women who are only “hypofertile. ” Among the new indications being used for NRTs, IVF (which was first used for female infertility) is now prescribed sometimes as a treatment for male infertility. Thus this risky method is applied to the fertile women whose husband is infertile. Apart from the risks of egg retrieval for women, one must add those associated with <b>hormonal</b> <b>stimulations.</b> To be more precise, new drugs are being tested on large numbers of women: even if they don’t increase their chances of having a baby, they do allow the doctors to retrieve a very great number of eggs (which are very important as raw material for experiments), and they certainly do increase the risks for women.

40|$|Background: Low (or poor) {{responder}} {{patients are}} women who require large doses of stimulation medications and produce less than an optimal number of oocytes during IVF cycles. Low responder patients produce few oocytes and embryos, which significantly reduces their chances for success in a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycle. Accumulation of vitrified oocytes or embryos before the actual PGD cycle is a possible strategy that might increase patient’s chances for a healthy pregnancy. Aim of the study: This retrospective study evaluates the efficacy of a PGD program in low responder patients after repeated ovarian stimulation cycles with cumulative vitrification of oocytes and embryos. Methods: Over a period of 30 months, 13 patients entering the PGD program were identified as poor responders after their first ovarian stimulation. These patients started a PGD cycle {{for one of the}} following indications: history of recurrent implantation failure (n= 1), cystic fibrosis (n= 1), X-linked microtubular myopathy (n= 1), recurrent miscarriages (n= 5), Duchene muscular dystrophy (n= 1), chromosomal translocation (n= 1) and high sperm aneuploidy (n= 1).  After multiple ovarian <b>hormonal</b> <b>stimulations</b> patients had either all mature oocytes (Group A; 3 patients) or all of their day 2 embryos vitrified (group B; 10 patients). Mean total number of oocyte collections per patient was 2. 3 (range: 2 - 5 cycles). Results: In the actual PGD cycle, all vitrified oocytes from group A patients were warmed and underwent intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) followed by culture up to day 3. For group B patients all vitrified day 2 embryos were warmed and cultured overnight. On day 3 of culture, all embryos from Group A and B had blastomere biopsy followed by genetic analysis. In group A, 20 embryos were found suitable for biopsy and genetic analysis; at least one healthy embryo was available for transfer for each patient.   For group B, 72 embryos in total were available for biopsy and PGD.   All patients, except one, had at least one healthy day 5 embryo for transfer (mean number of 2. 1 embryos per transfer). Nine patients had a clinical pregnancy; 7 patients delivered a healthy baby. Conclusion: Low responder patients entering a PGD program might increase their chances for a healthy pregnancy by repeat ovarian stimulation in combination with cumulative oocyte or embryo vitrification...|$|R

It is also interesting that the exact etiology of PMS is still unknown, and 80 % women who suffered from PMS also experience sleep disturbances. Recently, there has been increasing numbers of literatures and evidence-based cases linking periodontal disease to systemic diseases.

Methods. Of the seven patients reported here, five women had SLE with nephritis, the sixth had immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) and the seventh had microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with renal involvement. All women were nulliparous and younger than 35 yrs. Results. Patients with SLE underwent {{in vitro maturation}} (IVM) of immature oocytes aspirated during a natural menstrual cycle followed by vitrification of the matured oocytes if a male partner was not available, or vitrification of embryos if one was available. The patient with ITP and the patient with MPA underwent gonadotropin ovarian stimulation followed by oocyte or embryo vitrification. All women completed fertility preservation treatment successfully and mature oocytes or embryos (36 and 13, respectively) were vitrified. No complications were associated with this treatment and cytotoxic therapy was initiated as scheduled in all cases. Conclusions. Oocyte or embryo cryopreservation should be considered for fertility preservation in young women with SARDs who face imminent gonadotoxic treatment.

In patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea, serum cationic trypsinogen was 4 · 9 ± 4 · 9 μg/l (mean ±SD), significantly below values in patients with non-pancreatic steatorrhoea (47 · 0 ± 22 · 1 μg/l, p< 0 · 001) and 50 control subjects (31 · 4 ± 7 · 4 μg/l, p< 0 · 001). Serum cationic trypsinogen values in patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea all fell below the lower limit of our control range and below all values for patients with non-pancreatic steatorrhoea. Serum cationic trypsinogen was also evaluated against pancreatic trypsin output in 47 patients (range 0 · 2 - 17 · 0 yr) who underwent a <b>hormonal</b> pancreatic <b>stimulation</b> test. In 17 patients, serum cationic trypsinogen was low (<- 2 SD or 16 · 6 μg/l), and associated with greatly impaired pancreatic trypsin output, ranging from 0 - 8 % of mean normal trypsin output.

In 30 patients with normal or raised serum cationic trypsinogen (≥ 16 · 6 μg/l), pancreatic trypsin output ranged from 15 - 183 % of mean normal values. In conclusion, low serum cationic trypsinogen suggests severely impaired exocrine pancreatic function, with sensitivity extending above the steatorrhoeic threshold. In the presence of steatorrhoea, low serum cationic trypsinogen indicates a pancreatic aetiology.

In this paper we demonstrate that a Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase similar to the enzyme previously purified and characterized from rat brain is present in PC 12, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line. We show that Ca 2 + influx elicited by various forms of cell stimulation leads to increased 32 P incorporation into tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a major phosphoprotein in these cells. Several other unidentified proteins are either phosphorylated or dephosphorylated as a result of Ca 2 + influx. Acetylcholine stimulates TH phosphorylation by activation of nicotinic receptors. K+-induced depolarization stimulates TH phosphorylation in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, presumably by opening voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels. Ca 2 + influx that results from the direct effects of the ionophore A 23187 also leads to TH phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of TH is accompanied by an activation of the enzyme.
