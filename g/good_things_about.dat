His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home.

25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
25|$|From {{a man in}} Iowa, Walker heard <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{and moved}} there in 1862. He arrived at Saint Paul where he met and sold grindstones, once to James Jerome Hill, then {{employed}} as a clerk who carefully sorted them for the buyer. Within one hour of his arrival in Minneapolis, he {{was hired as a}} chainman to George B. Wright, who was surveying federal pine lands in the north of the state. He became a deputy surveyor within a few days. His application to become assistant professor in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin had been accepted but he loved his new career and turned it down. Walker worked for twelve years on government surveys and on surveys for the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. His work took him away from home for long periods, and it gave him intricate knowledge of what property to buy in northern Minnesota. He began to acquire pine land in 1867, but without capital of his own, he partnered at first with Dr. Levi Butler and Howard W. Mills and later with others.|$|E

500|$|... "El Amor" [...] {{was written}} by Arjona {{in an attempt to}} show all sides of love. As said by Arjona himself, [...] "So many <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> love has been shown, that {{somebody}} had to turn it around and tell the bad ones". The development of [...] "El Amor" [...] was motivated by Arjona's idea of showing [...] "those big dark events within love that nobody talk about", saying that [...] "love's dark sides are really fundamental to understand its great value".|$|E

The song became Arjona's fourth single to reach number one on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs, and the seventh to do so on the Latin Pop Songs chart. It also became his first song ever to reach number one on the Tropical Songs chart, improving his previous peak of number two almost twelve years prior. [...] "El Amor" [...] also topped several national charts from Latin America.|$|E
500|$|Prost won {{the first}} two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost {{recovered}} from losing a wheel, and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that [...] "When I went to Renault the journalists wrote <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> me, but by 1982 I had become the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had {{made the mistake of}} winning! The French don't really like winners." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the 2012–13 season, Bridges signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Bury Town on a free transfer. On joining Bury Town, Bridges said — [...] "I'm good friends with Adam Tann and Craig Parker and they couldn't say enough <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the club. They told me that the players are really well looked after and the club is full of good honest people". He left Bury Town in December 2013 due to the club's {{financial}} problems, and subsequently joined Brackley Town of the National League North in January 2014. Bridges made his debut for Brackley on 11 January 2014, coming on as an 87th-minute substitute in a 31 victory over Gainsborough Trinity. He made 15 appearances during the second half of the 201314 season whilst at Brackley, scoring two goals [...] both of his goals coming within the space of a week at the end of March 2014, in games against Altrincham and Workington respectively.|$|E
500|$|Arkham Asylum and Arkham City {{composer}} Nick Arundel {{returned to}} score Arkham Knight, while his partner on those games, Ron Fish, {{was replaced by}} composer David Buckley. On his continued involvement in the series, Arundel said [...] "One of the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> doing a sequel, is you {{get the opportunity to}} redo , to revisit things... We have a set of material that we want to keep consistent, like the Batman theme ... We wanted to keep [...] theme and tailor it more to the story for this game. How can we get the Scarecrow element out of that one theme." [...] Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created, as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it. Buckley received Arundel's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme. Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23, 2015, and a limited edition vinyl record featuring fifteen songs from the soundtrack chosen by Arundel. Singer and record producer Trent Reznor served as a music consultant on Arkham Knights [...] "Be the Batman" [...] trailer.|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} [...] "fresh" [...] 95% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 43 reviews and Metacritic gave it a 73, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Many focused on the film's ending title cards: several compared them to a public service announcement, and Philip Kemp of Sight & Sound wrote, [...] "All that's missing is the address we should send donations to." [...] Zhang Xiaoling, on the other hand, considered the titles to be an implicit criticism {{of the state of}} rural education in China, saying, [...] "the news that voluntary contributions have helped 15 percent of the pupils to return to school is aimed to give rise to a question: what about the remaining 85 percent?" [...] The disagreement about the title cards is also reflected in the critical reaction {{to the rest of the}} film's resolution. Kemp described the ending as [...] "feelgood" [...] and criticized the film for portraying officials and generous cityfolk as coming to the rescue, The Washington Posts Desson Howe called the ending [...] "flag-waving", and The Independents Gilbert Adair called it [...] "sugary". Alberto Barbera of the Venice Film Festival, on the other hand, said that while the end of the film may have been like propaganda, the rest was a [...] "strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for the country children". Likewise, Zhang Xiaoling argued that although the film superficially appears to praise the city people and officials, its subtext is harshly critical of them: he pointed out that the apparently benevolent TV station manager seems to be motivated more by audience ratings than by altruism, that the receptionist's callous manner towards Wei is a result of Chinese [...] "bureaucratism and nepotism", and that for all the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> the city, Zhang Huike's clearest memory of city life is having to beg for food. Zhang and Kraicer both argued that critics who see the film as pro-government propaganda are missing the point and, as Kraicer put it, [...] "mistaking [...] layer as the message of the film... mistaking the part for the whole". David Ansen of Newsweek and Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun each pointed out that, while the film is [...] "deceptive" [...] positive at face value, it has harsh criticism [...] "bubbling under the surface". Chinese critics Liu Xinyi and Xu Su of Movie Review recognized the dispute abroad over whether the film was pro- or anti-government, but made no comment; they praised the film for its realistic portrayal of hardships facing rural people, without speculating about whether Zhang intended to criticize or praise the government's handling of those hardships. Hao Jian of Film Appreciation, on the other hand, was more critical, claiming that the movie was organized around a political message and was intended to be pro-government. Hao said that Not One Less marked the beginning of Zhang's transformation from an outspoken independent director to one of the government's favorites.|$|E
