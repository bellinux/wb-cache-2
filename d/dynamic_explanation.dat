40|$|Our {{group has}} {{recently}} described {{a new form}} of kinetic isotope effect that arises from dynamic selectivity in the bifurcation of a reaction pathway on the slope of an energy surface. Since the selection between products does not occur at a potential energy saddle point, we proposed that the isotope effect is decided by dynamic factors that are not necessarily related to zero point energy effects on the surface. As an alternative explanation, it has recently been suggested that variational transition state theory can account for these isotope effects. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>explanation</b> and variational transition state theory explanation make distinct predictions as to the temperature dependence of these isotope effects. I describe here my studies of the temperature dependence of the intramolecular isotope effects for the reaction of singlet oxygen with gemtetramethylethylene- d 6. The selectivity observed for this reaction across a broad temperature range is clearly a non-Eyring distribution and thus the mechanism cannot be adequately described solely using transition state theory or even some variation of it. After using these results to evaluate competing theories it was concluded that this mechanism could only be properly understood using a <b>dynamic</b> <b>explanation...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Farrington Theory (2003) was {{developed}} to explain offending and anti-social behaviour by working class males. This theory alleges that stability in criminal behaviour resides in the individual {{rather than in the}} environment; the social problem of crime is largely medicalized, constituting a psychological model of anti-social behaviour rather than a theory of crime and delinquency. The argument proposed in this paper is threefold: First, I argue Farrington’s theory is problematic given that it constructs deviance in a narrow and largely stable manner; therefore, this theory is better conceptualized as a psychological model of anti-social behaviour not a theory of crime. Secondly, I argue that integrated theoretical perspectives offer more nuanced and <b>dynamic</b> <b>explanations</b> and understandings of crime over the life course. As such, I attempt to address the shortcomings of Farrington’s model by reframing it in terms of an integrative framework.

Model-Driven Engineering offers powerful solutions to handle the design and the implementation of such User Interfaces. However, this approach requires the creation of an important amount of models and transformations, each of them in turn requiring specific knowledge and competencies. This leads to the need of adapted process models and tools sustaining the designers' work. Moreover, automatic adaptation to new devices implies that users could have questions about the interaction with the same UI in such new devices. As this adaption is automatically performed at runtime, designers cannot foresee all the possible combinations of contexts of use at design time in order to conveniently support the users. For this reason, dynamic help systems are necessary to generate <b>dynamic</b> <b>explanations</b> to the end-user at runtime.

Furthermore, the development costs associated with state-of-the-art technologies currently limit the introduction of these learning environments to monolingual systems. We present amultilingual framework for generating multimodal explanations of complex physical phenomena that combines 3 D animated technologies with multilingual speech.

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between traditional (force scaling models) {{and the more}} recently conceived <b>dynamic</b> <b>explanations</b> of load compensation (λ model) was the departure point for the present study. By using the complex “open” motor skill of catching a ball rather than the traditional “closed” skills under “normal” (baseline) conditions and under conditions where a spring load {{was applied to the}} catching hand (thereby changing the dynamics of the skeleto-muscular system) it was hoped to provide further clarification of this issue. Traditional force scaling models, in this respect, would predict that maximal closing velocity of the grasp action, and movement time would not be significantly different between a control and a spring-load condition. In contrast, a dynamic system perspective would maintain that spring loading would be compensated for by a change in the rate of shift of the reciprocal command (R-command). The obtained results showed a significant difference for conditions with regard to the maximal closing velocity of the grasp action, the baseline condition being higher than the two spring-load conditions. Furthermore, a significant difference was found for the aperture at moment of catch, the aperture at moment of catch being smaller in the baseline condition than that under the two springload conditions. With regard to the temporal variables, no significant differences were obtained. A comprehensive overall explanation of the obtained data in terms of the force scaling models was not realisable. It may be that findings supporting such theories are task specific and that for constrained tasks such as catching a ball-different underlying organisational principles apply. The λ model, however, could explain adequately the obtained results. It was concluded that, except for the preparatory phase associated with load compensation before the onset of the movement of the ball, the spatiotemporal structure of the control pattern underlying catching remains the same (invariant) in both baseline and load conditions. Thereby, the spatiotemporal structure of the resulting movement changes {{under the influence of the}} load and thus is not the same for load and baseline condition...|$|R

Analysis reveals that the key to the modeling success is to resolve the lake‐atmosphere interactions and apply appropriate representations of different meteorological forcing fields, based on the nature of their spatiotemporal variability. The close agreement between model simulation and observations also suggests that the 3 ‐D hydrodynamic model can provide reliable spatiotemporal estimates of heat budgets over Lake Superior and similar systems.
