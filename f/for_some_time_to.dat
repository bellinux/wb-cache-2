5|$|Christie was {{promoted}} to rear admiral {{as part of his}} move back to Newport. In January 1943, however, Rear Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarines, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was killed in a plane crash. Christie hoped to get the position but the job went to Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, and the Bureau of Personnel selected Christie to take over Lockwood's old command. Christie lobbied Vice Admiral Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane. Carpender refused, and Christie went on to Fremantle. Nevertheless, Christie continued to try <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take the Brisbane force under his control.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} at the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald {{managed to escape}} {{with the aid of}} Rögnvald Brusason (later Earl of Orkney) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway. He stayed there <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> heal his wounds, and {{thereafter}} (possibly up to a month later) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden. A year after the Battle of Stiklestad, Harald arrived in Kievan Rus' (referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or Svíþjóð hin mikla). He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg), arriving there {{in the first half of}} 1031. Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise, whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald. Badly in need of military leaders, Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces. Harald's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028, and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf. Harald took part in Yaroslav's campaign against the Poles in 1031, and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the Chudes in Estonia, the Byzantines, as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people.|$|E

25|$|After {{several hours}} of intense combat, Braddock was shot off his horse, and {{effective}} resistance collapsed. Colonel Washington, although he had no official position {{in the chain of}} command, was able to impose and maintain some order and formed a rear guard, which allowed the remants of the force to disengage. This earned him the sobriquet Hero of the Monongahela, by which he was toasted, and established his fame <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
25|$|With Transport for London {{purchasing}} fifty Routemasters {{and having}} them thoroughly rebuilt in 2001/02, {{it appeared that}} the Routemasters would be around <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come. In February 2003, route 10 was split, with the Kings Cross to Hammersmith section converted to OMO operation and the Archway to Marble Arch section remaining Routemaster-operated as route 390. In the same month route 36 was curtailed between Lewisham and New Cross and duplicated by route 436 between New Cross and Paddington, operated by Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses.|$|E
25|$|The {{call to arms}} {{was given}} at a very {{critical}} period. The weather was burning hot. Crops were ripe and ready for harvesting. The journey was long and arduous. Many persons preferred to stay back. In spite of these obstacles and difficulties, an army of thirty thousand persons was raised. The army assembled at Al Jorf outside Medina. Muhammad remained at Medina <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attend to other affairs, and at Al Jorf Abu Bakr deputised for Muhammad and led the prayers.|$|E

Insisting that his hero move on from that loss, Jones convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume, but this partnership lasts only a short time; a disguised Red Skull, impersonating Rogers {{with the help of the}} Cosmic Cube, drives Jones away.|$|E
25|$|Although the region's large {{industries}} {{have been affected}} by the Great Recession, the Inland Empire is projected to remain California's fastest-growing region <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come. The area is also projected to remain one of the least educated areas of the state with the lowest average in annual wages in the country. A 2006 study of salaries in 51 metropolitan areas of the country ranked the Inland Empire second to last, with an average annual wage of $36,924. However, inexpensive land prices and innovative institutional support networks have attracted some small businesses and technology startups into the area.|$|E
25|$|The {{armies of}} Hamilcar and Agathocles clashed in the Battle of the Himera River in 311BC. Agathocles {{suffered}} a disastrous defeat there because {{a large part}} of his army was killed or taken prisoner by the Carthaginians. He gathered the survivors, burned his camp and withdrew to Gela. There he remained <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> divert the Carthaginian army from Syracuse. This allowed the Syracusans to harvest their crops. Hamilcar first besieged the Gela, but gave up when he discovered that Agathocles had large supplies and enough soldiers to defend the city. He then visited the cities and strongholds which were still siding with Agathocles to win them over. Because they despised Agathocles they soon deserted to the Carthaginians.|$|E

25|$|After Le Grand Macabre, Ligeti {{struggled}} <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{find a new}} style. Besides {{two short}} pieces for harpsichord, he did not complete another major work until the Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano in 1982, over {{four years after the}} opera. His music of the 1980s and 1990s continued to emphasise complex mechanical rhythms, often in a less densely chromatic idiom, tending to favour displaced major and minor triads and polymodal structures. During this time, Ligeti also began to explore alternate tuning systems through the use of natural harmonics for horns (as in the Horn Trio and Piano Concerto) and scordatura for strings (as in the Violin Concerto). Additionally, most of his works in this period are multi-movement works, rather than the extended single movements of Atmosphères and San Francisco Polyphony.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Croydon Vision 2020 {{regeneration}} scheme, East Croydon {{is planned}} to be expanded to both {{the west and the}} east. Work has been planned on the west side <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> increase station capacity, made more urgent by likely additional traffic from the planned Croydon Gateway nearby. A proposal by Arrowcroft, which included the 12,500-seat Croydon Arena, was rejected in August 2008. Arrowcroft had proposed a £24million expansion of the station with a new 'airport style' concourse above the tracks {{to the north of the}} station. Arrowcroft had agreed to contribute £500,000 to the build costs to offset the impact of their proposed Arena. The source of the remaining £23.5million was not identified, and Network Rail had not committed this expenditure in its capital plans.|$|E
25|$|Ellenborough Park is a {{large area}} of parkland in Weston-super-Mare. The land was owned in 1855 by two tenants in common, who sold off parts of the land for the {{building}} of houses, and granted rights to {{the owners of the}} houses to enjoy the parkland which remained. The land was enjoyed <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> come, until 1955, when Judge Danckwerts delivered his decision on the case which arose. Part of the problem arose out {{of the fact that the}} War Office had taken possession of the land during World War II, and compensation was due to be paid to the owners of the properties built on land surrounding the land which had been occupied during the war under the Compensation Defence Act 1939, section 2 (1).|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{starts in}} the initial position with the body completely straight, body movement is coordinated such that the legs {{are ready for the}} thrust phase while the arms are halfway through the insweep, and the head is out of the water for breathing. In this position the body has also the largest angle to the horizontal. The arms are recovered during the thrust phase of the legs. After the stroke the body is kept in the initial position <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> utilize the gliding phase. Depending on the distance and fitness the duration of this gliding phase varies. Usually the gliding phase is shorter during sprints than during long distance swimming. The gliding phase is also longer during the underwater stroke after the start and each turn. However, the gliding phase is usually the longest phase in one entire cycle of breaststroke.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July 1847 {{the railway}} {{merged with the}} Caledonian Railway and became their main outlet to the coast. The Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway opened its branch line on 13 May 1865 with its trains being {{operated}} by the Caledonian Railway, but its steamer operations were slow {{to live up to}} their promise and when in 1869 the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station at Princes Pier, Greenock, the Cathcart Street station was effectively bypassed and the Caley lost trade. They had been trying <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> organise an extension to Gourock, and having gained Parliamentary approval in 1884 they spent three years in construction which involved extensive tunnelling, and opened Gourock railway station on 1 June 1889. In August 1893 the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway.|$|E
25|$|Several {{influential}} Congress leaders, including Henry Chipembere, Kanyama Chiume, Dunduzu Chisiza and T.D.T. Banda (no relation) {{pleaded with}} {{him to return to}} Nyasaland to take up leadership of their cause. A delegation sent to London met with Dr. Banda at the Port of Liverpool where he was making arrangements to return to Ghana. He agreed to return, but asked <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sort out a few private matters, probably seeking to clear his political name after the Mrs. French debacle. The delegation returned without him and proceeded to make arrangements for his imminent return. After two false starts, including a fracas between the police and African crowds threatening to storm a BOAC aeroplane rumoured to be carrying Dr. Banda at Chileka Airport, Banda finally made a showing on 6 July 1958 after an absence of about 42 years. In August, at Nkata Bay, he was acclaimed {{as the leader of the}} Congress.|$|E

25|$|As the {{daughter}} of Augustus, mother (now legally the sister) of two of his heirs, Lucius and Gaius, and wife of another, Tiberius, Julia's future seemed assured to all. Yet in 2 BC she was arrested for adultery and treason; Augustus sent her a letter in Tiberius' name declaring the {{marriage null and void}} (Tiberius was at this time on the island of Rhodes and unable to respond quickly). He also asserted in public that she had been plotting against his own life. Though at the time Augustus had been passing legislation to promote family values, he likely knew of her intrigues with other men but hesitated <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> accuse her. Several of Julia's supposed lovers were exiled, most notably Sempronius Gracchus, while Iullus Antonius (son of Mark Antony and Fulvia) was forced to commit suicide. Others have suggested that Julia's alleged paramours were members of her city clique, who wished to remove Tiberius from favour and replace him with Antonius. This would explain the letter, written by Gracchus, asking Augustus to allow Julia to divorce Tiberius.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles {{have been}} {{admitted}} on the city's train network <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> facilitate mixed-mode commuting, and in 2010, the state railways (DSB), made it free to bring bicycles on the train. Since then {{the number of}} passengers bringing a bicycle on the train have more than tripled, growing from 2.1 million to 7.3 million in 2012. To accommodate {{the growing number of}} bikes, DSB rebuilt all their S-trains by adding an extra carriage specifically for bikes, while keeping the flexible compartments {{at each end of the}} train to accommodate bicycles, as well as prams and wheelchairs, and increased capacity from 22 to 46 bicycles per train. Building on the success, DSB has launched additional bicycle initiatives such as opening bike shops in 10 stations, where customers can leave bikes for repair on their morning commute and retrieve them on their way home. The company has also introduced various bicycle discounts in their loyalty programme, vowed to install ramps on all stairs and drastically expand bicycle parking at stations.|$|E
25|$|Evan-Thomas' next {{appointment}} in October 1915 was as {{commander of the}} 5th Battle Squadron, which consisted of the five newly completed Queen Elizabeth-class fast battleships, arguably the most powerful ships afloat at that time. HMS Barham was chosen as flagship for the admiral. The 15inch gun ships, capable of 24 knots, formed a fast division attached to the Grand Fleet, complementing the fast battlecruiser squadron which normally served in a detached scouting role. The posting was considered prestigious. It {{is likely that the}} choice of Evan-Thomas for the post was influenced by his previous friendship with Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet but also by Jellicoe's concerns not to appoint an officer to the post who might be too independent of mind. The appointment was likely also to be acceptable to Beatty, commanding the battlecruisers, since he had seniority over Evan-Thomas and would command in any joint operation. Although the Queen Elizabeths were slightly slower than the battlecruisers, Beatty continued <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> campaign that they should be permanently attached to his command as the fast division of the fleet.|$|E
