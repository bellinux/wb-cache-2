5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be funny if the plant went on strike. The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent that {{by the time of the}} tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a good story.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> {{to conclude that}} the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> {{to think}} that the notion of {{function}} problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a,b,c) such that the relation a×b=c holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.|$|E
25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from mental rotation and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|To be acceptable, any {{rule of law}} must {{be capable}} of being applied consistently, thus a {{definition}} of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B {{on the road and}} by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury {{and the extent to which}} B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.|$|E

25|$|Western {{researcher}} R. J. Rummel {{estimated that}} 30 {{million people were}} killed {{under the rule of}} the Mongol Empire. This is a low-end estimate, as some estimates go as high as 80 million, with 50 million deaths being the middle ground. The population of China fell by half in fifty years of Mongol rule. Before the Mongol invasion, the territories of the Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest was completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people. While it <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to attribute this major decline solely to Mongol ferocity, scholars today have mixed opinions regarding this subject. Scholars such as Frederick W. Mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than a de facto decrease, whilst others such as Timothy Brook argue that the Mongols reduced much of the south Chinese population, and very debatably of the Han Chinese population, to an invisible status through cancellation of the right to passports and denial of the right to direct land ownership. This meant that the Chinese had to depend on and be cared for chiefly by Mongols and Tartars, which also involved recruitment into the Mongol army. Other historians such as William McNeill and David Morgan argue that the Bubonic Plague was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E

[...] Bruce Britt of Daily News of Los Angeles praised that album, and wrote that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to dismiss 'Weird Al' Yankovic as a joke [...] but those who dismiss Yankovic so easily overlook the fact that his lampoons are often wittier than the songs he spoofs." [...] Many critics praised the lead single, [...] "Fat". Chadbourne wrote that [...] "the arrogance of 'I'm Bad' [...] was perfectly trumped by Yankovic's musical pile of lard, the appeal of the video's visuals clearly not the only ace in the hole."

500|$|The {{cycle of}} {{scenes from the}} life of Saint Agnes, and that of her foster-sister Saint Emerentiana, follows the {{traditional}} story of Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine; the most popular compilation of hagiographies of the age, whose wording corresponds to some of the inscriptions in banderoles or scrolls that explain the scenes. Other texts are quotations from the Latin Vulgate Bible, mostly derived from the liturgy for St Agnes' feast day, and {{it has been suggested that}} the two rings of pearls also reflect the language of the chants for these services. [...] It seems likely that clerical advice was taken, at least over the texts used in the inscriptions. It <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to relate the depiction of the story, with its [...] "distinct and vivid tableaux, well suited to adaptation for performance" [...] to medieval drama, often a source for iconography, but the fragmentary records mention no dramas on the life of St Agnes that are close in time or place to the origin of the cup.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} broad {{agreement}} among historians that McKinley's election {{was at the}} time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems. Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley. Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people. Republican Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s,—a realignment that did not happen. [...] Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E
500|$|Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is {{a social}} satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who [...] "have just come from {{performances}} of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [...] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic {{when it comes to}} their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." [...] On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in Party Time), who describe themselves as [...] "peaceful strategy consultants [...] we don't carry guns." [...] At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a [...] "totally disordered personality... a psychopath," [...] while Lambert [...] "vows to be reincarnated as ' more civilised, [...] gentler person, [...] nicer person'." [...] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. [...] Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: [...] "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'... have everything in common beneath the surface". [...] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence... It <b>is</b> <b>tempting</b> but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. [...] Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier [...] "memory plays", while harking back to his [...] "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech: ...|$|E
