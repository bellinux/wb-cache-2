5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel <b>dormouse</b> (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel <b>dormouse</b> is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the cheek}} teeth of Seorsumuscardinus are known; {{these include the}} fourth premolar and three molars in the upper (maxilla) and lower jaws (mandible). The teeth are {{medium-sized}} for a <b>dormouse</b> and have a flat occlusal (chewing) surface. S.bolligeri is slightly larger than S.alpinus.|$|E
50|$|The rodent family Platacanthomyidae, or Oriental <b>dormice,</b> {{includes}} the spiny <b>dormice</b> and the Chinese pygmy <b>dormice.</b> In {{spite of their}} appearance, these animals are not true <b>dormice,</b> but {{are part of the}} large and complex superfamily Muroidea. The platacanthomyids can be distinguished from the true <b>dormice,</b> because they have no premolars, giving them three cheek teeth, like their relatives, the Muroidea.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dormice</b> were eaten, {{considered}} a delicacy. A status symbol among wealthy Romans, some even had <b>dormice</b> weighed {{in front of}} dinner guests. A sumptuary law enacted under Marcus Aemilius Scaurus forbade the eating of <b>dormice,</b> but failed to stop the practice.|$|R
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three <b>dormouse</b> species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed <b>dormouse.</b> There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|In MN 4, Seorsumuscardinus {{has been}} {{recorded}} from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 Seorsumuscardinus alpinus teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece (S.alpinus); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; S. cf. alpinus). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of S.bolligeri were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. In all these localities, {{it is part of}} a diverse <b>dormouse</b> fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are temporally distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may be useful for biostratigraphy (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits). Seorsumuscardinus occurred at the same time as the oldest known Muscardinus.|$|E
5|$|The larger Welsh mammals {{died out}} during the Norman period, {{including}} the brown bear, wolf and the wildcat. Today, mammals of note include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the <b>dormouse,</b> are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. Other animals of note include, otter, stoat and weasel. The pine marten which has had the occasional sighting, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats {{can be found in}} Snowdonia.|$|E
50|$|The Platacanthomyidae contain three genera - Neocometes, Platacanthomys (spiny <b>dormice),</b> and Typhlomys (pygmy <b>dormice)</b> - {{but only}} two extant species.|$|R
50|$|They fed these captive <b>dormice</b> walnuts, chestnuts, and acorns for fattening. The <b>dormice</b> {{were served}} by either {{roasting}} them and dipping them in honey or stuffing {{them with a}} mixture of pork, pine nuts, and other flavorings. It was, however, very important to upper-class Romans that the <b>dormice</b> be separated from other products of the hunt, like the large game, for presentation purposes.|$|R
50|$|The African <b>dormice,</b> genus Graphiurus, are <b>dormice</b> {{that live}} {{throughout}} sub-Saharan Africa {{in a variety}} of habitats. They are very agile climbers and have bushy tails. They eat invertebrates and small vertebrates.|$|R
5|$|The {{two species}} of Seorsumuscardinus are known from {{isolated}} teeth, which show that they were medium-sized dormice with flat teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the anterotropid, distinguishes the two species, as it {{is present in the}} lower molars of S.alpinus, but not in those of S.bolligeri. Another crest, the centroloph, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in S.bolligeri, but not in S.alpinus. Seorsumuscardinus may be related to Muscardinus, the genus of the living hazel <b>dormouse,</b> which appears at about the same time, and the older Glirudinus.|$|E
5|$|Two {{comprehensive}} {{histories of}} Engelbart's laboratory and work are in What the <b>Dormouse</b> Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry by John Markoff and A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century by Donald Neilson. Other books on Engelbart and his laboratory include Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing by Thierry Bardini and The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart, by Valerie Landau and Eileen Clegg {{in conversation with}} Douglas Engelbart. All four of these books are {{based on interviews with}} Engelbart as well as other contributors in his laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description of}} S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests are not connected {{on the sides of the}} tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel <b>dormouse,</b> but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
40|$|Population {{densities of}} marked common <b>dormice</b> Muscardinus avellanarius are {{generally}} based on nest box checks. As <b>dormice</b> also use natural cavities and leaf nests, {{we tried to}} answer the question "what proportion of the population cannot be monitored by nest boy checks", using parallel trapping sessions. We selected a forest of 1. 7 ha where a 5 -year nest box survey revealed an annual mean of 3. 4 ± 1. 4 <b>dormice</b> per check. The trap design (permanent grid of 77 hanging platforms) was developed in June. During July and August the traps were set every second week (4 sessions of two nights = 8 nights) resulting in a total of 75 captures with mean of 9. 4 <b>dormice</b> per night and the presence of 16 different individuals. The grid of 60 nest boxes was checked weekly (8 times) which allowed the recapture of 19 <b>dormice</b> with a mean of 2. 4 <b>dormice,</b> per control day and the presence of 6 different individuals. Population density estimated by calendar of capture and the minimal number of <b>dormice</b> alive methods gave for nest-box checks a value of 2. 4 animals/ha and the trap checks 6. 6 animals/ha with the conclusion that 63 % of the population were not being monitored by nest box checks...|$|R

5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of <b>dormouse</b> (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple hairstreak butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Thomas Bolliger {{described}} some {{teeth of}} Seorsumuscardinus from the Swiss locality of Tägernaustrasse (MN 4; early Miocene, see MN zonation) as an indeterminate <b>dormouse</b> (family Gliridae) perhaps related to Eomuscardinus. Six years later, Hans de Bruijn named the new {{genus and species}} Seorsumuscardinus alpinus {{on the basis of}} material from Oberdorf in Austria (also MN 4) and included fossils from Tägernaustrasse and from Karydia in Greece (MN 4) in Seorsumuscardinus. In 2007, Jerome Prieto and Madeleine Böhme named Heissigia bolligeri as a new genus and species from Affalterbach in Bavaria (MN 5, younger than MN 4), and referred the Tägernaustrasse material to it, but failed to compare their new genus to Seorsumuscardinus. Two years later, Prieto published a note to compare the two and concluded that they were referable to the same genus, but different species. Thus, the genus Seorsumuscardinus now includes the species Seorsumuscardinus alpinus from MN 4 and S.bolligeri from MN 5. Prieto provisionally placed the Tägernaustrasse material with S.alpinus. He also mentioned Pentaglis földváry, a name given to a single upper molar from the middle Miocene of Hungary, which is now lost. Although the specimen shows some similarities with Seorsumuscardinus, published illustrations are too poor to confirm the identity of Pentaglis, and Prieto considered the latter name to be an unidentifiable nomen dubium.|$|E

25|$|The {{biological}} {{diversity of the}} country is high, with 1% of the world's organisms on 0.004% of the Earth's surface area. There are 75 mammal species, among them marmots, Alpine ibex, and chamois. There are numerous deer, roe deer, boar, and hares. The edible <b>dormouse</b> is often found in the Slovenian beech forests. Trapping these animals is a long tradition and {{is a part of the}} Slovenian national identity.|$|E

50|$|Depending {{on where}} this species is {{geographical}} located determines {{whether or not}} it hibernates and for how long. In Israel, forest <b>dormice</b> stay active throughout the year. However, during the winter they do go through a period of torpor for {{a certain amount of time}} each day. Forest <b>dormice</b> located in the north tend to hibernate from October until April. During this period of hibernation, northern <b>dormice</b> will sit on their back legs and curl up into a ball. Its tail will wrap around its body and its hands may touch its cheeks. In all hibernating species, body temperature decreases from the range of 35-37 °C to about 5 °C.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dormice</b> {{are small}} rodents, with body lengths between 6 and 19 cm, and weights between 15 and 180 g. They are {{generally}} mouse-like in appearance, but with furred, rather than scaly, tails. They are largely arboreal, agile, and well adapted to climbing. Most species are nocturnal. <b>Dormice</b> {{have an excellent}} sense of hearing and signal {{each other with a}} variety of vocalisations.|$|R
50|$|Garden <b>dormice</b> are {{primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in spherical nests in trees during the day. At night, {{they look for}} food, mainly eating larger insects, such as grasshoppers and beetles, and snails, eggs, young nestlings, small rodents, and spiders, as well as berries, fruit, and nuts, such as acorns and beechnuts. While omnivorous, the diet of <b>dormice</b> contains slightly more animal protein than vegetation.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the pathogenic variant of Lyme disease spirochetes, isolate A 14 S, is perpetuated in a particular reservoir-vector relationship, we screened vector ticks in various Central European sites for a related spirochete and determined its host association. A 14 S-like spirochetes infect numerous questing ticks in the Petite Camargue Alsacienne (PC). They frequently infect <b>dormice,</b> but no mice or voles. Garden <b>dormice</b> appear to be better reservoir hosts for A 14 S-like spirochetes than for Borrelia afzelii, because these spirochetes are retained longer and infect ticks more readily. Spirochetes associated with garden <b>dormice</b> in the PC site form a homologous entity with those isolated from a human patient in The Netherlands. Its unique biological relationship together with previous genetic characterization justifies designating this dormouse-associated genospecies as a distinct entity. Garden <b>dormice</b> serve as the main reservoir hosts of a novel genospecies, Borrelia spielmani sp. nov., one of several that cause Lyme disease in people...|$|R
