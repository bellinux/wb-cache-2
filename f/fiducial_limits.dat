Chemical control methods are not ecofriendly and have several problems of resistance development and residual toxicity. Therefore, biological control methods were {{tried to control}} the insect. To start with methods were standardized to rear the insect in the laboratory. Insecticidal crystal protein was extracted from Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. tenebrionis grown on the sporulation medium. The specific activity of the insecticidal protein in 50 ml 48 h old culture containing 10 - 9 cells was 2. 5 Î¼g mL- 1. Bioassay was standardized in replicated sets to test the insecticidal property of the toxic protein on Myllocerus larvae by soil drenching and root dip methods. In the soil drenching procedure, the freshly emerged larvae from the egg were transferred to the pots containing the brinjal seedlings, which was treated with 10 mL of 102 to 10 - 4 ng/mL concentrations of Bt toxins. In the root dip method, the root tissue of known size treated with the same concentrations of Bt toxins and dried in air were fed to the larvae. Suitable controls were compared. Mortality was recorded after 24 hours. Lethal concentration of Bt was determined by Probit analysis. The LC 50 values were 2. 69 ng mL- 1 and <b>Fiducial</b> <b>limit</b> was 1. 4 - 511 ng mL- 1.

40|$|A gas chromatographic {{method was}} applied to the {{determination}} of the urinary glycine conjugates, hippuric, o-, m- and p-methylhippuric acids. These were extracted with ethyl acetate from urine after acidification with hydrochloric acid. The internal standard solution (heptadecanoic acid methanol solution) was added before extraction and a diazomethane-ether-ethanol solution was subsequently added to the dried extracts. The methylated residues were dissolved in methanol and injected into a gas chromatograph as described by Buchet and Lauwerys (1973). By the combined use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry the methyl esters of hippuric acid and m-methylhippuric acid were identified in the urine of a volunteer who had been exposed to toluene and m-xylene vapours. When the urine specimen contained salicyluric acid (a urinary metabolite of salicylic acid) two sharp peaks were observed. The faster peak coincided with m- or p-methylhippuric acid.

The TD 50 for transplanted primary LMC 1 cells was approximately 12 (<b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> 8 - 20 cells), and the latency of the 8 - 10 mm tumours formed (T 8 - 10) after inocula of 10 (2) to 10 (5) cells decreased linearly with the logarithmic {{increase in the number}} of cells injected.

Heterozygotes can be detected by virtue of codominance in all combinations except a few in which bands of single groups are absent (“semi-null” alleles). No recombinations were detected in 7419 F 2 segregants of 53 different combinations of alleles. A maximum <b>fiducial</b> <b>limit</b> (P = 0. 01) of 0. 08 % crossing-over between any Prx- 4 band groups is estimated.

The disposition of a is not similarly associated with that of the other bands, while that of the faint-staining c could not always be reliably resolved.

The CyberKnife is an attractive technology for delivering large fraction doses based {{on the ability to}} deliver highly conformal radiation therapy to moving targets. In addition to intra-fractional translational motion (left-right, superior-inferior and anterior-posterior), prostate rotation (pitch, roll and yaw) can increase geographical miss risk.

40|$|A {{search for}} heavy neutrinos in the decay K⁺→μ⁺_h has been {{performed}} using {{the data collected}} by the NA 62 -R_K experiment in 2007. The signal event selection is presented, along with {{an estimate of the}} expected background in the signal region, obtained by Monte Carlo simulation as well as data driven techniques. This estimate is supported by studies of the detector performance in muon identification efficiency and momentum resolution. Using a sample corresponding to 6 x 10 ^ 7 kaon decays in the <b>fiducial</b> volume, <b>limits</b> of order 10 ^-^ 5 have been set on the branching ratio, Br(K^+→μ^+ν_h), for neutrino masses in the range 275 MeV/c^ 2 – 375 MeV/c^ 2, under the assumption that the heavy neutrino does not decay into visible particles inside the detector. In the range 330 MeV/c^ 2 – 375 MeV/c^ 2, there are no previous limits from peak searches. Over the rest of the range, the new limits do not improve upon existing results. Improved limits might come from the NA 62 experiment designed to measure the branching ratio of the ultra rare kaon decay K+→π^+νν, which began taking data in 2015. Kaon identification is performed by a differential Cherenkov detector. The timing resolution of the photo-detectors was measured in a pilot run in 2014 and used to improve the simulation of the detector. An algorithm was developed to align the detector during live data taking, and this was used {{at the start of the}} 2015 run. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{progress in}} mobile augmented reality (AR) over recent years, {{there are few}} commercial entertainment systems utilizing this exciting technology. To help understand why, we shall review {{the state of the}} art in mobile AR solutions, in particular sensor-based, marker-based, and markerless solutions through a design lens of existing and future entertainment services. The majority of mobile AR that users are currently likely to encounter principally utilize sensor-based or marker-based solutions. In sensor-based systems, the poor accuracy of the sensor measurements results in relatively crude augmentation, whereas in marker-based systems, the requirement to physically augment our environment with <b>fiducial</b> markers <b>limits</b> the opportunity for wide-scale deployment. While the alternative online markerless systems overcome these limitations, they are sensitive to environmental conditions (i. e. light conditions), are computationally more expensive, and present greater complexity of implementation, particularly in terms of their system-initialization requirements. To simplify the operation of online markerless systems, a novel, fully autonomous map initialization method based on accelerometer data is also presented; when compared with alternative move-matching techniques, it is simpler to implement, more robust, faster, and less computationally expensive. Finally, we highlight that while there are many technical challenges remaining to make mobile AR development easier, we also acknowledge that because of the nature of AR, it is often difficult to assess the experience that mobile AR will provide to users without resorting to complex system implementations. We address this by presenting a method of creating low-fidelity prototypes for mobile AR entertainment systems...|$|R
40|$|Dynamical {{properties}} of spherically symmetric galaxy models where both the stellar and total mass density distributions are {{described by the}} Jaffe (1983) profile (with different scale-lenghts and masses), are presented. The orbital structure of the stellar component is described by Osipkov [...] Merritt anisotropy, and a black hole (BH) is added {{at the center of}} the galaxy; the dark matter halo is isotropic. First, the conditions required to have a nowhere negative and monothonically decreasing dark matter halo density profile, are derived. We then show that the phase-space distribution function can be recovered by using the Lambert-Euler $W$ function, while in absence of the central BH only elementary functions appears in the integrand of the inversion formula. The minimum value of the anisotropy radius for consistency is derived in terms of the galaxy parameters. The Jeans equations for the stellar component are solved analytically, and the projected velocity dispersion at the center and at large radii are also obtained analytically for generic values of the anisotropy radius. Finally, the relevant global quantities entering the Virial Theorem are computed analytically, and the <b>fiducial</b> anisotropy <b>limit</b> required to prevent the onset of Radial Orbit Instability is determined as a function of the galaxy parameters. The presented models, even though highly idealized, represent a substantial generalization of the models presentd in Ciotti et al. (2009), and can be useful as starting point for more advanced modeling the dynamics and the mass distribution of elliptical galaxies. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures. MNRAS, accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of two rodent X {{human somatic cell}} hybrids, carrying different inborn translocations of the human chromosome 14 long arm, has permitted us to narrow down the localization of the structural locus for alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (PI) to band 14 q 32. 1, proximally to the highly polymorphic DNA locus D 14 S 1 which has been localized by previous studies between 14 q 32. 1 and 14 q 32. 2. These data, evaluated {{in conjunction with other}} published information, suggest that the D 14 S 1 locus is cytologically equidistant from both the PI locus and the complex locus for the immunoglobulin heavy chains (IGH) but, genetically, it appears much closer to the latter since the recombination frequency reported between the IGH complex and PI is six times greater than that between the IGH complex and D 14 S 1 (lod score peaks respectively at 26 % and 4 % with narrow <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits).</b> The present report adds further strength to the frequently proposed hypothesis of a nonlinear relationship between cytologic and genetic distances of human genes. The possibility that this phenomenon may be a feature of frequent occurrence throughout the entire human genome is discusse...|$|E
40|$|Urinary gonadotrophins were assayed against HMG 20 A {{during the}} menstrual cycle in four {{subjects}} by methods believed to measure {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) and total gonado-trophin respectively. The gonadotrophins showed qualitative fluctuation. Three subjects showed maximum levels of total gonadotrophin near {{the middle of the}} cycle, and three showed a notably different pattern of excretion of FSH with high values {{in the first part of}} the cycle. Gonadotrophins from patients with secondary amenorrhoea showed no qualitative fluctuation, but treatment with stilboestrol apparently caused a rise in excretion of interstitial cell stimu-lating hormone in three out of nine patients. The results of ninety-eight assays are recorded with <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> and are discussed with reference to the specificity of the methods and the importance of inter-assay errors. In this investigation the excretion ofgonadotrophin at different stages of the menstrual cycle has been measured by the same methods as were used in a previous study[Brown, 1958]. At the same time patients with secondary amenorrhoea of unknown aetiology have been investigated because understanding of this abnormality is relevant to the study of normal function. The fluctuation in gonadotrophin excretion by these patients has been compared with the fluctuation during the menstrual cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{ordinary}} {{method of}} the biological direct assay {{has been described by}} many authors and most investigators being engaged in the biological assay have practiced the method for a long time. It seems, however, to us that the method is in need of large number of subjects and the <b>fiducial</b> <b>limits</b> appling Fieller 2 ̆ 7 s theorem are mostly too wide to be useful for the consideration of the relative potency of test preparation, in spite of that the principle of Fieller 2 ̆ 7 s theorem itself contains a kind of discussion. In this paper, an extensive method of the direct assay is proposed and its analysis is shown with the numerical illustrations. Because of that our preferable circumstances assumed in section 2 is satisfied naturally as our situation performing the considerable kinds of biological assay, and the analytical method is devised sufficiently from the theoretical and practical viewpoints, it seems that our extensive direct assay may be advantage to estimate and test the potency of test preparation for some direct assays in aid of the above appeals for the improvement of the customary direct assay...|$|E
