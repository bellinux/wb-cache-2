40|$|The horizontal, reverse taper, wiped film {{evaporator}} that was evaluated demonstrated {{a number of}} positive characteristics with respect to its applicability in the solidification of nuclear fuel recovery process wastes. Foremost among these {{is its ability to}} remove the bulk (80 to 90 percent) of the liquid associated with any of the purex-type high level, intermediate level, or mixed waste slurries. The major disadvantage of the evaporator is its current inability to discharge a product that is low enough in liquid content to avoid sticking to the evaporator <b>discharge</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Also, while the indirect indications of the torque required to turn the rotor and the power drawn by the drive motor are indicative of the liquid content of the discharged product, no reliable correlation has been found to cover all of the possible flow rates and feed stock compositions that the evaporator may be required to handle. In addition, no reliable means has been found to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} product flow through the <b>discharge</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The lack of a positive means of moving the product concentrate out of the evaporator and into a high temperature receiver is an undesirable feature of the evaporator. Pulverized glass former, or frit, was added to the evaporator feedstock in a ratio of frit to metal oxides of 2 to 1, and the resulting mixture successfully evaporated to a concentrate containing about 50 percent solids.

40|$|After {{the end of}} injection, {{the needle}} closes and {{residual}} fuel present inside the injector sac and orifices is discharged due to the high fluid inertia. This so-called post-injection <b>fuel</b> <b>discharge</b> can present several problems. The excess fuel can undergo incomplete combustion due to its large, slow moving and often surface-bound nature. Not only does this {{have a negative effect}} on emissions and performance, but it has been speculated that the by-products of incomplete combustion are implicated in the growth of carbonaceous deposits on the tips of fuel injectors. Accumulation of these deposits is known to lead to premature fuel injector failure that can lead to re-ductions in power output and engine lifetime. Seeing as modern multiple-injection strategies give rise to an in-creased number of transient injection phases, post-injection discharges are an increasingly common occurrence during normal operating conditions. In order to develop a phenomenological model for the fluid dynamics after the end of injection, there is a need to characterise the causes of this discharge and how they might be influenced by engine operating conditions. In this study we present ongoing analysis into results from the first visualisation of post injection <b>fuel</b> <b>discharge</b> at the microscopic level under engine-like operating conditions. We observed the process of <b>fuel</b> <b>discharge</b> for multi-hole injectors, using a high-speed camera fitted with a long-distance micro-scope and a high-speed laser illumination source. We related the effect of a variety of operating conditions on the severity of this process, including injection pressure and in-cylinder pressure along with a characterisation of the dynamics of the various modes by which these undesired liquid structures are produced. We present the different modes by which this process occurs and we conclude that the extent of post-injection discharge depends on both the in-cylinder and injection pressures...|$|R

40|$|In {{the smart}} grids context, {{distributed}} energy resources management {{plays an important role}} in the power systems’ operation. Battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles should be important resources in the future distribution networks operation. Therefore, it is important to develop adequate methodologies to schedule the electric vehicles’ charge and discharge processes, avoiding network congestions and providing ancillary services. This paper proposes the participation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in fuel shifting demand response programs. Two services are proposed, namely the fuel shifting and the <b>fuel</b> <b>discharging.</b> The <b>fuel</b> shifting program consists in replacing the electric energy by fossil fuels in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles daily trips, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>discharge</b> program consists in use of their internal combustion engine to generate electricity injecting into the network.
