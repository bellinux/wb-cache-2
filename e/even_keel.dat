5|$|In contrast, Somerset's {{successor}} John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, made Duke of Northumberland in 1551, {{was once}} regarded by historians {{merely as a}} grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the crown. Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal Council and returning the government to an <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as manager of}} Conference North club Alfreton Town on 25 May 2005 on a three-year contract, becoming the first full-time manager in the club's history. Alfreton went into 2005–06 with a reduced playing budget and Mills {{was able to keep}} the club on an <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> His first match as Alfreton manager was a 2–1 home defeat to Vauxhall Motors on 13 August 2005, and having flirted with relegation the team finished the season in 17th place in the Conference North. Mills was registered as a player in 2005–06, and made 21 appearances after his debut came in a 2–1 home win over Redditch United on 10 September 2005.|$|E
5|$|Köln was {{the only}} ship of the class to survive the {{operations}} off Norway. After returning to Germany, she was modified {{to serve as a}} testbed for the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter. She thereafter served in the Baltic, providing gunfire support to advancing German troops in 1941. In mid 1942, she returned to Norwegian waters, and unsuccessfully attempted to attack Convoy PQ 18 along with several other German warships. She was then ordered back to Germany, where she served in a variety of roles, including training ship and convoy escort, before again returning to Norway. She was damaged by British bombers in December 1944 and forced to return to Germany for repairs. While in dock in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, she was attacked and sunk by American heavy bombers. She sank on an <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> with her guns still above water, which permitted their use against advancing British forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E

50|$|For {{those who}} have not {{witnessed}} this unique JB phenomenon, the experience can be intimidating and sometimes amusing! When the divine sedans are carried for the three journeys, robust devotees, usually young men with bravado will jostle, push and shove for a hold on the sedans and it is not uncommon that they will end up with bruises, sprains and other minor injuries! With this jostling and shoving, the sedans will rock wildly and violently, sometimes <b>even</b> <b>keeling</b> over to knock at the devotees or bystanders! The believers insist that the sedans rocked because of the deities’ mood and the jostling for positions is to steady and keep them firm.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{negative}} review for Rolling Stone, David Fricke said [...] "too much of Cut the Crap is Strummer's angst running on automatic, superficially ferocious but ultimately stiff and unconvincing." [...] Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times felt the uptempo rockers sounded less effective than previous Clash records {{in light of}} the tamer political climate at the time and the absence of Jones, although he concluded that Strummer's singing was still compelling and the ballads [...] "This Is England" [...] and [...] "North and South" [...] made the album [...] "more than passable". In a more positive review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said in spite of the synthesized horns on [...] "Dictator", most of the songs eventually take effect, some persistent, exuberant, melancholic, and <b>even</b> <b>keeled,</b> particularly [...] "We Are the Clash".|$|R
5|$|Like {{her sister}} ships, Köln {{served as a}} {{training}} ship for naval cadets in the 1930s, and joined the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War during {{the latter part of}} the decade. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she conducted several operations in the North Sea, but did not encounter any British warships. She participated in the attack on Bergen during Operation Weserübung in April 1940, and she was the only member of her class to survive the operation. In 1942, she was modified to carry a Flettner Fl 282 helicopter experimentally. Later in 1942, she returned to Norway, but did not see significant action. She remained there until early 1945, when she returned to Germany; in March, she was sunk by American bombers in Wilhelmshaven. She remained on an <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> with her gun turrets above water; this allowed her to provide gunfire support to defenders of the city until the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1314 December, Köln was {{attacked}} by British bombers in Oslofjord; several near misses caused damage to her propulsion system that required repair in Germany. She departed Norway on 23 January 1945 in company with Admiral Hipper and a destroyer, and arrived in Kiel on 8 February. She then proceeded to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again attacked by Allied bombers repeatedly. On 30 March, B-24 Liberators from the Eighth Air Force attacked the harbor; Köln was hit and sank on an <b>even</b> <b>keel.</b> Since her guns remained above water, the ship {{was used as an}} artillery battery to defend the city from advancing Allied forces. She served in this capacity {{until the end of the}} war in May. She was partially dismantled in situ after the end of the war, and finally raised in 1956 for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations in Versailles that ultimately produced the treaty {{that ended the}} war. A copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter {{came to the conclusion}} that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Hindenburg was the last ship to sink, at 17:00. Her captain had deliberately arranged that the ship sank on an <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> to make it easier for her crew to escape. After several unsuccessful attempts, she was raised on 23 July 1930, only to be scrapped at Rosyth between 1930 and 1932. Her bell was presented to the Bundesmarine (Federal Navy) on 28 May 1959.|$|E
5000|$|One of the story's heroes, Oakhurst is {{occasionally}} frank but kind in motivation. He is chivalrous, insisting upon switching {{his good}} riding horse Five Spot for the mule of the Duchess {{and refusing to}} use vulgar language. Another instance of his good nature is: [...] "'Tommy, you're a good little man, but you can't gamble worth a cent. Don't try it ever again.' He then handed him back his money back, and pushed him gently from the room". Oakhurst is not a drinker. He is cool tempered, <b>even</b> <b>keeled</b> and has a calm manner about him. He believes in luck and fate. His suicide spurs the question whether he was simply giving into his bad luck or rather, decided {{he was no longer}} going to live by luck and took his life.|$|R
2500|$|All vessels have keels, {{it is the}} {{backbone}} of the hull. In traditional construction, it is the structure upon which all else depends. Modern monocoque designs include a virtual <b>keel.</b> <b>Even</b> multihulls have <b>keels.</b> On a sailboat, the word [...] "keel" [...] is also used to refer to the area that is added to the hull to improve its lateral plane. The lateral plane is what prevents leeway and allows sailing towards the wind. This can be an external piece or a part of the hull.|$|R

5|$|The {{ships were}} turned into {{floating}} AA batteries {{over the next}} several months although it availed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July. On the 24th Ise was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded. The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow, although she was returned to an <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> after three days pumping. Hyūga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses. She was badly damaged with some 200-odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack. She slowly foundered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later. This time it was Ises turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list. The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war.|$|E
5|$|The three ships all {{participated in}} the {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–1939. After the outbreak of war, {{they were used to}} lay defensive minefields along with Emden, and in April 1940, {{participated in the}} invasion of Norway. Two of the three cruisers, Karlsruhe and Königsberg, were sunk during the invasion; Karlsruhe was torpedoed by a British submarine off Kristiansand and Königsberg was sunk by British divebombers in Bergen. Köln was used in a variety of roles after the conclusion of the campaign, including as a testbed for operating the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter at sea. She was bombed and sunk by American heavy bombers in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, though she sank in shallow water on an <b>even</b> <b>keel,</b> which allowed her guns to provide gunfire support to German troops {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was airborne after {{a run of}} approximately 1100 yards, climbed to about 150 feet in a perfectly normal manner and then gradually lost height, striking the sea on an <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> approximately 1200 yards after leaving the ground.|$|E
50|$|The dorsal {{scales are}} {{strongly}} <b>keeled,</b> <b>even</b> on the occiput and nape, and {{are arranged in}} 19 rows. Ventrals are 102-130 in number, the anal scale is divided, and the 61-94 subcaudals are paired and keeled.|$|R
50|$|As {{has almost}} all {{of the rest of the}} ship, <b>even</b> the <b>keel</b> has been remade. It can be argued that Bluenose II had so many rebuilds and repairs over the years since she was built in 1963 by the Olands, that she has not been the same ship for quite some time. The current rebuild aims to have the {{schooner}} look more like the original Bluenose with smaller deckhouses and more deck space, as Bluenose II was built with yacht accommodation as opposed to the layout of a fishing schooner. Various subcomponents for this Bluenose II project were supplied from notable firms including the ships keel at Snyders Shipyard in Dayspring, the ships backbone of laminated ribs at Covey Island Boatworks in Riverport and assembly of the vessel in Lunenburg.|$|R

25|$|As {{the wind}} shifts {{direction}} and changes the loads on the turbine and foundation, a secondary hull-trim system shifts ballast water between {{each of the}} three columns. This permits the platform to maintain <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> while producing the maximum amount of energy. This is in contrast to other floating concepts which have implemented control strategies that de-power the turbine to compensate for changes in turbine thrust-induced overturning moment.|$|E
25|$|Great Western was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, {{with four}} masts to hoist the {{auxiliary}} sails. The sails {{were not just}} to provide auxiliary propulsion, but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship on an <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American's British Queen went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson & Mercer in Bristol, Great Western was launched on 19 July 1837 and then sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons & Field, producing 750 indicated horsepower between them. The ship proved satisfactory in service and initiated the transatlantic route, acting {{as a model for}} all following Atlantic paddle-steamers.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics watertight doors. This {{theory suggests}} that if these doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled on an <b>even</b> <b>keel</b> and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus {{it was impossible to}} lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E
