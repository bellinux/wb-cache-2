Deprogrammer Rick Ross had been referred to Scott's mother by a local volunteer for CAN, and Moxon represented Scott in a lawsuit against Ross and CAN. Moxon took on Jason Scott's case pro bono. According to a 60 Minutes report on Scientology's actions against the Cult Awareness Network, two affidavits used by Moxon in the case were false. Scott won a jury judgment of US$5 million including $1.8 million against CAN, and CAN later declared bankruptcy. After the CAN organization was purchased in bankruptcy court by a Scientology attorney, Scott fired Moxon and hired Graham Berry, a Los Angeles lawyer who had previously represented clients in suits against the Church of Scientology. Scott and Ross settled in 1996 for $5,000 and 200 hours of time from Ross for his <b>intervention</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

Subjects and methods: The three-year outcomes for the first group of 62 Patients to receive three years treatment in the Early <b>Intervention</b> <b>Service</b> in Luton, Bedfordshire were examined.

Results: It does not appear that there are major differences between the three-year outcomes of any one of the three groups studied.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} a new early <b>intervention</b> <b>service</b> for survivors of cardiac arrest and their caregivers, and {{to explain the}} evidence and rationale behind it. Rationale: A cardiac arrest may cause hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, which often results in cognitive impairments. Survivors of cardiac arrest can also encounter emotional problems, limitations in daily life, reduced participation in society and a decreased quality of life. A new early <b>intervention</b> <b>service</b> was designed based on literature study, expert opinion and patient experiences. Description of the intervention: The early <b>intervention</b> <b>service</b> is an individualized programme, consisting of one to six consultations by a specialized nurse for the patient and their caregiver. The intervention starts soon after discharge from the hospital and can last up to three months. The intervention consists of screening for cognitive and emotional problems, provision of information and support, promotion of self-management strategies and can include referral to further specialized care if indicated. Discussion: This intervention is assumed to reduce future problems related to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury in the patient and caregiver, and its effectiveness is currently being investigated in a randomized controlled multicentre trial. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|R
