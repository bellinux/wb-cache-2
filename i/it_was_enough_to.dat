This set up the AFL's first-ever playoff game to decide which of the teams would win the division and compete in the championship. The Bills lost the game, 26–8.|$|E

The Gliders then defeated the United States by a point {{to set up a}} final clash with Germany. The Gliders lost 44–58, and earned a silver medal.|$|E
5|$|After graduating a Bachelor of Arts, Tarr was {{articled}} to the solicitors firm of Owston, Dickinson, Simpson, and Bigg in Leicester, {{and also}} joined the Leicester Tigers, {{then as now}} {{considered one of the}} strongest clubs in the country. He scored 72 points in 94 appearances. In 1913, having been dropped by England four years earlier, he was surprised to be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability to}} play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully sat up and waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to a small gap over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E

5|$|Karthik {{established}} himself as a regular opener in the mid-2007 Test series in England. After scoring 76 and 51 in the two tour matches ahead of the Tests, he recorded a half century {{in each of the three}} Tests, regularly helping India to make solid starts. In the First Test at Lord’s, Karthik made 60 in the second innings before India fell to 9/282 in pursuit of 380 when rain ended the match early. In the Second Test at Trent Bridge, Karthik scored 77, helping to lay a top-order platform for India’s first innings of 481, which gave them a 283-run lead. He then scored 22 as they reached their target of 73 to take a winning series lead. In the Third Test at The Oval, Karthik scored 91 as India batted first and helped to lay the foundation for their total of 664 and a first-innings lead. This was enough to secure a 319-run first innings lead, and although India were unable to finish England off, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> secure a 10 series win. With a total of 263 runs at 43.83, he was the highest scorer in the series for India, as the tourists won their first series in England for 21 years. He started the ODI series with an unbeaten 44 in the first ODI as India capitulated to 184 all out and a 104-run defeat, but thereafter had four consecutive innings where he failed to score more than four runs, and he was dropped for the final two matches.|$|E

25|$|His parents, {{upon his}} graduation, {{had decided to}} give him a monthly {{allowance}} of $200 out of their earnings from Cobblestone Gardens, a substantial sum in those days. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep him going, and indeed it guaranteed his survival for the next twenty-five years, arriving with welcome regularity.

25|$|Eager {{not to miss}} Football League fixtures, and {{not to have a}} {{difficult}} trip again, the club chartered a British European Airways plane from Manchester to Belgrade for the away leg against Red Star.

The takeoff from Belgrade was delayed for an hour after outside right Johnny Berry lost his passport, and the plane landed in Munich for refuelling at 13:15 GMT.|$|E

This lack of ideological preoccupation doesn't mean that the party didn't bother to spread its principles.
