60|$|That {{night we}} sailed for Alacranes. It {{was a white}} night of the tropics, with a million stars {{blinking}} in the blue dome overhead, and the Caribbean Sea like a shadowed opal, calm and rippling and shimmering. The Xpit was not a bark of comfort. It had a bare deck and an empty hold. I could not stay below in that gloomy, ill-smelling pit, so I tried to sleep on deck. I lay on a hatch under the great boom, and what with its creaking, and the hollow roar of the sail, and the wash of the waves, and the dazzling starlight, I could not sleep.

There were phosphorescent waves rolling up as if they meant to eat me, {{and all the rest of}} the night as black as pitch. The air was simply yelling. The clouds seemed down on your head almost, and the rain fell as if heaven was sinking and they were baling out the waters above the firmament. One great roller came writhing at me, like a fiery serpent, and I bolted. Then I thought of the canoe, and ran down to it as the water went hissing back again; but the thing had gone. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the egg then, and felt my way to it.

Rogers also questioned certain policies of Louisiana Education Superintendent Shelby M. Jackson, an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for governor in the 1963 primary election.

40|$|Roman Civilization in his ‘New Rome ’ in the 1930 ’s.

Wandering through the vast marble halls, my head still full of information about new humanities digitization projects, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the huge amounts of time and energy that must have been spent in reproducing objects on such a vast architectural scale; about the classifications and groupings of objects within the museum displays, and about the ‘knowledge ’ represented in and through the collection, which extended beyond that contained within remnants of original objects, to a conscious display of knowledge about Roman civilization revealed through reproduction and presentation of facsimiles or surrogates.

40|$|Growing {{up as an}} Asian American, I {{never really}} had a role model of sort that I could relate to entirely. There were the general {{characters}} in movies that I looked up to {{but there was never}} that one character that I could possibly see myself as because there was never any lead characters that looked like me. Every time an Asian character was showed on-screen they were never a normal relatable person; they were always rather a living stereotype or unrealistic. Asians are always portrayed as intellectuals that are very awkward and geeky or one who has a very thick ethnic accent. Apart from Aladdin and Jackie Chan there never was a core Asian character who I looked up to as a role model. So, growing up there was always a stigma towards me that I had to be very Asian or very smart. Ever since Asians immigrated to the United States, they were being portrayed by the media in one form or another. The portrayal was often stereotyped extensively which affected the public’s viewpoint towards Asian Americans. But in the recent decade the portrayal of Asian Americans has shifted to a more positive and everyday image. So, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> how this happened and asked my research question, “How and Why has American Media Shifted the On-Screen Image of Asian Americans from Stereotypical Roles to Lead Roles?”[URL]...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{women are more likely to}} be raped or killed by an {{intimate}} partner in their own home, stranger attacks are still seen as the defining experience of violence perpetrated by men against women. It is a narrative of convenience: one that conceals women who manage to survive partner violence but deserve no less justice; that comforts other women (and men) who believe that they can do things to avoid being violated; that dilutes the notion that the perpetrator had made a choice; and that exonerates institutions from systemic failures. Moreover, random attacks that gain media attention rarely shed light on a critical question: how do we prevent future rapes and murders of women by men? I entered this question with the notion that it is not enough to push back against victim-blaming. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the structural nature of sexually violent crime, and whether there are policy calculations that might do more to minimise victimisation of women. The reality is that sociocultural approaches to masculinised violence are almost inextricable from contemporary criminal justice philosophy, which takes criminal behaviour as correctible via punitive and therapeutic interventions. When we start deconstructing what it is that makes certain men violent – in order to figure out how to keep women safe – it becomes evident that incarceration is a severely limited, often post facto intervention.

I had just started my doctoral work in the early 1980 s with a focus in interpersonal and relational communication. Not long before this time, my cousin in another state had endured a terrible car accident and he was now experiencing paraplegia. I followed the news coming from different fam-ily members during my cousin’s hospitalization and rehabilitation stays. The news was mostly about his physical condition [...] {{the nature of his}} injuries, his medical treatment, and prognosis for his recovery. There was honestly little mention of anything else.

As I pondered on my understanding of this relationship, <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> it in terms of what is written in faculty of education handbooks and educational literature. Was there more? How might associate teachers 1 experiences be listened to and written about differently? Associate teachers speak in terms of personal uncertainty, professional duty and a feeling of being taken-for-granted (Slocum, 1989). They talk about discovering conflicts in their positions, their concerns and tensions and the pleasure and excitement of experiencing collegiality with the student teacher (Slocum, 1989). Is this pointed to as part of the associate teachers role and responsibility in practicum handbooks? In other words, what remains silent and hidden and taken for granted about this relationship? In what way may we enter into this relationship so that the invisible becomes visible?

40|$|When I {{think back}} on my {{decision}} {{to pursue a career}} in cardiac electrophysiology, I recall how much I enjoyed this field in which almost every disease state and its specific treatment seemed logical. I was fascinated by the physiology of electrophysiology, how arrhythmias were generated, and how an understanding of pathophysiology led to curative procedures. I recall the joy of my first catheter ablation of an accessory pathway, how the surface electrocardiogram normalized within seconds of applying radiofrequency energy and, more importantly, how the supraventricular tachycardia that had plagued the patient for years was no longer able to be induced by pacing maneuvers. I remember the first day that I ablated an atrial tachycardia with a combination of activation mapping and pace mapping and how an almost incessant arrhythmia was silenced and sinus rhythm reigned. And I recollect feeling confident that the chance of recurrent atrial flutter was very low when I confirmed bidirectional block in another patient for the first time after a tricuspid isthmus ablation. See page 1163 When I learned that catheter ablation procedures were being developed as a curative treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), I was intrigued but also suspicious. Sure, I ablated the His bundle for rate control of this increasingly prevalent arrhythmia, but using a catheter to forever silence the atrium from returning to a chaotic electrical storm seemed implausible.

My wandering has led {{me from the}} east {{to the west and}} back again, several times over; exploring both the inner and outer realms of wilderness. I have journeyed through steep canyon walls that have humbled me and enabled me to grasp my insignificance in the greater scheme of things. I have paddled on lakes and rivers in the mountains, prairies, on the Canadian Shield, and amongst desert sands that have all taught me to move in accordance with the flow of life rather than countering our own nature and that of the surrounding world. I have hiked on trails travelled by thou-sands as well as on barrens and streambeds likely untouched by direct human presence, both of which have helped me to dispel the myth of dualism and inspired feelings of being a part of, rather than apart from, the natural world. I recognize and celebrate the fact that my wandering has enabled me to become grounded in a deeply felt and profoundly experienced sense of relationship with the Earth. My wandering reflects a deep sense of devotion to an ongoing journey of discovering self and place.
