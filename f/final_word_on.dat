25|$|The DNA {{template}} {{is not the}} <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> mature miRNA production: 6% {{of human}} miRNAs show RNA editing (IsomiRs), the site-specific modification of RNA sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their DNA. This increases the diversity and scope of miRNA action beyond that implicated from the genome alone.|$|E

The ROK 1st Division, which would be following Task Force Growdon, was to relieve the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team upon reaching Munsan-ni, and the airborne unit then was to prepare to move south and revert to Eighth United States Army reserve.|$|E

50|$|The {{ending of}} the film {{turns out to be}} the opening {{sequence}} to the movie. Although we only see bits and pieces of the ending interrogation, the audience gets to hear of Malachy's and Luke's <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the incident before the movie cuts out.|$|R
25|$|Still, the new Governor-General {{appointed}} in 1786, Lord Cornwallis, {{not only had}} more power than Hastings, but also {{had the support of}} a powerful British cabinet minister, Henry Dundas, who, as Secretary of State for the Home Office, {{was in charge of the}} overall India policy. From 1784 onwards, the British government had the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> all major appointments in India; a candidate's suitability for a senior position was often decided by the strength of his political connections rather than that of his administrative ability. Although this practice resulted in many Governor-General nominees being chosen from Britain's conservative landed gentry, there were some liberals as well, such as Lord William Bentinck and Lord Dalhousie.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{judicial}} review can be excluded through executive decision remains a live issue because the 1989 {{amendments to the}} ISA reverted the law on {{judicial review}} applicable to the ISA to the date that Lee Mau Seng was decided. However, Lee Mau Seng appears to be bad law since it was overruled by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Furthermore, as a High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng {{may not be the}} <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> judicial review of action taken under the ISA. In addition, if detainees allege procedural impropriety, this allows a court to consider if there are procedural defects in the Executive's decision-making process, such as the taking into account of irrelevant considerations. Finally, ouster clauses are not barriers to judicial review in modern administrative law because courts can still step in to prevent jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
25|$|Though the feud raised many {{concerns}} {{as to its}} effect on the league, and the Russian national team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, it apparently dissipated as mysteriously as it started. On 24 January 2009, at the SuperSkills Competition, Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the Breakaway Challenge. Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat. Though there is no <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the nature and status of the feud, considering their past interactions, this incident appears to show that the feud has effectively ended. It has been reported that Ilya Kovalchuk, who was then the Atlanta Thrashers' captain and is also teammate of Ovechkin and Malkin on the Russian national team, brokered the peace between the two.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Castro had decided to retaliate for the attempts on his life, and that perhaps he was behind the assassination of JFK. According to the Church Committee: Book V, Drew Pearson, {{a writer for the}} Washington Post, met with Chief Justice Earl Warren in January 1967. The columnist passed along information to Warren that a client of one of his Washington lawyer friends had told his friend that Castro had plans to retaliate. Pearson asked Warren to meet with the lawyer, but Warren never did. However, Warren did inform the director of the Secret Service, James Rowley. Rowley passed the information on to Hoover, who in turn sent six secret letters to senior Bureau officials. There are no records of these conversations, and officials have adamantly denied that conversations about Castro's revenge plans ever took place. The FBI's <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the matter was that they had not found evidence suggesting that Lee Harvey Oswald had links to the Cuban government. They never informed the new administration of these talks.|$|E
25|$|Academies and {{societies}} served to disseminate Enlightenment science by publishing the scientific works of their members, {{as well as}} their proceedings. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, published by the Royal Society of London, was the only scientific periodical being published on a regular, quarterly basis. The Paris Academy of Sciences, formed in 1666, began publishing in volumes of memoirs rather than a quarterly journal, with periods between volumes sometimes lasting years. While some official periodicals may have published more frequently, there was still a long delay from a paper’s submission for review to its actual publication. Smaller periodicals, such as Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, were only published when enough content was available to complete a volume. At the Paris Academy, there was an average delay of three years for publication. At one point the period extended to seven years. The Paris Academy processed submitted articles through the Comité de Librarie, which had the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> what would or would not be published. In 1703, the mathematician Antoine Parent began a periodical, Researches in Physics and Mathematics, specifically to publish papers that had been rejected by the Comité.|$|E

500|$|Elizabeth Hand of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Meyer's prose seldom {{rises above}} the serviceable, and the {{plotting}} is leaden." [...] The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the series was, [...] "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is {{something more than just}} an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on." ...|$|E
500|$|While Napoleon's mistresses had {{children}} by him, Joséphine {{did not produce}} an heir, possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the Reign of Terror or an abortion she may have had in her twenties. Napoleon chose divorce so he could remarry {{in search of an}} heir. Despite his divorce from Josephine, Napoleon showed his dedication to her {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] When he heard the news of her death while on exile in Elba, he locked himself in his room and would not come out for two full days. [...] Her name would also be his <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> his deathbed in 1821.|$|E
500|$|The reissue was {{critically}} well received, although reception {{was mixed}} about the supplemental material. Reviews in AllMusic, Uncut, Q, Rolling Stone, Paste and PopMatters praised the supplemental material, but with reservations. A review written by Scott Plagenhoef for Pitchfork awarded the reissue a perfect score, {{arguing that it}} was worth buying for fans who did not already own the rare material. Plagenhoef said, [...] "That the band {{had nothing to do}} with these is beside the point: this is the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era." [...] The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell praised both the bonus disc and the DVD, and said of the album, [...] "It really is the perfect synthesis of Radiohead's seemingly conflicted impulses." ...|$|E

50|$|We do {{not know}} what else Papias said about these or the other Gospels—he {{certainly}} treated John—but some see Papias as the likely unattributed source of at least two later accounts of the Gospel origins. Bauckham argues that the Muratorian Canon (c. 170) has drawn from Papias; the extant fragment, however, preserves only a few <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> Mark and then speaks about Luke and John. Hill argues that Eusebius' earlier account of the origins of the four Gospels is also drawn from Papias.|$|R
5000|$|The {{order of}} the {{quotations}} is chronological; quotations without definite dates are listed last. The list below omits Hugo Gernsback's later redefining of the term [...] "science fiction". According to anthologist, populist and historian of the genre Sam Moskowitz (1920-1997), Gernback <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the matter were: [...] "Science fiction {{is a form of}} popular entertainment which contains elements of known, extrapolation of known or logical theoretical science". The list also omits John W. Campbell's infamous [...] "Science fiction is what I say it is".|$|R
500|$|He {{focused his}} {{attention}} on a problem that had eluded scientists for two hundred years: the nature of Saturn's rings. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn. The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because St John's College, Cambridge had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 Adams Prize. Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, Maxwell concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called [...] "brick-bats", each independently orbiting Saturn. Maxwell was awarded the £130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay [...] "On {{the stability of the}} motion of Saturn's rings"; he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry. His work was so detailed and convincing that when George Biddell Airy read it he commented [...] "It {{is one of the most}} remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen." [...] It was considered the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the issue until direct observations by the Voyager flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction.|$|E
500|$|In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Theseus, the Duke of Athens, is {{preparing}} to marry Hippolyta. Peter Quince decides to entertain her and hires a group of actors nicknamed the Rude Mechanicals to perform Pyramus and Thisbe, a love story. Robin {{is one of the}} Rude Mechanicals, the tailor, who gathers with his colleagues to prepare their production. Robin at first is told to play the part of Thisbe's mother, but Peter Quince points out that a love story needs moonlight shining on the lovers to have any real effect on the audience. After Nick Bottom suggests looking in the almanac for a time when the Moon might shine on their performance, the players apparently decide that they will just have Robin act as Moonshine. Robin's role as Moonshine in The Mechanical's performance of Pyramus and Thisbe before Theseus' court is often highlighted by scholars as among the funnier parts of the play. Although the court makes fun of all the players, Starveling is mocked the most by Hippolyta, who is very vocal in her opinion that his attempt to be moonshine is a ridiculous failure, although very humorous. [...] He is also the only mechanical to be cut off in his monologue as opposed to being mocked afterwards, causing him to fluster and summarise his lines rather than giving them. [...] This summary is usually played angrily or irritably, but has also been performed as the climax of Starveling's potential stage fright. [...] Starveling is the member of the group that seems to be afraid of just about anything. [...] Starveling is the most ambiguous in taking sides in the power struggle between Bottom and Quince. [...] While Snout affirms whatever Quince says and Flute always looks to Bottom for the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> something (Snug is too slow to be bothered), Starveling seems to try to agree completely with both, as impossible as it is to do so.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> Grace's 1864 {{season was}} a line in John Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion (aka [...] "Green Lilly") which said: [...] "Mr W. G. Grace {{promises}} to be a good bat: bowls very fairly".|$|E

He gets drunk, is ripped off, insulted by pretentious Englishmen and exploited by record producers, religious charlatans and a BBC television producer (Peter Cook). He reluctantly leaves England under the orders of his aunt, after exposing himself <b>on</b> television.

2500|$|One of the {{identified}} dead, Isaac E. Avery, died in action on July 2, 1863, at the Battle of Gettysburg. On that evening, his brigade stormed Cemetery Hill, trying to dislodge the Union forces. Halfway up the hill, {{he was hit}} in the throat by a musket ball. Mortally wounded, he fell from his horse. He scrawled his <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> a piece of paper: [...] "Tell my father I died with my face to the enemy." [...] Avery's body was carried as far as Williamsport, Maryland and buried there, but moved to the Washington Confederate Cemetery. A plaque was placed in the cemetery for him in 2007.|$|R

2500|$|Stephen Howe, {{professor}} {{of the history}} of colonialism at Bristol University, said that Pappé's book was an often compelling mixture of historical argument and politico-moral tract. According to Howe, while the book will not be the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> the events of 1948, it is [...] "a major intervention in an argument that will, and must, continue".|$|E
2500|$|Emma did not fade {{quietly into}} the history books, however. [...] For years after her retirement, she {{remained}} {{an important part of}} brewery operations. [...] While she did not have voting powers with the San Antonio Brewing Association, she typically had the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>on</b> all large deals or changes.

2500|$|In 1813 and 1814, Harris was {{attached}} to the 8th Veteran's Battalion based in London, having been rejected from foreign service by the Duke of Wellington, who decreed no survivors of Walcheren were to serve in his army as none were fit for marching or fighting. There he served alongside several detachments of French deserters, again witnessing the frequent brutal punishment of the day, when a man was given 700 lashes for desertion. Stricken with illness, he was unable to rejoin his regiment during the Hundred Days Campaign and thus forfeited his pension. Nonetheless, Harris’ <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the subject are very revealing. [...] "I enjoyed life more whilst on active service than I have ever done since, and I look back on my time spent on the fields of the Peninsula as the only part worthy of remembrance".|$|R

25|$|But the Silmaril escaped {{them again}} and was borne by Eärendil into the West. That Silmaril {{was lost to}} the sons of Fëanor but two more {{remained}} inside the crown of Morgoth. So after the War of Wrath the two remaining oath-takers, Maedhros and Maglor, stole the two Silmarils from the camp of the victorious West (the other five brothers were dead by this time). However, due to the terrible deeds committed by the brothers in their retrieval of the Silmarils they found they could not handle the Silmarils without enduring searing pain. The two brothers parted: in their anguish Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery chasm, and Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Maglor would spend eternity wandering the shore, lamenting his fate (though in Tolkien's <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>on</b> the subject, Maglor cast himself with his Silmaril into the sea).|$|R
