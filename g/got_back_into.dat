5|$|Ruth {{spent part}} of the offseason of 1925–26 working out at Artie McGovern's gym, where he <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> shape. Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team and {{surrounded}} the veteran core with good young players like Tony Lazzeri and Lou Gehrig, but the Yankees were not expected to win the pennant.|$|E
5|$|Norwich <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the game}} against Chelsea {{with a goal}} from Anthony Pilkington but conceded two late goals to finish 1–3 to the visitors. This was {{followed}} up with a 4–1 away defeat by Arsenal. The home fixture against Cardiff City finished in controversy during when Leroy Fer put {{the ball in the}} back of the net when passing the ball back to goalkeeper David Marshall. This resulted in a melee in which both Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing to control their players. The game was also notable with Norwich having 31 shots at goal despite the game finishing as a draw.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007–08 season, he was {{replaced}} by backup Chris Osgood, who had originally been traded away from the Red Wings {{to make way for}} Hašek before the 2001-02 season. When Hašek recovered and <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit coach Mike Babcock announced Hašek to start in the 2008 playoffs. Through the first two games against the Nashville Predators, the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism in practice and continued to support his teammates, with Darren McCarty citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually the Red Wings beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.|$|E

60|$|He {{pulled out}} his watch, and after some fumbling <b>got</b> it <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the breast pocket of his thick woollen jacket. Then he {{surveyed}} the heavens and ran his eye along the white sky-line to the south.|$|R
5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E
5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake. When Earthquake rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against Earthquake and Dino Bravo. Bravo and Earthquake powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed Earthquake to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside of the ring by Earthquake, Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. Earthquake powerslammed Hogan and performed two Earthquake splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed Earthquake. He performed a legdrop on Earthquake before Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan threw him out of the ring and then bodyslammed Earthquake onto a table at ringside. Hogan <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the ring and won the match via countout. Earthquake attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting Earthquake with a chair.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave {{up their}} planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a {{protective}} position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45a.m., Franz Ferdinand and Sophie <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the motorcade, {{once again in the}} third car. In order to avoid the city center, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, the driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. The {{reason for this is that}} Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde (who had earlier repeatedly protested about the lack of security precautions for the visit) was asked to tell the drivers of the new route but in the confusion and tensions of the moment neglected to do so.|$|E

50|$|Surprisingly, {{he moved}} {{straight}} to Villa's arch-rivals, Birmingham City. They {{went down in}} 1984 but he <b>got</b> them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the top flight at the first attempt. In January 1986, Saunders walked out on struggling Birmingham {{to take charge of}} local rivals and fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion.|$|R
50|$|Despite his success, Gray {{never fully}} settled at Forest and {{accepted}} an invitation in 1981 {{to return to}} Leeds by former teammate Allan Clarke, who was now manager. It was a £300,000 deal which <b>got</b> Gray <b>back</b> <b>into</b> Elland Road, but in the first season of his return Leeds were relegated.|$|R
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{started to}} close on Verstappen for second place, {{starting}} overtaking attempts on lap 33 and finally succeeding on lap 38. Meanwhile, Vettel was judged to have forced Felipe Massa {{off the track}} when he overtook him for eighth place, handing him a five-second time penalty. On lap 40, Jolyon Palmer retired in the pitlane. While Rosberg initially closed in on Hamilton, the latter started to improve his lap times {{towards the end of}} the race. As Räikkönen <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> fifth at the expense of Pérez, Rosberg reported problems with his gearbox on the team radio. His team told him to avoid using seventh gear, following which Rosberg was able to consolidate his slim lead over Verstappen, which had initially come down due to his problem. Hamilton was unaffected by this and crossed the line to take victory, 6.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg. He was the first driver to win the British Grand Prix three times in a row and also became the record winner at the Silverstone circuit, with four victories. It was the 47th victory of his career.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E
25|$|Bryant then <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his car {{and left}} the car park. Witnesses say he was {{sounding}} the horn and waving as he drove. Bryant drove along Jetty Road towards the toll booth where {{a number of people}} were running away. Bryant passed by at least two people.|$|E
50|$|Palazzi was the {{starting}} {{center for the}} Giants from 1946 to 1948 and ended his playing career with the Boston Yanks in 1949. After that, Chicago Bears owner George Halas, who tried to get Palazzi to play for him, <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the league as an official in 1951.|$|R

50|$|Cissé <b>got</b> himself <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the first}} team picture, but his {{relationship}} with Bruce continued to go sour, and after Christmas he only played three more games that season. At {{the end of the}} season he signed for Portsmouth for £300,000 on a two-year contract, beating off strong competition from Premiership rivals Bolton Wanderers.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, PNC <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> {{the credit}} card {{business}} by marketing and issuing credit cards, including one for small business, under the MasterCard brand by using a third-party vendor to handle its credit card business, partnering with Minneapolis, Minnesota-based U.S. Bancorp. After the National City merger in 2008, the U.S. Bancorp products were converted fully to PNC Bank products.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another car}} drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand. The driver, Simon Williams, {{was struck by}} fragments. The driver of another {{approaching}} vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to {{the house where the}} Martins, his first victims, lay dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{passage of}} the Railways Bill was {{controversial}} and there was much lobbying against the Bill. The Labour Party was opposed to it and promised to renationalise the railways when they <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> office as and when resources allowed - though this was not achieved during their period in government between 1997 and 2010. The Railways Bill became the Railways Act 1993 on 5 November 1993 and the organisational structure dictated by it came into effect on 1 April 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The Man {{received}} positive reviews – including 4 {{stars from}} Q Magazine; and 5 from Sounds Magazine {{who called the}} album a [...] "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement". Drummond intended to focus on writing books once The Man had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, [...] "That only lasted three months, until I had {{an idea for a}} record and <b>got</b> dragged <b>back</b> <b>into</b> it all".|$|R
5000|$|By this time, some artists, {{including}} Spiegelman, {{felt that}} the underground comix scene had become less creative {{than it had been}} in the past. According to Spiegelman, [...] "What had seemed like a revolution simply deflated into a lifestyle. Underground comics were stereotyped as dealing only with Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills.

5000|$|Dystopian Wars has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. The game currently holds an average rating of 7.78/10 with BoardGameGeek, based on 125 ratings. Peter Ray Allison of OneMetal describes {{the game as}} [...] "an excellent miniatures game that has many gamers claiming Dystopian Wars as the game that <b>got</b> them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> gaming." [...] Allison also describes the rules system as [...] "refreshing", referring to its accommodation of land, sea or air engagements.|$|R
25|$|During {{the ride}} the car passed several service {{stations}} {{but the man}} did not stop. For about 90 minutes he drove back and forth around the backroads near Tracy. When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using his flashlight telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the car and drove off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E
25|$|Scotland started well in Bridgend with Wade Liddell {{giving the}} Bravehearts the lead after just 8 minutes. This try was {{converted}} by Gareth Morton. But things got bad as Wales pulled a try back through Richard Johnson, and then Danny Brough was sinbinned for dissent on 26 minutes. In {{the next ten}} minutes a Wales team minus Iestyn Harris, who failed a fitness test prior to the match, capitalised on Scotland's shortfall and scored two tries to create a 14–6 lead going into half-time. However, after the break the Scots immediately <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the match, Danny Brough singlehandedly scoring a try after 70 seconds of the interval, and Jamie Benn a little later leeching on to a grubber kick. Mick Nanyn missed both conversions and so the scores were tied. On the 67th minute Scotland went in front, Nanyn converting his own try. And to seal a 21–14 victory Danny Brough scored a drop-goal. He would later get Man of the Match award.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Hart took {{advantage}} of a momentary lapse in concentration by Austin, who had just finished attacking Diesel, and threw him over the top rope {{on the far side}} of the ring. As Austin got to his feet, he quickly realized that none of the officials had seen his feet touch the floor as they were too busy with breaking the brawl up on the opposite side of the ring. Austin then <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the ring and continued in the match as if he had not been eliminated, and almost as soon as he did so he pushed both Undertaker and Vader, who were locked in a battle of their own to try to stay in the match, over the top. By this time, Mankind and Funk had been separated and the officials could focus again on the match, just in time to see Hart eliminate Diesel. Just after he did, though, Austin returned the favor from before and dumped Hart out of the ring. As a result, since as far as the officials were concerned Austin was still a legal participant in the match, he was declared the winner of the Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|Three minutes later, Cristiano Ronaldo {{played a}} short corner to Ryan Giggs, who evaded {{challenges}} from two Europe XI players before playing the ball across the goal area, where Wes Brown {{was on hand}} to poke it home. After a couple more chances for the home side, the Europe XI <b>got</b> themselves <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the game midway through the first half, via Florent Malouda's low, long-range strike, which passed {{just out of reach}} of Tomasz Kuszczak's outstretched hand.|$|R
50|$|Bruno {{once again}} <b>got</b> himself <b>back</b> <b>into</b> title {{contention}} with wins over former contender James Tillis and journeymen Reggie Gross and Chuck Gardner. In October 1987 Bruno faced the veteran Joe Bugner in an all British match up. Bugner although long past his peak, {{was coming off}} impressive wins over Greg Page, James Tillis and David Bey. Bruno won by TKO in the 8th round, the referee stopping the bout, although it appeared the protesting Bugner could have continued.|$|R
50|$|After Tyson's {{dominating}} {{victory over}} Frank Bruno five months prior, negotiations {{for a potential}} bout with Carl Williams began, and on June 15, 1989, the fight was made official. Four years earlier, Williams had challenged then-IBF Heavyweight champion Larry Holmes for the title, only to narrowly lose by unanimous decision. Prior to his fight with Tyson, Williams had won his previous five fights, including a victory over former champion Trevor Berbick which <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>into</b> contention.|$|R
25|$|Later that season, Elliott {{signed to}} drive the No. 21 for Wood Brothers Racing in 2007, {{in part due to}} his {{championship}} provisional, which guaranteed starting the race. Since fellow champion Dale Jarrett had used all of his guaranteed starts in his Toyota for Michael Waltrip Racing, Elliott was the only champion eligible for the provisional not guaranteed a spot by being in the top 35 in owner's points. His first race for the team was the Coca Cola 600 at Charlotte, which he qualified without needing one of his six provisionals. He led the race at one point until he was involved in a wreck around lap 200. At Michigan, Elliott gave the team a much needed 11th-place finish, and was kept in the car until the fall Richmond race. The car then fell out of the top 35 again but at Bristol <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> top 35 in points. Ken Schrader returned to the No. 21 replacing Elliott at a testing session at Talladega Superspeedway due to the team being back in the top 35 in owners points. He returned for the final four races after the 21 fell out of the top-35 once again.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{opened up}} their Ligue 1 season in a {{positive}} fashion, defeating Toulouse 3–0 with a brace from Karim Benzema and a rare goal from Jean Makoun. Following a 0–0 draw away to Lorient, which dropped them to third in the league standings, Lyon rebounded with back-to-back wins over Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne respectively. Following that, Lyon picked up their third-straight victory with a 3–2 win over Nice. The match was, however, marred with controversy—after trailing 0–2, Lyon <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the match with two spectacular free-kicks from Juninho. With the match in injury time and looking to end in a draw, referee Jean-Charles Cailleux {{and one of his}} assistant referees ruled a handball infraction had been committed by Nice defender Vincent Hognon in the box, giving Lyon a penalty which was converted by Benzema. Looking at the replay, it could have easily been determined that the handball infraction had been without malice and that the penalty should have not been given. However, Lyon escaped with a victory, which moved them into first place. They followed this win up with back to back one goal wins over newly promoted side Le Havre and Nancy giving them five-straight league victories.|$|E
25|$|Halas's {{replacement}} was Jim Dooley. In Dooley's {{first season}} {{at the helm of}} the team, the Bears finished with a 7–7 record. The low point of the season, though, was not the mediocre performance but a career threatening knee injury to Gale Sayers, from which he never fully recovered. The decade though was highlighted with the 1969 season. After Sayers's injury, back-up running back Brian Piccolo did not believe he deserved the job because of the injury. Instead of running away with his opportunity as most athletes would, Piccolo, who was a popular figure in the Chicago area and roomed with Sayers for a few years on road trips, during the entire off-season pushed Sayers to get his knee back into football playing shape. Sayers <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the lineup, and Piccolo was back on the bench when the season started. Sayers rushed for 1,000 yards and earned the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. This was the ultimate display of friendship between Piccolo and Sayers, who were friends despite race differences within society during the 1960s. The Bears finished the season, even with Sayers's performance, with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. The Bears' hopes worsened due to the fact that they have the No. 2 pick, while the Steelers have the first overall pick (with the Bears defeating them), allowing Pittsburgh to draft future Hall-of-Famer Terry Bradshaw.|$|E
50|$|The Volunteers {{started the}} season with five {{straight}} victories before facing off against #2 Alabama, which they lost 42-21. A win over TCU was followed by losses to Georgia and Ole Miss that dropped {{them out of the}} rankings. Victories over Kentucky and Vanderbilt to end the season <b>got</b> them <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the polls as they limped to a fourth place finish in the Southeastern Conference, though they were invited to a bowl game for the seventh straight year.|$|R
50|$|Ray {{was best}} known for {{participating}} in a playoff for the U.S. Open in 1913 with Vardon and Francis Ouimet, the winner. Ray's opening round of 79 was not particularly useful but he rebounded by carding a course record 70 in round two which electrified the gallery and <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>into</b> contention. He narrowly missed a 5-foot putt at the last {{that would have given}} him a 69. His four cards for the tournament were 79-70-76-79=304.|$|R
50|$|Tyson {{would follow}} his victory with a no contest against Orlin Norris (due to Tyson {{injuring}} Norris after the bell) and easy wins over Julius Francis and Lou Savarese that <b>got</b> him <b>back</b> <b>into</b> contention. After another no contest against Andrew Golota (due to Tyson {{testing positive for}} cannabis after the fight) and win over Brian Nielsen, Tyson would eventually earn one last title shot against Lennox Lewis but was knocked out in the eighth round.|$|R
