25|$|Recognising {{the rising}} political, economic, and naval {{strength}} in England, the Dutch accepted Marlborough as the Allied commander-in-chief in the Low Countries. However, his command necessarily had its limitations and {{was subject to}} the approval of Dutch generals and Field Deputies (civil and military representatives of the States General). The priority of the Dutch was to re-establish their Barrier fortresses, a goal which could be achieved through sieges rather than risky battles. On several occasions the Dutch vetoed Marlborough's attempts to engage his opponents in the field, but losing a battle in the Low Countries could have potentially fatal consequences {{to the security of}} the Republic, and Marlborough himself was a relatively inexperienced foreign general. It was the Dutch, moreover, who provided the main system of supply, as well as the majority of the troops, engineers, and guns in theatre, initially fielding an army of 60,000 men (including hired contingents from the German states), plus 42,000 for garrison duty. For their part, the English Parliament voted for a field army of 40,000 men to fight in the Low Countries in 1702. Of this figure some 18,500 were British subject troops, the remainder were mostly auxiliaries from Germany. At sea the English dominated having 127 ships of the line notionally available for service in 1700; the Dutch having 83. In contrast, Leopold <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> limited resources and no navy, and he relied heavily on the Maritime Powers for his war effort. The Emperor had initially committed to a field army of 90,000 men, yet in 1702 he was unable to deploy any more than 40,000 in Italy (which would be half that number by December) and 20,000 on the Rhine.|$|E

[...] "I said, 'Alex, let me take that gun'... knew that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> experience firing a machine gun than a painter." ...|$|E

500|$|Parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Lesser Poland territories were {{included}} in the Austrian partition as early as the First Partition of Poland in 1772. From about 1775 to 1848, with several gaps, the crown land of Galicia had a relatively powerless parliamentary body, known originally as the Postulate Sejm (...) , and from 1817, as Estates of Galicia (...) [...] The Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria, which was formed in 1861 following the promulgation of the October Diploma by Emperor Franz Joseph <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> real power than its predecessors. In Polish parliamentary tradition, it is considered to have continued the history of the general sejm and regional sejmiks on the lands of Lesser Poland and Ruthenia.|$|E

500|$|In {{an early}} {{draft of the}} script, the {{skeleton}} was made of pastry dough baked by the mall's window dresser. Cohen had initially written the Stephen Jay Gould role as a generic scientist or paleontologist, not knowing that they would eventually get Gould. He had taken Gould's Introduction to Paleontology class at Harvard University. The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the [...] "world's most brilliant paleontologist". His original final line was [...] "I didn't do the test. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> important work to do.", but it was cut because the writers felt it would be funnier {{to give him a}} short final line. In an earlier version of the episode, Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her, letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa's correct assumptions all along.|$|E

500|$|Papa {{was born}} on March 10, 1987 to Kwaku and Gertrude Oppong and {{was brought up in}} the Pickering, Ontario area. Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, so my dad got me into soccer. Basketball is more of my love. I was sitting down and watching Michael Jordan and Kobe and all of those guys when I was younger, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> of a passion for it." [...] He learned the basics of basketball with the Ontario Basketball's Scarborough, Ontario club team. Oppong attended Blessed Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough. He helped the team win the provincial Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations (OFSAA) championship. He was also named Ontario Mr. Basketball.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{confessed that}} she never tried to change the {{situation}} because [...] " [...] used to be insecure and cautious, and so [...] would {{listen to what the}} people said." [...] However, the control Mottola exerted over her career soon [...] "spilled into her personal life" [...] once they were married, increasing the amount of conflict between the two. Soon, it was obvious that their marriage was in shambles; as stated in a Vanity Fair article, [...] "the couple began to argue {{at the drop of a}} hat." [...] Carey was very involved in the project, more so than she had ever been on an album. [...] "I went into this phase of recording, recording, recording and doing it really fast," [...] she told Time. [...] "This time, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> time, and I focused more on what I wanted to do." [...] As Carey's career and work continued to reflect her views on how it should sound, her marriage to Mottola continued to [...] "deteriorate".|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the film}} was {{rejected}} by every major studio in Hollywood, mostly due to the $20 million budget and the deal Lucas was offering. Eventually Paramount agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production {{was getting ready to}} shoot at Elstree Studios, with Lucas trying to keep costs down. With four illustrators, Raiders of the Lost Ark was Spielberg's most storyboarded film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to keep costs down and to follow the [...] "quick and dirty" [...] feel of the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery. [...] "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste", Spielberg said. [...] "Had <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie." ...|$|E

500|$|Phantasmagoria was {{a radically}} {{different}} game for Williams, who was best known for designing the family-friendly King's Quest fantasy adventure game series. Williams {{said she did not}} want to get typecast in a particular genre, adding: [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> to offer than fairy stories. I wanted to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions." [...] Although Phantasmagoria was her first horror game, Williams had created murder and crime stories in her earlier mystery games, Mystery House and the Laura Bow series. Williams was a fan of the horror genre, although she did not watch many horror films as a child after a traumatic experience watching Horrors of the Black Museum (1959) at age four. She began watching them again as a teen, and particularly enjoyed such films as Halloween (1978), and movies based on Stephen King novels, like Carrie and The Shining (1980). Williams cited the works of King and Edgar Allan Poe as the inspirations behind Phantasmagoria.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550.

It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past."

500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E

500|$|In 1882, the U.S. Navy {{consisted}} of many outdated ship designs. Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern steel-hulled armored cruisers and battleships, and by around {{the start of}} the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish–American War, the American Navy continued to build more ships, {{and by the end of}} World War <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> men and women in uniform than the British Royal Navy. The Washington Naval Conference of [...] 1921 recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the [...] "island-hopping" [...] campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship , on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships.|$|E

[...] He spent one year (1965–1966) at the Byam Shaw School of Art, and then studied furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–1970) before moving into engineering.|$|E
