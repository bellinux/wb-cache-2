5|$|The {{ubiquitous}} lifeboat collection boxes seen nationwide {{are popular}} {{enough to have}} <b>even</b> <b>become</b> the target for thieves. A fixed, cast iron collection box in Porthgwarra, Cornwall, is Grade II listed. The Institution's annual fundraising day ("SOS Day") {{is at the end}} of January, but many lifeboat stations hold open days during the summer, hosting displays, stalls and other events, as well as in-station shops which are open full or part-time.|$|E
5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to <b>even</b> <b>become</b> a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E

25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{considered}} one of the classic causes of a markedly enlarged (and therefore palpable) spleen; the organ, which is not normally felt during examination of the abdomen, may <b>even</b> <b>become</b> larger than the liver in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Predatory harasser {{who gets}} sexual thrills from humiliating others. This harasser may become {{involved}} in sexual extortion, and may frequently harass {{just to see how}} targets respond. Those who don't resist may <b>even</b> <b>become</b> targets for rape.|$|E
25|$|The hobby of {{collecting}} often goes hand-in-hand {{with an interest}} in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting postcards may reflect an interest in different places and cultures. For this reason, collecting can have educational benefits, and some collectors <b>even</b> <b>become</b> experts in their field.|$|E

25|$|Thompson's writing {{style and}} {{eccentric}} persona {{gave him a}} cult following in both literary and drug circles, and his cult status expanded into broader areas after being portrayed three times in major motion pictures. Hence, both his writing style and persona have been widely imitated, and his likeness has <b>even</b> <b>become</b> a popular costume choice for Halloween.|$|E
25|$|The Saint Bernard was bred to be {{a working}} {{companion}} {{and to this}} day the St.Bernard lives to please its master and is an amiable yet hard worker. St.Bernards have retained their natural ability for scent work and depending on the skill of the trainer and the talents of the dog, St. Bernards can participate in tracking events or <b>even</b> <b>become</b> involved in search and rescue work.|$|E
25|$|Litter, {{made from}} diverse {{materials}} that are denser than surface water (such as glasses, metals and some plastics), {{have been found to}} spread over the floor of seas and open oceans, where it can become entangled in corals and interfere with other sea-floor life, or <b>even</b> <b>become</b> buried under sediment, making clean-up extremely difficult, especially due to the wide area of its dispersal compared to shipwrecks. Research performed by MBARI found items including plastic bags below 2000m depth off the west coast of North America and around Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, the {{lysogenic}} cycle {{does not}} result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as temperate phages. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it relatively harmlessly, or may <b>even</b> <b>become</b> established as a plasmid. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients; then, the endogenous phages (known as prophages) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated {{in all of the}} cell’s offspring.|$|E
25|$|The warming {{environment}} presents {{challenges to}} local communities {{such as the}} Inuit. Hunting, which is a major way of survival for some small communities, will be changed with increasing temperatures. The reduction of sea ice will cause certain species populations to decline or <b>even</b> <b>become</b> extinct. In good years, some communities are fully employed by the commercial harvest of certain animals. The harvest of different animals fluctuates each year and {{with the rise of}} temperatures it is likely to continue changing and creating issues for Inuit hunters. Unsuspected changes in river and snow conditions will cause herds of animals, including reindeer, to change migration patterns, calving grounds, and forage availability.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two modes}} available: Practice and Xtreme Island Adventure. In the former, players can {{participate}} in 15 different challenges with 3 difficulty settings. In the latter, players move around the island participating in events and exploring the surroundings. Some of the people players meet will give the player clues to solving {{the mystery of the}} Bone-Heads while others will issue challenges to compete in various sports. Players collect medals as the player win events. Players must win a certain number of easier challenges before the referees will allow the player into the tougher ones. Along the way players can also find Twitchy Shakes, which are special drinks that will increase the player's abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to attain higher speeds or <b>even</b> <b>become</b> invincible.|$|E

Refusing to listen any further, they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him.|$|E
500|$|Romeo and Juliet had a {{profound}} influence on subsequent literature. Before then, romance had not even been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. In Harold Bloom's words, Shakespeare [...] "invented the formula that the sexual becomes the erotic when crossed by the shadow of death". Of Shakespeare's works, Romeo and Juliet has generated the most—and the most varied—adaptations, including prose and verse narratives, drama, opera, orchestral and choral music, ballet, film, television, and painting. The word [...] "Romeo" [...] has <b>even</b> <b>become</b> synonymous with [...] "male lover" [...] in English.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Matthew {{wrote in}} his book On Naval Timber and Arboriculture (1831) of [...] "continual {{balancing}} of life to circumstance.... progeny of the same parents, under great differences of circumstance, might, in several generations, <b>even</b> <b>become</b> distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction." [...] Darwin implies that he discovered this work after the initial publication of the Origin. In the brief historical sketch that Darwin included in the 3rd edition he says [...] "Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very briefly in scattered passages in an Appendix to a work on a different subject... He clearly saw, however, {{the full force of}} the principle of natural selection." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{amount of}} resin {{required}} {{to fill the}} sprue, runner and cavities of a mould comprises a [...] "shot". Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that are ground into the parting line of the mould, or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped air {{is not allowed to}} escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming material and squeezed into the corners of the cavity, where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects. The air can <b>even</b> <b>become</b> so compressed that it ignites and burns the surrounding plastic material.|$|E
500|$|Anthony Osel of Complex {{wrote that}} [...] "Rick Ross gives us visuals {{for just about}} every freestyle, verse and song he's ever recorded. Rozay dropped off a Spiff TV-directed video for [...] "Devil In A New Dress" [...] from Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It's him smoking a blunt while {{cruising}} the streets of Toronto {{in the back seat}} of his 62S Maybach glancing out the window. Standard, but awesome, clip from Ross." [...] Ross would perform the song during his live concerts and it has <b>even</b> <b>become</b> a mainstay of his live sets.
