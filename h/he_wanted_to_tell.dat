25|$|Fei-Wang {{is located}} in an area cut off from time {{in the ruins of}} the Kingdom of Clow created by the {{original}} Syaoran when he wished to turn back time after he placed a death seal on the original Sakura. As a result of this wish, Fei-Wang took the original Syaoran and Sakura prisoner to set up his plan. When the original Syaoran manages to rescue the original Sakura from the death seal, Fei-Wang obtains the powers from the two Sakuras to revive Yūko, breaking a logic that starts causing all the worlds to be destroyed. This leads to a battle against two Syaorans, the two Sakuras, Fai and Kurogane, in which the clones manage to undo Fei-Wang's damage to the world. In the course of the battle, Fei-Wang is mortally wounded by Kurogane, and his body starts disintegrating leading to the belief he was created by a powerful magician. However, before disappearing, he traps the two Syaorans and Watanuki in a void, while stating <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Yūko something. In the original Japanese series, Fei-Wang is voiced by Kazuhiro Nakata. For the English dub of the anime adaptation, Fei-Wang Reed is voiced by Randy Tallman in first season and by R Bruce Elliott in the second season and the OVAs.|$|E
500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|Holby City {{was praised}} by campaigners for the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) in October 2003, when an episode which coincided with [...] "Learn To Sign Week" [...] used deaf actors, and {{featured}} characters communicating through British Sign Language. RNID chief executive John Low stated: [...] "Too often individuals {{have to rely}} on family members or friends to communicate complicated personal information to professionals. This is the reason the RNID is calling on the government to channel funding into the training of British Sign Language interpreters who could then be available to NHS staff treating deaf patients." [...] Stokes commented: [...] "The writer had a great story <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> – for us, that's what matters first and foremost." [...] A 2008 report into ethnic diversity on television, commissioned by Channel 4, cited Holby City as a positive example of [...] "diverse British programm". Five years previously in 2003, former BBC host Sir Ludovic Kennedy complained that ethnic minorities were over-represented on television, prompting a BBC spokeswoman to explain that Holby City has more ethnic characters as it is set in an area where minorities account for up to 30% of the population. According to the 2001 census, the population of Bristol – which the city of Holby is loosely based upon – is 88% white and 12% ethnic minorities.|$|E

500|$|Straczynski viewed [...] "sitting {{down and}} ferreting out [...] story" [...] as {{a return to}} his journalistic roots. He also drew on his {{experience}} writing crime drama for the procedural elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case {{that it was difficult}} to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: [...] "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." [...] Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was {{the only person in the}} story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, [...] "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did." ...|$|E
500|$|The Final Fantasy VI poem {{follows the}} journey of Terra Branford, [...] "the heroine born with the gift of magic". The poem explores the stages of her life through the game, as she escapes from slavery, faces her amnesia, discovers the source of her powers, and saves {{the world from the}} insane Kefka Palazzo. Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game that Wanamo had played, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of the game as it felt to him. Wanamo has {{described}} the arrangement as the most difficult one he had done to date. Originally, the poem was going to follow the story of the group of heroes, before Wanamo made Terra the focus, and ended up dropping the themes of the other heroes due to length. The Final Fantasy X piano concerto was arranged by Hamauzu not {{to tell the story of}} the game, but to express the [...] "continuum" [...] of the series through the lens of the game. While inspired by the game's story, Hamauzu also drew inspiration from the rest of the franchise to make the concerto more than [...] "a series of separate scenes and stories". He feels that a hallmark of Böcker's concerts is that they are not limited to directly translating the original works, but instead tie them to a wider creative process. Valtonen created the three movements of the Final Fantasy VII symphony to show three aspects of the game's setting. The first movement, [...] "Nibelheim Incident", follows the villain Sephiroth in his journey through the game; the second, [...] "Words Drowned by Fireworks", explores the relationship between Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough, and Tifa Lockhart; while the third movement, [...] "The Planet's Crisis", depicts the final clash between Cloud and Sephiroth. He tried to [...] "bring out both the darkest moments as well as the heart" [...] of the game.|$|E

2500|$|The ADL and AJC defended their {{decision}} to contact the Polish consulate and rejected Judt's characterization of them. Foxman accused his critics of themselves stifling free speech when [...] "they use inflammatory words like 'threaten,' 'pressure,' and 'intimidate' that bear no resemblance to what actually transpired." [...] He wrote that the [...] "ADL did not threaten or intimidate or pressure anyone. The Polish consul general made his decision concerning Tony Judt's appearance strictly on his own." [...] Foxman said that Judt has [...] "taken the position that Israel shouldn't exist hat puts him on our radar," [...] while David A. Harris, {{executive director of the}} AJC, said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the consulate that the thrust of Judt's talk ran [...] "contrary to the entire spirit of Polish foreign policy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thoreau neither {{rejected}} civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead {{he sought}} a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required {{that he be}} a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs {{to be close to}} those who needed to hear what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred [...] "partially cultivated country." [...] His idea of being [...] "far in the recesses of the wilderness" [...] of Maine was to [...] "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay [...] "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [...] Roderick Nash wrote, [...] "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2006, Rogue Pictures {{finalized}} a deal {{to remake}} The Last House on the Left with original writer and director Wes Craven as a producer. The company intended to preserve the storyline of the original film. In September 2006, {{it was announced that}} Craven had formed a production company, Midnight Pictures, under the umbrella of Rogue Pictures, and the remake for The Last House on the Left was selected as the company's first project. One of the reasons Craven agreed to remake The Last House on the Left was because of the money involved. In 1972, {{he did not have the}} budget to film every piece of the story <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> With the 2009 remake, a larger budget allowed the filmmakers to pace themselves more during filming, taking more care while shooting, and expand the scope of the story more. One of the ways to accomplish this was for the producers to find a [...] "rising young director to bring a new perspective for the story". According to the producers, who were impressed with Hardcore—which explored the world of teenage prostitution—director Dennis Iliadis was the person they were looking for. Co-producer Cody Zwieg stated, [...] "Hardcore wasn't a genre or a horror film but showed completely believable characters in horrific, realistic situations. Many directors could handle the surface elements, the blood and shock moments of Last House, but Dennis proved that he could do it all without exploiting his characters and their situations." [...] According to Iliadis, the director was quick to accept the responsibility of remaking The Last House on the Left, having already been a fan of Craven's and seen all of his films.|$|E
