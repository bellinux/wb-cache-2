5|$|While {{most highly}} {{expressed}} in the liver, sEH is also expressed in other tissues including vascular <b>endothelium,</b> leukocytes, red blood cells, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes and the kidney proximal tubule.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly <b>endothelium,</b> smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the <b>endothelium</b> of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular <b>endothelium</b> which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (<b>endothelium),</b> a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, carbonic anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid <b>endothelium,</b> appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of atherosclerotic plaques {{in a part}} of arterial <b>endothelium</b> is inhomogeneous. The multiple and focal development of atherosclerotic changes is similar to that in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain and that of age spots on the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that misrepair mechanisms {{play an important role in}} the focal development of atherosclerosis. Development of a plaque is a result of repair of injured <b>endothelium.</b> Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local <b>endothelium.</b> This is the manifestation of a misrepair. Important is this altered remodeling makes the local <b>endothelium</b> have increased fragility to damage and have reduced repair-efficiency. As a consequence, this part of <b>endothelium</b> has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of <b>endothelium</b> is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating. With{{in a part of}} arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.|$|E
25|$|The heart {{derives from}} {{embryonic}} mesodermal germ-layer cells that differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium, <b>endothelium,</b> and myocardium. Mesothelial pericardium forms the outer {{lining of the}} heart. The inner lining of the heart, lymphatic and blood vessels, develop from <b>endothelium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) {{particles in}} blood plasma invade the <b>endothelium</b> and become oxidized, creating risk of cardiovascular disease. A {{complex set of}} biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as Lp-LpA2) and free radicals in the <b>endothelium.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{result from}} {{injury to the}} {{vascular}} <b>endothelium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thrombus {{formation}} on {{an intact}} <b>endothelium</b> is prevented by nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and CD39.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endothelium</b> (the cell {{monolayer}} {{on the inside}} of the vessel) and covering tissue, termed fibrous cap, separate atheroma from the blood in the lumen. If a rupture (see vulnerable plaque) of the <b>endothelium</b> and fibrous cap occurs, then both (a) a shower of debris from the plaque combined with (b) a platelet and clotting response (to both the debris and at the rupture site) occurs within fractions of a second.|$|E
25|$|LDL {{particles}} pose a {{risk for}} cardiovascular disease when they invade the <b>endothelium</b> and become oxidized, since the oxidized forms {{are more easily}} retained by the proteoglycans. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL particles, chiefly stimulated by presence of necrotic cell debris and free radicals in the <b>endothelium.</b> Increasing concentrations of LDL particles are strongly associated {{with the development of}} atherosclerosis over time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endothelium</b> {{of blood}} vessels {{produces}} an extensive range of substances that influence blood flow and, in turn, is affected by changes in the blood and the pressure of blood flow. For example, local nitric oxide and endothelin, which are secreted by the <b>endothelium,</b> are the major regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In patients with essential hypertension, the balance between the vasodilators and the vasoconstrictors is upset, which leads {{to changes in the}} <b>endothelium</b> and sets up a “vicious cycle” that contributes to the maintenance of high blood pressure. In patients with hypertension, endothelial activation and damage also lead to changes in vascular tone, vascular reactivity, and coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Alterations in endothelial function are a reliable indicator of target organ damage and atherosclerotic disease, as well as prognosis.|$|E
25|$|There are ~80000 {{copies of}} glycophorin B per erythrocyte. Both glycophorin A and B are {{expressed}} on the renal <b>endothelium</b> and epithelium.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1 {{is mainly}} {{produced}} by the <b>endothelium</b> (cells lining blood vessels), but is also secreted by other tissue types, such as adipose tissue.|$|E
25|$|Ischemia also induces {{production}} of oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. These react with and damage {{a number of}} cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or <b>endothelium</b> is particularly important. In fact, many antioxidant neuroprotectants such as uric acid and NXY-059 work {{at the level of}} the <b>endothelium</b> and not in the brain per se. Free radicals also directly initiate elements of the programmed cell death cascade by means of redox signaling.|$|E
25|$|Once a micro-bubble forms it may {{continue}} to grow if the tissues are still supersaturated. As the bubble grows it may distort the surrounding tissue and cause damage to cells and pressure on nerves resulting in pain, or may block a blood vessel, cutting off blood flow and causing hypoxia in the tissues normally perfused by the vessel. Bubbles can also damage the vascular <b>endothelium</b> through ischemia and reperfusion, physical contact with the <b>endothelium</b> or by physical deformation. This damage may release endothelial membrane microparticles.|$|E
25|$|Coagulation begins almost {{instantly}} after {{an injury to}} the blood vessel has damaged the <b>endothelium</b> lining the vessel. Leaking of blood through the <b>endothelium</b> initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial tissue factor to plasma Factor VII, which ultimately leads to fibrin formation. Platelets immediately form a plug {{at the site of}} injury; this is called primary hemostasis. Secondary hemostasis occurs simultaneously: Additional coagulation factors or clotting factors beyond Factor VII (listed below) respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.|$|E
25|$|The {{blood clot}} {{is only a}} {{temporary}} solution to stop bleeding; tissue repair is needed. Small interruptions in the <b>endothelium</b> are handled by physiological mechanisms; large interruptions by the trauma surgeon.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that miR-181a binds the 3' UTR of Prox1 leading to {{translation}} repression and transcript degradation. Prox1 is a homeobox transcription factor involved in development of the lymphatic <b>endothelium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Postmortem {{studies of}} the BBB, {{especially}} the vascular <b>endothelium,</b> show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1.|$|E
25|$|The blood {{vascular}} system first appeared probably in an ancestor of the triploblasts over 600 million years ago, overcoming the time-distance constraints of diffusion, while <b>endothelium</b> evolved in an ancestral vertebrate some 540–510 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>endothelium</b> is damaged, the {{normally}} isolated, underlying collagen {{is exposed to}} circulating platelets, which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific glycoprotein Ia/IIa surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released from the <b>endothelium</b> and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets' glycoprotein Ib/IX/V and the collagen fibrils. This localization of platelets to the extracellular matrix promotes collagen interaction with platelet glycoprotein VI. Binding of collagen to glycoprotein VI triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of platelet integrins. Activated integrins mediate tight binding of platelets to the extracellular matrix. This process adheres platelets {{to the site of}} injury.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{distress}} to tissue causes capillaries {{to break}} under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps {{into the surrounding}} tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. Nerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, {{may be perceived as}} pain or pressure or be asymptomatic. The damaged capillary <b>endothelium</b> releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding. As the <b>endothelium</b> is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} found that ANCAs can {{activate}} neutrophils, increase their adherence to <b>endothelium,</b> and induce their degranulation that can damage endothelial cells. In theory, this phenomenon could cause extensive damage to the vessel wall, in particular of arterioles.|$|E
25|$|Acetylcholine in the serum exerts {{a direct}} effect on {{vascular}} tone by binding to muscarinic receptors present on vascular <b>endothelium.</b> These cells respond by increasing production of nitric oxide, which signals the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, leading to vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|IGFBP-3 mRNA is {{expressed}} in all tissue examined, with kidney, stomach, placenta, uterus and liver showing highest expression in rat tissues. Rat liver IGFBP-3 mRNA is found in nonparenchymal cells including sinusoidal <b>endothelium,</b> but not in hepatocytes. In contrast, human hepatocytes do express IGFBP-3.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is {{generated}} by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by <b>endothelium.</b> Plasmin proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products that inhibit excessive fibrin formation.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandins {{are found}} in most tissues and organs. They are {{produced}} by almost all nucleated cells. They are autocrine and paracrine lipid mediators that act upon platelets, <b>endothelium,</b> uterine and mast cells. They are synthesized in the cell from the essential fatty acids (EFAs).|$|E
25|$|Damage to <b>endothelium</b> is {{an early}} {{abnormality}} {{in the development of}} scleroderma, and this too seems to be due to collagen accumulation by fibroblasts, although direct alterations by cytokines, platelet adhesion and a type II hypersensitivity reaction have similarly been implicated. Increased endothelin and decreased vasodilation has been documented.|$|E
25|$|Eph receptors {{are present}} in high degrees during vasculogenesis (angiogenesis) and other early {{development}} of the circulatory system. This development is disturbed without it. It is thought to distinguish arterial and venous <b>endothelium,</b> stimulating the production of capillary sprouts {{as well as in}} the differentiation of mesenchyme into perivascular support cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{long held}} {{belief that a}} high-salt diet raises the risk of cardio-vascular disease is coming under scrutiny. More recently, dietary salt was {{demonstrated}} to attenuate nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the <b>endothelium.</b>|$|E
25|$|CD36 on {{the surface}} of the {{platelets}} has been shown to be involved in adherence but direct adherence to the <b>endothelium</b> by the infected erythrocytes also occurs. Autoaggregation of infected erythrocytes by platelets has been shown to correlate with severe malaria and cerebral malaria in particular and antiplatelet antibodies may offer some protection.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the tunica media into the intima in response to cytokines secreted by damaged endothelial cells. This causes {{the formation of a}} fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak. Intact <b>endothelium</b> can prevent this smooth muscle proliferation by releasing nitric oxide.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} layers {{in the dog}} and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of {{the thickness of the}} cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal <b>endothelium.</b> The <b>endothelium</b> is a single cell layer that separates the cornea from the aqueous humor.|$|E
