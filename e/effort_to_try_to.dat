5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star. Hitchcock had long {{wanted to make a}} film based on the idea of Hamlet, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get him {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Vital to the Norwegian <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{halt the}} German advance was {{assistance}} from the Allies, which Koht requested {{in the early hours}} of 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid. When the rest of the government fled from Molde to Tromsø, landing on 1 May, Koht and Ljungberg (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser HMS Glasgow to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives (Lord Halifax, Chamberlain and Admiral Philips) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met Reynaud, Gamelin and Daladier in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May. The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front. These plans were however abandoned by the Allies on 24 May 1940, following the worsening situation for the Allies in France, and an evacuation decided. Koht was informed by British Minister to Norway Sir Cecil Dormer on 1 June that the Allied Forces had decided to retreat from Norway, owing to the difficult situation at the Western Front.|$|E

50|$|Sasan {{is known}} for his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bring Zoroastrianism back into the empire. He even {{encouraged}} Papak to take over the Parthian satrapy of Pars.|$|R
25|$|Bahrain's {{government}} {{spent millions}} of pounds on public relations, particularly with PR companies in Britain and the US, with which the regime has close diplomatic, military and commercial links, in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improve its bloodied image.|$|E
25|$|The Black Thursday {{crash of}} the Exchange on October 24, 1929, and the {{sell-off}} panic which started on Black Tuesday, October 29, are often blamed for precipitating the Great Depression. In an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> restore investor confidence, the Exchange unveiled a fifteen-point program aimed to upgrade protection for the investing public on October 31, 1938.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fix the problems, MIM {{installed}} some {{column flotation}} cells in the zinc concentrate and bulk concentrate sections of the plant. In those days, the air was introduced into flotation columns using air spargers, usually {{in the form of}} a bag or sheath around a pipe. The spargers were high-maintenance items, and their performance was critical to the operation of the column.|$|E

25|$|A Movement of Ex-Muslims of Belgium {{exists to}} support apostates from Islam, and to 'fight Islamic indoctrination'. As of 2014, {{it had a}} dozen members, who had to operate {{carefully}} and often anonymously. Additionally, Belgians like Maarten Boudry and Johan Leman has led <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> normalize leaving Islam in Belgium.|$|R
50|$|Gray {{has called}} for the IPCC to be abolished, {{claiming}} it is “fundamentally corrupt” due to his conclusion that for significant parts {{of the work of}} the IPCC, the data collection and scientific methods employed are unsound and that the IPCC resists all <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> discuss or rectify these problems.|$|R
25|$|After {{assessing}} the situation, Castilian Admiral Fernando Sánchez de Tovar considered victory very unlikely {{under the circumstances}} and ordered the fleet to tack and return to port. His Portuguese counterpart saw an opportunity to beat the rival, and began pursuit of the Castilian fleet. De Tovar ordered to his men to row at a fast pace, forcing his Portuguese pursuers to match the <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> overcome the fleet. The different speeds at which they advanced increased {{the distance between the}} Portuguese ships, breaking their formation.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} mark the {{importance}} of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy {{from their point of view}} and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.|$|E
25|$|The Prospect Expressway, built between 1953 and 1960, {{runs through}} the middle of the neighborhood, with the {{majority}} of the neighborhood northeast of the expressway, and {{a small part of the}} neighborhood in the southwest connected by various bridges to the northeast section. Some neighborhood streets, such as Greenwood Avenue and Vanderbilt Street, were bisected by the expressway and remain so, while others, such as Seeley Street, 11th Avenue/Terrace Place, and Prospect Park W, are bridged over the highway. A plan to extend the highway along Ocean Parkway was never realized, though Ocean Parkway serves as a service road for the expressway for a short distance in southern Windsor Terrace. In the late 1950s, the Holy Name of Jesus Church led a failed <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reroute the Prospect Expressway elsewhere or cancel the expressway altogether.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} {{note for}} quality and completeness are {{the collections of}} Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, Orange Free State, and Rhodesia. Mosely spared no <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make his collection as complete as possible, and included all known varieties, as well as essays, proofs, 'specimens', and stamps on original covers.|$|R
50|$|The {{nation was}} {{becoming}} huge, complex, multi-faceted, and required additional <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> streamline Congress; in 1965, a senator discussed how {{issues such as}} space and atomic energy were overshadowing less complex matters such as which towns got new post offices, and demanded the institution change with the times.|$|R
50|$|It is illogical to seek {{purpose or}} meaning in an uncaring world without purpose or meaning, or to {{accumulate}} excessive {{wealth in the}} face of certain death. Absurdity is used in existentialist and related philosophy to describe absurdly pointless <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find such meaning or purpose in an objective and uncaring world, a philosophy known as absurdism.|$|R
25|$|In 1996, Apple's newest CEO, Gil Amelio, poached Ellen Hancock from National Semiconductor {{and put her}} {{in charge}} of {{engineering}} in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get development back on track. She decided it was best to cancel the project outright and try to find a suitable third-party system to replace it. Development of Copland officially ended in August 1996. After a short search, Apple announced its purchase of NeXT in order to use its NeXTSTEP operating system as the basis of a new Mac OS. Hancock also suggested that Apple should work on improving the existing System 7 while the new system matured. This was released as Mac OS 8 in 1997 and was followed by Mac OS 9 in 1999. The new operating system based on NeXTSTEP shipped in 2001 as Mac OS X.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, Styles {{was married}} in storyline to Karen Angle. Meanwhile, Styles and Tomko lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Kaz and Super Eric. With Kurt {{constantly}} accusing Styles and Karen of an affair and both denying anything beyond friendship, Styles quit The Angle Alliance. In retaliation, Tomko cost Styles his King of the Mountain qualifying match against Booker T. At Slammiversary, Styles defeated Angle, but was beat-down by Angle and Tomko after the match. The feud continued through Hard Justice, with Styles and Angle trading wins {{and on the}} following episode of Impact! he defeated Angle for his Olympic gold medal. Styles also won the rematch ladder match the following week to end their feud, but he was later asked to give Angle back his gold medal by Jeff Jarrett in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> mend things with Angle.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{fighting}} around Roosevelt Ridge, the Allied advance on Salamaua continued. Mount Tambu was secured on 18 August, and {{operations in the}} area continued through the final week of August. The capture of Roosevelt Ridge enabled Allied artillery observers to control fires more effectively around Salamaua and {{in the days following}} they began shelling Tambu Bay heavily, while patrols were pushed forward of the ridge with a view to eventually clearing the Japanese from the Scout Ridge junction and pushing north of Roosevelt Ridge. Around the same time, the Allies launched a seaborne landing near Lae and an airborne landing at Nadzab as part of an operation to secure Lae, which Allied planners considered more important than Salamaua itself. Pressure had been maintained on Salamaua in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> draw reinforcements away from Lae; however, as the Lae operation developed, the Japanese moved about 5,000 to 6,000 troops away from Salamaua by sea, abandoning the badly bomb damaged town.|$|E
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{sensitivity of}} societies and legal systems to environmental damage {{and the increasing}} size of ships has to some extent offset {{the decline in the}} number of salvage operations undertaken. Accidents such as major oil tanker groundings or sinkings may require extensive salvage <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> minimize the environmental damage such as that caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, or the Amoco Cadiz and Torrey Canyon disasters.|$|R
50|$|Outside {{of their}} role as Elders, Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi have {{individually}} {{been involved in the}} international <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> resolve the conflict in Syria. In February 2012, Annan was appointed Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and League of Arab States on the Syrian crisis. He was succeeded in the role by Brahimi, who was appointed Joint Special Representative in August 2012, a position he held until May 2014.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{becoming}} Prime Minister, Bildt {{had been a}} strong supporter of the three Baltic nations, and during his period as PM devoted considerable <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> assist the three now again independent Baltic states in handling their immediate challenges in form of withdrawal of ex-Soviet forces and strategic installations, as well as deciding on sensitive issues of citizenship. In this he worked closely together with the leaders of the three countries as well as with Russia Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.|$|R
25|$|A {{perceived}} {{weakness of}} his administration was the situation in handling migrant workers' protection, a very major issue in the Philippines, as {{there are millions of}} Filipinos abroad throughout the world serving as workers in foreign countries, and their remittances to relatives at home are very important to the Filipino economy. On the eve of his 67th birthday on March 17, 1995, Ramos was on a foreign trip when Flor Contemplación was hanged in Singapore. His last-minute effort to negotiate with Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong never succeeded and Ramos' return home was marred with protests after his arrival in Manila. The protests also caused the resignation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo and Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor from the cabinet. He immediately recalled Philippine ambassador to Singapore Alicia Ramos and suspended diplomatic relations with Singapore. He created a special commission to look into the case, which was in part an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rescue his sagging popularity. The commission was led by retired Supreme Court Justice Emilio Gancayco.|$|E
500|$|After this {{a period}} of {{stalemate}} fell across the peninsula. In early June, the 15th Battalion, its strength having fallen to below 600 men, was withdrawn from Quinn's Post to recuperate in a quiet sector known as [...] "Rest Gully". Over the next two months, due to illness, the battalion's personnel were almost completely replaced. It received several drafts of reinforcements, amounting to over 500 men, including its transport element, and by early August it had reached a strength of 720 men. On 6 August, the Allies launched an offensive in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break the deadlock, during which the 15th Battalion attacked the Abdel Rahman Bair heights, which was known to the Australians as [...] "Hill 971", before later supporting the 14th Battalion's attack on [...] "Hill 60". Casualties were heavy, and on 13 September the battalion was withdrawn for a brief rest on Lemnos, its strength having fallen to just 11 officers and 136 other ranks. They returned to Gallipoli early in November, occupying a position in Hay Valley, as winter began. They remained there until being evacuated on 13 December on the transport Carron, {{as part of the}} main Allied withdrawal. The battalion's casualties during the campaign amounted to 10 officers and 380 other ranks killed, and one officer and 17 other ranks captured.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get over an important story." ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 15, a North Korean [...] {{landed a}} three-person special {{operations}} reconnaissance {{team on the}} east coast of South Korea near Jeongdongjin, 20 kilometres south-east of Gangneung, Gangwon-do. Their mission was to spy on the naval installations in the area and then return. The submarine made a failed attempt to collect the team on the 16th, and returned the following day. The submarine, however, ran aground in the attempt, and all <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make her free were in vain.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 July 1897, Louis Leblois, {{lawyer for}} Lieutenant Colonel Georges Picquart, {{informed}} Scheurer-Kestner in {{detail about the}} Dreyfus Affair.Initially, he did not doubt the guilt of Dreyfus, but {{he wrote in his}} diary that he felt [...] "something vague and painful".https://books.google.com/books?id=ojwgAAAAMAAJ&q=%22esprit+quelque+chose+de+vague+et+de+douloureux%22&dq=%22esprit+quelque+chose+de+vague+et+de+douloureux%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_EMGT46UG4iIhQe2psXUAQ&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA After the intervention of Bernard Lazare, who <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> overcome his hesitation in 1897, this man [...] "passionately in love with Justice", who saw himself as the protector of all Alsatians in France, redoubled his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> form a sure opinion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> compete inter{{national}}ly {{took place}} in 2016.

2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style.

2500|$|After leaving Today, Garroway {{returned}} to television on National Educational Television (the forerunner of PBS) with a science series called Exploring the Universe in late 1962. Later {{he went back}} to working in radio, doing [...] "split shift" [...] shows called Garroway AM (mid mornings) and Garroway PM (mid afternoons) for WCBS (AM), New York. Garroway also started a magazine, National FM-Radio; the venture was a costly failure with Garroway realizing he was not cut out to be a businessman. While he was in the publishing business, Garroway began reading various law books in an <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> understand what his lawyer was saying. His attorney told him that he had done enough legal reading to pass the New York State bar exam. On a bet, Garroway sat for and passed the written exam.|$|E
50|$|Sickles devoted {{considerable}} <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> gain {{credit for}} helping achieve the Union victory at Gettysburg, writing articles and testifying before Congress {{in a manner}} that denigrated the intentions and actions of his superior officer, the army commander, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. After the war, Sickles was appointed as a commander for military districts in the South during Reconstruction. He also served as U.S. Minister to Spain. Later he was re-elected to Congress, where he helped pass legislation to preserve the Gettysburg Battlefield.|$|R
50|$|In 1725 Austria {{had signed}} the Treaty of Vienna, {{offering}} material {{support to the}} Spanish in their <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take back Gibraltar from the British. Britain was then allied to France, but their relationship was slowly declining, and by 1731, they would be considered enemies again. When, in 1727, the Spanish besieged Gibraltar during the Anglo-Spanish War, British diplomats persuaded the Austrians not to assist the Spanish by offering a number of concessions. A humiliated Spain was forced to break off the siege and make peace.|$|R
500|$|In {{line with}} its [...] "business as usual" [...] policy, the {{government}} was initially reluctant <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> control the food markets. It fought off <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> introduce minimum prices in cereal production, though relenting {{in the area of}} controlling of essential imports (sugar, meat and grains). When it did introduce changes, they were only limited in their effect. In 1916, it became illegal to consume more than two courses whilst lunching in a public eating place or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the public found feeding the pigeons or stray animals.|$|R
