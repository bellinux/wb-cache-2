Instead of idler gears, of course, a toothed belt or a roller chain can be used to transmit torque over distance. For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not.

The starting point is represented by a suitably depth‐averaged transport equation, with generally nonlocal turbulent mixing, solved in terms of particles trajectories and their first‐ and second‐order moments. Input data refer to six rivers of southern Italy, for which the irregular section morphology is known from a field survey. As the governing equation predicts, and according to experimental observations, in the case of variable cross‐sectional diffusion the tracer cloud exhibits a permanent and asymmetric peripheral drift toward the shallow boundary zones, with a remarkable deceleration along the main flow direction. Longitudinal <b>inertia</b> <b>moments</b> tend to become linear after a period equal to twice the single river diffusive time and sometimes show an early anomalous change of slope.

The accuracy of {{calculation of the}} <b>inertia</b> <b>moments</b> of the mass, directly affects on the accuracy of oscillation frequencies and vibrations level of mechanical system. This makes that is specified the system resonance zones and the amplitude of oscillation. As a case study for the calculation it is taken crankshaft of the engine, which has complex shape. For this case it is used theoretical method, which calculates the <b>moment</b> of <b>inertia</b> of the detail drawing. In fact, in practice, the completed details change form given in drawing, because it affect the technological manufacturing tolerances and dynamic balancing process. Therefore it is used experimental method, which takes account when the material is not homogeneous. The chosen method is hanging method, because it is accurate, simple and the device is designed and produced easy and {{it can also be}} used for other details. The results of experimental measurements performed for 4 crankshafts, have shown that the values of the <b>moments</b> of <b>inertia</b> are about 7 % smaller than those derived from theoretical method and differ by 4 % from one detail to another.

40|$|Abstract: Placing a {{satellite}} {{or any other}} spacecraft in orbit is a risky and expensive process; years of research {{and a lot of}} money are transformed into equipments that will be beyond any possibility of maintenance in case something goes wrong. Therefore, space projects must be carried on as carefully as possible in order to guarantee that satellite equipments perform its mission properly. In that context, experimental validation of new equipment and/or control techniques through prototypes is the way to increase system confidence. The Space Mechanics and Control Division (DMC) of INPE is constructing a 1 D simulator, with rotation around the vertical axis and a 3 D simulator, with rotation in three axes, to implement and test satellite Attitude Control System (ACS). However, to perform experimental test it is necessary to estimate the platform inertia parameters in order to balance the platform accurately, so it behaves similar to space torque free conditions. This paper presents the equations of motion and control law design for a 3 D attitude control system simulator. This 3 D model is simplified to 1 D simulator from which the <b>inertia</b> <b>moment</b> is estimated by a recursive least squares that uses experimental data. The platform data are obtained in a simple experiment where a reaction wheel is used to apply torques and a gyroscope is used to measure the platform angular velocity.

40|$|The Earth {{expansion}} {{problem has}} attracted great interest, {{and the present}} study demonstrates that the Earth has been expanding, at least over the recent several decades. Space-geodetic data recorded at stations distributed globally were used (including global positioning system data, very-longbaseline interferometry, satellite laser ranging stations, and stations for Doppler orbitography and radiopositioning integrated by satellite), which covered a period of more than 10 years in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2008. A triangular network covering {{the surface of the}} Earth was thus constructed based on the spherical Delaunay approach, and average-weighted vertical variations in the Earth surface were estimated. Calculations show that the Earth is expanding at present at a rate of 0. 24 ± 0. 04 mm/yr. Furthermore, based on the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 and the secular variation rates of the second-degree coefficients estimated by satellite laser ranging and Earth mean-pole data, the principal <b>inertia</b> <b>moments</b> of the Earth (A, B, C) and in particular their temporal variations, were determined: the simple mean value of the three principal <b>inertia</b> <b>moments</b> (i. e., [A+B+C]/ 3) is gradually increasing. This clearly demonstrates that the Earth has been expanding, at least over the recent decades, and the data show that the Earth is expanding at a rate ranging from 0. 17 ± 0. 02 mm/yr to 0. 21 ± 0. 02 mm/yr, which coincides with the space geodetic evidence. Hence, based on both space geodetic observations and gravimetric data, we conclude that the Earth has been expanding {{at a rate of about}} 0. 2 mm/yr over recent decades. ...|$|R
