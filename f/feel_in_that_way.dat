5000|$|Another theme running {{throughout}} the book is that humanity's traditional [...] "hero-systems", such as religion, are no longer convincing {{in the age of}} reason. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing [...] "illusions" [...] that enable us to <b>feel</b> heroic <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world.|$|R

25|$|When in 1920 the {{informal}} white-line printmakers' group organized its own exhibition, Weinrich showed a dozen works, including one called Cows Grazing in the Dunes near Provincetown.

The cows and dunes are recognizable but not presented realistically. The white lines serve to emphasize the blocks of muted colors which are the print's main pictorial elements. Weinrich uses {{the texture of the}} wood surface {{to call attention to the}} two-dimensional plane—the paper on which she made the print—in contrast with the implicit depth of foreground and background of cows, dunes, and sky.

40|$|Abstract This project {{focuses on}} the {{understanding}} of the meaning of the identity of Copenhagen. Though this is not the meaning {{what it means to be}} a person from Copenhagen, but our interior in the city, and the way our city epicentres are planned. The identity of Copenhagen is allegedly a town which interior is based upon history, tradition and modern Scandinavian design. To understand further about the way we plan our city. I had to use the design manual and the design policy, which is published by a sub department of city council. The manual and policy is an elaborate manual of how to decorate our city with the appropriate design of their choosing. These two manuals are made to achieve a greater and more used city. To find out if they actually used these manuals I used visual ethnography. To understand peoples bond to objects I used Yi-Fu Tuan’s theory of how people bond to a space, or place. Furthermore I used Jan Gehl theory of the perfect city planning. These to theories combined with my visual ethnography gave me the understanding that the identity of Copenhagen is not definable, at least not as the design manual and police planned. The identity does not come from objects; it comes from the interaction with people of the city. It is imperative that the city invites to stay in prober ways so the people <b>feel</b> invited, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> identity is made...|$|R

In fact, however, what we have done is to sacrifice the liberties of some-immigrants, and especially Arab and Muslim immigrants-for the purported security of the rest of us. This double standard is an all too tempting way to strike the balance-it allows citizens to enjoy a sense of security without sacrificing their own liberty, but it is an illegitimate trade-off.

60|$|First, in {{her growing}} resentment, {{she had an}} impulse {{to go to her}} new friend, the hunter Wade, and confide in him not only her longing to learn about Wilson, but also other matters that were growing daily more burdensome. How strange for her to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some <b>way</b> Jack Belllounds had come between her and the old man she loved and called father! Columbine had not divined that until lately. She felt it now <b>in</b> the fact <b>that</b> she no longer sought the rancher as she used to, and he had {{apparently}} avoided her. But then, Columbine reflected, she might be entirely wrong, for when Belllounds did meet her at meal-times, or anywhere, he seemed just as affectionate as of old. Still he was not the same man. A chill, an atmosphere of shadow, had pervaded the once wholesome ranch. And so, feeling not yet well enough acquainted with Wade to confide so intimately in him, she stifled her impulses and resolved to make some effort herself to find out what she wanted to know.|$|R

Zirphile reassures them that destiny has decreed that she will eventually have power over the Genie, but not yet. She must leave them to consult with the Gods and learn how this will come about. In her absence she hopes to protect them through the power of a magic ring. This will unites the lovers in a sort of telepathic bond, so that whatever one feels, the other will <b>feel</b> simultaneously. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> if the Genie punishes or even kills his rival Achante, he will also torment or kill the object of his affections.. Achante resists the charm as he does not wish Céphise to suffer either, but Zirphile compels her followers to enact the secret spell.The Genie arrives in a fury and orders Achante to be taken away. He tries to break down Céphise’s resistance with the vision of power and riches that an alliance with an immortal might provide. His suite add their persuasions, but she is adamant. Céphise feels the distress of Achante, imprisoned elsewhere… The Genie is at first confused by her communication with the absent lover. Then he recognises the work of Zirphile and realises that he must bring Achante back if Céphise is not to expire. Reunited, the lovers try to appeal to the Genie’s better side. He leaves them the rest of the day together, but after that… Achante suggests that they use the time to consult the oracle in the temple of love.|$|R

Gaga began the performance wearing a square-shaped head piece and an all-white cape as pre-recorded boos were quickly replaced by sound of cheers. Gaga then glided across the stage and was assisted by her dancers as she changed into a black sequin leotard and performed the intricate choreography seen in the song's corresponding music video. Throughout the performance she cycled through costumes and wigs she had previously employed throughout her career. She was also dancing with a Jeff Koons blue gazing ball, and had her face painted in the style of the single cover by one of her dancers. She concluded the performance by emerging from behind jungle-like scenery dressed in a seashell bikini ensemble, wearing a bigb londe curly wig and taking a bow. Gaga collaborated with experimental theater director Robert Wilson on the performance. His designed set featured a shimmering white jungle background with letters spelling [...] "Applause" [...] suspended from tree branches. Gaga characterized the performance as: [...] "So beautiful, it is so indicative of me as an artist.

I know you will forgive me if I still mingle something of the paternal with my fraternal admonitions. I watched you closely. I have still my old diaries of the St. Matthew's days, and I have been looking at them to remind me of what you once were. It was my custom to note my early impressions of all the men who worked with me, because I have a firm belief in the soundness of first impressions and the considerable risk one runs of having them obscured by the accidents and habituations of constant intercourse. I found <b>that</b> quite early <b>in</b> your days at St. Matthew's I wrote against your name 'enthusiastic, but a saving delicacy.' After all our life-long friendship I would not write anything truer. I would say of you to-day, 'This man might have been a revivalist, if he were not a gentleman.' There is the enthusiast, there is the revivalist, in you.

60|$|Yes, he felt sure; he did {{not know}} why he felt so sure: but he did feel sure; God's Spirit in his heart made him <b>feel</b> sure, <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some <b>way</b> or other, some day or other, the Lord God would come to judgment, to judge the wicked princes and rulers of this world, and cast them out. It must be so. God was a righteous God. He would not endure these unrighteous doings for ever. He was not {{careless}} about this poor sinful world, and about all the sinful down-trodden ignorant men, and women, and children in it. He would take the matter into His own hands. He would show that He was Lord and Master. If kings would not reign in righteousness, He would come and reign in righteousness Himself. He would appoint princes under Him, who would rule in judgment. And He would show men what true righteousness was; what the pattern of a true ruler was; namely, to be able to feel for the poor, and the afflicted, and the needy, to understand the wants, and sorrows, and doubts, and fears of the lowest and the meanest; in short, to be a man, a true, perfect man, with a man's heart, a man's pity, a man's fellow-feeling in Him. Yes. The Lord God would show Himself. He would set His righteous King to govern. And yet Isaiah did not know how, but he saw plainly that it must be so, that same righteous King, who was to set the world right, would be a MAN.

I went to hear celebrated preachers, and I read religious books. But I found nothing that fitted my own need. The faith which puts the sinner in possession of salvation seemed, as I understood it, to be quite out of my reach. I had no faith; I only felt utterly wretched, under the power of habits and dispositions which had wrought hideous evil. At last, as I told you, I found a friend to whom I opened all my feelings--to whom I confessed everything. He {{was a man who}} had gone through very deep experience, and could understand the different wants of different minds. He made it clear to me that the only preparation for coming to Christ and partaking of his salvation, was that very sense of guilt and helplessness which was weighing me down. He said, You are weary and heavy-laden; well, it is you Christ invites to come to him and find rest. He asks you to cling to him, to lean on him; he does not command you to walk alone without stumbling. He does not tell you, as your fellow-men do, that you must first merit his love; he neither condemns nor reproaches you for the past, he only bids you come to him that you may have life: he bids you stretch out your hands, and take of the fulness of his love. You have only to rest on him as a child rests on its mother's arms, and you will be upborne by his divine strength. That is what is meant by faith. Your evil habits, you feel, are too strong for you; you are unable to wrestle with them; you know beforehand you shall fall. But when once we <b>feel</b> our helplessness <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and go to the Saviour, desiring to be freed from the power as well as the punishment of sin, we are no longer left to our own strength. As long as we live in rebellion against God, desiring to have our own will, seeking happiness in the things of this world, it is as if we shut ourselves up in a crowded stifling room, where we breathe only poisoned air; but we have only to walk out under the infinite heavens, and we breathe the pure free air that gives us health, and strength, and gladness. It is just so with God's spirit: as soon as we submit ourselves to his will, as soon as we desire to be united to him, and made pure and holy, {{it is as if the}} walls had fallen down that shut us out from God, and we are fed with his spirit, which gives us new strength.' ...|$|R
