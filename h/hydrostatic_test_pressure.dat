50|$|A <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> {{is a way}} {{in which}} {{pressure}} vessels such as pipelines, plumbing, gas cylinders, boilers and fuel tanks can be tested for strength and leaks. The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified <b>test</b> <b>pressure.</b> Pressure tightness can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss. The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant. Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container. <b>Hydrostatic</b> <b>testing</b> is the most common method employed for <b>testing</b> pipes and <b>pressure</b> vessels. Using this test helps maintain safety standards and durability of a vessel over time. Newly manufactured pieces are initially qualified using the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test.</b> They are then re-qualified at regular intervals using the proof <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> which is also called the modified <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Testing</b> of <b>pressure</b> vessels for transport and storage of gases is very important because such containers can explode if they fail under pressure.|$|R

40|$|Although the {{lifetime}} of plastic pipes is commonly determined by <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tests</b> which measure the mechanical resistance, thermo-oxidative degradation {{plays an important role}} in practice. It is, therefore, an important question to monitor the elemental processes occurring during ageing of polymers, namely the loss of stabilising additives and the degradation of the polymer. The diffusion of the phenolic antioxidant AO- 18, the processing stabiliser, and changes in polymer morphology during <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>testing,</b> have been systematically studied for pipes made of PE 80 and PE 100 using infrared microscopy in a quantitative manner. For both materials a parabolic concentration profile of AO- 18 develops over the pipe wall upon <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>testing.</b> Under comparable conditions of testing the loss rate was larger for the PE 80 than for the PE 100. An annealing of the polymer occurs upon ageing with a similar increase in degree of crystallinity for bot h materials. However, the PE 100 has an overall higher level of crystallinity, and it may be speculated that this is one of the reasons for the slower loss of antioxidant. The results from IR-microscopy are in excellent agreement with analyses of samples taken over the pipe wall by oxidative induction time (OIT) and extraction HPLC. The conversion of the phosphite additive PS- 2 to the corresponding phosphate as a result of oxidation has been quantitatively assessed. The total content of phosphate and phosphite was found to be constant, and almost no extraction is seen before 5000 h.

40|$|A steel {{containment}} vessel was fabricated and proof tested {{for use by}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory at their M- 9 facility. The HY- 100 steel vessel was designed to provide total containment for high explosives tests up to 22 lb (10 kg) of TNT equivalent. The vessel was fabricated from an 11. 5 -ft diameter cylindrical shell, 1. 5 in thick, and 2 : 1 elliptical ends, 2 in thick. Prior to delivery and acceptance, three types of tests were required for proof testing the vessel: a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>test,</b> air leak tests, and two full design charge explosion <b>tests.</b> The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> provided an initial static check on the capacity of the vessel and functioning of the strain instrumentation. The pneumatic air leak tests were performed before, in between, and after the explosion tests. After three smaller preliminary charge tests, the full design charge weight explosion tests demonstrated that no yielding occurred in the vessel at its rated capacity. The blast pressures generated by the explosions and the dynamic response of the vessel were measured and recorded with 33 strain channels, 4 blast pressure channels, 2 gas pressure channels, and 3 displacement channels. This paper presents an overview of the test program, a short summary of the methodology used to predict the design blast loads, {{a brief description of the}} transducer locations and measurement systems, some of the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>test</b> strain and stress results, examples of the explosion pressure and dynamic strain data, and some comparisons of the measured data with the design loads and stresses on the vessel...|$|R

40|$|Reliable testing methodologies for the {{assessment}} of protective coatings are critical for ensuring the integrity and durability of pipeline coatings (such as field joint coatings) and the mitigation of pipeline corrosion. Currently the failure of joint coatings {{is one of the major}} concerns in corrosion protection of pipelines, although they represent only approximately 5 % of the coated area in a pipeline system. This paper presents an overview of major testing methodologies currently used in the pipeline industry for the selection, testing, and life prediction of coatings, in particular field joint coatings. Particular focus is on the discussion of difficulties and limitations in testing methods for assessing pipeline coating cracking, cathodic disbondment and loss of adhesion. It is shown that there are limitations in current methodologies in evaluating the coating flexibility - a key parameter for avoiding coatings cracking during <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>testing,</b> cyclic <b>pressure</b> operation and field bending. Methodologies for assessing the effect of holidays in coatings on the cathodic disbondment of pipeline coating under excessively negative cathodic protection (CP) voltages also require improvement. Furthermore, methods for understanding the effects of coating wet adhesion on pipeline coating, cracking and disbondment also need attention. Some preliminary results for addressing some of these issues are also presented in this paper...|$|R
