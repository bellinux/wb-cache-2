40|$|Although the {{technology}} of refrigeration and air conditioning developed in the XX century, their origins {{can be traced back}} to the beginnings of civilization. Snow and ice were used to preserve food and to cool drinks. However, it was not until the mid XIX century that methods were elaborated to produce artificial ice and the early XX century that air conditioning was developed. Today the widespread use of this technology has necessitated the creation of vocational courses of a medium level for the assembly and maintenance of air conditioning devices, and courses of a higher level for making projects of thermal facilities. We present some didactic materials related to the history of refrigeration that could be used in vocational courses to assist students, and that could be included in a commemorative <b>commercial</b> <b>catalogue</b> in order to provide a more detailed explanation to the technician...|$|R
