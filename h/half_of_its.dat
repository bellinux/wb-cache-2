5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1917 Russian Revolution, Belarus declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> territory to Poland after the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World WarII. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a third of its population and more than <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became {{a founding member of the}} United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.|$|E

5|$|Although {{cyclones}} take {{an enormous}} toll in lives and personal property, {{they may be}} important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.

Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path, though it also killed 259people and caused $9.14billion (2005 USD) in damage.|$|E

Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated in the Alps by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range.|$|E
