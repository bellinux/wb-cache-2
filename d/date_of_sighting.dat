40|$|The Pierre, S. D., {{office of}} the Fish and Wildlife Service has {{released}} their records of sightings of the Wood Buffalo flock of Whooping Cranes, and those that pertain to Nebraska are given below. There are three classes of sightings: Confirmed Sightings. Observation made by a State or Federal Biologist or officer or by other known qualified observer (trained ornithologist or birder with experience in identification of Whooping Cranes). A photograph may {{also be used to}} confirm sightings. Probable Sighting. No confirmation made by State or Federal Biologist or officer or by other known qualified observer, yet details of the sighting seen to identify the birds as Whooping Cranes. To be classified as a probable sighting each of the following factors must be met: (1) location of sighting is within normal migration corridor and is an appropriate site for Whooping Cranes, (2) <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>sighting</b> is within period of migration, (3) accurate physical description, (4) number of birds is reasonable, (5) behavior of the birds does not eliminate Whooping Cranes, and (6) good probability that observer would provide reliable report. Unconfirmed Sighting. Details of the sighting meet some, but not all, of the six factors listed for a probable sighting. The confirmed sightings are:.. ...|$|E

Still following {{the course of the}} river which wound through the forests {{at the base of the}} peak, we entered the territory of the redoubtable Wambe. This, however, was not accomplished without a certain difference of opinion between my bearers and myself, for when we reached the spot where Wambe's boundary was supposed to run, the bearers sat down and emphatically refused to go a step further. I sat down too, and argued with them, putting my fatalistic views before them as well as I was able. But I could not persuade them to look at the matter in the same light. 'At present,' they said, 'their skins were whole; if they went into Wambe's country without his leave they would soon be like a water-eaten leaf. It was very well for me to say that this would be Fate. Fate no doubt might be walking about in Wambe's country, but while they stopped outside they would not meet him.' ...|$|R

In determining the lunar months system, Hisab seems to be an attempt that uses scientific approach, while Ruyah seems to be an attempt that use taabbudiyah approach. This fact is often exposes people to two alternatives, giving priority to scientific method or deemed contrary to leave the scientific method with emphasis to taabbudiyyah...|$|R
40|$|When Craig Faanes, Grand Island, {{went to the}} Mormon Island Crane Meadows 16 April 1987 {{to watch}} Sandhill Cranes at night he saw a bird that he first took for a Whimbrel. He was {{familiar}} with Whimbrels on both coasts, but the more he studied the bird the more {{he was convinced that}} the bird was an Eskimo Curlew. After he had gone to the natural history museum at UNL and studied a stuffed Eskimo Curlew be was convinced that that was what he had seen. After the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> this <b>sighting</b> Eskimo Curlews were reported from 2 ̆ 2 the Sabine and Aransas wildlife refuges in Texas 2 ̆ 2. (Probably the first reference is to Sabine NWR, Hackberry, Louisiana, near the Texas line. Aransas NWR, near Corpus Christi, is the winter home of the major flock of Whooping Cranes. [...] Ed.) The information above was condensed, by permission from the 1 November 1987 issue of the Omaha World-Herald.

The birds were very common in Nebraska until the market hunters took their toll. It is to be hoped that the Eskimo Curlew can be brought back, just as the Whooping Crane has been, although the situations are very different...|$|R
50|$|Finally, the {{standard}} historical method of counting {{the duration of}} pregnancy begins from the last menstruation and this remains common with doctors, hospitals, and medical companies. This system is convenient because {{it is easy to}} determine when the last menstrual period was, while both fertilization and implantation occur out <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> An interesting consequence is that the <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy measured this way begins two weeks before ovulation.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{employee}} alignment with an initiative is often considered a critical process of organizational change, {{few studies have examined}} processes where organizations change the individual to bring about alignment. This research aims to fill this gap by examining how employees change following the introduction of a new change initiative. Specifically, I investigate how employee knowledge of (1) a change objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives) and (2) how to best affect the objective (i. e., line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions) changes following the introduction of a change initiative. To better understand potential attributes that may affect the trajectory of the line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> constructs, I take a social cognitive approach to suggest five potential moderators (i. e., locus of control, interaction quality, valence, learning goal orientation, self-efficacy) based on the five core concepts of social cognitive theory (i. e., agency, observational learning, valued outcomes, goals, self-efficacy). Additionally, I propose a potential trajectory for behavioral alignment, based on a theory of change momentum; and, I examine the potential moderating effects of learning on the behavioral alignment trajectory. I also examine a potential pathway in which line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions mediate the relationship between line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and behavioral alignment with the same five social cognitive facets as proposed moderators. In a sample of 189 fast food employees, partial support is found for the alignment model. Line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives influences both line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions and behavioral alignment. Line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions also predicted performance. When looking at the trajectories, the time period encompassing the intervention saw significant gains in line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives, but not line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions. The change in line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> objectives and line <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> actions also predicted the change in behavioral alignment. Implications and future directions for research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) {{has allowed}} precise {{determinations}} {{of the column}} densities of molecular hydrogen () in Galactic lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> {{with a wide range}} of pathlengths and extinction properties. However, survey studies <b>of</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with greater extinction have been mostly restricted to the low-J states (lower total angular momentum) in which most molecular hydrogen is observed. This paper presents a survey of column densities for the molecular hydrogen in states of greater rotational excitation (J ≥ 2) in Galactic lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> with ≳ 20. This study is comprehensive through the highest excited state detectable in each line <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> J= 5 is observed in every line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and we detect J= 7 in four lines <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> J= 8 in one line <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and vibrationally excited in two lines <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b> We compared the apparent b-values and velocity offsets of the higher-J states relative to the dominant low-J states and we found no evidence of any trends that might provide insight into the formation of higher-J, although these results are the most affected by the limits of the FUSE resolution. We also derive excitation temperatures based on the column densities of the different states. We confirm that at least two distinct temperatures are necessary to adequately describe these lines <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> and that more temperatures are probably necessary. Total column density is known to be correlated with other molecules; we explore if correlations vary as a function of J for several molecules, most importantly CH and CH^+. Finally, we briefly discuss interpretations of selected lines <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> by comparing them to models computed using the Meudon PDR code.
