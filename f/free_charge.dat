25|$|Magneto-optic {{generalized}} ellipsometry (MOGE) is {{an advanced}} infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry technique for studying <b>free</b> <b>charge</b> carrier properties in conducting samples. By applying an {{external magnetic field}} {{it is possible to}} determine independently the density, the optical mobility parameter and the effective mass parameter of <b>free</b> <b>charge</b> carriers. Without the magnetic field only two out of the three <b>free</b> <b>charge</b> carrier parameters can be extracted independently.|$|E
25|$|Even when an object's net {{charge is}} zero, charge can be {{distributed}} non-uniformly in the object (e.g., {{due to an}} external electromagnetic field, or bound polar molecules). In such cases the object {{is said to be}} polarized. The charge due to polarization is known as bound charge, while charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called <b>free</b> <b>charge.</b> The motion of electrons in conductive metals in a specific direction is known as electric current.|$|E
25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of <b>free</b> <b>charge</b> carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.|$|E

2500|$|Single-wavelength {{ellipsometry}} {{employs a}} monochromatic light source. This {{is usually a}} laser in the visible spectral region, for instance, a HeNe laser [...] with a wavelength of 632.8nm. Therefore, single-wavelength ellipsometry is also called laser ellipsometry. The advantage of laser ellipsometry is that laser beams can be focused on a small spot size. Furthermore, lasers have a higher power than broad band light sources. Therefore, laser ellipsometry {{can be used for}} imaging (see below). However, the experimental output is restricted to one set of [...] and [...] values per measurement. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources, which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. By that the complex refractive index or the dielectric function tensor in the corresponding spectral region can be obtained, which gives access to a large number of fundamental physical properties. Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) can probe lattice vibrational (phonon) and <b>free</b> <b>charge</b> carrier (plasmon) properties. Spectroscopic ellipsometry in the near infrared, visible up to ultraviolet spectral region studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties, for instance, band-to-band transitions or excitons.|$|E

The terms <b>free</b> <b>charge</b> and dissimulated {{electricity}} convey therefore erroneous notions if {{they are}} meant to imply any difference as to the mode or kind of action. The charge upon an insulated conductor {{in the middle of}} a room is in the same relation to the walls of that room as the charge upon the inner coating of a Leyden jar is to the outer coating of the same jar. The one is not more free or more dissimulated than the other; and when sometimes we make electricity appear where it was not evident before, as upon the outside of a charged jar, when, after insulating it, we touch the inner coating, it is only because we divert more or less of the inductive force from one direction into another; for not the slightest change is in such circumstances impressed upon the character or action of the force.|$|E

Whilst the charge of the inner coating could induce only through the glass towards the outer coating, and the latter contained no more of the contrary force than was equivalent to it, no induction external to the jar could be perceived; but when the inner coating was extended by the rod and ball {{so that it could}} induce through the air towards external objects, then the tension of the polarized glass molecules would, by their tendency to return to the normal state, fall a little, and a portion of the charge passing to the surface of this new part of the inner conductor, would produce inductive action through the air towards distant objects, whilst {{at the same time a}} part of the force in the outer coating previously directed inwards would now be at liberty, and indeed be constrained to induct outwards through the air, producing in that outer coating what is sometimes called, though I think very improperly, <b>free</b> <b>charge.</b> If a small Leyden jar be converted into that form of apparatus usually known by the name of the electric well, it will illustrate this action very completely.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} and internal energy of an ultracold plasma {{in a state}} of quasi-equilibrium are evaluated using classical molecular dynamics simulations.
