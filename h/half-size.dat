5|$|The Grolier Codex (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Sáenz Codex) is a Maya book of a pre-Columbian type but of disputed authenticity. It first appeared in a private collection in the 20th century and was displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name. The codex consists of a fragment of a Maya book, containing almanacs of Venus represented in a simplistic fashion. The Grolier Codex would be only the fourth surviving pre-Columbian Maya book if genuine. The codex {{is said to have been}} recovered from a cave in the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1960s, together with a mosaic mask and some blank pages of pre-Columbian fig-bark paper. It was displayed at the Grolier Club from April 20 to June 5, 1971, and is now held in Mexico City. In 1973, Michael D. Coe published the first <b>half-size</b> recto-side facsimile of the codex in The Maya Scribe and His World, produced by the Grolier Club. The codex contains a Venus almanac that, in structure, is closely related to the Venus almanac contained in the Dresden Codex.|$|E
5|$|Allward chose a {{relatively}} new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used <b>half-size</b> plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now {{on display at the}} Canadian War Museum, and an instrument called a pantograph to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave {{was not part of the}} original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two basic}} types of de-interlacing algorithms: field {{combination}} and field extension [15]. In the field extension type, there is a de-interlacing method called vertical <b>half-sizing.</b> In this method, each interlaced field is displayed separately, resulting in a video with half the vertical resolution of the original one, this alleviates the problem of combing artifacts. This method is implemented by deleting all the even or odd lines of the interlaced frame. It can eliminate most combing artifacts but it severely degrades the video quality and breaks the aspect ratio, and hence, it is not widely used for de-interlacing. We focused on the powerful de-interlacing ability of vertical <b>half-sizing</b> and used it {{as the basis of}} our scheme to separate the screenshots and nonscreenshots.|$|R
50|$|<b>Half-sizing</b> {{displays}} each interlaced {{field on}} its own, {{resulting in a}} video with half the vertical resolution of the original, unscaled. While this method retains all vertical resolution and all temporal resolution it is understandably not used for regular viewing because of its false aspect ratio. However, it can be successfully used to apply video filters which expect a noninterlaced frame, such as those exploiting information from neighbouring pixels (e.g., sharpening).|$|R
25|$|On 28 April 2003, Prince Andrew as {{president}} of The Football Association unveiled the World Cup Sculpture (also called The Champions) in a prominent place near the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. It depicts Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, {{on the shoulders of}} Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. The one and a <b>half-size</b> bronze was sculpted by Philip Jackson after a famous photograph taken just after the 1966 final at the old Wembley. The south bank at West Ham's ground up until 2016, the Boleyn Ground in Upton Park, was named the Bobby Moore Stand shortly after Moore's death.|$|E
25|$|As the <b>half-size</b> {{models were}} nearing {{completion}} in 1933, the CFA suspended the project. By now, the United States {{was in the}} depths of the Great Depression. The bridge was finished and slightly over budget, and Congress was increasingly unwilling to appropriate money for any further construction except the most critical remaining construction items (such as roadways). Obtaining funds for the costly granite and expensive carving was politically impossible. Furthermore, what funds were available were impounded under the Economy Act of 1933. Nevertheless, the CFA wanted very much to proceed with the statues. With the full-size models already paid for, it asked the sculptors to finish their work. The Commission of Fine Arts visited Friedlander's White Plains, New York, studio on October 14, 1933, and approved his models.|$|E
500|$|Guy {{notes that}} the further the Moon is from the Earth in its {{eccentric}} orbit, the slower it moves, and the more likely the need to resort to an intercalary night to keep the calendar in sync with its phases. He hypothesizes that the [...] "heralding sequences" [...] are instructions to observe the apparent diameter of the Moon, and that the <b>half-size</b> superscripted crescents (orange) preceding the sixth night before and sixth night after the full moon represent the small apparent diameter at apogee which triggers intercalation.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the standard retail version, a Limited Collector's Edition of Halo Wars was made available. To attract Halo 3s player base, Microsoft bundled early access to the Mythic Map Pack, a collection of three Halo 3 multiplayer maps, with the collector's edition. A 48-page, <b>half-size</b> hardcover graphic novel was also included; titled Halo Wars: Genesis, it was created by Phil Noto, Graeme Devine, and Eric Nylund. It explores the background stories of Anders, the Arbiter, Forge and Cutter. Other bonuses included a unique in-game vehicle, trading cards, and a Spirit of Fire patch. Players who pre-ordered the game from certain retailers received a special in-game Warthog vehicle with flame decals. GameStop announced that on February 28, 2009, one thousand stores in the United States would hold Halo Wars tournaments, and two thousand GameStop stores held midnight releases for the game. European markets sold a [...] "Best of Halo" [...] bundle of Halo Wars, Halo 3 and an Xbox 360.|$|E

500|$|As County Executive, Gorski {{would oppose}} Mayor Griffin several times. [...] One {{of the first}} {{occurred}} in 1989 when Griffin ignored Vietnam [...] veterans' request to use LaSalle Park to host The Moving Wall, a <b>half-size</b> replica of the Washington, DC's Vietnam Veterans Memorial. [...] Gorski made Chestnut Ridge Park, which is located [...] south of Buffalo in Erie County, available to the veterans. A major crisis during his administration led to the threatened shutdown of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority bus and Light rail Buffalo Metro Rail subway service throughout Western New York. [...] At the time, Buffalo was the smallest American city with a subway system and Alfred Savage had just resigned as Executive Director to assume that position with the Chicago Transit Authority. [...] During Gorski's first term the local economy was revitalized: by March 1990, Buffalo's monthly unemployment rate fell below the state average {{for the first time}} in 11 years, and the region's job growth had outpaced the state average for its fourth consecutive year. [...] The city was ranked by Fortune as one of the nation's top five growth communities. [...] Gorski signed the controversial item pricing law in 1991, making Erie County one of the early counties to confirm the requirement that most supermarket products have a price tags. By the time he ran for re-election for the first time, he was backed by both the County Democratic and Conservative parties, and he was challenged by fourth-term incumbent Mayor Griffin. [...] Gorski handily won the Democratic nomination over Griffin by a 6832 margin as well as the Conservative party nomination. [...] Gorski handed Griffin the first general election defeat of his political career when the Mayor contested Gorski as the Republican Party and New York State Right to Life Party nominee. [...] By the end of Gorski's first term, he had established himself as the most influential person in Western New York according to a report cited in The New York Times.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{standardized}} steel shipping containers began {{during the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, when commercial shipping operators and the US military started developing such units.

2500|$|Using {{personal}} finances, John Devitt founded Vietnam Combat Veterans, Ltd. With {{the help}} of friends, the <b>half-size</b> replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, named The Moving Wall, was built and first put on display {{to the public in}} Tyler, Texas, in 1984. The Moving Wall visits hundreds of small towns and cities throughout the U.S., staying five or six days at each site. Local arrangements for each visit are made months in advance by veterans' organizations and other civic groups. Desire for a hometown visit of The Moving Wall was so high that the waiting list became very long. Vietnam Combat Veterans built a second structure of The Moving Wall. A third structure was added in 1989. In 2001, one of the structures was retired due to wear. By 2006, there had been more than 1,000 hometown visits of The Moving Wall. The count of people who visited The Moving Wall at each display ranges from 5,000 to more than 50,000; the total estimate of visitors is in the tens of millions. As the wall moves from town to town on interstates, it is often escorted by state troopers and up to thousands of local citizens on motorcycles. Many of these are Patriot Guard Riders, who consider escorting The Moving Wall to be a [...] "special mission", which is coordinated on their website. As it passes towns, even when it is not planning a stop in those towns, local veterans organizations sometimes plan for local citizens to gather by the highway and across overpasses to wave flags and salute the Wall.|$|E
