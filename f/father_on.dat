He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E

Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald came to {{the throne}} {{on the death of}} his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> 24 February 616, or {{possibly}} 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald's accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht's second wife is not recorded, but it seems likely that she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.|$|E

In the summer of that year, the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press, but not by the British press, which maintained a self-imposed silence. Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.|$|E

5|$|In 1725, Newton {{was born}} in Wapping, a {{district}} in London near the Thames. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a Catholic but had Protestant sympathies, {{and his mother was}} a devout Independent unaffiliated with the Anglican Church. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> a ship as an apprentice; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.|$|E
5|$|In 1842, Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in {{what was}} to be a childless marriage. Soon after, he succeeded as duke upon the death of his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> 29 January 1844. As reigning Duke Ernest II, he {{supported}} the German Confederation in the Schleswig-Holstein Wars against Denmark, sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps; as such, he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces. After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862, the British government put Ernest's name forward as a possible successor. Negotiations fell through however for various reasons, not in the least of which was that he would not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|In the {{confusion}} of the rout, thousands of Bulgarian troops were killed and the remainder desperately attempted to flee westwards. Samuel and his son Gabriel Radomir immediately headed to the east from their headquarters in the Strumitsa fortress to aid their army, but in desperate fighting {{near the village of}} Mokrievo (present-day Republic of Macedonia) they were overwhelmed by the quickly advancing enemy. Many Bulgarian soldiers were killed at Mokrievo and many more were captured. Emperor Samuel himself barely escaped, only breaking free through the bravery of his son, who mounted his <b>father</b> <b>on</b> his own horse and took him to safety in Prilep. From Prilep, Samuel returned to Prespa while Gabriel Radomir headed towards Strumitsa to continue the struggle.|$|E

40|$|This diploma work {{is focused}} on the {{situation}} of <b>fathers</b> <b>on</b> parental leave in the Czech Republic. The aim of research is to find out how <b>fathers</b> feel <b>on</b> their parental leave, what is positive or negative for them and how they evaluate this experience. The theoretical part describes the legislative framework of parental leave and parental allowance and explains the concepts such as femininity, masculinity, maternity and paternity. Then I deal with gender stereotypes and situation on the labour market, and their influences on the decision for starting parental leave. Then I formulate arguments for more father's participation in taking care of children. The empirical part {{is focused on}} a qualitative research. The research was realized by interviews done with 10 <b>fathers</b> <b>on</b> parental leaves, and analyzed by coding. Then I made a connection between new data and theoretical resources which are described in the first part. At the end I indicate the posibility of doins some other research, for example with both parents...|$|R
