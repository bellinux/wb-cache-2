5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>reasons.</b> Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma.

David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E

Since release, the game has inspired a mobile prequel, and Godai wrote a series of novels based on her original premise for the story.|$|E

5|$|Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, {{which he}} entered {{before he was}} six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his {{occasional}} long withdrawals from public performance, <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>reasons.</b> Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually {{all of which are}} for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op.35) and all the minor keys (Op.39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op.39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.|$|E
