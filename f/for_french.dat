5|$|Born into a well-read {{and educated}} family, Hambro {{developed}} a penchant <b>for</b> <b>French</b> literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English {{literature in the}} Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De frafalnes klubb, Hambro published trilogies and other novels {{for the next two}} decades. He had a keen interest in linguistics; in the 1969 book Ting, tanke, tale he problematized linguistic questions in a popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Confederate {{agents in}} Britain had {{arranged}} {{for the construction of}} Confederate ships, most notably the CSS Alabama, which ravaged Union shipping after her construction in 1862.

5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism <b>for</b> <b>French</b> fries in the United States. The term came to prominence in 2003 when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias in response to France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War.

5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered <b>for</b> <b>French</b> military personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Pope Pius XII {{died and}} was succeeded by Pope John XXIII, who, in 1959, after giving Lefebvre {{the choice between}} {{remaining}} either as Apostolic Delegate or as Archbishop of Dakar, appointed another to the post of Apostolic Delegate <b>for</b> <b>French</b> Africa. Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of Dakar until 23 January 1962, when he {{was transferred to the}} diocese of Tulle in France, retaining his personal title of archbishop.

5|$|In August 1987, the {{encouraged}} Chadians {{carried their}} offensive into the disputed Aouzou Strip, occupying {{the town of}} Aouzou following another battle in which the Libyans suffered severe losses in troops and abandoned equipment. In retaliation, Libya intensified its air bombardments of towns in the north, usually from altitudes beyond the range of FANT's shoulder-fired missiles. Appeals by Habré <b>for</b> <b>French</b> air missions to defend the area against the bombing were rejected, as Aouzou had been retaken against the wishes of French President François Mitterrand. Instead, Mitterrand called for international mediation to settle competing claims to the disputed territory.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's {{lightning}} campaign {{exposed the}} Austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus. Mack completely misread the French dispositions and scattered his forces; as the French defeated each unit separately, the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications. Napoleon arrived to take personal command {{of close to}} 80,000men. At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20,000infantry and 3,273cavalry.

As French explorers entered the area, a Montreal-based company, the North West Company, began trading with the Métis. Both the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company built fur-trading forts; {{the two companies}} competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the Hudson's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg preserve {{the history of this}} era).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1943 {{national}} elections in French Mandatory Syria, the French authorities attempted {{to negotiate with}} Quwatli {{as head of the}} National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria's alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return <b>for</b> <b>French</b> help in securing Quwatli's election to the presidency. Quwatli refused, believing the Syrian people would view such negotiations negatively. He was also confident that the National Bloc would win the elections regardless of French support. Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria's president on 17 August 1943.|$|E

5|$|Rose Levin was {{a capable}} cook, and, though the {{household}} {{was not well}} off, Levin was well fed and acquired an interest in food that in adult life {{became one of the}} regular themes of his journalism. The cuisine was traditional Jewish, with fried fish as one cornerstone of the repertoire, and chicken as another – boiled, roast, or in soup with lokshen (noodles), kreplach or kneidlach. As an adult Levin retained his love of Jewish cookery along with his passion <b>for</b> <b>French</b> haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The German {{were forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the north of the Orne but Allied forces were unable to push beyond the Orne.

5|$|The Manitoba Schools Question {{showed the}} deep {{divergence}} of cultural {{values in the}} territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding <b>for</b> <b>French</b> Catholic schools.
