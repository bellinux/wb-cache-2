40|$|The Reduced Enrichment Research Test Reactors (RERTR) fuel {{development}} program {{is developing a}} high uranium density fuel based on a (LEU) uranium-molybdenum alloy. Testing of prototypic RERTR fuel elements is necessary to demonstrate integrated fuel performance behavior and scale-up of fabrication techniques. Two RERTR-Full Size Demonstration fuel elements based on the ATR-Reduced YA elements (all but one plate fueled) are to be fabricated for testing in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). The two fuel elements will be irradiated in alternating cycles such that only one element is loaded in the reactor at a time. Existing criticality analyses have analyzed Standard (HEU) ATR elements (all plates fueled) from which controls have been derived. This criticality safety evaluation (CSE) documents analysis that determines the reactivity of the Demonstration fuel elements relative to HEU ATR elements and shows that the <b>Demonstration</b> <b>elements</b> are bound by the Standard HEU ATR elements and existing HEU ATR element controls are applicable to the <b>Demonstration</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|E

40|$|With the {{increase}} of broadband connections users, the number of home computers has increased importantly. As a consequence security issues have gained in importance in this domain. Most of these new computer users are novice {{and do not have}} the knowledge to understand exactly the repercussion of their actions in term of security on their machines. Software companies have developed several products to protect these stand alone computers. Some of them are designed to produce security audits which evaluate the security risk of the Personal Computer (PC). Unfortunately, even with these audit programs, users do not become aware of the danger they can face on Internet. This project has developed a security audit tool which is intended for novice computer users. This tool’s objective is to evaluate the materiel security level and the behaviour security risk of the user. Moreover, to be sure of the users ’ understanding, this tool also contains some explanation and <b>demonstration</b> <b>elements,</b> which show them how a malicious person can exploit their lack of prudence...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} <b>demonstration</b> <b>element</b> of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) {{program is}} aimed at demonstrating {{the closure of the}} fuel cycle by destroying the transuranic (TRU) elements separated from spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Multiple recycle through fast reactors is used for burning the TRU initially separated from light-water reactor (LWR) spent nuclear fuel. For the initial technology demonstration, the preferred option to demonstrate the closed fuel cycle destruction of TRU materials is a sodium-cooled fast reactor (FR) used as burner reactor. The sodium-cooled fast reactor represents the most mature sodium reactor technology available today. This report provides a review of the current state of development of fuel systems relevant to the sodium-cooled fast reactor.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led multi-center Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) project Deep Space Habitat (DSH) analog that will be field-tested during the 2011 Desert Research and Technologies Studies (D-RATS) field tests. The HDU project is a technology pull project that integrates technologies and innovations from multiple NASA centers. This project will repurpose the HDU Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM) that was field tested in the 2010 D-RATS, adding habitation functionality to the prototype unit. The 2010 configuration of the HDU-PEM consisted of a lunar surface laboratory module that was used to bring over 20 habitation-related technologies together in a single platform that could be tested as an advanced habitation analog in the context of mission architectures and surface operations. The 2011 HDU-DSH configuration will build upon the PEM work, and emphasize validity of crew operations (habitation and living, etc), EVA operations, mission operations, logistics operations, and science operations that might be required in a deep space context for Near Earth Object (NEO) exploration mission architectures. The HDU project consists of a multi-center team brought together in a skunkworks approach to quickly build and validate hardware in analog environments. The HDU project is part of the strategic plan from the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Directorate Integration Office (DIO) and the Exploration Mission Systems Office (EMSO) to test destination elements in analog environments. The 2011 analog field test will include Multi Mission Space Exploration Vehicles (MMSEV) and the DSH among other <b>demonstration</b> <b>elements</b> to be brought together in a mission architecture context.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{an overview of}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led multi-center Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Project. The HDU project is a "technology-pull" project that integrates technologies and innovations from numerous NASA centers. This project will be used to investigate and validate surface architectures, operations concepts, and requirements definition of various habitation concepts. The first habitation configuration this project will build and test is the Pressurized Excursion Module (PEM). This habitat configuration - the PEM - is based on the Constellation Architecture Scenario 12. 1 concept of a vertically oriented habitat module. The HDU project will be tested as part of the 2010 Desert Research and Technologies Simulations (D-RATS) test objectives. The purpose of this project is to develop, integrate, test, and evaluate a habitat configuration {{in the context of the}} mission architectures and surface operation concepts. A multi-center approach will be leveraged to build, integrate, and test the PEM through a shared collaborative effort of multiple NASA centers. The HDU project is part of the strategic plan from the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) Directorate Integration Office (DIO) and the Lunar Surface Systems Project Office (LSSPO) to test surface elements in a surface analog environment. The 2010 analog field test will include two Lunar Electric Rovers (LER) and the PEM among other surface <b>demonstration</b> <b>elements.</b> This paper will describe the overall objectives, its various habitat configurations, strategic plan, and technology integration as it pertains to the 2010 and 2011 field analog tests. To accomplish the development of the PEM from conception in June 2009 to rollout for operations in July 2010, the HDU project team is using a set of design standards to define the interfaces between the various systems of PEM and to the payloads, such as the Geology Lab, that those systems will support.

40|$|Context and Background: Nursing {{students}} are taught many skills {{to prepare them for}} their practical experience in the clinical environment. To date these skills have been taught to students using a demonstration and practice technique. This teaching method has a number of disadvantages: -	it is highly resource intensive -	learning experiences vary depending on the mix of demonstration and practice in each session -	it can be difficult for students to absorb all of the information presented in a single demonstration. It was decided that video technology incorporating the deployment of a skills video bank over a web server, in conjunction with a shift in emphasis in the teaching contact sessions could provide a useful tool to aid the teaching process. Aim of the paper The aim of the paper is to disseminate our experiences of producing a large scale audiovisual learning package. The Production Process The first step involved the production of a video demonstrating a particular clinical skill, aseptic technique. This replaced the <b>demonstration</b> <b>element</b> of the skills session. Students viewed it online before the skills session and then spent the time allotted to this skill practising it under supervision. It was evaluated positively by students and the lecturer involved. As a result, a bank of 17 more videos focussing on fundamental skills within one first year module was developed in-house. The main focus of this paper will be on the production processes involved in this and its introduction into teaching practice. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} quantum error-correction {{codes for}} multimode bosonic systems, such as optical fields, that {{are affected by}} amplitude damping. Such a process is a generalization of an erasure channel. We demonstrate that the most accessible method of transforming optical systems {{with the help of}} passive linear networks has limited usefulness in preparing and manipulating such codes. These limitations stem directly from the recoverability condition for one-photon loss. We introduce a three-photon code protecting against the first order of amplitude damping, i. e. a single photon loss, and discuss its preparation using linear optics with single-photon sources and conditional detection. Quantum state and process tomography in the code subspace can be implemented using passive linear optics and photon counting. An experimental proof-of-principle <b>demonstration</b> of <b>elements</b> of the proposed quantum error correction scheme for a one-photon erasure lies well within present technological capabilites...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of tyrosine-phospborylated proteins was studied in cultured rat pancreatic islets. Immunoblotting performed with total extracts of islets cultured in the {{presence of}} 1. 8 or 5. 6 mM glucose revealed at least three distinct tyrosinephos-phosphorylated bands (25 kDa, 95 kDa and 165 – 185 kDa). After 12 h incubation in medium containing 1. 8 mM glucose, a pulse exposition to 11 or 22 mM glucose or to 10 − 7 M insulin led to a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of all three bands, with no appearance of novel bands. Immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies demonstrated that the signal detected at 95 kDa corresponds to the β subunit of the insulin receptor (IR) while the band at 165 – 185 kDa corresponds to the early substrates of the insulin receptor, IRS- 1 and IRS- 2. Immunoprecipitation with IRS- 1 or IRS- 2 antisera detected their association with the lipid metabolizing enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase).
