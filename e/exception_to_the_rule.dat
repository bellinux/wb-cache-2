5|$|References to interpreters {{indicate}} the continuing use of local languages other than Greek and Latin, particularly in Egypt, where Coptic predominated, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show {{a concern for}} local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding and application of laws and oaths. In the province of Africa, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions and for legends on coins {{during the time of}} Tiberius (1st century AD). Libyco-Berber and Punic inscriptions appear on public buildings into the 2nd century, some bilingual with Latin. In Syria, Palmyrene soldiers even used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, in a striking <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that Latin was the language of the military.|$|E

5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> that cardinals – members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E

25|$|There was no fixed {{process for}} papal {{selection}} before 1059.

While the process was often characterized by some capacity of election, an election with the meaningful participation of the laity was the <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> especially as the popes' claims to temporal power solidified into the Papal States. The practice of papal appointment during this period would later give rise to the jus exclusivae, a veto right exercised by Catholic monarchies into the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of necessity is an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> against bias and operates to prevent a failure of justice. According to Anwar Siraj v. Tang I Fang (1982), necessity is the greatest single common law exception to the general rule that an adjudicator {{who appears to be}} biased or prejudiced must disqualify himself from participating in a proceeding. This rule is firmly established and is to the effect that disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act. The rule applies regardless of whether the disqualification arguably arises from the combination of prosecutorial and judicial functions, pecuniary interest, personal hostility or bias.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, changes {{were taking place}} at the BBC. With the {{introduction}} of their new logo of square boxes with slanted letters {{a number of things}} changed. Firstly the clock design was changed c.1958 to two circles, one inside the other, containing the clock and the new logo. The large second hand was retained, reaching the larger of the two circles. The clock element itself was made larger and more consipcous. This was changed again on 8 October 1960 to a digital clock, featuring the BBC logo above a line, with the 'TV' box and time below. Having a digital clock was very unusual in television as nearly all station clocks were analogue; the only notable <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> was ATV's clock.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{commencement}} of the tournament, each team names a squad of 15 players. All players must be contracted by the team for their domestic tournament. Mirroring the IPL rule, each team can field a maximum of four international players. Most of the other tournaments have a lower limit on both contracted international players and how many can play in their matches. In 2011, an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> was made for the Mumbai Indians who, due to players being unavailable, had a squad of seven Indian players {{and would have been}} unable to put together a playing team of eleven players should another be injured. They were allowed to field five international players. That year, Mumbai won the CLT20.|$|E
