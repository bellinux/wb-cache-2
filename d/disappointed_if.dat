To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the Aurora borealis and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E

This player will immediately be given another (free) ball to compensate.

500|$|The entire game, {{including}} {{the tools and}} libraries, was written from scratch. A trial and error approach was taken: the team learned by trying something and changing what did not work. They avoided using control panels, icons and buttons for casting miracles, preferring a gesture system. Molyneux commented {{that he would have}} been very <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> the system was dumped, but in the end, they got the feature working [...] "beautifully". Integrating the storyline was found to draw the player through the game in an unexpected manner, which {{led to the development of}} characters like Sable, the Creature trainer, and the advisers. A great deal of effort was devoted to getting features such as the weather import working.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage {{were in the}} style of Watershed. After hearing the songs for the first time, Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> the album {{continued}} in that direction. Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album, Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style. In the press release for Heritage, Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old. In a review for Allmusic, Thom Jurek called Heritage the band's most adventurous album, describing the songs as [...] "drenched in instrumental interludes, knotty key and chord changes, shifting time signatures, clean vocals, and a keyboard-heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons, Rhodes pianos, and Hammond organs".|$|E
500|$|During a July {{press conference}} in Spokane, Washington, while {{lobbying}} for ballot access, Paul promised that as president he would veto spending increases for both domestic programs and the military.

[...] Paul conceded that he would not win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state. A few weeks later, The New York Times discovered that many former members of the Pat Robertson campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in Michigan that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would [...] "carry the standard" [...] of the free market. Paul commented in a San Diego Union interview that he [...] "identifwith Robertson" [...] although [...] "he's not a libertarian."

500|$|Sam Wollaston for The Guardian said he {{was missing}} the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, {{and that the only}} fun in the drama was [...] "recognising the nods, working out who's who and how it all fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jim Shelley didn't find the storyline [...] "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's {{performance}} as Freddie [...] "laughable" [...] and saying it was [...] "bizarre" [...] that the storyline [...] "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him". In The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe said that [...] "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite {{a lot of the time}} you were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you". Benji Wilson from The Daily Telegraph also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> they [...] "tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between", and that it was an [...] "ocean-going stinker".|$|E
500|$|They {{believed}} in empowering children by {{practices such as}} greeting their audience members with [...] "Hello, everyone", instead of [...] "Hello, boys and girls" [...] because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting [...] "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to [...] "Wake Up Jeff" [...] when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was [...] "very much {{in keeping with the}} way they work with children". [...] Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. [...] Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that [...] "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". [...] Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt [...] "great excitement" [...] and were <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. [...] Anthony Field, who called it [...] "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done {{since the start of the}} group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. [...] The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because [...] "it was a perfect fit". [...] When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or as exciting as the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E

500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it.

He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally, and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the [...] "national interest".

2500|$|Lunafreya's {{place in}} XV was {{originally}} {{held by the}} similarly-named , the main female protagonist of Versus XIII. The relationship between Stella and Noctis was originally designed to be platonic rather than romantic, as Nomura felt a preference towards portraying {{a different kind of}} relationship between male and female protagonists. He also wanted to make her the first female character to [...] "stand out from all previous [...] ". A key scene for Stella was the meeting and conversation with Noctis during the game's opening. While Nomura deliberately designed her against his usual tastes, he grew fond of her design over the years. Stella's design underwent alterations between 2011 and 2013, mainly to make her more beautiful. She was intended to be a very polite person, with that politeness conveyed through specific dialogue traits in her speech. During the transition from Versus XIII to XV, the developers envisioned a different type of heroine which did not fit with Stella's original role, but Stella was already known to and expected by fans who had followed the game's development. Stella was initially redesigned to play {{a more active role in}} the story, but Tabata was uncomfortable about this. Faced with the scenario of fans being <b>disappointed</b> <b>if</b> Stella's personality or role were changed, the developers instead opted to replace her entirely.|$|E

Based on this fact, the work of Aeron and Saligrama [8] and Özgür et al. [9] proposes schemes employing cooperative multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) techniques as their main strategy. In such schemes each source node cooperates with the nearby nodes to form a virtual MIMO transmitter. In addition, local nodes at the receive side form a virtual MIMO receiver. Upon transmission of the MIMO signal, the received signals at the receive nodes should become quantized. After quantization and further cooperation, the data are sent to and decoded at the destination node.|$|R
