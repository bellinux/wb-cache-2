500|$|The {{gameplay}} of God of War: Ghost of Sparta {{resembles that}} of the previous installments. It is a third-person single player video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in hack and slash combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including minotaurs, cyclopes, harpies, Gorgons, and satyrs. The undead legionnaires, keres wraiths, <b>geryons,</b> automatons, Boreas beasts, and Triton warriors were influenced by the mythology, but created specifically for the game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player {{can use it to}} access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door. The game features new weapons, magical powers, and navigational abilities not present in previous games and has been cited as featuring 25 percent more gameplay than [...]|$|E

[...] To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. [...] Ill worthie I such title should belong [...] To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind [...] A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach [...] Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: [...] But infinite in pardon was my Judge, [...] That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't [...] The sourse of life; next favourable thou, [...] Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, [...] 170 [...] Farr other name deserving. But the Field [...] To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, [...] Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, [...] All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins [...] Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, [...] I never from thy side henceforth to stray, [...] Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind [...] Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, [...] What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? [...] Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. [...] 180 [...] So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate [...] Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest [...] On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd [...] After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight [...] The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, [...] Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: [...] Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, [...] First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, [...] Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; [...] Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. [...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. [...] He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands [...] Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now [...] In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, [...] 210 [...] A glorious Apparition, had not doubt [...] And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. [...] Not that more glorious, when the Angels met [...] Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw [...] The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; [...] Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd [...] In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, [...] Against the Syrian King, who to surprize [...] One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, [...] Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch [...] 220 [...] In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise [...] Possession of the Garden; hee alone, [...] To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, [...] Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, [...] While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. [...] Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps [...] Of us will soon determin, or impose [...] New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie [...] From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill [...] One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate [...] 230 [...] None of the meanest, some great Potentate [...] Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie [...] Invests him coming; yet not terrible, [...] That I should fear, nor sociably mild, [...] As Raphael, that I should much confide, [...] But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, [...] With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. [...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile. [...] Adam by this from the cold sudden damp [...] Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, [...] To Michael thus his humble words addressd. [...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his absolute Decree [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie <b>Geryons</b> Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?

[...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.

[...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.

50|$|The {{gameplay}} of God of War: Ghost of Sparta {{resembles that}} of the previous installments. It is a third-person single player video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in hack and slash combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including minotaurs, cyclopes, harpies, Gorgons, and satyrs. The undead legionnaires, keres wraiths, <b>geryons,</b> automatons, Boreas beasts, and Triton warriors were influenced by the mythology, but created specifically for the game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player {{can use it to}} access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door. The game features new weapons, magical powers, and navigational abilities not present in previous games and has been cited as featuring 25 percent more gameplay than God of War: Chains of Olympus.|$|E
