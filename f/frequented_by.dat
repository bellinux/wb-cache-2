5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat {{and black}} rat (Rattus rattus). Superb fairywrens may utilise a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas <b>frequented</b> <b>by</b> noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala) recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not <b>frequented</b> <b>by</b> noisy miners {{did not respond to}} miner alarm calls. This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species' vocalisations.|$|E

40|$|Ethnographic {{reports on}} a world sample of {{societies}} were used for rating frequency of participation by children in adult activities and degree of permissive treatment of children. Although {{the correlation between the}} two measures of childhood is close to zero, <b>frequent</b> participation <b>by</b> children in adult activities has different meanings depending on whether children are treated permissively or puni-tively. In societies where permissiveness is low, <b>frequent</b> participa-tion <b>by</b> children is correlated with several measures of low cultural complexity, indicating greater need for child labor. In societies where permissiveness is high, <b>frequent</b> participation <b>by</b> children is correlated with absence of an initiation ceremony for adolescent girls and with a compact rather than dispersed settlement, indicat-ing more opportunities for children to be granted adult privileges. <b>Frequent</b> participation <b>by</b> children in adult activities also has different meanings depending on whether the community is inde-pendent or subordinate to a government. <b>Frequent</b> participation <b>by</b> children in adult activities has several advantages. Children can contribute needed labor. Family cohe-sion may be strengthened by participation of children. Children usually desire adult privileges, such as sharing enjoyable experi-ences with adults and staying up late at night...|$|R
