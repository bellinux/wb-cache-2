5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, {{there is always}} a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, {{despite his}} success so far, Harun's {{position}} was precarious, as {{the defeat of}} al-Rabi threatened his lines of communication with the Caliphate. Consequently, after plundering the Byzantine capital's Asian suburbs, Harun turned his army back, but during his march along {{the valley of the}} Sangarius River, east of Nicaea, he was surrounded by the forces of the tagmata under Anthony in his rear and of the Bucellarians under their general Tatzates to his front. Fortunately for him, at this point Tatzates, an Armenian prince who had defected from his Arab-ruled homeland to the Byzantines in 760 and was closely associated with the iconoclast regime of Constantine V, secretly made contact with him. Tatzates offered to aid Harun in exchange for a pardon and a safe return for himself and his family to his native Armenia. Theophanes explains Tatzates's actions with his hostility towards Irene's favourite, Staurakios, but this evidently masks a broader dissatisfaction with Irene's regime.

To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot handheld. Saw 3D was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He {{said in an interview with}} Popular Mechanics that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, [...] "If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space.

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of technology and its cheapness, robotic vehicles have gained {{a large number of}} applications. The spread of their use is growing also because they are getting smaller, lighter and easier to build. In this paper we present a simple and effective way to map a road network {{with the help of a}} driverless vehicle. Our approach consists of only three parts: vision-segmentation, angle variation and travelled distance. A video camera attached to a Lego® NXT Mindstorm vehicle guides it by image segmentation using Matlab® Image processing toolbox, along a road network, in which is represented by black tape over a white floor. The algorithm makes the vehicle travel all over the road memorizing main coordinates to identify all crossroads by keeping track of the travelled distance and the current angle. The crossroads and road’s end are the nodes of the graph. After several simulations have been performed, the modelling proved to be successful in that small scale approach. Consequently, there are <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> driverless cars and UAVs also make use of the strategies to map route networks accordingly.
