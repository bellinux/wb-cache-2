5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably <b>incapable</b> of functioning comfortably in a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been <b>incapable</b> of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|Infantes (young children) and furiosi ("lunatics") were {{considered}} <b>incapable</b> of formulating the necessary intention and could therefore not commit furtum.|$|E
5|$|McCain was a {{prisoner}} of war in North Vietnam for {{five and a half years}} until his release on March 14, 1973. His wartime injuries left him permanently <b>incapable</b> of raising his arms above his head.|$|E
5|$|Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it {{gradually}} renders people <b>incapable</b> of tending {{for their own}} needs, caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be carefully managed {{over the course of}} the disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Kelgian species, Naydrad looks like a giant caterpillar. Since the {{involuntary}} movements of Kelgians' fur completely show their emotions, the species is <b>incapable</b> of both lying and tact. Naydrad is a specialist in rescuing victims of space accidents.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th-century folklore, {{the laws}} of {{aerodynamics}} prove the bumblebee should be <b>incapable</b> of flight, as {{it does not have}} the capacity (in terms of wing size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary.|$|E
5|$|Alex is a {{young man}} who is {{depressed}} after his fiancée breaks up with him. Tired of seeing him unhappy, Alex's grandmother sends him Ada, a Tanaka X-5 android which is capable of intelligent human interaction. The robot is initially <b>incapable</b> of self-awareness, as each android has a program that blocks any potential free thought or consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Although the vastly outnumbered Confederates had inflicted {{casualties}} and slowed the Union advance on Saltville, they were <b>incapable</b> of halting it. Finding their own path to Saltville's defenses blocked, Breckinridge {{and his men}} retreated further south, while a Union company advanced. Saltville fell to a night attack on December 2021 and the salt works were destroyed by the Union forces.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{research}} {{is the ability of}} starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The stem cells of adult humans are <b>incapable</b> of much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.|$|E
5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was <b>incapable</b> of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were <b>incapable</b> of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{courage and}} obstinacy {{with which the}} Americans fought were the astonishment of everyone, and we now became fully {{convinced}} {{that they are not}} that contemptible enemy we had hitherto imagined them, <b>incapable</b> of standing a regular engagement and that they would only fight behind strong and powerful works.|$|E
5|$|The flood {{dislodged}} {{thousands of}} peasant farmers, {{many of whom}} joined roving bandit and rebel {{groups such as the}} Red Eyebrows to survive. Wang Mang's armies were <b>incapable</b> of quelling these enlarged rebel groups. Eventually, an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang.|$|E
5|$|There are spiders with {{a reduced}} number of eyes, of these those with six-eyes {{are the most}} {{numerous}} and are missing a pair of eyes on the anterior median line, others species have four-eyes and some just two. Cave dwelling species have no eyes, or possess vestigial eyes <b>incapable</b> of sight.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter <b>incapable</b> of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be <b>incapable</b> of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were <b>incapable</b> of defending the empire effectively.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and <b>incapable</b> of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} Las Casas's defense by offense, he had {{to argue}} against Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. Sepúlveda was a doctor of {{theology}} and law who, in his book Democrates Alter, sive de justis causis apud Indos (Another Democrates /or A New Democrates, or on the Just Causes of War against the Indians) had argued that some native peoples were <b>incapable</b> of ruling themselves and should be pacified forcefully. The book was deemed unsound for publication by the theologians of Salamanca and Alcalá for containing unsound doctrine, but the pro-encomendero faction seized on Sepúlveda as their intellectual champion.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first to order the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was <b>incapable</b> of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him <b>incapable</b> of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E
5|$|Canopus was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean in early 1915 for the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the British and French fleets proved <b>incapable</b> of forcing the straits. After the Gallipoli Campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, Canopus patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, but saw no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. After the war, the ship was broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Carmela, whose {{relationship}} with Tony is tense due to financial worries and Tony's infidelities, develops a mutual infatuation with Furio Giunta. Furio, <b>incapable</b> of breaking his own moral codes {{and that of}} the Neapolitan mafia, clandestinely returns home to Italy. After Tony's former mistress calls their home, Carmela throws Tony out. Tony is approached by Johnny Sack with a proposal to murder Carmine, which Tony turns down.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Alongside the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, {{each with its own}} personality and methods, although they are genetically <b>incapable</b> of disobeying the Overmind. Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose control of its respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the test programme, Senior Prom was {{cancelled}} in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it <b>incapable</b> of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B-1 bomber; the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, had a more slender airframe with retractable wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly {{after the end of the}} Senior Prom programme.|$|E
5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though <b>incapable</b> of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E
5|$|Gulf {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of various projects in the late 1960s intended to adjust the world oil industry to developments of the time including closure of the Suez Canal after the 1967 war. In particular, Gulf undertook the construction of deep water terminals at Bantry Bay in Ireland and Okinawa in Japan capable of handling Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) vessels serving the European and Asian markets respectively. In 1968, the Universe Ireland was added to Gulf's tanker fleet. At , this was the largest vessel in the world and <b>incapable</b> of berthing at most normal ports.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Chicago {{metropolitan}} area and was raised there until the age of 13, at which point he moved to live with an uncle in North Carolina so that he could live a better life. He attended four different high schools, but eventually became one of the top ten high school basketball prospects in the class of 2011. He played for USA Basketball in the 2010 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Early in his senior year, he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rendering him <b>incapable</b> of playing the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard was <b>incapable</b> {{of creating the}} score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, added some melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.|$|E
5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} is <b>incapable</b> {{of interpreting}} the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, Prime7 {{transferred}} its playout {{facilities to}} MediaHub Australia {{located within the}} Sydney suburb of Ingleburn. The facility is {{a joint venture between}} public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation and rival regional network WIN Television. Network officials noted that its existing Canberra facilities cannot be upgraded with technological advancements, causing Prime7 to be <b>incapable</b> of relaunching its HD simulcast as well as introducing 7flix to its viewers.|$|E
5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent {{spoofing}} himself, whether it was the affected nervousness of the treasurer in The Treasurer's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the <b>incapable</b> sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of species with two {{permanent}} sexes, including {{but not limited to}} Earth-humans, the stories state that females are psychologically <b>incapable</b> of allowing their psyches to be violated to the extent required by the educator tapes. However, in one of the later books a very assertive non-human female character accidentally acquires several sets of memories which cannot be erased, and adjusts to this with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently <b>incapable</b> of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Keltset Mallicos, Panamon's mute companion. He is mute as {{a result}} of the Warlock Lord. He was able to save Panamon and Shea after they were {{captured}} by Trolls because he had been awarded the Black Irix, the highest honor any Troll can receive, and therefore is considered <b>incapable</b> of treachery. The Trolls then helped them get to Skull Mountain so that Shea could confront the Warlock Lord.|$|E
5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were <b>incapable</b> of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips {{published}} The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God in 2004, {{presenting a}} challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are <b>incapable</b> of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence. With reference to the suffering of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.|$|E
