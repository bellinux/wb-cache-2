40|$|Objective To assess {{food and}} {{nutrient}} intakes and compliance with nutritional recommendations in pregnant women according to selected sociodemographic characteristics. Design Cross-sectional study {{based on data}} from the INMA-Valencia cohort (Spain), which recruited pregnant women between 2004 and 2005. Information on maternal sociodemographics and anthropometry was collected. Dietary intake was assessed through an FFQ. <b>Intakes</b> <b>of</b> foods were compared with Spanish food-based dietary guidelines. Intake inadequacy for nutrients was assessed using the Dietary Reference <b>Intakes</b> <b>of</b> the US Institute of Medicine. Setting Valencia, Spain. Subjects We studied 822 pregnant women who had information on dietary intake during their first trimester of pregnancy. Results More than 50 % of pregnant women did not meet the guidelines for cereals and legumes; reported <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> carbohydrates, n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids were below recommendations and exceeded the total fat intake according to dietary references. Dietary inadequacy for folate, Fe and vitamin E ranged from 99 % to 68 %. Vegetable intake was related to age only. Younger and less educated women showed lower <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> protein and n- 3 fatty acids and higher <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> trans-fatty acids as well as greater inadequacy for micronutrients. Spanish women reported lower <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> fruit and carbohydrates and higher <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> protein, total fat, SFA, MUFA and n- 3 fatty acids compared with their foreign-born counterparts. Conclusions Women in the studied area have inadequate <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> several nutrients relevant during pregnancy. Age, education and country of origin are factors significantly related to dietary intake and adequacy...|$|R

40|$|This study investigated, in on-reserve First Nations (FN) {{youth in}} Ontario, Canada, the following: (a) the <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> {{vegetable}} and fruit, “other” foods and relevant nutrients {{as compared to}} current recommendations and national averages, (b) current prevalence rates of overweight and obesity and (c) the relationship between latitude and dietary intakes. Twenty-four-hour diet recalls were collected via the Waterloo Web-Based Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (WEB-Q) (n = 443). Heights and weights of participants were self reported using measured values and Body Mass Index was categorized using the International Obesity Task Force cutoffs. Food group and nutrient intakes were compared to current standards, Southern Ontario Food Behaviour data and the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2. 2, using descriptive statistics. Mean vegetable and fruit, fibre and folate intakes were less than current recommendations. Girls aged 14 – 18 years had mean <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vitamin A below current recommendations for this sub-group; for all sub-groups, mean <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vegetables and fruit were below Canadian averages. All sub-groups also had <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> all nutrients and food groups investigated that were less than those observed in non-FN youth from Southern Ontario, {{with the exception of}} “other” foods in boys 12 – 18 years. Prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were 31. 8 % and 19. 6 %, respectively, exceeding rates in the general population. Dietary intakes did not vary consistently by latitude (n = 248), as revealed by ANOVA. This study provided a unique investigation <b>of</b> the dietary <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> on-reserve FN youth in Ontario and revealed poor <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vegetables and fruit and related nutrients and high <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> “other” foods.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to establishing an upper or prescriptive level <b>of</b> recommended <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> nutrients was devised for use in Britain. It was based on present food supplies in the UK, and the following measures were proposed to improve the national diet: moderate reductions in <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> fat, sugar, meat, and alcohol; increased <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> cereals, potatoes, and other vegetables and fruit; while <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> milk and eggs and fish, pulses, and nuts were to remain unchanged. The proportions of food energy derived from protein would be increased, despite reduced meat consumption. Nutrient content of the diet may be {{expressed in terms of}} food groups or as nutrient concentrations per energy unit, which is particularly applicable to planning or prescribing diets for individuals or small groups. The suggested changes in the national diet are large enough to be meaningful, yet would not disrupt agricultural or trade policies if implemented over the next decade. Furthermore, the methods used to assess the recommended <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> nutrients are flexible enough to be used both for planning and prescribing diets and for evaluating results of dietary surveys or histories...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Associations between smoking habit, social class, {{body mass}} index, and diet were {{examined}} in 493 men aged 45 to 59 yr, selected {{from the general population}} and who had completed a 7 -day weighed dietary record. Smokers were lighter than nonsmokers and had a lower body mass index. There was no difference in energy intake, but in general, smokers had lower <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Exsmokers had similar intakes to non-smokers. Manual workers tended to be shorter, had a higher body mass index, higher <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> energy and carbohydrates, and lower <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vitamins and minerals than nonmanual workers. Social class had a greater effect than smoking habit on <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> energy and carbohydrates, whereas smoking habit had the greater effect on <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> minerals and vitamins.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Human NutritionValentina M. RemigThe {{frequency}} of dietary supplement use {{has increased in}} recent years, especially among older adults. National studies estimated 60 - 65 % of older adults were using at least one dietary supplement, typically a multi-vitamin, multi-mineral (MVMM) supplement. Dietary supplement use {{has been reported to}} improve the micronutrient <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> older adults. The current research study focused on the use of dietary supplements, dietary <b>intakes,</b> and impact <b>of</b> vitamin/mineral (VM) supplements on the nutrient <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> older Kansans. Volunteer subjects, 60 + years of age, were recruited from 35 senior centers across Kansas. Subjects completed a questionnaire asking for demographic information, current health status, and dietary supplement use. Dietary supplement use was verified for 319 subjects. Two subsequent 24 -hour diet recalls were completed by 312 subjects. The sample population was primarily white, non-Hispanic females. Nearly 86 % of participants used at least one dietary supplement; most commonly MVMM, calcium, vitamin D, and fish oil. Dietary intake analyses compared <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> dietary supplement (DS) users to non-dietary supplement (NDS) users. DS subjects consumed significantly higher dietary <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> carbohydrate, fiber, vitamin A, and zinc than NDS subjects. The NDS group consumed undesirably higher <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> total fat, saturated fat, and sodium. These results support previous findings that DS users consume healthier diets. The impact of VM supplement use on micronutrient intake compared only the <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> subjects using VM supplements (n= 263) to the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). Subjects were most likely to have inadequate dietary <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D, calcium, vitamin E, and magnesium. All micronutrient intakes were improved with the inclusion of VM supplements; most improved were vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin D, vitamin B 6, and calcium. Despite supplementation, nearly half of subjects still exhibited low <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium. Supplementation did not consistently exceed the Tolerable Upper Limit established by the DRIs for most nutrients. In conclusion, dietary supplement use was very common in the sample population, DS subjects had generally healthier diets, and VM supplement use improved micronutrient intake without contributing to concern for toxicity...|$|R
25|$|Some {{forms of}} copper are not soluble in stomach acids and cannot be absorbed from the stomach or small intestine. Also, some foods may contain indigestible fiber that binds with copper. High <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> zinc can {{significantly}} decrease copper absorption. Extreme <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> Vitamin C or iron can also affect copper absorption, reminding {{us of the}} fact that micronutrients need to be consumed as a balanced mixture. This is one reason why extreme <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> any one single micronutrient are not advised. Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground: The only {{therapy for}} coeliac disease (CD) is a {{long-term}} gluten-free diet (GFD). Little {{is known about the}} detailed composition of such a diet. Aim: To clarify the nutritional composition of a GFD and to compare it to a non-GFD diet in representative non-CD populations. Methods: 139 consecutive patients with CD were invited to fill in a prospective validated 5 -day food diary, of which data from 93 were analysed. Results were compared with data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of Adults and the UK Women's Cohort Study. Results: Individuals consuming a strict GFD generally had similar <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> energy and nutrients to the comparison populations, but a higher proportion <b>of</b> carbohydrate <b>intake</b> was obtained from non-milk extrinsic sugars and <b>intakes</b> <b>of</b> non-starch polysaccharides were low.
