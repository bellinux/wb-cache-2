40|$|Measuring {{the level}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> emitted by {{electronic}} devices {{is an important part}} of the process of production and development of these devices. Today, these measurements are performed by specialized laboratories that are equipped with an anechoic or semi-anechoic chamber. For manufacturers of electronic devices, it would be beneficial if a Gigahertz Transversal Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell would be possible to use for measurements of emitted <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference.</b> A GTEM cell may be purchased at a fraction of price of an anechoic or semi-anechoic chamber, so manufacturers would be able to perform these measurements themselves during the development of the device.

The wearing comfort of conductive textiles is poor due to the chemical nature of synthetic fibres and coatings usually used in their production.
