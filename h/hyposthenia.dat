5000|$|The {{nature of}} Schelling's {{influence}} in German culture was such as to further promote the Brunonian system, as presented by Röschlaub. [...] "It was Röschlaub's explanation which made Brown's principle {{life as a}} 'forced state' acceptable" [...] to the German mind which had a more dynamic conception of life. Röschlaub helped {{to bring out the}} dynamic interplay between the outer stimulant ('excitant') and the inner life potential (excitability) resulting in the activity known as life (biological excitation). The organism possesses an intrinsic receptive activity to be acted upon but also a proactive ability to respond. Röschlaub also refined Brown's idea that disorders resulted from an excess (hypersthenia) or deficit (<b>hyposthenia)</b> of stimuli by adding that this involved a disporoportion between the receptive and pro-active sides of excitability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{a case of}} laxative-induced rhabdomyolysis in an elderly patient. An 87 -year-old woman was hospitalized for the onset of confusion, tremors, an inability to walk, and a fever {{that she had been}} experiencing for 36 hours. She often took high dosages of lactulose and sorbitol syrup as a laxative (about 70 g/day). During her physical examination, the patient was confused, drowsy, and she presented <b>hyposthenia</b> in her upper and lower limbs, symmetric and diffuse moderate hyporeflexia, and her temperature was 37. 8 °C. Laboratory tests revealed severe hyponatremia with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis. Moreover, rhabdomyolysis markers were found. The correction of hydroelectrolytic imbalances with saline, potassium and sodium chlorure, calcium gluconate was the first treat-ment.

40|$|The {{presence}} of small areas of ossification in the Achilles tendon {{is a relatively}} frequent finding. It is instead rare to find large, extensive ossifications {{for more than half}} of the tendon. The authors describe a case of a man aged 45 years who, in the wake of an unknown lesion of the Achilles tendon, developed clinically symptomatic ossification 9. 5 cm in length and 2. 3 cm in width. The patient was treated surgically by removal of the ossified portion and repair of the diastasis with a proximal Achilles flap. After 17 months, the patient is asymptomatic, there are no disorders in walking, and he exclusively shows moderate limitation in range of movement of the ankle joint associated with tricipital <b>hyposthenia.</b> Bone metaplasia of the Achilles tendon is a rare event, that can follow trauma or surgery. The size of the area to be removed implies considerable difficulty in repair of the continuity and in recovery of the length of the tendon...|$|E
40|$|A case of ganglioneurocytoma of {{the spinal}} cord in a 51 -year-old man is reported. Patient {{presented}} with a progressively worsening back pain and <b>hyposthenia</b> of lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of {{the spinal cord}} revealed an intradural lesion in the T 10 – 11 spinal segments, hyperintense on T 1 -weighted sequences. Complete resection was achieved. The patient did not show evidence of recurrence 12  months after surgery. On histology, the lesion was composed of round to oval cells with fine granular, slightly eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm suggesting a neurocytic differentiation. Some ganglion cells were observed. Neither significant cytologic atypia nor mitoses were present. The neoplastic cells were strongly positive with synaptophysin and negative with glial fibrillary acid protein. Neurocytomas are uncommon tumors typically arising within the lateral ventricles near the foramen of Monro. Extraventricular neurocytomas have been reported at various sites with rare examples in spinal cord. In the present paper, a case of ganglioneurocytoma of the spinal cord is reported with review of literature and discussion of differences compared to neurocytomas of other sites...|$|E
40|$|We report adhalin {{deficiency}} in 8 patients with clinically diagnosed muscular dystrophy, dystrophic histopathological features, high plasma creatine kinase levels, normal expression of dystrophin, and marked variability of symptoms. Although {{the distribution of}} <b>hyposthenia</b> was similar in all 8 patients and predominantly involved muscles in the pelvic girdle, age at onset and rate of disease progression were highly variable: In 2 patients onset, at ages 24 and 25, was later than has been previously observed. We found no apparent relation between disease severity and the quantity of adhalin expressed. Two kinds of myopathy with adhalin deficiency have been reported: one caused by a mutation in the adhalin gene on chromosome 17 (primary adhalinopathy) and the other l i e d to chromosome 13. The product of the gene on chromosome 13 is probably associated with adhalin and its deficiency results in secondary adhalinopathy. The severity of clinical phenotypes in these adhalinopathies seems to relate more to the kind and site of the mutations than to the residual amount of the protein. We also detected a variable reduction in the laminin pl subunit by immuno-histochemistry in most patients, confirming that this is commonly associated with adhalin dekciency...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{white and}} grey matter disease of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). It is recognized that cortical damage (i. e. focal lesions and atrophy) plays a role in determining the accumulation of physical and cognitive disability that is observed in patients with progressive MS. To date, an association of cortical lesions with clinical relapses has not been described. RESULTS: We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of five relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who had clinical relapses characterized by the acute appearance of cortical symptoms, due to the development of large, snake-like, cortical inflammatory lesions. Symptoms were: acute Wernicke's aphasia mimicking stroke; agraphia with acalculia, not associated to a motor deficit nor linguistic disturbance; <b>hyposthenia</b> of the left arm, followed by muscle twitching of the hand, spreading to arm and face; acute onset of left lower limb paroxysmal hypertonia; and temporal lobe status epilepticus, with psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical relapses may occur in MS. MRI examination in MS should include sequences, such as double inversion recovery (DIR) or phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR), that are aimed at visualizing cortical lesions, especially in the presence of symptoms of cortical dysfunction. Our observation further stresses and extends the clinical relevance of cortical pathology in MS...|$|E

40|$|A 31 -year-old woman {{presented}} with blood pressuresomewhat {{lower on the}} left compared with the right arm, <b>hyposthenia,</b> and left arm claudication. A vascular ultrasound examination demonstrated the absence of internal left carotid associated with left subclavian artery stenosis. A multidetector computed tomography using a 64 -row scan-ner (Figure 1) confirmed the echographic results and revealed {{the presence of an}} aneurysm of origin of the subclavian artery (Kommerell diverticulum) in right aortic arch. The patient underwent hybrid percutaneous emboli-zation treatment of the diverticulum and surgical reimplan-tation of the subclavian artery on the common carotid artery (Figure 2). Internal left carotid agenesis is extremely rare. Most patients are asymptomatic because there is a sufficient cerebral circulation supplied by anastomosis in the circle of Willis and intracavernous and external carotid artery anastomosis. Kommerell diverticulum is a congenital ab-normality of the aortic arch that is present in up to 60 % of patients with an aberrant subclavian artery. 1 Aberrant right subclavian artery occurs in 0. 5 % to 1. 0 % of the popula-tion, whereas aberrant left subclavian artery arising from a right aortic arch is extremely rare (0. 05 % to 0. 1 % of the population). 2 The aneurysmal diverticulum, in most cases, passes through the retroesophageal space, causing dyspha-gia, dyspnea, stridor wheezing, cough, recurrent pneumo-nia, obstructive emphysema, or chest pain by structure compression. 2,...|$|E

All 526 male workers (316 as exposed group : 132 aged 20 - 35 years, 184 aged &gt; 35 years; 210 as Non-exposed group: 89 aged 20 - 35 years, 121 aged &gt; 35 years) performing tasks exposed / not exposed to risk factors for WMSDS of the upper limbs underwent a clinical examinations as well as completing standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaires. The anamnestic cases were defined on the basis of pain, paraesthesia, <b>hyposthenia,</b> and vegetative disorders during previous months. Mean age of exposed and non- exposed groups were obtained 36. 3 years (SD= 5. 9) and 37. 9 years (SD = 7. 3) respectively. There were distinguished differences in occurrences of WMSDS of upper limbs between two mentioned groups. The major occurrence was found for the right and left hands. Nocturnal and diurnal paraesthesia obtained an occurrence of about 54 % and 53 % respectively. Data bears witness to the greater occurrence of affected individuals in exposed group, with a non- exposed / exposed ratio of 1 : 7. 2. The greater occurrences of affected individuals in exposed group (P = 0. 006) and in subjects&gt; 35 years (P = 0. 002) were significant. Structural, organizational and educational measures can be applied to prevent WMSDS or diminish the relative effects to acceptable limit...|$|E

During FTM treatment, the most frequent, but reversible toxic effect was hematological grade 2 anemia and thrombocytopenia but no other grade > 2 toxicity was recorded, so there was no reduction or delay in treatment. Presently, after 8 years of follow-up, the patient is in excellent health and has no evidence of intracranial disease recurrence. In light of this case, post-surgical FTM treatment seems to represent an interesting well-tolerated treatment possibility in patients with recurrent malignant GBM of the brain, given that there are very few reports of such a remission in the literature. </p...|$|E
