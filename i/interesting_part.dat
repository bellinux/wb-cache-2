The development, emergence and clarification of {{the foundations}} can come late in the history of a field, and may not be viewed by everyone as its most <b>interesting</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E

25|$|After 1686, the Baroque {{architecture}} {{designated the}} dominant style {{of art in}} catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century. There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest {{and one of the}} finest examples of original Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful historic buildings with original Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.|$|E

25|$|REM {{sleep is}} known for its vivid creations and {{similarity}} to the bioelectric outputs of a waking person. This stage of sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, fast but low voltage EEG and, as the name suggests, rapid eye movement. It is difficult to attribute memory gains to a single stage of sleep when it may be the entire sleep cycle that is responsible for memory consolidation. Recent research conducted by Datta et al. used an avoidance task followed by a post-training REM sleep period to examine changes in P waves affecting reprocessing of recently acquired stimuli. It was found that not only were the P waves increased during post-training sleep but also the density of the waves. These findings may imply that P waves during REM sleep may help to activate critical forebrain and cortical structures dealing with memory consolidation. In a Hennevin et al. study, 1989, the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) was given light electrical stimulation, during REM sleep, which is known to have an advantageous effect for learning when applied after training. The rats in the experiment were trained to run a maze in search of a food reward. One group of rats was given non-awakening MRF electrical stimulations after each of their maze trials compared to a control group which did not receive any electrical stimulation. It was noticed that the stimulated rats performed significantly better in respect to error reduction. These findings imply that dynamic memory processes occur both during training as well as during post-training sleep. Another study by Hennevin et al. (1998) conditioned rats to fear a noise that is associated with a subsequent foot shock. The <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> of the experiment is that fear responding to the noise (measured in the amygdala) was observed when the noise was presented during REM sleep. This was compared to a group of pseudo-conditioned rats who did not display the same amygdalar activation during post-training sleep. This would suggest that neural responding to previously salient stimuli is maintained even during REM sleep. There is no shortage of research conducted on the effects that REM sleep has on the working brain but consistency in the findings is what plagues recent research. There is no guarantee as to what functions REM sleep may perform for our bodies and brains but modern research is always expanding and assimilating new ideas to further our understanding of such processes.|$|E

But Eugene Myers at Tor.com praised Chapel, saying that the most <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> of [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?"

500|$|Disraeli always {{considered}} foreign affairs {{to be the}} most critical and most <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874. [...] He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830–1831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe. [...] His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.|$|E

In 1824 and 1825, French naturalists Quoy and Gaimard had observed that the coral organisms lived at relatively shallow depths, but the islands appeared in deep oceans.

500|$|In 2012, Atkinson reprised his {{character}} for a live performance {{as part of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In the scene, Mr. Bean works within the London Symphony Orchestra in its performance of [...] "Chariots of Fire", conducted by Simon Rattle. For this scene, Bean does not wear his usual brown tweed sports jacket, but the traditional clothing of the musician - white tie and tails. As they perform the piece, Bean is mostly bored with playing the same note repeatedly on the synthesiser and gets jealous of the more <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> being played on the grand piano. Still bored, he takes out his mobile phone and takes a picture of himself, looking proud. He then sneezes in a comical fashion and tries to retrieve his handkerchief from his bag behind him, finding he cannot reach it while at the synthesizer, until he uses an umbrella to maintain his performance. When he finally blows his nose with his handerchief, he throws it into the grand piano.|$|E
500|$|The most <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> of {{that for}} me is that audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's {{photograph}} of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com.

For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most <b>interesting</b> <b>part</b> of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E
