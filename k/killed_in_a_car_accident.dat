5|$|The Flames {{followed}} up their {{run to the}} Finals with their best regular season to that point. Calgary's 46–31–3 record in 1986–87 was good for third overall in the NHL, behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers.

5|$|The Third Doctor's final {{story was}} to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was {{commissioned}} on 15 February 1973. The story was to end with the reveal that the Master and the Doctor were brothers or two different, opposing aspects of the same being (the Ego and the Id), and the Master dying in a manner which suggested that he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor's life. The actor who played the Master, Roger Delgado, was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> in Turkey on 18 June 1973, forcing the scrapping of the story.

Maria initially raised José Julio Sarria on her own, but when this became too difficult she placed him with another couple.

Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who had fled from the Nazis.

5|$|Big Star's first album—1972's #1 Record—was met by {{enthusiastic}} reviews, but ineffective marketing by Stax Records {{and limited}} distribution stunted its commercial success. Frustration {{took its toll}} on band relations: Bell left {{not long after the}} first record's commercial progress stalled, and Hummel left to finish his college education after a second album, Radio City, was completed in December 1973. Like #1Record, Radio City received excellent reviews, but label issues again thwarted sales—Columbia Records, which had assumed control of the Stax catalog, likewise effectively vetoed its distribution. After a third album, recorded in the Fall of 1974, was deemed commercially unviable and shelved before receiving a title, the band broke up late in 1974. Four years later, the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album. The band's third album was finally issued soon afterward; titled Third/Sister Lovers, it found limited commercial success. Shortly thereafter, Chris Bell was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> at the age of 27.|$|E

5|$|Since Manchester United's first {{competitive}} match, 903 {{players have}} made a competitive first-team appearance for the club. Many of these players have spent only {{a short period of}} their career at Manchester United before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. Jimmy Davis was <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> in 2003 having made one first team appearance, the first Manchester United player to die during his career since the Munich air disaster, which claimed the lives of many of the Busby Babes, including Geoff Bent. The First and Second World Wars also disrupted the careers of footballers across the United Kingdom. Peter Beardsley only played one match for Manchester United but went on to have a very successful career at Newcastle United, Liverpool and several other clubs; he also won 59 caps for the England national team.|$|E

He married Ursula von der Heyde, a German national, while living in Burma in the 1970s, but divorced in 1982.

5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> <b>accident</b> engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E
