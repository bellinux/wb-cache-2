40|$|Abst ract~he {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of layer charge on the hydration of Mg-saturated expandable 2 : 1 phyllosilicates. Water retained by 12 Mg-saturated clays at 54 % relative humidity was quantified gravimetrically. X-ray diffraction and total chemical analysis were used to de-termine the hydratable surface area (447 - 759 m z g 1) and layer charge [0. 327 - 0. 754 electrons per formula unit (e f. u. ~) ] of each sample. Water retained by the clays increased with both hydratable surface area and layer charge of the clays. However, the increase in H 20 content with layer charge occurred only on <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the clays. This result suggests that the H 20 on <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> is localized around the cation/charge sites rather than forming multi-layers as was suggested previously. A model is proposed for the hydration of expandable 2 : 1 phyllosilicates. The model assumes that interlayer volume controls interlayer hydration and that the number of cation/charge sites on <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> controls hydration of <b>external</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings {{are attached to the}} second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of wings, are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E
5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing {{at the time of its}} death.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of the eardrum.|$|E

5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen, carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E

The quality and quantity of daylighting depends on many factors including distances, heights, shapes and reflectance of surrounding external obstacles and ground reflectance.

The case study carried out on a lighting simulation software and presented in this article demonstrates the influence of the light reflectance of <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the Daylight Factor.

25|$|The station's {{systems and}} {{experiments}} consume {{a large amount}} of electrical power, almost all of which converts to heat. Little of this heat dissipates through the walls of the station. To keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable, workable limits, ammonia is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat, then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation, then back into the station. Thus this passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes.|$|E
25|$|BIOPAN is a {{multi-user}} experimental facility {{installed on}} the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of the Russian Foton descent capsule. Experiments developed for BIOPAN are designed to investigate {{the effect of the}} space environment on biological material after exposure between 13 and 17 days. The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to solar and cosmic radiation, the space vacuum and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Of the 6 missions flown so far on BIOPAN between 1992 and 2007, dozens of experiments were conducted, and some analyzed the likelihood of panspermia. Some bacteria, lichens (Xanthoria elegans, Rhizocarpon geographicum and their mycobiont cultures, the black Antarctic microfungi Cryomyces minteri and Cryomyces antarcticus), spores, and even one animal (tardigrades) were found to have survived the harsh outer space environment and cosmic radiation.|$|E

The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers.|$|E
