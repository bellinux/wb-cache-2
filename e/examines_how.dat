Concentrating on two plays and two novels from the period—Victorien Sardou's Madame Sans-Gêne (1893), Maurice Barrès's Les Déracinés (1897), Edmond Rostand's L'Aiglon (1900), and André de Lorde and Gyp's Napoléonette (1913)—Datta <b>examines</b> <b>how</b> writers and critics of the Belle Époque exploited the Napoleonic legend for diverse political and cultural ends.|$|E

Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E

This case study of Ecuador provides a template for <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> gender identities are constituted in the physical and discursive sites of paid work. Neoliberal restructuring in Ecuador has wrought dramatic changes on work and daily life in Quito. Specifically, economic restructuring is producing new spaces of work in garment production and this presents a moment for <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> existing gender divisions of garment work are being maintained or reworked. This study sets the context for an analysis of the social construct ion of occupational segmentation by <b>examining</b> <b>how</b> the political-economy of neoliberalism is producing new sites of work. Within this context, I <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> gendered discourses of skill are reproduced or transformed with changing demand for workers, and I <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> workers narrate their gender identities as revealed through in-depth discussions of their jobs and their households. ...|$|R

40|$|Pricing of {{loanable funds}} without a proper {{rationale}} or framework leads to uncertainty and unpredictability on {{the incidence of}} the next or expected interest rate. The uncertainty and unpredictability lead to high interest rates to cover for any eventual loss. High interest rates may lead to high cost of capital, low investment, reduction in aggregate supply {{of goods and services}} and a vicious circle that reduces economic growth. It also reduces credit availability and increase the risk of speculation and adverse selection. These problems result in lower standard of living due to reduced disposable income. The specific objectives of the study were: to <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> changes in wealth influence pricing of loanable funds by commercial banks in Kenya. Secondly, to <b>examine</b> <b>how</b> expected return on bonds relative to alternative assets influence pricing of loanable funds by commercial banks in Kenya.

25|$|Lott {{finds that}} when hiring {{standards}} are lowered {{in the process}} of recruiting more minority officers, the overall quality of all officers is reduced and crime rates are increased. The most adverse effects of these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated cities. There is no consistent evidence that crime rates rise when standards for hiring women are changed, and this raises questions about whether norming tests or altering their content to create equal pass rates is preferable. The paper <b>examines</b> <b>how</b> the changing composition of police departments affects such measures as the murder of and assaults against police officers.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{examining}} employers' {{attempts to}} regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) <b>examines</b> <b>how</b> fast-food workers' {{respond to these}} regulations. According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage {{in some form of}} emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a smile and friendly attitude independent of their own mood or temperament at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|Friel {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the politics of the day, releasing The Mundy Scheme (1969) and Volunteers (1975), both pointed, the first bitter, satires on Ireland's government. The latter stages an archaeological excavation on the day before the site is turned over to a hotel developer, and uses Dublin's Wood Quay controversy as its contemporary point of reference. In that play, the Volunteers are IRA prisoners who have been indefinitely interned by the Dublin government, and the term Volunteer is both ironic, in that as prisoners they have no free will, and political, in that the IRA used the term to refer to its members. Using the site as a physical metaphor for the nation's history, the play's action <b>examines</b> <b>how</b> Irish history has been commodified, sanitized, and oversimplified to fit the political needs of society.|$|E
