40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{research}} was to verify, in a selected series of 37 patients, not only the real validity of multislice CT employment with 2 D and 3 D reformatted images in pre-surgical evaluation, but also the real necessity to use this technique as elective methodological procedure for maxillo-facial fractures in emergency. Material and methods. 37 selected patients (24 males, 13 females), with age ranging from 17 to 63 years (mean age 33 years), underwent multislice CT examination at the casualty department of the hospital San Camillo of Rome, from October 2004 to March 2005. In all the patients the computed tomography was carried out with spiral technique (General Electric Light Speed - 8 crowns), using thin acquisition of 2. 5 mm, with configuration of the eight detectors 8 x 1, 25 or 8 x 2, 25, with values of pitch equal to 1 (in some cases 1, according to thickness of the anatomical volume to appraise), with interval and thickness of retro-reconstruction respectively of 1 mm and of 1, 25 mm. The parameters of exposure were: 280 mAs, 120 Kv and a time for total scanning of 10 - 15 sec. (for only maxillofacial structures). Results. The {{results of the study}} were: 7 out of 37 patients reproduced a facial smash, 26 out of 37 patients showed a complex fracture: 8 patients with a nasal-ethmoidalorbital fractures, 7 patients with a zygomatico-maxillary fracture, 5 patients with a nasal-maxillary fracture; 4 patients with a condylar or subcondylar fracture, 1 patient with multiple <b>fracture</b> <b>of</b> <b>jaw,</b> 1 patient with fracture of the orbital floor (blow out); and 4 patients showed a picture of malar fracture. On the total of the examined patients, 26 (70 %) showed solitary or multiple fractures of the orbital walls. In particular in 9 cases were found fractures of the orbital floor, of which 6 with sinking of bony fragments in the underlying maxillary sinus (blow out). The medial walls of the orbit were involved in the complex fractures in 7 cases. In 11 cases presented fractures of the orbital lateral walls. Discussion. The most important aspect emerged by this experience was the absence of patients in which the classical pattern of fracture, in accordance with the historical Le Fort classification, was reproduced faithfully, and the clean prevalence of complex fractures, that come out from the normal canons of classification. We wanted to underline the role of CT in the diagnosis in this type of fractures, and in particular of the spiral multislice technique, with axial volumetric thin acquisitions supplied with coronal/sagittal and 3 D with volumetric rendering reconstructions. Conclusion. In comparison with the traditional CT examination that, in prevision of MPR and 3 D reconstructions, results incompatible with the necessary time and accuracy request for emergency conditions, the spiral technique reduces drastically both the times and the radiant dose, allows to work in the phase of post-elaboration on the raw data of volumetric scanning, obtaining from the axial scans multiplanar and three-dimensional reconstructions of superior quality. Emphasis was placed also {{on the fact that the}} possibility to appraise the entity of the skeletal damages, the concomitant muscular lesions, of cerebral parenchyma and of the cervical rachis made this techniqueelective in this field. The MPR reconstructions hold particular importance because undoubtedly better underline the presence of suspected or badly definable lesions compared with axial scans and complete the diagnostic supply...|$|E
50|$|Histologically {{a normal}} dental {{follicle}} is lined by enamel epithelium, whereas a dentigerous cyst is lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

40|$|There {{was carried}} out an {{analysis}} of the results of treatment of 34 patients with oblique <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the lower <b>jaw</b> by the method of commissure osteosynthesis that was elaborated by the authors. Aim: to increase the effectiveness of treatment of patients with oblique <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the lower <b>jaw</b> at the expense of optimization of commissure osteosynthesis. Methods: there {{was carried out}} examination and operative treatment of 34 patients with oblique <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>jaw</b> <b>of</b> the different localization. In the area <b>of</b> the lower <b>jaw</b> angle – 19 (55, 88 %) patients, in the area <b>of</b> the lower <b>jaw</b> body – 12 (35, 29 %) persons, the number <b>of</b> patients with <b>fractures</b> <b>of</b> the neck with dislocation of the head <b>of</b> lower <b>jaw</b> was 3 (8, 83 %). All patients were the persons of male sex 32 – 55 years old. The operative treatment was consisted in commissure osteosynthesis according to the method elaborated by the authors. Results: there were not observed any complication in operated patients during postoperative period. There were not observed the secondary displacement of splinters or inflammatory complications. The consolidation of splinters was clinically observed on 21 day after operation. In remote terms (3 month after osteosynthesis) patients have no complaints the disorders of dental occlusion did not take place. Conclusions : An offered method of osteosynthesis with wire suture allows: 1.  Eliminate the horizontal displacement of splinters; 2.  Eliminate the shortening <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> arch and the deviation of occlusion with deformation of the patient’s face; 3.  Raise the stability of osteosynthesis.

40|$|<b>Fractures</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> {{are often}} treated with rigid and stable {{internal}} fixation using plates or miniplates. Early surgery for jaw fractures is the optimal treatment; however, if a late treatment is begun, often {{the adoption of}} other protocols is needed. When the jaw fracture has one free bone fragment with 2 full-thickness lesions of mucoperiosteal soft tissues both on the buccal and palatal sides, the risk of resorption or necrosis is very high after elevating a mucoperiosteal flap for rigid fixation. For this reason, we developed an intraoral epimucosal fixation technique using self-locking screws and plates. Substantial advantages of this new technique, in comparison with other commonly used fixation techniques, consisted {{in the prevention of}} bone resorption or necrosis by safe and simple screw insertion procedure after manipulation <b>of</b> the <b>fracture</b> for reduction in closed surgery. Major indications for epimucosal fixation in closed surgery are the presence <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>fractures</b> without dislocation or reducible jaw fractures by manipulation particularly in edentulous patients...|$|R
