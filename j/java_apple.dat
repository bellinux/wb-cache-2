In Indonesia, certain fruit plants has their own bearing fruits season, usually within late dry season to the wet season, thus the time of fruit harvest usually coincides with the time of having rujak in Indonesian villages.

Traditionally the agricultural cycles linked to rice cultivation were celebrated through rituals, such as Sundanese Seren Taun rice harvest festival. In Bali the traditional subak irrigation management was created to ensure the water supplies for rice paddies, managed by priests and created around [...] "water temples".

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that some queries submitted to search engines are by nature ambiguous (e. g., <b>java,</b> <b>apple).</b> However, few studies have investigated the questions of “how many queries are ambiguous? ” and “how can we automatically identify an ambiguous query? ” This paper deals with these issues. First, we construct the taxonomy of query ambiguity, and ask human annotators to manually classify queries based upon it. From manually labeled results, we find that query ambiguity is to some extent predictable. We then use a supervised learning approach to automatically classify queries as being ambiguous or not. Experimental results show that we can correctly identify 87 % of labeled queries. Finally, we estimate that about 16 % of queries in a real search log are ambiguous...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{reduction}} or {{removal of}} noise in a color image {{is an essential}} part of image processing, whether the final information is used for human perception or for an automatic inspection and analysis. In addition to all the classical based filters for noise reduction, many fuzzy inspired filters have been developed during the past years [3 – 26]. However, it is very difficult to judge the quality of all these different filters. For which noise types are they designed? How do they perform com-pared to each other? Are there some filters that clearly outperform the others? Do the numerical results correspond with the visual results? In this paper we answer these questions for color images that are corrupted with impulse noise. We also have developed a <b>Java</b> <b>Apple...</b>|$|E

25|$|The Cocoa {{frameworks}} {{are written}} in Objective-C, and hence that is the preferred language for developing Cocoa applications. Java bindings for the Cocoa frameworks (termed the Java bridge) were also made available {{with the aim of}} replacing Objective-C with a more popular language but these bindings were unpopular among Cocoa developers and Cocoa's message passing semantics did not translate well to a statically-typed language such as Java. Cocoa's need for runtime binding means many of Cocoa's key features are not available with <b>Java.</b> In 2005, <b>Apple</b> announced that the Java bridge was to be deprecated, meaning that features added to Cocoa in macOS versions later than 10.4 would not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.|$|R

40|$|The {{extraction}} of planar sections from volume images {{is the most}} commonly used technique for inspecting and visualizing anatomic structures. We propose to generalize the concept of planar section to the {{extraction of}} curved cross-sections (free form surfaces). Compared with planar slices, curved cross-sections may easily follow the trajectory of tubular structures and organs such as the aorta or the colon. They may be extracted from a 3 D volume, displayed as a 3 D view and possibly flattened. Flattening of curved cross-sections allows to inspect spatially complex relationship between anatomic structures and their neighbourhood. They also allow to carry out measurements along a specific orientation. For the purpose of facilitating the interactive specification of free form surfaces, users may navigate in real time within the body and select the slices on which the surface control points will be positioned. Immediate feedback is provided by displaying boundary curves as cylindrical markers within a 3 D view composed of anatomic organs, planar slices and possibly free form surface sections. Extraction of curved surface sections is an additional service that is available online as a <b>Java</b> <b>apple...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{export of}} fruits from Suriname to the US, Brazil and French Guyana is prohibited, all {{on account of}} one {{particular}} pest.

Whilst the carambola (Averrhoa carambola) and <b>Java</b> <b>apple</b> (Syzygium samarangense) are the main hosts, the fly has also been found on many other species of fruit trees such as guava, mango, many types of citrus and even nut trees such as cashew and tropical almond. The pest was first detected in Suriname in 1970 but its spread westward was slow. Researchers concluded that its spread was associated with human travel and the planting of introduced cultivars, as it was not found in jungle areas. To prevent the fruit fly moving further west, a pilot-eradication project was initiated in 1990. Trapping and bait spot treatment with methyleugenol and malathion proved very effective; the fly population has decreased to 98 % of the original and in one isolated village has been eradicated.
