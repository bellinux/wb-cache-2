40|$|Abstract. To study a novel protein family {{requires}} a biologist to understand {{many different types}} of information. Moreover, the speed of discovery in biology has been expanding exponentially. And the public <b>knowledge</b> management <b>platforms</b> are not customized to a research project. It is often cumbersome. To overcome these obstacles, we have set up a <b>knowledge</b> management <b>platform</b> by integrating several databases. Particularly, we have constructed a <b>knowledge</b> management <b>platform</b> on the novel LARGE-like glycosyltransferase family. The predicted protein structure of a LARGE protein family member contains an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, a coiled-coil motif and two putative catalytic domains with the conserved DXD motif and a conserved protein structural domain, as previously described. Initially, we have developed an workflow to identify the members of the LARGE-like protein family. We then integrated the DNA sequence, protein sequence, protein domain, protein family based on the CAZY databank, human and animal disease information and references into one <b>knowledge</b> management <b>platform</b> for studying diseases...|$|R

40|$|Digital Storage {{management}} systems {{have become more}} affordable {{over the last few}} years and software applications have emerged to help business managers implement them. Digital information is designed to derive its value from best practice information and business processes using electronic media. Storage and archiving however, has become paramount importance in <b>knowledge</b> <b>platforms</b> in which information management is deployed. However, implementing successful electronic storage (e-storage) and electronic archiving (e-archiving) requires good understanding of basic information standards and protocols upon which the storage system depends. In the construction industry, the uncertainty over the standards and lack of interoperable <b>knowledge</b> <b>platforms</b> reduces the ability to access information. There is also a rise in information and document loss, malpractice of propriety information, fraud, and unauthorised changes in design. Another problem is that digital standard protocols that were designed for an open and trusted community have inherited flaws that allows human error, tampering and changing of individual files. The lack of appropriate archiving tools in proper pattern has affected the implementation of archiving systems. Research suggests that a...|$|R
