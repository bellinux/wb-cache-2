50|$|Biotrue contact lens {{solutions}} are {{a brand of}} cleaning and storage solutions manufactured by Bausch & Lomb that were developed to match the natural lubricant found in the eye. It matches the pH of healthy tears and helps to keep certain beneficial tear proteins active while removing <b>deposited</b> <b>proteins</b> that distort a wearers vision. In theory this helps to keep a users contact lenses more comfortable. In 2012 an affordable line of daily disposable contact lenses were launched under the same brand name for both single vision and for users with presbyopia. They were first introduced in Italy and quickly followed by the United Kingdom and the Nordics. In 2015 they were approved for the US market. Biotrue one day contact lenses are made from a material called HyperGel and manufactured {{in the country of}} Ireland.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{simultaneous}} {{accumulation of}} different misfolded proteins {{in the central}} nervous system is a common feature in many neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, co-occurrence of abnormal <b>deposited</b> <b>proteins</b> is observed in different brain regions and cell populations, but, in some instances, the proteins {{can be found in the}} same cellular aggregates. Co-occurrence of tau and a-synuclein (a-syn) aggregates has been described in neurodegenerative disorders with primary deposition of a-syn, such as Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Although it is known that tau and a-syn have pathological synergistic effects on their mutual fibrillization, the underlying biological effects remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used different cell models of synucleinopathy to investigate the effects of tau on a-syn aggregation. Using confocal microscopy and FRET–based techniques we observed that tau colocalized and interacted with a-syn aggregates. We also found that tau overexpression changed the pattern of a-syn aggregation, reducing the size and increasing the number of aggregates. This shift was accompanied by an increase in the levels of insoluble a-syn. Furthermore, co-transfection of tau increased secreted a-syn and cytotoxicity. Conclusions/Significance: Our data suggest that tau enhances a-syn aggregation and toxicity and disrupts a-syn inclusion formation. This pathological synergistic effect between tau and a-syn may amplify the deleterious process and spread th...|$|E

40|$|The {{earliest}} {{stages of}} development in most metazoans are driven by maternally <b>deposited</b> <b>proteins</b> and mRNAs, with widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurring hours after fertilization, at a period known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of {{a small number of}} genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) {{plays a key role in}} their transcriptional activation. To better understand the mechanisms of ZLD activation and the range of its targets, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before (mitotic cycle 8), during (mitotic cycle 13), and after (late mitotic cycle 14) the MZT. Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic cycle 10, we identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. As expected, early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However, we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This strong earl...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) for {{wastewater treatment}} {{has been increasing}} since the 1990 s and is gaining more importance due to rising demands for water in general. There is yet one main limitation in full-scale applications of MBRs: the membrane fouling, leading to a substantial loss of membrane performance and subsequently to high costs because of cleaning and replacing the membranes. Since no consensus on the exact fouling phenomenon or a single fouling parameter in MBRs has been reached yet {{the present study was}} aiming at characterizing membrane foulants in the full-scale MBR Nordkanal (Düsseldorf, Germany), in pilot-scale MBRs as well as in fermenter-/lab-scale studies. The focus {{of the present study was}} on two classes of substances that are known to cause fouling in membrane applications: extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and metals. The long-term observation of activated sludge, permeate and autopsied membranes from the MBR Nordkanal showed a significant contribution of EPS and iron to membrane fouling. The membrane fouling layers where shown to have the following composition (in weight %) : humic substances (39 %), carbohydrates (30 %), iron (22 %) and fatty acids (8 %). Contrary to other, mostly pilot-scale studies, biofilm development was not dominant in this full-scale MBR due to vigorous aeration and frequent backwashing of the fibres. Interestingly, precipitations of iron hydroxides were detected on the membranes, even on the permeate side, whereas Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + were not involved in fouling in this MBR. The retention by the ultrafiltration membranes in the full-scale MBR was shown to be 39 ± 27 % for humic acids and 79 ± 30 % for carbohydrates (average of 2. 5 years of monthly samples) although the molecular weight of the humics fraction was demonstrated to be below the molecular weight cut-off of the membrane. Fatty acids (FA) of microbial origin (C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0) were the dominating FA in EPS of activated sludge flocs, sludge supernatant, permeate and membrane fouling layers in the MBR Nordkanal. A remarkable finding was that a shorter FA of a probable synthetic origin (C 9 : 0) was preferentially deposited into the membranes where it accounted for 10 % of the FA in total EPS whereas in sludge floc EPS it was only 1 % of total FA concentration. The results from the full-scale study were used to propose a fouling mechanism that is based on complexation and adsorption processes. Iron from the coagulant FeCl 3 in form of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + is playing a central role in this mechanism as it is able to form complexes with humic acids and with uronic acids that were detected in the microbial polysaccharides of samples of the MBR Nordkanal. For such complexes as well as for fatty acids, reduced electrostatic repulsion, narrowing of the membrane pores and hydrophobic interactions with the membrane material could explain the observed fouling phenomenon. In lab-scale surveys regarding membrane cleaning strategies, it was further verified that citric acid is especially suited to remove iron and EPS from fouled membranes. Moreover, it was demonstrated through lab-scale sludge digestion how soluble Fe 2 + can be formed and released together with EPS from the sludge floc matrix under anaerobic conditions. Such conditions also deteriorated sludge properties in terms of filterability and settling behaviour. Finally, in the pilot-scale study it was shown that low sludge retention time (SRT) leads to an excess production of EPS in correlation with deteriorating sludge properties. The formation of fouling layers on the membranes was also more distinct at low SRT, with 40 -fold higher amounts of <b>deposited</b> <b>proteins</b> and 5 -fold higher concentrations of carbohydrates compared with high SRT. However, membrane permeability was similar at both SRTs. The conclusion for operators of full-scale MBRs in general is that high SRT is beneficial for activated sludge properties. For the specific case of the MBR Nordkanal which is already operated at high SRT (28 d), it can be concluded that the presence of iron in conjunction with anaerobic conditions in the denitrification tank, prior to membrane filtration, is more decisive for the membrane fouling. As shown by results of the present study, the applied cleaning strategy with citric acid in Nordkanal is appropriate for removing the major membrane foulants. For future studies aiming at clarifying distinct fouling parameters and fouling mechanisms, a focus on metal complexation with specific EPS or with wastewater components, as well as the interaction of such complexes with different membrane materials looks promising...|$|E
