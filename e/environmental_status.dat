But in reality, these places are often so {{unhealthy}} that they underlie majority of accident and disease among children in the developing world. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine ergonomic, safety and <b>environmental</b> health <b>status</b> at primary schools in Markazi province. Material and Methods: It was a descriptive – cross – sectional study, that performed at 210 primary schools in Markazi province. These schools were selected randomly by stratified method. The data were collected through a check list and observation. Results: Only 21. 2 percent of schools had acceptable <b>environmental</b> health <b>status.</b> There was significant difference between urban and rural schools and between girls, boys and girls – boys schools. 18. 1 percent of schools had good safety condition. There was significant difference between urban and rural schools and between girls, boys and girls – boys schools. 25. 6 percent of schools had appropriate ergonomic condition. There was significant difference between urban and rural schools. Conclusion: According to results safety, ergonomic and <b>environmental</b> health <b>status</b> are very far from acceptable condition. These findings may be related to supervision of environmental health at schools, defects in designing, building, and maintenance of schools, change in users of schools and safety culture.

These data, juxtaposed with data on the health status of Hispanics, {{tell us that the}} <b>environmental</b> health <b>status</b> of Hispanics and their children is poor. At the same time, significant inadequacies in the collection of data on Hispanics make it difficult to make improving Hispanic <b>environmental</b> health <b>status</b> a priority. These inadequacies include the failure to use Hispanic identifiers in data collection and failure to collect sample sizes large enough to allow for breakouts of data by Hispanic subgroup. In addressing environmental justice issues, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S.

This study was done to study the <b>environmental</b> health <b>status</b> and consumption of baking soda in the military and urban Lavash bakeries of Tehran in 2012. Materials and methods:This is a descriptive comparative study done on Lavash bread production of 14 military bakeries and 14 corresponding urban bakeries near them. PH in the samples was tested based on Institute of Standards and Industrial Research of Iran No. 2628. To check the <b>status</b> of <b>environmental</b> health and personal hygiene of bakeries, the check list of Cereal Research Center was used.
