5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, Krichell {{discovered}} Hank Greenberg while on a scouting trip in Massachusetts. Krichell believed Greenberg {{would be the next}} Lou Gehrig. Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing the Yankees were looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knew his opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman. Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Schindler {{joined the}} separatist Sudeten German Party in 1935. Although {{he was a}} citizen of Czechoslovakia, Schindler became a spy for the Abwehr, an {{intelligence}} service of Nazi Germany, in 1936. He was assigned to Abwehrstelle II Commando VIII, based in Breslau. He later told Czech police that he did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> needed the money; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>it's</b> {{not only}} <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a genius that I {{ask you to}} let me bring him here; <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> a human being, and he is ill and poor." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "At home too he lets things go," [...] Grace interposed. [...] "He does so little--takes no trouble." [...] Her mother {{suffered}} {{this statement}} to pass unchallenged, and she pursued philosophically: [...] "I suppose <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knows he's so clever." ...|$|R
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects {{in the years that}} followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. He's simply {{fallen in}} with what we've said. <b>It's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> so sweet and yielding, and can't bear to refuse. I can {{understand}} it perfectly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fleda hesitated; at last, {{before her}} companion's, {{she lowered her}} look. [...] "Because I love him. <b>It's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> weak that he needs me," [...] she added.|$|R
6000|$|... "He wouldn't dare to do that--I {{know too}} much about him," [...] {{answered}} Sid Merrick. [...] "No, <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wants too big {{a share of the}} treasure." ...|$|R
5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the case}} did not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn existed in various {{anonymous}} versions; it was a sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|John and Kanyenke {{then take}} their mercenaries {{in pursuit of}} Warwick's fleeing army, and ally with the French in the Seven Years' War against Warwick. When Colonel George Washington tells them that Warwick is a renegade and has been hunted by the British as well, John agrees to track him down for the British. John leads his mercenaries and Washington's forces and destroys Warwick's base in the Great Lakes region. The {{presence}} of the Circle of Ossus' Boneguard prove to John {{the existence of the}} Circle and that Warwick is the current Circle's leader. In the ruins of the Circle's base John finds the decapitated body of his uncle Stuart. John then demands that Nonahkee be kept at home while they pursue Warwick, who has again escaped and fled to the Rocky Mountains. Kanyenke agrees and reveals that he knows about John's relationship with Nonahkee. He tells him that he would not have chosen John as her husband, but he accepts <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knows that she decides who she loves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you?' she said, in {{her most}} easy, most cutting voice. 'Do {{you want to know}} what it is in him? <b>It's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has some {{understanding}} of a woman, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is not stupid. That's why it is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Beale gave a last touch; she was ready; {{she stood}} there in all her elegance. [...] "I mean, my dear, that <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> HASN'T got <b>it</b> that I left him." ...|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of 15 May 218, Elagabalus was taken, by either Julia Maesa or Gannys, to the camp of the Legio III Gallica at Raphanea and {{presented}} to the soldiers stationed there. In one account of the events, Elegabalus was saluted as Antoninus by the soldiers, after his father Caracalla whose official name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Enticed by Julia's bribes, the legion proclaimed Elagabalus the righful Emperor of Rome on 16 May 218. In Gibbon's opinion, Macrinus {{might have been able}} to stop the rebellion in this early stage, but failed to contain <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was unable to decide on an appropriate course of action and instead remained at Antioch.|$|E
5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included. An often {{repeated}} {{story is that}} Erasmus included <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt bound by a promise to include it if a manuscript was found that contained it. When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included it, though he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his Annotations. Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. The real reason to include the Comma by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E
25|$|After {{his studies}} Nassau voluntarily {{went to the}} Prussian army. He fought with it in Flanders and Brabant during the War of the Spanish Succession. He then {{switched}} to Hessian service, but had to leave <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> fought a duel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] cried Dorothy, in {{an anxious}} voice, [...] "I'm sure Uncle Henry isn't getting any better, and <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{is worried about}} me. Ozma, dear, I must go to him at once!" ...|$|R
25|$|The Fred Savage sitcom Working had {{an episode}} where the main {{character}} organizes his fellow workers into a union and tells management <b>it’s</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> really cares about the well-being of his coworkers, exhibiting solidarity.|$|R
50|$|He was nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} that <b>it</b> was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{was always so}} busy with working on something, but his brother Bret said in his {{autobiography}} that <b>it</b> was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was always up to some mischievous business.|$|R
25|$|During Iqbal's stay in Heidelberg in 1907 his German {{professor}} Emma Wegenast {{taught him}} about Goethe's Faust, Heine and Nietzsche. During his study in Europe, Iqbal {{began to write}} poetry in Persian. He prioritised <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believed he had found {{an easy way to}} express his thoughts. He would write continuously in Persian throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Chris Moyles was {{involved}} in a tax avoidance scheme and requested a court order to prevent the press from reporting <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> claimed it would infringe his human rights. In February 2014 it was reported that he had attempted to avoid up to £400,000 in income tax by claiming losses of £1,000,000 on a used car dealership scheme.|$|E
25|$|Worf {{submitted}} {{his resignation}} but Sisko rejected <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> still needed him. He {{had decided to}} rescue {{the members of the}} Cardassian council from certain death {{at the hands of the}} Klingons. In doing so, he was able to prove that there was no Dominion involvement by verifying their identities. The Klingons attacked the station in order to capture the council members but withdrew as Starfleet ships approached, fearing a war on two fronts.|$|E
60|$|He stood me two 'arf-pints and {{was just}} going to order another, when 'e found 'e 'adn't got any money left, and he wouldn't hear of me paying for <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>'e</b> said <b>it</b> was his treat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he said, [...] "when Saunders makes a {{proposition}} {{of that kind}} <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> sees how he's going to {{get something out of}} it. But for all that, I guess it's sound advice he's giving you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> got all tired out yesterday, an' that he'll be {{himself again}} to-morrow," [...] said Aunt Olive, after Toby {{had come in}} {{for at least the}} sixth time, and she saw how worried he was.|$|R
25|$|Work {{started in}} the same year; {{the ends of the}} {{crescent}} were started first. The project was then delayed when Otto ran out of money; he returned to the West Indies to secure more funds, then came back to Brighton and supervised the completion of the crescent, which happened in 1807. Unlike many contemporary and later developments in Brighton, Otto was able to take his time to complete <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was not wholly dependent on it for his financial success: his plantations were still his main source of income.|$|E
25|$|Clay's American System {{ran into}} strong {{opposition}} from President Jackson's administration. A key {{point of contention}} {{between the two men}} was over the Maysville Road. It would authorize federal funding for a project to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River; however all of the road would be inside Kentucky. Jackson vetoed <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> felt that it did not constitute interstate commerce, and he feared it would fund corruption. Jackson opposed using the federal government to promote economic modernization, thereby appealing to his agrarian base that wanted rural expansion but distrusted cities.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, {{one of the}} Russian {{supersonic}} heavy {{strategic bomber}} Tu-160, based at the Engels-2 Air Force Base, was named for Igor Sikorsky, which caused controversy among air base crew members. One of the officers said that Igor Sikorsky does not deserve <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> laid {{the foundations of the}} U.S., rather than Russian aviation. However, the Long Range Aviation command officer said that Igor Sikorsky is not responsible for the activities of his military aircraft. In 2013, Flying magazine ranked Sikorsky number 12 on its list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} answer, and I {{am sorry}} if you don't like it. If Innocent is happy, <b>it</b> is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> IS innocent. If he can defy the conventions, <b>it</b> is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> can keep the commandments. <b>It</b> is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{does not want to}} kill but to excite to life that a pistol is still as {{exciting}} to him as it is to a schoolboy. <b>It</b> is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not want to steal, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not covet his neighbour's goods, that he has captured the trick (oh, how we all long for it!), the trick of coveting his own goods. <b>It</b> is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex; <b>it</b> is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons. If he had really murdered a man, if he had really deserted a woman, {{he would not be able}} to feel that a pistol or a love-letter was like a song-- at least, not a comic song." ...|$|R
50|$|Dessel {{is taken}} to the Sith Academy on Korriban. <b>He</b> thinks <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is being punished for disobeying the direct orders of a {{superior}} officer. But little does Des know, he's {{on his way to}} becoming a member of the Brotherhood of Darkness.|$|R
