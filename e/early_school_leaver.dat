40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to clarify the European Commission’s Education and Training (ET 2020) strategy, focusing primarily on the dimension of educational attainment. According to the ET 2020, {{the percentage of the}} population aged between 30 and 34 who have completed their tertiary education, should be at least 40 % by 2020. Meanwhile, also forecasts a reduction in the <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> rate to less than 10 %. 	The purposes of this study are to explore the present educational attainment performance in various OECD countries and to analyse the determinants of productivity growth regarding these educational targets. We found that in long run, an increase in the level of human capital resulted in a greater increase in productivity in those countries where the tertiary education and <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> ratios targets are achieved. Our conclusions highlight that educational reforms are needed to rethink the establishment of knowledge societies...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiences}} of <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> in a New South Wales Central Coast community {{during the year}} after they left school were examined to identify ways of easing their transition into {{the community and the}} work force. Data were collected through interviews with community service providers, representatives of educational agencies, refuge workers, and local employers. Few schools had a system for providing <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> with information about their options. Unlike in Europe, the responsibility of <b>schools</b> to <b>early</b> <b>leavers</b> in the North Coast appeared to be minimal and did not embrace the idea that <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> should be followed up via some well-established community-based arrangements. Because many <b>early</b> <b>leavers</b> left <b>school</b> too suddenly for the school to intervene or left "under a cloud," they were unlikely to receive sympathetic farewells and relevant information, even though they are the students most in need of information and support. It was concluded that the reason <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> pose such a problem fo...|$|R
50|$|The {{institute}} {{also offers}} {{education and training}} options for <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers.</b> Previously the institute offered the National Trade Certificate Foundation (NTC F) course for <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> who failed to complete primary school and earn the Certificate of Primary Education. However, this course option has been gradually phased out and replaced with a programme of study of four years of pre-vocational education.|$|R
30|$|Compared to {{the studies}} {{illustrated}} so far, this study differs {{also in the}} empirical methodology because it replaces the more standard regression analysis with a matching approach. This is a statistical tool designed to match “treated” individuals (early school leavers) and “control” individuals (high school graduates) using a large set of observables. The underlying idea is to find for each <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> a high school graduate with {{the same set of}} observable characteristics. Unfortunately, since matching cannot be done on unobservable characteristics, this method does not allow us to identify a causal relationship between education and earnings. From this viewpoint, it cannot be considered {{as an alternative to the}} estimates based on credible exogenous variation in education attainment.|$|E
30|$|Despite an {{improved}} labour market situation for vocational {{education and training}} in the high valued so-called “Dual System” a substantial proportion of school graduates and <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> still ends up in various pre-vocational training programmes within the transition system. The situation has hardly improved for young people without a qualification higher than a general school leaving certificate [Hauptschulabschluss] and for foreigners (Authoring Group Educational Reporting 2012; Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2016). Early school leavers and young adults who have left school with a lower secondary qualification (general school diploma) have little chances of a proper vocational training as well as few options to receive an apprentice position according to their interests and aptitudes (ibid, p. 109 ff.).|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{the results}} of the {{regression}} estimates indicate similar patterns to those of parental involvement. In Austria, increased support from older siblings significantly reduces the odds of being an <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> beyond the effects of parental support or parents’ education levels (odds ratio: 0.66, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and increases the chance of becoming a high-achiever (odds ratio: 1.68, p[*]<[*] 0.01), holding all other variables constant. In other words, the success in education of second-generation Turks in the Austrian education system is significantly dependent on the education levels of their parents, and the degree of involvement and support by parents and older siblings. By contrast, and in line with the findings on parental involvement, my additional results revealed that older siblings’ support is not significantly associated with the two dependent variables in France and Sweden (results available upon request).|$|E
3000|$|Columns 3 to 5 of Table  6 {{show that}} in almost all regions <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> are {{disadvantaged}} {{in terms of the}} probability of ever transiting to employment relative to those who stay in school longer (the probability of ever transiting is 86 % for <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> compared to 92 % among those who leave education after age 18). With the exception of MENA, where those with high levels of education tend to transit at a slower rate, the disadvantage among <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> is also evident in the duration of transition to employment, in columns 3 to 5 of Table  7. While median transition duration is on the order of almost 2  years (23  months) for those who left education by age 15, among those who leave school after age 18 is less than 1  year (11 months) [...]. 14 If school-leaving age precedes the legal age of employment, this could contribute to explain longer transition durations among <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> compared to those who stay on longer. The circumstance that the probability of ever transiting to a job is lower for <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> suggests some returns from attending school longer (although unobserved heterogeneity is clearly an alternative explanation).|$|R
40|$|By OECD standards, {{the share}} of the Australian labour force with at least a {{secondary}} school qualification is low.

A key finding is that the early years after leaving school are crucially important, with rates of re-engagement dropping dramatically in the first three years out from school. For those who enter the labour market after school, results suggest that finding work, especially satisfying work, is an important driver for returning to study. <b>Early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers,</b> vocational education and training, re-engaging in education...|$|R

30|$|Teachers of {{secondary}} vocational educational institutions (VET) in four {{cities in the}} Netherlands are cooperating in developing a curriculum for at-risk students. The schools {{are part of a}} project called “Playing for Success 15 – 23 ”, which was launched as an <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> (ESL)-programme for secondary vocational students aged 15 – 23 and inspired by the British “Playing for Success” concept (Sharp et al. 2007). The innovative characteristic of this curriculum is the cooperation with professional sports organizations, such as a professional soccer club. In this program, at-risk students are assigned to a 8 – 10  week curriculum enacted in a professional environment such as a soccer stadium or top sports arena. The goal of this cooperation is to motivate at-risk students and engage them in learning {{and on the other hand}} to develop learning opportunities especially tailored to the educational needs of these students. The aim of this study is to examine whether dropout prevention, now typically located in a regular ‘bricks and mortar’ school environment, can be extended to a soccer stadium or top sports arena and to examine whether a professional, appealing environment with well-known sportspeople and a curriculum with many “binding” learning experiences reinforces the success of the ESL-programme.” We assume that teacher impact really matters (Hattie 2003; Timperley and Alton-Lee 2008) and therefore we focus on teachers’ views on effective dropout prevention and teachers’ pedagogical-didactical strategies for creating positive and motivating learning experiences for at-risk students.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Though girls ’ {{education}} is a well-established part of the anti-poverty canon, its importance {{in the lives of}} girls on the margins of China’s globalization is more complex than a utility approach might suggest. This article uses a capabilities approach of empowerment to understand what educational opportunities a set of multiply marginalized girls value- that is, might have reason to value. The article foregrounds rural girls ’ voices to tell us what capabilities they treasure, how they develop agency, and what well-being they experience while living under severely constrained gendered socio-economic and cultural circumstances. Findings show that the opportunity structure is embedded in how and what the girls value in their world related to education. Hence, understanding and strengthening the fabric of this embedded opportunity structure can lay the foundation for an effective educational development policy toward the Millennium Development Goals. Findings showed that with schooling, the girls gained confidence, and psychological as well as cognitive control; some went against their parents ’ wishes, and stayed in school. After they ‘went into society’, they continued to develop their voice and capability of making strategic life choices about school, work and marriage. They imagined social change in their relation to their birth families, though they accepted the prevailing preference for sons, but they sought alternatives to marrying and returning to ‘grow crops ’ [zhong tien] and have babies. One <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> put it this way, ‘If I don’t change, I won’t make progress. It would be like living in the past [the village]. I have to adapt to society [in the larger world]. ’ Powerless and poor girls make up the most disadvantaged group in education. (Unite...|$|E
30|$|In {{the area}} of schooling, the most {{prominent}} means across the Member States relate to those preventing early school leaving. Early school leavers are those people aged 18 – 24 with a lower as secondary level education not participating in any further education or training. In countries such as Spain, Malta and Portugal, the rate of early school leavers exceeds 30 %. To guarantee that young people learn basic skills, several countries have installed extra support classes, observing pupils’ achievements much closer than previously. For instance, in Greece, such kinds of classes exist throughout primary and secondary education {{in order to enhance}} pupils’ performance. The ‘Hope for suburbs’ programme in France supports young people stemming from underprivileged areas, with 200 schools providing intense training for those delivering poor results. The ‘Acting for youth’ plan in the same country has extended compulsory education from 16 to 18 years, entailing the ‘right to prepare for working life’ in the sense of benefiting from training or taking up a job after leaving school. Other Member States have also introduced so-called second-chance schools, placing emphasis on practical skills and work experience or guidance measures for early school leavers. In Finland, early school leavers were assigned to personal advisors, providing advice and support {{in the form of a}} search team to find either employment or a way to further educate the <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> (European Commission 2011 a). In the UK, the 2008 Education and Skills Act provides that all young people will have to remain in education or training until the age of 18 by 2015. Accordingly, young people have to either participate in education or training at a school, college and home education, or carry out work-based learning such as an apprenticeship (Skill 2009).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (D. Ed. Psych.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Learning and Educational Development, 2005 There are two {{components}} in this research. The first comprises identification of what characterises an at risk student using risk factors identified from the literature. The second comprises {{identification of the}} prevalence of these risk factors in one school and how this school identified and assisted these students {{in the context of}} the <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> literature. Fifty-two students from a Melbourne government high school and seven of their teachers participated in the research. Students were divided into three groups; at risk students who participated in an intervention program, at risk students who did not participate in an intervention program, and a low risk group. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered and analysed to investigate prevalence of risk factors and usefulness and relevance of the intervention programs. All students completed a 30 -page survey consisting of a demographics page, the Academic Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, the Classroom Environment Scale (Real and Ideal Forms) and the Family Environment Scale (Real and Ideal Forms). The teachers completed the Teacher Report Form of the Child Behaviour Checklist. The at risk students participated in interviews and completed six monthly questionnaires. From these data, a profile of the at risk student was developed. At risk students are characterised as performing academically lower than low risk students, exhibiting more problem behaviours, are more likely to be male, to value friendships made at school, to find the work at school and the teacher relationships difficult, to hold aspirations to achieve year 12 and believe they are in control of their school experience. The students participating in an intervention felt it was valuable. The quantitative data revealed non-significant changes in these students' academic self-efficacy and trivial differences in their academic grades. It is clear that school aptitude results from as early as year 7, and student behaviours can help to identify students at risk. It is also clear that friendships formed at school serve as a buffer for these students. Significant events occurring in the nominated at risk students lives do not appear to influence their decision to leave school early. The results imply that schools have the necessary information to identify students at risk, but that intervention programs need to be designed specifically to target problem issues. Recommendations for the school are made in the hope that they can be communicated to educators and the broader community. Restricted Access: Staff and Students of the University Onl...|$|E
40|$|Clondalkin Drugs Task Force: The Clondalkin Drug Task Force {{is one of}} 14 LDTFs located {{mainly in}} the greater Dublin region. Their overall role is to prepare and {{implement}} action plans which identify existing and emerging gaps in services in relation to education/prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and curbing local supply. To date the Clondalkin Drug Task Force The Task Forces has drawn up two Area Actions Plans based on intensive consultations (1997 / 8 and 2001). The plans represent a consensus on the priority issues {{to be addressed in}} the community in terms of problematic drug use. Each plan included a range of measures in terms of treatment, rehabilitation, education and prevention, and curbing the local supply of drugs. The initial Action Plan focused on education and prevention strategies and actions in response to the identified need for innovative community based education programmes in Clondalkin. CDTF’s most recent Area Action Plan was developed in 2001 and entitled ‘Making Progress’. In the development of the this Action Plan, the Task Force reflected on the lessons learned from implementing the initial plan and developed a number of strategies and actions that focused on Treatment & Rehabilitation. Prevalence of Drug Problems in Clondalkin: The research shows that drug use in Clondalkin is perceived to have become more problematic. The prevalence survey suggested that there are greater quantities and varieties of drugs available and there has been an increase in the proportion of younger people using drugs than {{was the case in the}} past. The respondents to the survey feel that drug dealing has become more visible in the locality. Drug consumption mostly occurs in the user’s place of residence and the first encounter with illicit drugs typically occurred in the company of friends. Heroin is the overwhelming primary problematic drug of use. Yet, there has been a notable increase in the problematic use of cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs. Cocaine has become a frequently used recreational drug in Clondalkin. There is some indication in the survey that crack cocaine is an emerging problem drug. The survey highlights how polydrug use is the norm. There are a wide variety of polydrug use patterns: heroin combined with either cannabis, cocaine, benzodiazepines, alcohol or crack cocaine, are the most common patterns of use. The typical pattern for recreational drug users was cocaine combined with either cannabis or alcohol. The injection of cocaine by injecting heroin users was another emerging trend. This research suggests there are 1, 591 opiate users in the area. Heroin was overwhelmingly the main problem drug for this cohort. The typical problematic drug user (especially opiates) in Clondalkin is most commonly a male, Irish, single, unemployed, <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> between the ages of 15 and 24 years. The MQI research indicates that in contrast to heroin users, recreational cocaine users come from all age groups and all social strata. The majority of problem drug users do not seek treatment until their late twenties and early thirties. This research suggests that there is an obvious lack of data available on drug use among ethnic minorities. This emerges through the lack of engagement by those from new communities with existing treatment services and also lack of general knowledge on the part of community and statutory services of the profile of new communities in Clondalkin. This report reveals that the causes of drug problems were perceived as wide, differed depending on the respondent’s relationship with drugs and ranged across a number of factors such as contact with problematic drug use; family dysfunction; lack of education, low self-esteem and peer influences; curiosity, adolescent experimentation and an awareness of the pleasurable aspects of drug use. Hepatitis C is quite prevalent among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) according to the survey. In addition, one fifth of those interviewed had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness and have accessed mental health services. A significant minority of IDUs reported not being aware of needle exchange services in Clondalkin. MQI also show that there was a marginal decrease in the numbers of individuals accessing drug treatment services over the three year period, 2004 - 2007. It is perceived that services have improved over the past 5 years, due to the increase of facilities. Criticisms of current services included the lack of a ‘moving on’ or progression mechanism as well as the lack of input of clients to their drug treatment. There was widespread agreement that there is a lack of drug treatment services in the Clondalkin area and insufficient numbers of detoxification programmes available. The research also suggests that there is a clear need for a local homeless service in order to provide suitable facilities for homeless drug users. There was a perception that drug related violence has increased significantly in recent years. There was a notable increase in simple possession and possession for sale and supply incidents from 2005 to 2006. Participants in the research perceived that there is a lack of Garda personnel dedicated to tackling drug related crime in Clondalkin. The effects of drug problems on families include: physical and psychological stress; financial burden of payment of drug debts; grandparents who are taking care of their grandchildren; and, concerns for children of drug users in relation to their early exposure to drug addiction. The effects of drug problems on the community include: the crime element of drug use and the openness of dealing; fear of using public amenities; and that community anti-drug activism appears to have diminished due to fatigue...|$|E
40|$|In September 1969, {{data was}} {{collected}} on the fourteen year old pupils from two rural and two urban {{high schools in the}} Wanganui and Manawatu region. From the school records information was obtained on race, previous attendance, date of birth, history of audio-testing, and form. Non-Maori pupils were reduced by random selection so that they make up 75 per cent of the sample. All Maori pupils were included and make up 25 per cent of the sample. The total sample of 232 pupils were given a battery of tests which included reading comprehension, verbal and performance intelligence tests, a school interest inventory, a personality test and a general questionaire. Maori pupils had poorer reading comprehension and lower verbal and performance I. Q. 's than non-Maori pupils. A year after testing was carried out, the schools were contacted and they indicated which of the pupils examined had left school. It was found that 21 Maori pupils (37 per cent of the Maori sample) and 20 non-Maori pupils (11 per cent of the non-Maori sample) were early school leavers. Data was then analysed. Sex of pupil, mother's employment, attendance, the socio-economic status of the father's occupation and pupil's expressed attitude toward school were not found to be related to early school leaving. Nor was early school leaving related to sense of belonging and sense of personal worth. When all of the early school leavers were compared to all the continuers, leavers had poorer verbal and performance I. Q. 's. Leavers had poorer reading comprehension than continuers. Early school leavers at the age of fourteen had less school interest than continuers. Early leavers showed lesser aspirations in their vocational and educational plans than continuers at the age of fourteen. Audio-history was found to be related to early leaving and those pupils who failed an audio test at some stage of their schooling had a 44 per cent chance of becoming early school leavers as compared to an 18 per cent chance for the average pupil. More early school leavers came from urban areas than rural areas. When all the early school leavers were compared to all the continuers on personality adjustment it was found that leavers tended to have a poorer personal and social adjustment. Leavers showed poorer adjustment than continuers in self reliance, sense of personal freedom, freedom from withdrawal tendencies, freedom from nervous symptoms, and total personal adjustment. Socially leavers tended to have poorer social standards, more acting out or anti-social tendencies, poorer family, school, and community relationships than pupils who continued on at high school. Early school leavers tended to be poorer than continuers in their social adjustment and in their overall adjustment. Maori early school leaving was found to be significantly higher for urban schools. Maori pupils were {{three times more likely to}} become early school leavers than the non-Maori pupil. Only a few significant differences were found between Maori early school leavers and Maori continuers. Maori early school leavers scored significantly lower on performance I. Q. tests but were approximately equal to Maori continuers on verbal intelligence tests. Maori leavers had poorer reading comprehension than Maori continuers. For the Maori male, school interest was found to be negatively related to early leaving but no significant difference was found for Maori females. Maori early school leavers had poorer adjustment than Maori continuers in just two areas-social standards and total social adjustment. The non-Maori <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leaver</b> had a poorer I. Q. on both verbal and performance tests than the non-Maori continuer. The non-Maori leaver had poorer reading comprehension than the non-Maori continuer. When personality adjustments were taken into account, it was found that the non-Maori leaver had more withdrawal tendencies, more nervous symptoms, poorer school adjustment, poorer personal and total adjustment than the non-Maori continuer. The non-Maori leaver was more likely to see his parents as leaving the decision to him whether he left or not while the non-Maori continuer most often saw his parents wanting him to spend three full years at school. It was also found that male non-Maori leavers at the age of fourteen showed less school interest than male non-Maori continuers. Although there were approximately equal numbers of male and female early leavers, sex differences were noted between some independent variables and early school leaving. Audio-history was related to early leaving for the male sample. Form retardedness was found to be only related to early school leaving for the female group. The percentage of subjects liked was also found to be related to early school leaving but by only the male group. When personality differences between early school leavers and continuers were considered by sex, in most areas the results for males and females were consistent. In only two areas were sex differences noted. Female leavers had more anti-social tendencies than female continuers while the differences for the male were not significant. Male early school leavers had poorer self reliance than male continuers while the differences between the females were not significant. Socio-economic matching showed only a minor lessening of the significance of race as a factor in early school leaving. Socio-economic factors in themselves are only one of a number of variables that influence early school leaving. The danger of generalising from profiles was noted. While as a whole early school leavers had poorer reading comprehension, twenty five per cent of leavers scored above the mean of continuers. Although leavers generally had lower verbal and performance I. Q. 's still fifteen per cent scored at or above the mean for continuers. Early school leavers cannot be stereotyped into one pattern. It was concluded that each high school should study the needs and characteristics of its own early school leavers as the local cultural setting may have its own significant influence. There is a need for more research into the area of early school leaving in the New Zealand setting...|$|E

To the extent that country level variation in the labour market integration of <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> can be attributed to specific institutional and macro-structural characteristics, it enriches the single cross-national definition of <b>early</b> <b>school</b> leaving, and points towards best practices that can be learned from. The overarching research question that runs through this thesis is twofold. To what extent is the labour market integration of <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> in Europe obstructed by the country-specific macro-structural factors underlying a knowledge economy? And, second, can the various education and labour market policies across the European countries help to decrease the relative labour market disadvantage of <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers?</b> The concept of <b>early</b> <b>school</b> leaving, the process of ranking and rating countries on the basis of institutional and macro-structural characteristics, and the increasing availability of standardised country level indicators have all developed through a cross-fertilisation of academic research and EU policy making, which is why this thesis draws upon both the empirical literature and the Lisbon objectives when arguing the relevance of the research and formulating its conclusions. Using the ESS, the ECHP, and the EU-SILC, this thesis addresses the cross-level influences of educational expansion, skill-biased occupational change, the type and quality of the education and training system, and labour market policies.

The participants in this On Track longitudinal survey comprised 2346 Year 12 or equivalent completers and 1130 <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers.</b> These young people were first contacted in 2008 as part of the annual On Track survey and were interviewed in each subsequent year until 2011. In the first year after leaving school, 70 % of Year 12 or equivalent completers were participating in education and training, comprising 39 % at university, 20 % studying for a certificate and 11 % in an apprenticeship or traineeship. By the fourth year of the study, 93 % of Year 12 or equivalent completers had participated in some form of education and training, including 56 % who had attended university for at least one year. Among <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers,</b> 78 % had participated in education in the four years. In the first year after leaving school, 56 % were in education and training. Apprenticeship was {{the most common form of}} education and training among <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} {{evidence}} of positive interactions between schools and community sheds in Australia to examine {{what it is}} about shed-based community programs and pedagogies that are attractive to some <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> and <b>school</b> resisters. It is based primarily on interview data from the subset of men’s sheds across Australia with school programs that formed part of our 2007 research into men’s sheds. It is complemented by insights from interviews with men’s sheds participants and rural fire volunteers about what it was that also led many of them to also ‘shed’ <b>school</b> <b>early.</b> Our paper identifies links between the success factors associated with informal learning pedagogies in voluntary and community groups identified in the UK and success factors associated with community-based shed programs in Australia. We identify the potential benefits of sheds in engaging both <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> and older men with negative recollections of school, in enjoyable, regular, hands-on activity. We also discuss ways in which some of the difficulties associated with shed-based school programs that seek to engage and reintegrate <b>early</b> <b>school</b> <b>leavers</b> might be avoided or minimised. Finally, we pose some unanswered questions about the implications of our research findings for education and training providers...|$|R
