25|$|Armstrong {{was playing}} a gig at the Brick House in Gretna, Louisiana when he met Daisy Parker, a local prostitute. He started the affair as a client. He {{returned}} to Gretna on several occasions to visit her. Eventually he <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> look for her home {{in order to see}} her away from work. It was on this occasion that he found out that she had a common-law husband. Not long after this fiasco, Daisy journeyed to Armstrong's home on Perdido Street. They checked into Kid Green's hotel that evening, and the next day, March 19, 1918, at the age of 16, Louis and Daisy married at City Hall. They adopted a 3-year-old boy, Clarence Armstrong, whose mother, Louis' cousin Flora, died soon after giving birth. Clarence Armstrong was mentally disabled (the result of a head injury at an early age) and Louis would {{spend the rest of his}} life taking care of him. Louis' marriage to Parker failed quickly and they separated in 1923.|$|E

But here you are, free, with the whole world before you, and your last danger disappearing with the {{knowledge}} that I am ready to be your friend and am sensible about everything that has happened. This ought to be an immense relief to you, Philip. You ought to be the happiest man on earth. And there you sit, looking like a death's-head! Look at me for a moment like a human being, can't you? Drink some more wine. There must be some strength, some manhood about you somewhere, or you couldn't have done what you have done." ...|$|R
50|$|After the October Revolution in 1917, Edith and her mother's {{economic}} {{assets were}} suddenly rendered worthless {{since they had}} been placed in Ukrainian securities; and soon after, from the spring of 1918, the Karelian Isthmus became a war zone. In Petrograd (as St. Petersburg was called from 1914), people were being shot without trial, and Södergran knew that several of her classmates had fled from the city.

60|$|It {{is perhaps}} {{needless to say}} that Mrs. Carr had never been more in earnest in her life than when she {{announced}} her intention of departing to the Isle of Wight. The discovery that her suspicions about Arthur had but too sure a foundation had been a crushing blow to her hopes, and she had formed a wise resolution to see no more of him. Happy {{would it have been}} for her, if she could have <b>found</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> act up to it, and go away, a wiser, if a sadder, woman. But this was not to be. The more she contemplated it, the more did her passion --which was now both wild and deep--take hold upon her heart, eating into it like acid into steel, and graving one name there in ineffaceable letters. She could not bear the thought of parting from him, and felt, or thought she felt, that her happiness was already too deeply pledged to allow her to throw up the cards without an effort.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{separation}} of Church and State was a traumatic event for France, this article argues that its legal product—the Law of 1905 —was and remains respectful of religious freedom. By considering the relevant literature and by reviewing the key laws and judicial decisions on the matter, this article also suggests that, for France, laïcité represented ‘the other Enlightenment’, that is to say, a moment when national identity was reawakened, if not formed anew. The piece concludes {{that the reason for}} this lies in the fact that, in 1905, France’s <b>Founding</b> Fathers had <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> distance <b>the</b> country’s bloody religious past from its legal system, thus producing a statute (the Law of Separation) and a concept (laïcité) that fostered tolerance rather than conflict. </p...|$|R

After talking about how much {{they want to go}} to the Top 3, the judges criticize their pictures: Elly demonstrates great body expression, elegance and an absolute control, showing her best work; Malana brings back her lightness in the photos; Maíra showed a bad angle of her face, a harmonious set, but weak and has not yet <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and conviction <b>to</b> be a model, still evolving, but is unstable.

About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I {{ever thought about}} my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that.

40|$|The {{single biggest}} {{influence}} on {{this work is}} Nur Touba, who got me started {{in the field of}} design automation for VLSI. Nur's unflagging support and encouragement have sustained and driven me throughout the last five years. To the extent that the work presented herein is worthy of credit, Nur deserves a large portion of that credit. His standards in professionalism, integrity, and honesty have raised the bar of excellence for me to follow. Another important influence is Gustavo De Veciana, whose professional life is grounded in a deep understanding of and love for electrical engineering and the teaching and learning process. Words cannot do justice to express all that Gustavo's mentoring has come to mean to me. Thanks also to Margarida Jacome, not just for her support on my dissertation committee, but also for her encouragement and particularly forceful endorsement that has helped me embark on a career in academics. I must also thank Dinos Moundanos and Jawahar Jain for their part in making my stay at and collaborations with the Fujitsu Laboratories of America highly productive. It was there that I took my first tentative steps into the world of research and there that I <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> and confidence <b>to</b> pursue my own ideas.

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{practical}} {{guide to the}} everyday actions and decisions that anyone can take to promote gender equality and social justice in their own life and the world around them. “I’m for equal rights but I’m not some radical feminist. ” It is a common sentiment, as people seek to avoid the aggressive, man-hating connotations that “feminist” unfairly carries. For in reality, {{by far the largest}} part of feminist activism today is moderate, respectful, and thoughtful, the sum total of a million individual decisions, actions, and encounters. Beyond Burning Bras: Feminist Activism for Everyone is an antidote to the poison of shock jocks who caricature the women’s movement as a radical fringe of man-haters and paint activists as spoiled hooligans. Two real-life feminist activists, Laura Finley and Emily Stringer focus on the mainstream of everyday feminism, explaining what feminism is really all about and fanning out a spectrum of simple, imaginative, user-friendly ways in which ordinary readers can promote gender equality and social equity in their own lives and in the world around them. Beyond Burning Bras taps the life stories and first-person accounts of 50 ordinary individuals of every age, sex, sexuality, class, nationality, race, ethnicity, and learning style. All of them tell how they <b>found</b> within themselves <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> take a stand {{on the front lines of}} feminist activism, whether in subtle private ways or in life-changing public ways. After a survey of the history of feminism in the United States, the authors and contributors show in successive chapters how feminism today meshes with other forms of activism relating to the workplace, sexual violence, the environment, politics, human bodies, the arts, youth, empowerment, and mothering...|$|R
60|$|She was not {{surprised}} by the answer--her suspicion of the priest had remained in her mind from the night of Lady Loring's ball.

60|$|I {{wished to}} go in and look at him but I had not <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the {{theatrical}} advertisements in the shopwindows as I went. I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever <b>found</b> in himself <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> undertake them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate questions. Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice. Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip--a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.|$|R

She encountered negro shanties turned into studios, with orange curtains and pots of mignonette; marble houses on New Hampshire Avenue, with butlers and limousines; and men who looked like fictional explorers and aviators.
