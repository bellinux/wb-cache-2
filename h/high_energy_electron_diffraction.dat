50|$|Analytical {{techniques}} such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and reflection <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> (RHEED), have been extensively used to monitor SK growth. AES data obtained in situ during film growth in a number model systems, such as Pd/W(100), Pb/Cu(110), Ag/W(110), and Ag/Fe(110), show characteristic segmented curves like those presented in figure 4. Height of the film Auger peaks plotted {{as a function of}} surface coverage Θ, initially exhibits a straight line, which is indicative of AES data for FM growth. There is a clear break point at a critical adsorbate surface coverage followed by another linear segment at a reduced slope. The paired break point and shallow line slope is characteristic of island nucleation; a similar plot for FM growth would exhibit many such line and break pairs while a plot of the VW mode would be a single line of low slope. In some systems, reorganization of the 2D wetting layer results in decreasing AES peaks with increasing adsorbate coverage. Such situations arise when many adatoms are required to reach a critical nucleus size on the surface and at nucleation the resulting adsorbed layer constitutes a significant fraction of a monolayer. After nucleation, metastable adatoms on the surface are incorporated into the nuclei, causing the Auger signal to fall. This phenomenon is particularly evident for deposits on a molybdenum substrate.|$|E

In addition a strong deviation from a Debye model was observed in the scattered intensity of the Bragg reflections. This deviation from the harmonic approximation occurs well below the roughening transition temperature. The behavior of the three metal surfaces is qualitatively similar except for the transition temperatures.

A lineshape analysis of the (00) reflection shows the transition from a Lorentzian lineshape to a power law.

The SPA-LEED patterns reveal more than 500 individual diffraction spots in the k-vector range of |k∥| < 3 Å- 1. The positions of all observed diffraction spots agree with the surface projections of the reciprocal lattice structure of the type-I bulk phase. HAS shows identical spot positions as SPA-LEED, thus demonstrating a top surface layer with long range quasicrystalline order and a reciprocal lattice structure consistent {{with that of a}} bulk truncated surface. SPA-LEED peak widths are found to vary between different diffraction orders. Based on an analysis of a randomized Fibonacci sequence, this is linked to the random nature of the tiling of the type-I structure. STM measurements reveal a surface morphology characterized by rough single-height steps separating terraces with widths on the order of 100 Å. Two different surface terminations are observed, a coarse and a fine one, frequently coexisting on single terraces. The fine structure termination directly reflects the atomic structure of a bulk truncated surface, allowing a random rhombic tiling to be identified. In order to compare diffraction, real-space data, and atomic structure models, the Patterson function and autocorrelation of the surface structure, respectively, are studied. This allows an understanding of the coarse structure termination as consisting of subunits of a few atoms each arranged statistically on sites defined by the atomic tiling of the bulk tenfold planes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} high quality Te on misoriented Si(100) is {{important}} as an intermediate phase for epitaxial growth of CdTe. The misorientation angle {{plays a key role}} in the growth quality of CdTe/Si(100); this incited the curiosity to investigate the effect of the misorientation angle on the topography of the surface structure of Si(100). The main goal is to show the relation between the misorientation angle, the terrace width and the step height distributions. HRLEED (<b>High</b> Resolution Low <b>Energy</b> <b>Electron</b> <b>Diffraction)</b> provides information in reciprocal space while STM gives real space topographic images of the surface structure. STM and HRLEED measurements were performed on Si(100) with misorientation angle {var_theta} = 0. 5 {degree}, 1. 5 {degree} and 8 {degree} towards the [110] direction and {var_theta} = 4 {degree} towards the [130] direction. Except for the 8 {degree} misorientation in which case a regular step array with diatomic step height was observed, for the other misorientations the terrace width was variable. The average terrace width decreased with increasing misorientation angle. A mixture of diatomic and monatomic step heights was observed on the 0. 5 {degree} and 1. 5 {degree} misoriented Si(100) samples. It proves that one can not assume purely monatomic step height for low misorientation angles. The results do not agree with the belief that at low miscut angle A and B terraces are equal and that as the misorientation angle increases the B terrace tends to be wider than the A terrace. In fact, pairing of terraces was not observed at all. Te was deposited at a substrate temperature of 200 C. The authors observed a significant reduction in the terrace widths for all miscut angles...|$|R
