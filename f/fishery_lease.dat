40|$|Angling for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{a popular}} {{recreational}} activity and provides income for Norwegian landowners holding fishing rights. Abundance and distribution of salmon have however declined markedly during the last 30 years. The recreational salmon fishery is a highly interesting meeting place for natural resources management, delegation of rights and responsibilities, and economic development in rural areas. Landowners are key actors in this regard by having {{a wide range of}} roles being farm owners, holders of fishing rights, suppliers of angling, tourist hosts, owners and managers of salmon habitat, and comanagers of salmon stocks through statuary river owner organizations. Landowners have limited angling tourism resources, and share salmon management responsibilities, making collective-action by the landowner group important. The recreational salmon fishery which both salmon and landowners are parts of {{can be viewed as a}} social-ecological system where there is reciprocity between salmon as a resource and landowners regarding angling tourism,management and conservation of salmon stocks. The main objectives of the thesis were 1) to identify constraints and 2) make recommendations about management of salmon stocks and development of angling tourism in Norway with an emphasis on private small scale landowners. Secondary objectives were to: a) reveal landowners’ objectives and which variables influence these objectives; b) analyze landowners’ profit efficiency; c) analyze risk sources in angling tourism and landowners’ risk management strategies; d) identify different types of landowners, their priority of management actions to strengthen salmon stocks and attitudes to river owner organizations’ work. The objectives were addressed through a study of the recreational salmon fishery in four major salmon rivers in the Trondheim fjord region of mid-Norway. Empirical results were based on a postal questionnaire survey sent landowners in the Gaula, Orkla, Stjørdal and Verdal rivers. Data analyses included use of multiple regressions, factor analysis, binary logistic regression, cluster analysis, and a stochastic profit frontier function. The study revealed a heterogeneous landowner group regarding quality of the fishing rights, farm and landowner characteristics, and objectives about the fishing right. Heterogeneity is generally a problem for cooperation and coordination. Several distinct landowner types were identified: the passive owner, the recreationist, the multiobjective owner, and the economist. Marginalization of angling income reduces profit efficiency in supply of angling tourism. The ongoing trend with more landowners taking off-farm work or not living on the farm may lead to future landowners emphasizing the recreational function of the fishing right and other farm resources rather than the business function. Thereby, profit efficiency would decrease and less fishing could be available for anglers and have consequences for rural tourism. Policies should therefore facilitate development of specialized fishing tourism enterprises by making it easier to rent and acquire fishing rights. Thus could be done by e. g. legislating a minimum period for lease of rights. Mandatory organization of landowners in river owner organizations and introducing a minimum size for beats could also reduce some of the problems caused by heterogeneity in the landowner group. Reduced angling season and changes in strength of salmon runs salmon were seen as having the largest impact on future income from salmon angling tourism. Measures to strengthen salmon stocks might therefore be the most important measure to promote angling tourism, as this ensures that angling can take place and reduces landowners’ investment risk. Landowners used a multiple of strategies to secure household income. Salmon related strategies were least important probably because of the overall limited profit from angling (average NOK 30, 000 per landowner), and the top risk sources being beyond individual landowner control. Reduce problems from salmon farming and stop the spread of the Gyrodactylus salaris (Malmberg) parasite were seen as the biggest threats to salmon stocks. The river owner organizations have little influence over unfavorable conditions in the ocean. Landowners could maximize natural smolt production in the rivers to mitigate these effects and show that they take their share of salmon conservation. Management of habitat and regulation of the fishery to ensure enough spawners are key issues. The high priority of stocking and low priority of catch and release show the apparently irrationality of landowners in prioritizing management actions to secure stocks. This demonstrates a need for knowledge building in the landowner group and for improved communication between scientists, government, river owner organizations and landowners about the effects of stocking and other management actions. The many landowners being negative to the net <b>fishery</b> <b>lease</b> might be due to a lack of information from the river owner organization but also the unfamiliarity with paying for conservation, a concept being new for landowners that historically may have taken salmon for granted. The results from this study might be useful also for understanding how landowners view other natural resources on their farm and the effects on resource management, conservation and economic development...|$|E
