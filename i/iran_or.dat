The United States government has long been resistant to the use of PRC launch services by American industry due to concerns over alleged civilian technology transfer that could have dual-use military applications to countries such as North Korea, <b>Iran</b> <b>or</b> Syria, and announced an official embargo against the PRC in 2000. Thus, financial retaliatory measures have been taken on many occasions against several Chinese space companies.|$|E
25|$|Individuals of Iranian {{nationality}} {{resident in}} Iran are subject to tax on all their income whether earned in <b>Iran</b> <b>or</b> abroad. Foreign nationals working in Iran are also {{subject to the same}} income tax based on their salary. Non-resident individuals are liable to pay tax only on their Iranian-sourced income. Foreign employees cannot obtain an exit visa from Iran unless they provide proof that they have paid their due taxes, and since they need to obtain an exit permit when their presence in Iran is based on a work permit, the government can easily enforce this rule. The government assumes a certain salary for employees depending on their position and country of origin. The assumed minimum monthly salaries in 2004 range from US$2,500 for unskilled European workers to US$7,000 for European managing directors.|$|E
25|$|Abdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara {{ethnic group}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century due to their fierce {{rebellion}} against the Afghan king gave birth to an intense feeling of hatred between the Pashtun and the Hazara that would last for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and Daychopan, continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, Mashhad (Iran) and Quetta (Pakistan). It is estimated that more than 60% of the Hazara were either massacred or displaced during Abdur Rahman's campaign against them. Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns and as a result many Hazara families had to move seasonally to the major cities in Afghanistan, <b>Iran,</b> <b>or</b> Pakistan in order to find jobs and sources of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|The {{turning point}} from cold peace toward hostility {{occurred}} in the early 1990s, shortly {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union and defeat of the Iraqi Army during Desert Storm, after which distribution of relative power shifted towards Iran and Israel and formed a nascent bipolar structure in the Middle East. The conflict escalated in the early 1990s, as Yitzhak Rabin's government adopted a more aggressive posture on Iran. Rhetorical conflict additionally heated up during the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who made inflammatory statements against Israel. Other factors which have contributed to the escalation of tensions include Iran's development of nuclear technology relative to Israel's long-stated Begin Doctrine, Iranian funding of groups like Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, and alleged involvement in terrorist attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the 1994 AMIA bombing, alleged Israeli support for groups like People's Mujahedin of <b>Iran</b> <b>or</b> Jundallah and alleged covert operations in Iran including assassinations and explosions.|$|E
25|$|In April 1959 Iran {{altered the}} legal status of the strait by {{expanding}} its territorial sea to 12-nautical-mile (22km) and declaring that it would recognize only transit by innocent passage through the newly expanded area. In July 1972, Oman expanded its territorial sea to 12nm by decree. Thus, by mid-1972, the Strait of Hormuz was completely “closed” by the combined territorial waters of Iran and Oman. During the 1970s, neither <b>Iran</b> <b>or</b> Oman attempted to impede the passage of warships through the strait, but in the 1980s, both countries asserted claims that were different with customary (old) law. Upon ratifying UNCLOS in August 1989, Oman submitted declarations confirming its 1981 royal decree that only innocent passage is permitted through its territorial sea. The declarations further asserted that prior permission was required before foreign warships could pass through Omani territorial waters. Upon signing the convention in December 1982, Iran entered a declaration stating “that only states parties to the Law of the Sea Convention shall be entitled to benefit from the contractual rights created therein”, including “the right of transit passage through straits used for international navigation”. In May 1993, Iran enacted a comprehensive law on maritime areas, several provisions of which conflict with UNCLOS provisions, including a requirement that warships, submarines, and nuclear-powered ships obtain permission before exercising innocent passage through Iran’s territorial waters.The United States does not recognize any of the claims by Oman and Iran and has contested each of them.|$|E
25|$|Local {{elections}} {{were held in}} 1987. It began when the government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties, {{announced that it would}} be prepared to share power with representatives of opposition groups {{in the event of a}} coalition government, and issued a new constitution providing for a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), consisting of a Senate (Sena) and a House of Representatives (Wolesi Jirga), and a president to be indirectly elected to a 7-year term. The new political parties had to oppose colonialism, imperialism, neo-colonialism, Zionism, racial discrimination, apartheid and fascism. Najibullah stated that only the extremist part of the opposition could not join the planned coalition government. No parties had to share the PDPA's policy or ideology, but they could not oppose the bond between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. A parliamentary election was held in 1988. The PDPA won 46 seats in the House of Representatives and controlled the government with support from the National Front, which won 45 seats, and from various newly recognized left-wing parties, which had won a total of 24 seats. Although the election was boycotted by the Mujahideen, the government left 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, as well as a small number of seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would end their armed struggle and participate in the government. The only armed opposition party to make peace with the government was Hizbollah, a small Shi'a party not to be confused with the bigger party in <b>Iran</b> <b>or</b> the Lebanese organization.|$|E
