5000|$|... ==Technology== Stabilization ponds {{consist of}} {{man-made}} basins comprising a single or several series of anaerobic, facultative or maturation ponds. The primary treatment {{takes place in}} the anaerobic pond, which is mainly designed for removing suspended solids, and some of the soluble element of organic matter (BOD). During the secondary stage in the <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> most of the remaining BOD is removed through the coordinated activity of algae and heterotrophic bacteria. The main function of the tertiary treatment in the maturation pond is the removal of pathogens, although it also assists in nutrient reduction (i.e. nitrogen).|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} methods {{available}} {{for the design of}} waste stabilization ponds.

Nevertheless, while <b>facultative</b> <b>ponds</b> typically treat BOD, maturation ponds remove fecal coliform, pathogens, and nutrients (Cinara 2004). In comparison with the other pond types, {{the characteristics of the}} maturation pond include a depth range between 1 and 1.15  m (Kayombo et al. 2010), which makes it shallower than all of the ponds besides the aerobic. Generally, maturation ponds maintain anaerobic conditions (Martinez et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Background: Yazd waste {{stabilization}} pond facilities consist of three {{stabilization pond}} systems, module 1, module 2 and module 3 that AWSP module 1 has started its operation. The existing facilities have had several {{problems in their}} operation. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the performance of stabilization ponds in wastewater treatment {{of the city of}} Yazd, due to several problems in their operation, and to prepare a scheme of its upgrading, if necessary. Methods: During the period from December to June 2010, data analysis were carried out for both raw and treated wastewater. Results: Results of these investigations showed that the average effluent concentrations of Biochemical Oxygen Demand 5 (BOD 5), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Suspended Solid (SS) taken from anaerobic <b>pond</b> and secondary <b>facultative</b> <b>ponds</b> of module 1 were 306. 9, 135. 18, 139. 75 and 136. 75, 69. 025, 136. 5 mg/L, respectively. Conclusion: These results indicated that the effluent of the anaerobic pond of module 1 was complied with the Iranian treated wastewater standards for agricultural reuse in terms of BOD 5 and COD concentrations; hence the secondary <b>facultative</b> <b>ponds</b> could be changed to other primary <b>facultative</b> <b>ponds</b> in order to increase the capacity of wastewater treatment plant. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} for the digestion of organic matter in facultative ponds in tropical regions. Complete mixing has been assumed for the aerobic and anaerobic compartments. Settling, aerobic layer oxidation, and anaerobic layer methanogenesis are the main processes for organic matter removal in the water column. Exchange processes between layers are dispersive or soluble exchange, solubilization and transport of organic matter from sediments to water column are also taken into account. Degradation of organic matter in the sediments produces gaseous emissions to the water column. The exchange between bubbles ascending and the water column was measured. The model was calibrated with data obtained from a pilot <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> built in Muña Reservoir in Bogotá. The pond was sampled during 4 months to compare data between its water hyacinth covered section and uncovered section. The results clearly show {{the relative importance of}} different BOD removal processes in facultative ponds and suggest modifications to further improve performance. The results from the model suggest that internal loadings to facultative ponds due to solubilization and return of organic matter from the sediments to the aerobic layer greatly influence the soluble BOD effluent concentration. Aerobic degradation activity in the <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> does not affect significantly the effluent concentration. Anaerobic degradation activity in the <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> can more easily achieve increases in the removal efficiencies of BOD.

30|$|A <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> is a {{treatment}} unit with anaerobic and aerobic conditions. A typical pond {{is divided into}} an aerobic surface region consisting of bacteria and algae, an anaerobic bottom region, consisting of anaerobic bacteria, and a region in between anaerobic and aerobic conditions where bacteria can thrive in both conditions (Kayombo et al. 2010; Joint Departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force 1988). If used in series, effluent from a previously treated source enters the pond (Quiroga 2011; Kayombo et al. 2010). Facultative ponds treat BOD, typically within a range of 100 – 400  kg BOD/ha/day, by removing BOD by 95  %. Because facultative ponds employ algae as decomposers, the treatment time can range between 2 and 3  weeks, which is attributed to the photosynthetic processes that occur within the unit. A <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> on average has a depth of 1 – 2  m (Kayombo et al. 2010).|$|E

The Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados has a {{wastewater}} treatment plant for “Las Lomas” urbanization in Buenos Aires, Puntarenas. This plant is a single <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> which presents microalgae overproduction that generates {{a reduction in the}} effluent quality, causes operational problems and also does not comply with the national legislation. Therefore, current <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> was evaluated by major design parameters for facultative ponds, to recommend a potential solution for improvement to optimize the treatment of wastewater. Evaluation of the current <b>facultative</b> <b>pond,</b> based on average daily flow of 40 m 3 /day and 50 m 3 /day maximum daily, resulted in major problems, such as, L/A ratio, the surface loading rate and, most importantly, the detention time. Subsequently, the actual area required for treatment of this wastewater was calculated, based on the maximum daily flow, is 725 m 2. Then, different scenarios were evaluated in the same way. It was evaluated: two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second one a maturation pond); two ponds in series (the first facultative and the second a macrophyte pond) and three ponds (two facultative in parallel and one a maturation pond). Then, was calculated the approximate cost to implement these proposal (including all costs of removing sludge, lagoon waterproofing, structural work, mechanical installation and other indirect and additional costs), which resulted in required an investment of $ 78. 400, 00; $ 118. 300, 00 y $ 90. 100, 00 for the proposals 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} on the algal community structure in waste stabilisation ponds is limited {{and it is}} unclear how physical–chemical changes affect the algal community structure and the treatment performance of waste stabilisation ponds. In the present paper we studied the spatial distribution of the algal community in a waste stabilisation pond in Cuenca (Ecuador) and found that the distribution was associated with the BOD concentration of the system. At the upstream end of the <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> where the BOD value is relatively high (74 mg L− 1), the community is dominated by motile algal species such as Euglena and Cryptophytes. More downstream, the algal community is more evenly distributed (G = 0. 26 > 0. 18) and also non-motile species such as Chlorophytes and Chrysophytes are present. Throughout the ponds, the reduction of motile algal species was associated with the decrease in BOD concentration. The dominance of Chlorophyta, Chrysophyta and Euglenophyta was highly associated with BOD concentration. Furthermore, it was concluded that the algal abundance (45541 cells mL− 1), diversity (D = 0. 85), evenness (G = 0. 26) and richness (20. 97) of the community in the maturation pond were higher than those of the <b>facultative</b> <b>pond.</b> The results of this research are valuable for {{a better understanding of the}} algae-based processes in waste stabilisation ponds.

50|$|When being {{designed}} {{there are}} several factors that go into planning the build such as climate of the region, cost {{and the best way}} to process the waste in the water. Once the pond has been designed the next thing that must be considered is the location of the pond. The size depends on the type of wastewater entering the pond, the type of pond and location in order to begin to size it. Depths usually range from between four and twenty feet deep with the type of bacteria and total amount of waste the plant must treat being the determining factor in the design of depth. With a key factor in determination of size being how much wastewater is going to be treated by the pond the question of how much surface area is needed varies from a few thousand feet to many acres. Anaerobic ponds must be designed to be far deeper than either aerobic or <b>facultative</b> <b>ponds,</b> this is in order to decrease the oxygen levels in the deeper parts of the ponds so the bacteria can do their jobs, eating the waste. Aerobic ponds must be shallower with a great surface area so that more oxygen can dissolve into the water giving the bacteria enough oxygen to properly function. <b>Facultative</b> <b>ponds</b> meet somewhere in the middle in their design with a large surface area and a fairly deep design to allow for both bacteria to function properly.Usually, common reed or Phragmites australis are used in treatment ponds (e.g., in greywater treatment systems to purify wastewater). In self-purifying water reservoirs (used to purify rainwater), other plants are used as well. These reservoirs need to be filled with 1/4 lavastones and water-purifying plants.|$|R

The results were used to generate residence time distribution curves and provide an estimate of mean residence time in the system. The data was used to examine hydraulic efficiency as it relates to short-circuiting and dead zones. A sludge study accumulation study was performed using the white towel method and the resulting measurements were interpolated to determine a total estimated sludge volume of 169 m 3 (which is 8 % of the <b>facultative</b> <b>pond</b> volume). An orange study was also performed to assess the surface flow pattern in the system. The results were compared with a computational 2 -d model. The 2 -d model incorporated the estimated sludge distribution and provided a good fit for the tracer dye concentrations measured in the field over the 12 day study period. Simple models such as the Tanks in Series and the Completely mixed model were evaluated and abandoned because of their inability to model the physical behavior in the system. The Completely mixed model did however perform better than the Plug flow model. After comparing the tracer results from the reactor models that were considered: Tanks in Series, Completely mixed fluid, manual interpolation and the results from the 2 -d cfd flow simulation, the results that provided the best fit for the data over 12 days was the manual interpolation method at a flow rate of 98 m 3 /day and configuration D at 60 m 3 /day. However, because of uncertainty as to what depth to obtain a representative area for the 2 -d simplification and sensitivity to flow; all four configurations were considered for estimating the MHRT at the lowest measured flow rate of 60 m 3 /day.

The filters were loaded hydraulically from 0. 25 million gallons per acre per day to 1. 0 million gallons per acre per day. It was found that sand size has a profound effect on the quality of effluent produced by filtration. Also, sand size was related to the time of operation before plugging occurred.

30|$|Wind {{patterns}} and wind speed control the overall removal of bacteria. Various studies compare wind speeds, direction, {{and also the}} implementation of baffles within the simulated waste stabilization ponds. The factors related to bacteria removal include the direction, speed of wind, {{and the presence of}} baffles, particularly L-shaped baffles, where winds blowing parallel to the inlet–outlet of the pond produce poorer results as compared to the orthogonal orientation of the pond. Nevertheless, the results may vary with increasing wind speeds (Badrot-Nico et al. 2010). Wind coupled with pond geometry can likewise have an impact on treatment performance. For example, in the aerobic layer of <b>facultative</b> <b>ponds</b> the presence of wind leads to vertical mixing and the distribution of dissolved oxygen, bacteria, algae, and BOD. This creates a quality effluent. However, without the wind, algae create a 20  cm-thick layer moving through 50  cm of the pond.
