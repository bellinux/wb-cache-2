5|$|It {{was first}} {{suggested}} in the 18th century that intracranial pressure rather than skull damage {{was the cause of}} pathology after TBI. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed around the end of the 19thcentury, and opening the skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} silver iodide would cause {{supercooled}} {{water in the}} storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E

50|$|Fisher's {{method is}} {{typically}} {{applied to a}} collection of independent test statistics, usually from separate studies having the same null hypothesis. The meta-analysis null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> {{that all of the}} separate null <b>hypotheses</b> <b>are</b> true. The meta-analysis alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> {{that at least one of}} the separate alternative <b>hypotheses</b> <b>is</b> true.|$|R

50|$|Misunderstandings of p-values are an {{important}} problem in scientific research and scientific education. P-values are often used or interpreted incorrectly. The data obtained by comparing the p-value to a significance level will yield one of two results: either the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected (which however {{does not imply that}} the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false), or the null <b>hypothesis</b> cannot <b>be</b> rejected at that significance level (which however does not imply that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true). In Ronald Fishers formulation, a low p-value means either that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true and a highly improbable event has occurred or that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false.|$|R
5|$|According to Tischendorf, Codex Sinaiticus {{was one of}} {{the fifty}} copies of the Bible {{commissioned}} from Eusebius by Roman Emperor Constantine after his conversion to Christianity (De vita Constantini, IV, 37).

5|$|After {{selecting}} the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, it was {{hypothesized}} that 15810 Arawn could be a quasi-satellite of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration. According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> disproven in 2016, when more-accurate observations of the position of Arawn were made by New Horizons.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} a null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> used {{differently}} in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher, a null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected if the observed data are significantly unlikely to have occurred if the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>were</b> true. In this case the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected and an alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> accepted in its place. If the data {{are consistent with the}} null hypothesis, then the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> not rejected. In neither case <b>is</b> the null <b>hypothesis</b> or its alternative proven; the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data are. This is analogous to the legal principle of presumption of innocence, in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).|$|R
25|$|Statistical <b>hypothesis</b> testing <b>is</b> a key {{technique}} of both frequentist inference and Bayesian inference, {{although the two}} types of inference have notable differences. Statistical hypothesis tests define a procedure that controls (fixes) the probability of incorrectly deciding that a default position (null <b>hypothesis)</b> <b>is</b> incorrect. The procedure is based on how likely it would be for a set of observations to occur if the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>were</b> true. Note that this probability of making an incorrect decision is not the probability that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true, nor whether any specific alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> true. This contrasts with other possible techniques of decision theory in which the null and alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>are</b> treated on a more equal basis.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> a conjecture, {{based on}} {{knowledge}} obtained while formulating the question, {{that may explain}} the observed behavior of {{a part of our}} universe. The <b>hypothesis</b> might <b>be</b> very specific, e.g., Einstein's equivalence principle or Francis Crick's [...] "DNA makes RNA makes protein", or it might be broad, e.g., unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans. A statistical <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> a conjecture about some population. For example, the population might be people with a particular disease. The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people. Terms commonly associated with statistical <b>hypotheses</b> <b>are</b> null <b>hypothesis</b> and alternative hypothesis. A null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the conjecture that the statistical <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false, e.g., that the new drug does nothing and that any cures are due to chance effects. Researchers normally want to show that the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> false. The alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> the desired outcome, e.g., that the drug does better than chance. A final point: a scientific <b>hypothesis</b> must <b>be</b> falsifiable, meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested.|$|R
5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Mathematical models {{show that}} the E ring is unstable, with a {{lifespan}} between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years; therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring, at its narrowest but highest density point. In the 1980s some suspected that Enceladus is {{the main source of}} particles for the ring. This <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
30|$|To {{describe}} the process qualitatively and quantitatively statistically, null <b>hypothesis</b> (H o) <b>is</b> defined assuming {{that it is}} true. An alternative <b>hypothesis</b> (H a) <b>is</b> defined {{at the same time}} keeping in view that alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> accepted, if the null <b>hypothesis</b> <b>is</b> rejected or vice-versa.

5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E

5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales.

For example, Veltmann (1870) demonstrated that Fresnel's formula implies that the aether {{would have to be}} dragged by different amounts for different colors of light, since the index of refraction depends on wavelength; Mascart (1872) demonstrated a similar result for polarized light traveling through a birefringent medium. In other words, the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time.|$|E

The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

An alternative <b>hypothesis</b> <b>was</b> presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, which found weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones.
