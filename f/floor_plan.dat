5|$|Foundation {{construction}} {{began in}} May 1896. However, work was stopped when Roberts took ill in August; he died the next January. The Panic of 1896 led Roberts' successor, Frank Thomson, not to continue work. When Thomson died in 1899, Alexander Cassatt was recalled to the PRR {{to serve as}} president. Cassatt immediately began a major capital improvement program, which included both adding capacity to mainlines and constructing large stations including Washington Union Station and New York Penn Station. Work resumed in 1900 with an enlarged <b>floor</b> <b>plan,</b> and the new station was complete in April 1901.|$|E

5|$|Ravenscroft {{commissioned}} the architect Thomas Edward Knightley {{to design the}} new hall. Using a <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> previously prepared by C. J. Phipps, Knightley designed a hall with a floor area of 21,000 square feet (2,000 m²) and an audience capacity of 2,500. Contemporary newspapers commented on the unusual elevation of the building, with the grand tier at street level, and the stalls and arena downstairs. The exterior carving was by Sidney W. Elmes and Son, and the furnishing was by Lapworth Brothers and Harrison. The lighting {{was a combination of}} gas and electricity.|$|E
5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in <b>floor</b> <b>plan,</b> the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade.|$|E
5|$|The Bacon Academy, nicknamed Old Bacon Academy, was the {{original}} Bacon Academy until 1993. The Old Bacon Academy was built in 1803 and is located at 84Main Street, Colchester, Connecticut. The main structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. Noted for its plain, utilitarian <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> consisting of two rooms off a central hall and stairway, the inside has seen some renovations throughout its history. The Day Hall, a contributing property purchased by the Bacon Academy trustees in 1929, is a church hall that {{was used for the}} high school until 1962.|$|E
40|$|This study {{constitutes}} {{a new approach}} to quantitative analysis of people's housing preferences. Using medium-sized apartments in Beijing as an example, seven <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> were developed and a questionnaire survey was conducted where the respondents were asked to decide between different pairs of <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> based on their own preferences. Based on the data, the spatial properties of the <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> were examined and sample families were classified by their attributes. Using a modeling approach, the preferences for housing <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> of various family groups were estimated and discussed in detail. The results demonstrated that privacy,' south-facing,' storage,' and number of rooms' were the critical means of evaluation of the <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> of medium-sized apartments. The preferences of different family groups differed significantly and most families were quite selective regarding <b>floor</b> <b>plans.</b> Thus, high-level customization is necessary in architectural design and information services. The preference indices revealed to what extent people were satisfied with different <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> and suggested precise ways to improve satisfaction with regard to layout plans. In addition, the results implied that, for apartments smaller than 90 m(2), essential functions or housing utility' must be given priority. In particular, a dining room and a study room were considered mandatory, but a separate storage room was not required...|$|R
40|$|All {{existing}} {{data sources}} used to reconstruct 3 D building models have certain restrictions. An eye-catching alternative is IndoorOSM, {{one of the}} most popular examples of the newly evolved crowdsourced geodata. The potential power of this rich and simple-formatted data source has been proven by many researches. However, a fatal flaw of IndoorOSM is also pointed out, which is its accuracy. Another promising data source that has been looked into is 2 D architectural <b>floor</b> <b>plans.</b> They are also commonly available and full of detailed indoor information. Due to the inconsistencies and ambiguities existing among real-life <b>floor</b> <b>plans,</b> previous researches all are established on different user cases. Althogh sharing a common pipeline, they differ from each other in every step, from the data structure, processing procedure to the 3 D reconstruction method. The combination of these two data sources can be beneficial, because architectural <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> can offer IndoorOSM better accuracy and extensive indoor information while IndoorOSM can provide a unified data structure and 3 D reconstruction workflow for information extracted from <b>floor</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on a throughout review of the characters of real-life <b>floor</b> <b>plans,</b> a set of rules are proposed to redraw architectural <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> from real life. These rules mainly focus on reorganizing information contained in <b>floor</b> <b>plans,</b> taking advantages of the layering and blocking functions supported by CAD application. The original geometry and graphical representation in the raw <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> is reserved as much as possible. Redrawing is only required when unstandardized representation is encountered. Then, an automatic process is accordingly presented to extract desired information from the redrawn <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> into an IndoorOSM database. Finally, highly detailed CityGML LoD 4 models with interior structures can be generated using a method proposed by Dr. Marcus Goetz. The pipeline is tested with several <b>floor</b> <b>plans</b> from real life for 3 D reconstruction. User feedback validated the feasibility and efficiency of the redrawing rules.

5|$|The Potter–Collyer House is a {{historic}} house at 67 Cedar Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The house, first constructed in 1863, is representative of vernacular architecture of the Pawtucket due to the great modifications to the home which has obscured the original structure of the home. Believed to have begun as a -story cottage with a gable roof, subsequent additions and expansions have added a two-story hip-roof addition and greatly altered the <b>floor</b> <b>plan</b> due to enlargement and remodeling.

What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom.

The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions.

5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller than the present <b>floor</b> <b>plan.</b> This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E

Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room.

After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, the farmhouse, corn crib, barn, silo and chicken coop.
