Semi-synthetic and synthetic cutting fluids represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified oil in a water base.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is {{to determine whether there}} is a cost/benefit to allocating financial and other company-related resources to improve <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> performance beyond that which is required by law. The issue of whether a company benefits from spending dollars to achieve <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> performance beyond legal compliance is an important issue to the chemical manufacturing industry in the United States because of the voluminous and complex legal requirements impacting <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> expenditures. The cost/benefit issue has practical significance because many U. S. chemical manufacturing companies base their <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> management strategies on just achieving and maintaining compliance with legal requirements when in reality this strategy may actually be a higher cost way of managing <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> practices. This difference in <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> management strategy is being investigated to determine if managing <b>environmental,</b> health and <b>safety</b> to achieve performance beyond that which is required by law results in a greater benefit to companies in the U. S. chemical manufacturing sector...|$|R

Recurrent trade restrictions on Indian products decided by the European Commission (around 700 generic medicines were black-listed in 2015 which followed an earlier import ban on fruits and vegetables from India in 2014) and the European Parliament resolution in 2015 on alleged human rights violations by India are examples of recent actions which were unhelpful impediments to the improvement of European Union-India relations.|$|E
