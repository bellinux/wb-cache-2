40|$|Aortic {{angiography}} {{is widely}} considered the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of traumatic thoracic aortic injury. Unfortunately, thoracic aortic angiography has many disadvantages: the technique is invasive but, more importantly, it is not routinely available in all hospitals, necessitating transfer of critically ill patients. Contrast-enhancement <b>helical</b> <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> (CEHCT) of the thorax is rapidly becoming available, especially in more district general hospitals, and {{has been shown to}} be as sensitive and specific in detecting aortic trauma as angiography. This technique has the advantage of being non-invasive and is able to demonstrate injuries other than thoracic aortic disruption. We present four cases of traumatic thoracic disruption initially diagnosed using CEHCT in whom surgical repair was performed on the basis of the CEHCT findings. The surgical findings of aortic injury were correlated with CEHCT features...|$|E

It is a simple, safe, non-invasive diagnostic examination done on an out patient. <b>Computerised</b> <b>Tomography</b> not only shows {{the presence of a}} lesion but also shows the extent of the disease and its relationship to other intraorbital and adjacent structures. With coronal scans, relationship of orbital disease to the optic nerve and extraocular muscles can be well demonstrated.

40|$|Introduction Whole body <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> {{has become}} a {{standard}} of care for the investigation of major trauma patients. However, its use varies widely, and current clinical guidelines are not universally accepted. We undertook a systematic {{review of the literature}} to determine whether clinical guidelines for whole body <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> in trauma increase its diagnostic accuracy. Materials and methods A systematic review of Medline, Cinhal and the Cochrane database, supplemented by a manual search of relevant papers was undertaken, with narrative synthesis. Studies comparing clinical guidelines to physician gestalt for the use of whole body <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> in adult trauma were included. Results A total of 887 papers were identified from the electronic databases, and 1 from manual searches. Of these, seven papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two papers compared clinical guidelines with routine practice: one found increased diagnostic accuracy while the other did not. Two papers investigated the performance of established clinical guidelines and demonstrated moderate sensitivity and low specificity. Two papers compared different components of established triage tools in trauma. One paper devised a de novo clinical decision rule, and demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy with the tool. The outcome criteria used to define a ‘positive’ scan varied widely, making direct comparisons between studies impossible. Conclusions Current clinical guidelines for whole body <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> in trauma may increase the sensitivity of the investigation, but the evidence to support this is limited. There is a need to standardise the definition of a ‘clinically significant’ finding on CT to allow better comparison of diagnostic studies...|$|R

40|$|Great {{progress}} has been realised {{in the field of}} biliary obstruction diagnosis, thanks to new technics of investigation based on physical means. The efficacy of echography in the diagnosis of intra-abdominal space occupying lesions is already well known. Its possibility of structural analysis permits one to differentiate liquid collections from plain tumors and, thanks to this property, to distinguish a dilated gallbladder and demonstrate the presence of biliary lithiasis when I. V. cholangiography reveals only an exclusion of the gallbladder. <b>Computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> gives not only good morphologic information on intra-abdominal organs, but measures also some density of parenchyma. It permits one to differentiate a tumor tissue from the normal parenchyma. The biliary tree is easy to distinguish when dilated. <b>Computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> is able to localise the siege of an obstruction of the extra-hepatic biliary tree, as a neoplasm of the head of the pancreas. It helps to demonstrate the absence of any obstruction and to establish the diagnosis of cholestatic jaundice. Combined echotomography and <b>computerised</b> <b>tomography</b> have undoubtedly improved the viability of the diagnosis in pathology of the biliary tract. The non invasive character of both investigations is quite appreciated by the patients. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
