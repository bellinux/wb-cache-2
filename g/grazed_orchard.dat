40|$|Traditional {{orchards}} are {{a valuable}} {{feature of the}} rural landscape and they are specific for regions with scattered settlement such as the Myjava hilly land and White Carpathians. Here, the permanent species-rich grasslands beneath trees were regularly managed in the traditional manner until some were replaced in the 1970 ’s and 80 ’s by intensively managed orchards, {{some of which were}} abandoned in the early 1990 ’s. Our 2011 – 2015 phytosociological research followed the standard Braun-Blanquet approach. We classified 178 phytosociological relevés recorded in orchard meadows (156 relevés), former intensively managed orchards (16 relevés), and two relevés from a semi-intensively <b>grazed</b> <b>orchard.</b> Traditionally managed orchard meadows were classified in the following five units: (i) Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris – thermophilous variant, (ii) Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris – transitional variant to Alchemillo-Arrhenatheretum elatioris, (iii) Ranunculo bulbosi-Arrhenatheretum elatioris, (iv) Onobrychido viciifoliae-Brometum erecti, and (v) Brachypodio pinnati-Molinietum arundinaceae. Formerly intensively managed large-scale orchards were classified as Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris association and the semi-intensively <b>grazed</b> <b>orchard</b> as Lolio perennis-Cynosuretum cristati association. The species composition varies considerably due to tree-shading and different management treatments applied in the orchards, so the relevés of the delimited syntaxonomic units are not typical and have transitional character. Moisture, soil nutrients, and soil reaction were identified as the main environmental gradients influencing species composition. We tested four management treatments in direct gradient analysis and found that abandonment has the strongest effect on species composition. Comparison of grassland vegetation in the studied traditional orchards with that described in Germany reveals differences in species composition. Moreover, species richness of the compared Arrhenatherion elatioris and Bromion erecti alliances in Slovakian orchard meadows was higher than in the German orchards...|$|E

50|$|Its {{conservation}} {{value is}} {{dictated by the}} archaeological investigations of the important intangible value of its cultural heritage. The management plan drawn by the park administration is oriented towards these archaeological investigations. Zoning of the park has been done accordingly under the classification of intangible zone, primitive zone, extensive use zone, service and CONAF (1976) zone and special use zone. A harmonious blend of conservation activities in the reserve areas (including monoliths and structures) with agricultural activities, livestock <b>grazing,</b> <b>orchards</b> and traditional fishing sites has evolved in the integrated management plans for the island. The management of the park {{is the responsibility of}} the Conservation Department of Chile's National Forestry Corporation (CONAF).|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Agro-silvopastoral land-use {{has a long}} tradition throughout Europe. Depending on the region, wood-pasture occurs as vanishing relic of historical land-use, or still more or less widespread as multiple-use rangeland. A new development is that former intensively managed land is being left to evolve towards wood-pasture as an economically and eco-logically favourable alternative. In a review of European wood-pasture habitats we distinguish 24 types based on the geobotanical criteria of region, structure, land-use and tree species composition. The European wood-pasture types may be classified as hemi-boreal and boreal (4 types), nemoral old-growth (7), nemoral scrub and coppice (5), meridional old-growth (2), meridional scrub and coppice (4), and <b>grazed</b> <b>orchards</b> (2). Wood-pasture forms part of the cultural heritage of Europe, and may add significantly to the preservation of regional biodiversity. The role of wood-pasture in ecological restoration planning and the possibilities of maintaining or enhancing features of wood-pasture deserve more recognition. Many wood-pastures suffer from regeneration failure and are over-mature. Other threats to wood-pasture include abandonment, intensification, oa...|$|R
50|$|It {{passes through}} Queensland's Darling Downs region. Typical of the scenery are <b>grazing</b> cattle, <b>orchards</b> and grain farmland. It was {{elevated}} to National Highway status in February 1993, and replaced the Cunningham Highway {{as the main}} route between Goondiwindi and Brisbane. Interstate traffic is rerouted through Toowoomba and the Warrego Highway as it presents a less steep gradient than via Warwick and Cunninghams Gap, shortening travel time especially for trucks. It was initially designated State Route 85 until February 1993 when National Highway 85 was proclaimed, splitting State Route 85 into two. In 2005 it was given the National Highway A39 designation.|$|R
40|$|Sometimes {{a single}} plant {{prevents}} managers from grazing livestock {{in an area}} with good forage production. Often the plant has high agronomic value, like fruit trees, Douglas fir trees or grapevines.

40|$|Lantana camara is {{more popular}} as toxic weed rather than {{medicinal}} plant {{in most of}} the countries responsible for infesting pastures, <b>grazing</b> lands, <b>orchards</b> and crops like, tea, coffee, oil palm, coconut and cotton, and reduces the economic viability of the crops. This plant can grow in even in extreme harsh climatic conditions of tropical and sub-tropical areas and has become naturalized worldwide as an ornamental plant including India. The stem, root and leaves contain many of the bioactive compounds responsible for various therapeutic applications such as cancers, chicken pox, measles, asthma, ulcers, swellings, eczema, tumors, high blood pressure, bilious fevers, catarrhal infections, tetanus, rheumatism, malaria, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative and diaphoretic. Besides this, it has some toxic effect by accidental ingestion among the livestock. Best alternate uses of West Indian Lantana started by the people, as it is difficult to eradicate such as household furniture like tables, chairs etc. are made from the stalks [...] Present review indicating that Lantana camara is a versatile ornamental plant species having economic importance and can be promoted for diversified applications like medicinal and other potential uses...|$|R

50|$|Much of {{the area}} is densely forested with mostly pine-oak or oak-hornbeam trees. Humans have been shaping the {{environment}} in this area for centuries and anthropic changes included cutting and burning forests, creating meadows, establishing vineyards and <b>orchards,</b> <b>grazing</b> animals and planting new trees. Today, the area of Devín Carpathians contains a mixture of stony and grassy forest steppe, shrublands and dense forests. Some areas are more often visited and continually being changed {{over the course of}} centuries, other areas are relatively intact. There are numerous endemic species living inside the protected areas. The mountains are rich in mushroom diversity as the small area of Devínska Kobyla alone contains at least 234 species of identified mushrooms.|$|R

50|$|The first plantings {{occurred}} in 1982 in a vineyard established by Sandy and Helen Haig immediately {{south of the}} city of Mount Gambier. The establishment of vineyards within the wine region is attributed to primary producers diversifying away from dairy production following the corporatisation and deregulation of that industry beginning in the late 1970s. Vineyards are exclusively family businesses ‘usually associated with other agricultural pursuits such as <b>orchards,</b> <b>grazing,</b> hay production and animal husbandry.’ The vineyards planted in the 1980s focused on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir varieties while establishments in the 1990s included varieties such as Cabernet and Merlot. Between the years 2001 and 2010, the majority of the region’s vineyards were planted with a total planted area of 243 ha for the region as of 2011. As of 2014, there are at least 20 vineyards and eight associated wineries in operation within the region.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} site {{consisted of}} an <b>orchard,</b> <b>grazing</b> land {{and a small}} forest. The prison was opened in 1937 and consisted of single wooden huts for 20 persons, built by prisoners. Another 50 single huts were built as numbers increased. A 50-cell block was built in 1968 and an extra block of 20 cells was built in 1970. The cell and administration buildings were replaced with concrete block construction in 1964 and are still in use today. At its peak, Hayes had large market vegetable gardens, 1,000 pigs, 1,800 laying hens, 2,000 sheep, an award-winning dairy herd and a clay processing plant that sold clay to Salamanca potters. Three truckloads packed with vegetables left the prison farm each week. Their customers included the Royal Derwent Hospital, Lachlan Park, the Royal Hobart and St John's hospitals, several nursing homes in the Hobart region, government departments and the prison itself. More than 300 cows are at Hayes. The farm is also responsible for a much smaller herd, which keeps the grass short at Government House in Hobart. Hayes sells 1.1 million litres of milk to dairy company National Foods each year. It also grows about 7000 kg of glasshouse, vine-ripened tomatoes and 1,700 bales of hay and silage.|$|R
