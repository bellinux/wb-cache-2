50|$|Ryan was re-elected as a Liberal under leader Lester B. Pearson in 1963 and 1965 {{and under}} Pierre Trudeau in 1968. Uncomfortable with Trudeau's policies, Ryan left the Liberal Party {{and crossed the}} floor on December 3, 1969 to sit as an Independent MP. In September 1970 he joined the Progressive Conservative caucus. Ryan cited three reasons for leaving the Liberals - the Trudeau government's <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> Canada's {{relationship}} with NATO, the government's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China and what Ryan argued was the <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> the status and influence of backbench MPs and ordinary Members of Parliament under Trudeau.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} Savannah River Site's {{compliance with}} the Department of Energy (DOE) direction to suspend current operations, transition to accommodate revised facility missions, and initiate operations to deactivate F-Canyon using a suspension and deactivation safety basis. This paper integrates multiple Workshop theme topics - Lessons Learned from the Safety Analysis Process, Improvements in Documenting Hazard and Accident Analysis, and Closure Issues - Decontamination and Decommissioning. The paper describes the process used to develop safety documentation to support suspension and deactivation activities for F-Canyon. Embodied are descriptive efforts that include development of intermediate and final ''end states'' (e. g., transitional operations), preparation of safety bases documents to support transition, performance of suspension and deactivation activities (e. g. solvent washing, tank/sump flushing, and laboratory waste processing), and <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> Safety Class and Safety Significant equipment. The reduction and/or removal of hazards in the facility result in significant risk (frequency times consequence) reduction to the public, site workers, and the environment. Risk reduction then allows the <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> safety class and safety significant systems (e. g., ventilation system) and elimination of associated surveillances. The <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> safety systems results in significant cost savings...|$|R
