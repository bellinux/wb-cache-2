The Coastal Observatory dataset has provided new insight into the vertical current structure and wave climate of the region due to the availability of ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler), HF radar and wave buoy data. Additionally, data from moorings has allowed for the examination of the temporal and vertical evolution of <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients.</b> The model was used to examine four factors affecting the stratification of the Liverpool Bay ROFI: wave mixing, wind straining, the impact of depth- and temporally- varying <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients,</b> and the effect of advection and straining of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient.</b> Wind straining was found to be important, specifically in terms of enduring stratification; northerly winds induced a westward residual which pushed the front offshore, generating enduring stratification whilst a southerly wind induced an eastward residual which acted as a destructive mechanism. Advection, in addition to depth-mean straining, was found to be an important process affecting the stratification of Liverpool Bay; its phase, and thus influence, relative to the depth-mean straining contribution, was found to be a function of the vertical variation of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient.</b> Wave breaking was determined to be an important source of mixing; wave-induced bed stresses and thus the energy available for mixing from those stresses, however, became significan once the water column had already homogenised suggesting they are unimportant to the vertical structure of the Bay.

The 30 -year variability, {{referred to as}} interdecadal variability (IDV), exist in an ocean model driven by climatological atmospheric forcing, suggesting that it is maintained by ocean dynamics; the 60 -year variability, the multidecadal variability (MDV), is only observed in the fully coupled model and therefore is interpreted as an atmosphere–ocean coupled mode.

Observations of cool filaments off northern California indicate that within the cool (dense) core of filaments the raised pycnocline inhibits the penetration to middepths of surface-generated mixing. The microstructure profiles are used to estimate the available wind energy for mixing as a function of pycnocline, or mixed layer depth. A greater portion of energy input at the surface is available for entrainment of dense fluid through the pycnocline and into the surface mixed layer where the pycnocline is shallow. Hence surface-forced mixing may cause a more rapid increase in mixed layer density within the cool filament than outside the filament, resulting in an enhanced <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> in the mixed layer. Assuming the flow adjusts towards geostrophy, the enhanced <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> at the front could result in an accelerated mixed layer {{in the direction of the}} preexisting geostrophic flow.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of a geostrophically balanced <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> on turbulent convection in the ocean is examined using numerical simulations and a theoretical scaling analysis. Starting with uniform horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients, convection is driven by imposing a heat loss or a destabilizing wind stress at the upper boundary, and a turbulent layer soon develops. For weak lateral fronts, turbulent convection results in a nearly homogeneous mixed layer (ML) whose depth grows in time. For strong fronts, a turbulent layer develops, but this layer is not an ML in the traditional sense because it is characterized by persistent <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>gradients</b> in <b>density.</b> The turbulent layer is, however, nearly homogeneous in potential vorticity (PV), with a value near zero. Using the PV budget, a scaling for the depth of the turbulent low PV layer and its time dependence is derived that compares well with numerical simulations. Two dynamical regimes are identified. In a convective layer near the surface, turbulence is generated by the buoyancy loss at the surface; below this layer, turbulence is generated by a symmetric instability of the lateral <b>density</b> <b>gradient.</b> This work extends classical scalings for the depth of turbulent boundary layers to account for the ubiquitous presence of lateral <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> in the ocean.

40|$|The Bay of Banten {{provides}} an example of a semicircular shallow tidal embayment in a tropical ROFI (Region Of Freshwater Influence), subject to a mixed, mainly diurnal tidal regime and a monsoon-driven residual circulation. A partially inactivated delta shapes the east coast of the bay and constitutes a distributed source of freshwater during the wet season. Measurements of flow velocity, salinity and temperature were taken at two contrasting sites in the bay, to investigate stratification dynamics throughout a spring–neap cycle. Bulk Richardson numbers are shown to vary both at tidal and subtidal frequencies, and indicate that the water column occasionally remains stratified all through a tidal cycle. About half of the variance of the subtidal flow can be explained from wind forcing. The wind-driven flow varies between 1 and 5 % of the wind speed, with a pronounced difference between the two locations under study. Stratification was further analyzed by estimating the contributions of advection by the depth–mean flow, tidal straining, vertical advection and heating, to variation in potential energy anomaly (PEA). To do so, <b>horizontal</b> <b>gradients</b> in <b>density</b> and PEA were estimated from multi-linear regression analysis.

This conceptual picture of the contributing processes has been tested in a one-dimensional point model forced by the observed slopes and the local <b>density</b> <b>gradients.</b> The model exhibits the same qualitative behavior as the observations, produces oscillations in stratification of the amplitude observed, and confirms the critical role of cross-shore tidal straining. The large cross-shore shear nder stratified conditions is identified with the changes in ellipse configuration which are observed between mixed and stratified conditions. The occurrence of semidiurnal variations in stability in the Rhine ROFI is thus inferred to be {{a consequence of the}} development of mean stability whenever the <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> relax in conditions of low stirring...|$|R
40|$|All natural fluids stratify. Stable stratifications, {{in which}} isobars and isopycnals are parallel, {{are capable of}} {{supporting}} internal wave motion. Unstable stratification, in which <b>density</b> and pressure <b>gradients</b> are not aligned, results in gravity-driven flow. Gravity currents are a subset of these flows in which <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> sharpen and propagate horizontally, transporting mass, momentum, and energy. If {{the density of the}} gravity current is within the density extrema of the stably stratified ambient fluid, it propagates as an intrusion at an intermediate height. Through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, this dissertation explores the influence of stratification on the dynamics of gravity- driven intrusions. Intrusions require stable stratification in the ambient fluid, which is capable of transporting momentum and energy away from the current in the form of internal waves. We investigate the constant velocity propagation of well-mixed intrusions propagating into a linearly stratified ambient fluid. Varying the level of neutral buoyancy, we quantify the corresponding variation in structure, momentum, and energy of the upstream wave field. Adjacent stable stratifications of differing vertical density structure necessarily entail <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients.</b> These gradients determine the hydrostatic pressure differences driving the ensuing gravity current. We examine the mid-depth, constant velocity propagation of one linearly stratified fluid into another more strongly linearly stratified fluid. Working from the available potential energy of the system and measurements of the intrusion thickness, we develop an energy model to describe the speed of the intrusion in terms of the ratio of the two buoyancy frequencies. Distinct from adjacent linear stratifications, adjacent discrete stratifications may create flow consisting of interleaving intrusions. Single intrusions into a two- layer ambient fluid are well understood. Limiting our study to an idealized system of multiple intrusions, we attempt to extend the two-layer model to describe the interleaving process. We show that this simple extension fails when the average densities of the two stratifications are unequal, and suggest that this failure is due to the coupling of interfacial waves across constant density layer...|$|R
40|$|A semi-implicit {{version of}} the Princeton Ocean Model, ECOMsi, was used to {{simulate}} the cyclonic gyre that {{is found in the}} western Irish Sea during the spring and the summer. Mesoscale, seasonal, density-driven circulations such as this are {{an important component of the}} long-term flow in shelf seas, and they pose a challenge to coastal ocean models. Extensive comparisons are made here with observational data to assess model performance. The model successfully reproduced the development of the temperature field, and the associated density-driven currents, throughout seasonal simulations. The results demonstrate conclusively that the gyre is density-driven and reinforce the dynamical importance of strong nearbed <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients.</b> Maximum baroclinic currents of 0. 14 m s− 1 were obtained, and results showed that the regional kinetic energy due to the residual flow was 20 %– 25 % of that due to tidal flow during periods in which <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> were strongest. The model revealed important interactions between both wind and tide and the density structure; these interactions can direct and modulate density-driven flow...|$|R
5000|$|Ocean surface {{heat flux}} (i.e. {{atmospheric}} cooling/heating) {{as well as}} freshwater flux (i.e. evaporation and precipitation) influence seasonal stratification by forming a <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> that allows phytoplankton to remain in a shallow mixed layer in the photic zone, as in Sverdup’s original theory. However, these processes cannot account for blooms that occur well {{before the onset of}} seasonal stratification. In many cases, the Critical Turbulence Hypothesis is also not enough to explain early bloom formations. Using float and glider data similar to Brody & Lozier (2015) as well as Argo float profiles and a 3D biophysical model constrained by observational data, Mahadevan et al. (2012) showed that spring blooms can be initiated by stratification due to <b>horizontal</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradients</b> (i.e. eddies and fronts), which can occur before the onset of seasonal stratification. Mahadevan termed this type of non-seasonal stratification [...] "eddy restratification." [...] She points out that spring blooms caused by eddy restratification can be expected to have patchier growth and more spatial heterogeneity than those due to seasonal changes, possibly allowing for a more diverse planktonic community.|$|R
