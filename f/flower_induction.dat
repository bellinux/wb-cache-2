We investigated effects of common cultural practices, flowering and maturity synchronisation, (1) to quantify the trade-offs of flowering and maturity synchronisation for pineapple quality {{and the proportion of}} fruits exportable to European markets, and (2) to determine the effect of harvesting practice on quality attributes. Four on-farm experiments were conducted during three years using cultivars Sugarloaf and Smooth Cayenne. A split-split plot design was used in each experiment, with <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> practice as main factor (artificial or natural <b>flowering</b> <b>induction),</b> maturity induction practice as split factor (artificial or natural maturity induction) and harvesting practice as the split-split factor (farmers' harvest practice or individual fruit harvesting at optimum maturity).

40|$|Natural {{flowering}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} agronomic problems in pineapple (Ananas comosus) cultivation. It causes heterogeneous flowering and fruit development with multiple harvest passes of the same field as an inevitable consequence. To avoid natural flowering, pineapple plants are induced to synchronize flowering by external ethylene treatments. In this research it is shown that pineapple plants (MD- 2 hybrid cultivar) are already sensitive to external ethylene treatments at an early developmental stage, i. e. 3 months after planting, although no natural flowering occurs during this early stage of plant development. These results indicate that young pineapple plants already posses all the necessary factors to induce flowering in response to ethylene treatments. Additionally the efficiencies of <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> of different external ethylene treatments, including a novel agent developed at our lab, called ‘zeothene’, were evaluated. Zeothene (=zeolite containing ethylene gas) and ethylene dissolved in water (both applied in the central cup of the plant) were proved to be very efficient <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> agents. The commercial cultivation practice, in which ethylene gas is sprayed with water over whole plants, was found less efficient confirming that central cup applications are more efficient than whole plant spraying. Cup applications allow the active ingredient (ethylene or ethephon) to be taken up immediately by the apical meristem resulting in an efficient <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> signal. The addition of activated carbon to enhance the <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> treatment was found to be useful only with a very high dose of activated carbon (5 %) and a long interaction time (at least 5 – 30 min) between the activated carbon and the <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> solution. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Before {{a flower}} can be {{produced}} the plant must undergo floral induction and initiation. Floral induction involves physiological processes in the plant that result in the shoot apical meristem becoming competent to develop flowers. It involves biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by cytokinins and the processes can be reversed. Floral initiation is the morphological transformation of an induced growing point from a vegetative to a floral primordium and involves the plant hormone florigen. Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favourable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce {{a number of different}} physiological and morphological changes. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower. <b>Flower</b> <b>induction</b> and initiation can simply occur when a plant has reached a mature enough age.

When growth elongation is complete, day length is reduced to 8 hours using a blackout curtain. Budset follows, and the grafts are held in the greenhouse until mid-May. Grafts are then moved into a cooler at 4 °C for 1000 hours, after which they are moved to a shade frame where they grow normally, with applications of fertilizer and irrigation as in the first cycle.

The factors that control this transition are unknown. We observed natural variation in Arabidopsis hypocotyl secondary growth and its coordination with root secondary growth. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population demonstrated separate genetic control of developmentally synchronized secondary-growth parameters. However, major QTL for xylem expansion and fiber differentiation correlated tightly and coincided with major flowering time QTL. Correlation between xylem expansion and flowering was confirmed in another RIL population and also found across Arabidopsis accessions. Gene-expression analyses suggest that xylem expansion is initiated after <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> but before inflorescence emergence. Consistent with this idea, transient activation of an inducer of flowering at the rosette stage promoted xylem expansion.

Two strains E 1 and L 1 differing in their photoperiodic and temperature requirements, {{were used in the}} present research, which completes former investigations (VAN DE VOOREN 1969 a, b, 197 1 a, b). High temperature Plants under short day conditions at 32 ° C are induced to flower bud formation. A quantitative juvenility for 32 ° SI), interaction between 32 ° SD and L 20 °, partial induction by 32 ° SD and desinduction of this partial induction in SD 20 ° exist in both strains, but E 1 is more sensitive than L 1. High temperature action on <b>flower</b> <b>induction</b> is maximal during the middle of a 16 h dark period for both E 1 and L 1. Maximal action in E 1 is more precisely 7 h after the onset of darkness, independent on the length of the dark period for 8 - 16 h photoperiods. There is no action for 20 and 24 h photoperiod. No influence of temperatures on <b>flower</b> <b>induction</b> during SD is apparent in the range 10 °- 30 °C and an increasing response in the range 35 °- 50 ° C. Light Light intensity {{is an important factor in}} <b>flower</b> <b>induction.</b> Increasing light intensities during SD or CL increase the flowering response. The optimal light intensity during CL is rather low in E 1 and has not been reached in L 1 in our experiments. Photoperiodic response curves at 20 ° and 32 ° C for E 1 and L 1 For photoperiods from 8 to 18 h more numbers of cycles necessary for 50 % flowering are needed for 20 ° C than for 32 ° C. The curves run parallel for both E, and L, at photoperiods from 18 to 24 h. In this range E 1 needs an equal number and L 1 decreasing numbers of cycles. Hypothesis The mechanism of <b>flower</b> <b>induction</b> is a balance between two processes: 1. A deblocking process in high intensity light, increasing light intensities accelerating it with an optimum, temperature insensitive. 2. A reblocking process in darkness, starting about 4 h after the onset of darkness° reaching its maximum after 6 - 7 h and decreasing for about 5 h, temperature sensitive, temperatures higher than 30 °- 35 ° C slowing it down increasingly. Incandescent light postpones the onset of darkness and hence the reblocking. When these 2 processes are out of balance and more deblocking than reblocking occurs, a critical level or disappearance of the block is reached and <b>flower</b> <b>induction</b> is completed. Models Models, based on the foregoing hypothesis, are presented for induction by LD 20 ° high intensity light, LD 20 ° - high+low intensity incandescent light, 32 ° SD.

In this paper the possibilities of early flowering induction were investigated. Vriesea ‘Ginger’ plants in different stages of development (15, 18, 22, 30, 38, and 52 weeks of greenhouse growth) were subjected to applications with ethylene or ACC. The minimal age required for both treatments to induce flowering was 18 weeks. This was also reflected in the endogenous ACC evolution in young leaves and meristems from vegetative plants which show a considerable increase from 18 weeks on, suggesting that the plants leave the juvenility status around 18 weeks and become prone to flowering induction.

40|$|International audienceThe {{potential}} for evolutionary change in flowering time has gained considerable attention {{in view of}} the current global climate change. To explore this potential and its underlying mechanisms in the iteroparous perennial Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima (sea beet), artificial selection for earlier and later flowering date was applied under semi-natural greenhouse conditions. Mean flowering date occurred more than 30 d earlier in 13 generations in the early selection line, but response was weaker in the late selection line. Taking advantage of the growing knowledge on the genetics and the physiology of <b>flowering</b> <b>induction,</b> particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana, the results obtained here were analysed in terms of the four different pathways of <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> known in this species. A first significant correlated response was stem elongation (bolting) in the vegetative stage, suggesting that plants were thus able to flower earlier as long as other requirements were satisfied. Vernalization had a clear influence on flowering date and its influence increased during the selection process, together with sensitivity to photoperiod. Vernalization and photoperiod could compensate for each other: each additional week of vernalization at 5 C decreased the necessary daylength for flowering by about 15 min during the later selection stages, while in unselected plants, it was about 7 min. Devernalizing effects were observed at short days combined with higher temperatures. Special attention was given {{to the role of the}} B (bolting) gene that cancels the vernalization requirement. The results here obtained suggest that all four known pathways may simultaneously participate in evolutionary change...|$|R
40|$|Photoperiod and sucrose levels play a {{key role}} in the control of flowering. GmRAV {{reflected}} a diurnal rhythm with the highest expression at 4 h after the beginning of a dark period in soybean leaves, and was highly up-regulated under short-day (SD) conditions, despite of not following a diurnal pattern under long-day (LD) conditions. GmRAV-i (GmRAV-inhibition) transgenic soybean exhibited early flowering phenotype. Two of the FT Arabidopsis homologs, GmFT 2 a and GmFT 5 a, were highly expressed in the leaves of soybeans with inhibition (-i) of GmRAV under SD conditions. Moreover, the transcript levels of the two FT homologs in GmRAV-i soybeans were more sensitive to SD conditions than LD conditions compared to the WT plant. GmRAV-i soybeans and Arabidopsis rav mutants showed more sensitive hypocotyl elongation responses when compared with wild-type seedlings, and GmRAV-ox overevpressed in tobacco revealed no sensitive changes in hypocotyl length. These indicated that GmRAV was a novel negative regulator of SD-mediated flowering and hypocotyl elongation. Although sucrose has been suggested to promote <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> in many plant species, high concentration of sucrose (4 % [w/v]) applied into media defer flowering time in Arabidopsis wild-type and rav mutant. This delayed flowering stage might be caused by reduction of LEAFY expression. Furthermore, Arabidopsis rav mutants and GmRAV-i soybean plants were less sensitive to sucrose by the inhibition assays of hypocotyls and roots growth. In contrast, transgenic GmRAV overexpressing (-ox) tobacco plants displayed more sensitivity to sucrose. In conclusion, GmRAV was inferred to have a fundamental function in photoperiod, darkness, and sucrose signaling responses to regulate plant development and <b>flowering</b> <b>induction...</b>|$|R
40|$|Flowering is very {{important}} in orchid cultivation. However, the long vegetative phase to be able to bloom of the plant becomes an important problem. The orchid needs three up to five years after sowing to bloom. In this study, <b>flowering</b> <b>induction</b> is done in the early growth stages of plants. At six months after sowing (mas), plants were sub-cultured on New Phalaenopsis (NP) medium witha half Nitrogen(N) concentration of NP (1 / 2 NP), with or without Benzyl Adenine (BA), concentration variations of Phosphor/P (1, 5 mM and 3 mM), and with or without roots cutting. In vitro flowering of Indonesian Phalaenopsisamabilis (P. amabilis) can induced on medium that contain 22. 2 µM BA and 3 mM P with roots cutting at 18 mas. ...|$|R
