40|$|Highlights from NASA-funded {{research}} {{over the}} past ten years for aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> are presented showing overall technical plans, accomplishments, and selected applications to turbofan engines. The work was sponsored by NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Noise Reduction Program. Emphasis is given to only the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> research and significant accomplishments that were investigated at Technology Readiness Levels ranging from 4 to 6. The <b>Engine</b> <b>Noise</b> <b>Reduction</b> sub-element was divided into four work areas: source noise prediction, model scale tests, engine validation, and active noise control. Highlights from each area include technologies for higher bypass ratio turbofans, scarf inlets, forward-swept fans, swept and leaned stators, chevron/tabbed nozzles, advanced noise prediction analyses, and active noise control for fans. Finally, an industry perspective is given from General Electric Aircraft Engines showing how these technologies are being applied to commercial products.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{a review of}} the {{literature}} regarding propeller airplane far-field <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> Near-field and cabin <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> are not specifically addressed. However, some of the approaches used to reduce far-field noise produce beneficial effects in the near-field and in the cabin. The emphasis is on propeller <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> but <b>engine</b> exhaust <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> by muffling is also addressed since the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> becomes a significant part of the aircraft noise signature when propeller noise is reduced. It is concluded that there is a substantial body of information available that can be used as the basis to reduce propeller airplane noise. The reason that this information is not often used in airplane design is the associated weight, cost, and performance penalties. It is recommended that the highest priority be given to research for reducing the penalties associated with lower operating RPM and propeller diameter while increasing the number of blades. Research to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> and explore innovative propeller concepts is also recommended...|$|R

40|$|Major {{airports}} in the world's air transportation systems face {{a serious problem}} in providing greater capacity to meet the ever increasing demands of air travel. This problem could be relieved if airports are allowed to increase their operating time, now restricted by curfews and by relaxing present limits on takeoffs and landings. The key operational issue in extending the present curfews is noise. In response to these increasing restrictive noise regulations, NASA has launched a program to validate through <b>engine</b> testing, <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> concepts and technologies that have evolved from the Advanced Subsonic Technologies (AST) <b>Noise</b> <b>Reduction</b> Program. The goal of this AST program was to develop and validate technology that reduces <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> and improves nacelle suppression effectiveness relative to 1992 technology. Contract NAS 3 - 97144 titled "Engine Validation of <b>Noise</b> <b>Reduction</b> Concepts" (EVNRC) was awarded to P&W on August 12, 1997 to conduct full scale <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> tests in two Phases on a PW 4098 engine.

Fan and jet noise technologies are highlighted from the AST program including higher bypass ratio propulsion, scarf inlets, forward-swept fans, swept/leaned stators, chevron nozzles, noise prediction methods, and active noise control for fans. Source diagnostic tests for fans and jets that have been completed {{over the past few}} years are presented showing how new flow measurement methods such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) have played a key role in understanding turbulence, the noise generation process, and how to improve noise prediction methods. Tests focused on source decomposition have helped identify which engine components need further <b>noise</b> <b>reduction.</b> The role of Computational AeroAcoustics (CAA) for fan noise prediction is presented.

The problem of jet noise has been substantially reduced in connection with the lower jet velocities employed {{in the case of the}} high bypass turbofan engines. The dominant noise sources are now related to the turbomachinery with the fan stage, the compressor, and the turbine.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} to quantify the contribution of fan broadband noise to advanced high bypass turbofan <b>engine</b> system <b>noise</b> levels. The result suggests that reducing fan broadband noise can produce 3 to 4 EPNdB in <b>engine</b> system <b>noise</b> <b>reduction,</b> once the fan tones are eliminated. Further, {{in conjunction with the}} elimination of fan tones and an increase in bypass ratio, a potential reduction of 7 to 10 EPNdB in system noise can be achieved. In addition, an initial assessment of <b>engine</b> broadband <b>noise</b> source mechanisms has been made, concluding that the dominant source of fan broadband noise is the interaction of incident inlet boundary layer turbulence with the fan rotor. This source has two contributors, i. e., unsteady life dipole response and steady loading quadrupole response. The quadrupole contribution was found {{to be the most important}} component, suggesting that broadband <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> can be achieved by the reduction of steady loading field-turbulence field quadrupole interaction. Finally, for a controlled experimental quantification and verification, the study recommends that further broadband noise tests be done on a simulated engine rig, such as the GE Aircraft Engine Universal Propulsion Simulator, rather than testing on an engine statically in an outdoor arena The rig should be capable of generating forward and aft propagating fan noise, and it needs to be tested in a large freejet or a wind tunnel...|$|R

40|$|Airframe {{noise is}} a growing concern in the {{vicinity}} of airports because of population growth and gains in <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> <b>reduction</b> that have rendered the airframe an equal contributor during the approach and landing phases of flight for many transport aircraft.

Previous work was done on a 2 D section of a transport-aircraft wing to demonstrate the implementation feasibility of these concepts.

40|$|Noise {{reduction}} is mostly limited to light helicopters whose noise signature {{is dominated by}} their tail rotors. It is primarily hardware oriented.

The concept of blade phasing as a means of reducing tail rotor noise is also used. Engine noise (exhaust noise), power train noise and airframe noise becomes important at low rotor tip speeds and means must be found to reduce these noise sources if further noise reductions are desired. The use of a special test rig aids in isolating the various noise sources and arriving at the penalties (performance or payload) involved in quieting them.
