50|$|When {{a driver}} like an {{electric}} motor or a turbine is coupled to a pump, generator, or any other piece of equipment, {{it is essential that}} the shafts of the two pieces are aligned. Any misalignment between the two increases the stress on the shafts and will almost certainly result in excessive wear and premature breakdown of the equipment. This can be very costly. When the equipment is down, production might be down. Also bearings or mechanical seals may be damaged and need to be replaced. <b>Flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> are designed to allow a driver (electric motor, engine, turbine, hydraulic motor) to be connected to the driven equipment. <b>Flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> use an elastomeric insert to allow a slight degree of misalignment. <b>Flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> can also use shim packs. These couplings are called disc couplings. Tools used to achieve alignment may be mechanical or optical, like the Laser shaft alignment method, or they are gyroscope based.

Virtually every user has a story about a piece of equipment with a coupling problem.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Couplings between rotating machines are typically divided into two categories: rigid and <b>flexible.</b> <b>Flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> allow misalignment of the two shafts but introduce potential rotordynamic instabilities to the system. Holeset couplings, a type of flexible coupling, are designed to reduce the losses to the system due to such instabilities by avoiding operation at natural frequencies of the coupling. This is accomplished by designing the coupling such that the stiffness and hence natural frequencies of the coupling change as torsion increases. Existing test devices were employed to determine the rotordynamic stiffness and damping of a selection of <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings.</b> An analytical model of a simple system employing a flexible coupling was written. The data and this model were used to determine the reduction of lost torque a Holeset coupling provides over a tire type elastomer coupling. The data collected, the programs used to collect the data, and the simulation programs are presented. One of the test rigs may be modified in order to further study the dynamic properties of <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings.</b> The design of a suitable modification is also presented...|$|R

Moreover, due to the presence of impulses in the signals, Continuous (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are applied and compared with the conventional time and frequency domain methods. In this work the wavelet analysis is used for the impulse component extraction and the choice of different wavelet functions for this purpose is evaluated. The experimental comparison between two different types of couplings is also given. The results suggest that the wavelet transform techniques are effective to indicate which type of coupling provides a good vibrational behaviour especially in working condition when the angular speed of the propeller shaft is often inverted...|$|R

To attune the transmitted vibration, a typical isolation system was installed without a significant amount of analysis, and consisted of unrestrained pump base mount pads and <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> on the suction and discharge pipes. Initial testing shows that while the base mount pads worked well, the lack of a positive seismic restraint made those devices unsuitable for use in an earthquake zone. The <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> however actually increased vibration transmitted into the piping because of excessive stiffness. Based on the initial test results and site observations, a new isolation system was required.

Until now we have dealt with the use of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> shaft <b>couplings</b> for tuning mechanical systems working with periodically alternating load torque at steady state. Some mechanical systems, however, operate with a static load torque at constant speed (e. g. hoists, elevators, etc.), where it is necessary to consider the suitability of shaft coupling in terms of load torque at transient conditions (run-up and braking). Therefore we decided to analyze the use of pneumatic <b>flexible</b> shaft <b>couplings</b> also in this type of mechanical systems on an example of conveyor belt drive...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the mathematical models of <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> in rotating mechanical systems in terms of their vibrational behavior. The residual unbalance of the coupled shafts is considered to be the main source of vibration in the rotating system. The moments and the frequencies of the forces, which result from these effects, are close to the natural frequencies of the mechanical system. Since the coupling {{is considered to be a}} flexible component in the power transmission system, it introduces a certain amount of mass, damping and stiffness to the system, influencing its natural frequencies. The present work shows the modeling of a mechanical rotor-bearing-coupling system, through the finite element method, used in this case to analyze the transverse vibrations of the system. Different modeling techniques were taken into account for this purpose. Such models are recommended for <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> to analyze their influence on the natural frequencies of the system and on the unbalance response of the system. Afterwards, a model updating was carried out to fit the coupling stiffness and damping coefficients, using the minimum quadratic technique. Some sensitivity of the proposed models was observed in relation to the coupling parameters...|$|R
50|$|If {{the motors}} are {{attached}} to the vehicle body, <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> are required but not if the traction motors are integrated into the wheels. One disadvantage is that the unsprung mass increases and suspension responsiveness decreases, which impacts ride and potentially safety.

In particular, <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> used in engine test rig are usually subjected {{to high levels}} of torsional oscillations and time-varying torque.

In this work an effective methodology for the estimation of the dynamic behavior of highly <b>flexible</b> <b>couplings</b> in real operational conditions is presented in order to prevent unwanted halts. The methodology addresses a combination of numerical models and experimental measurements. In particular, two mathematical models of the engine test rig were developed: a torsional lumped-parameter model for the estimation of the torsional dynamic behavior in operative conditions and a finite element model for the estimation of the natural frequencies of the coupling. The experimental campaign addressed torsional vibration measurements in order to characterize the driveline dynamic behavior as well as validate the models. The measurements were achieved by a coder-based technique using optical sensors and zebra tapes. Eventually, the validated models were used to evaluate the effect of design modifications of the coupling elements in terms of natural frequencies (torsional and bending), torsional vibration amplitude, and power loss in the couplings...|$|R
