40|$|The {{design for}} {{modifications}} to the CSB Cask Receiving pit guides was verified by the informal design verification (meeting) method on August 9, 2000. The invited list of attendees and the meeting attendance sheet are included in attachment 1. The design modifications that were reviewed are documented in ECN 654484 (attachment 2). The requirement that the design is to be verified against is to ''center the transportation cask sufficiently to allow installation of the <b>guide</b> <b>funnel</b> on the cask ({+-} 0. 25 inches or less) ''. The alternatives considered are detailed in attachment 3. Alternative number 4, ''Modify The Pit Guides'', {{was determined to be}} the preferred alternative primarily due to considerations of simplicity, reliability, and low cost. Alternative 1, ''Rotate the impact Absorber 180 {sup o}'', was successfully performed but was considered a temporary fix that was not acceptable for a long term operational mode. The requirement to position the receiving crane accurately enough to lower the transportation cask into the pit with the redesigned guides was discussed and considered to be achievable without undue effort from the operator. The tolerance on the OD of the transfer cask was discussed ({+-} 1 / 8 inch) relative to the clearance with the guides. As-built dimensions for the cask OD will be looked at to verify sufficient clearance exists with the maximum cask OD. The final design thickness of the shims under the guides will be based on the as-built cask OD dimensions and field measurements between the pit guides. The need for a ''plastic'' cover for the guides was discussed and deemed unnecessary. Thermal growth of the cask OD was calculated at 3 - 5 mils and considered insignificant. The possibility of reducing the OD of the <b>guide</b> <b>funnel</b> was reviewed but this was considered impractical due to the requirement for the MCO to miss the edge of the funnel in case of a MCO drop. One of the transportation casks have the lift trunions installed 3 / 8 inch off center. This is not expected to present a problem, but needs to be verified. Operations personnel were not in attendance to discuss the method for lowering the cask into the pit, however it was the consensus of those who observed the lowering operation performed by startup that it is operationally viable. The proposed design will be presented to Operations for review prior to issuance of the ECN. The final conclusion of the attendees is that the design meets the requirement ''center the cask sufficiently to allow installation of the <b>guide</b> <b>funnel.</b> '...|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor’s thesis {{has been}} done in {{cooperation}} with the client who offered the thesis, in order to propose a new solution for a <b>guiding</b> <b>funnel</b> to a truck coupling. The assignment was introduced with the issue of having difficulties when connecting the truck to the trailer on hilly terrain. The work consists mainly of CAD-modeling in Autodesk Inventor 2017 and nonlinear calculations with FEA in Ansys 17. 1. The CAD-modeling was used for designing new <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> and the calculations were done to verify that the new <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> met the requirements that the client suggested. The project was limited by only designing the <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> to withstand a single situation of a static load. The calculations assumed that the materials were isotropic and was following a multilinear stress curve in order to define the material as ideal plastic. Three <b>guiding</b> <b>funnels</b> were made whereas only two were valid according to the the requirements. The reliability of the results are discussed and improvements are suggested by potential errors that might have been evident in the calculations. The final decisions are discussed but the responsibility of choosing was given back to the client...|$|R
40|$|During 1989 - 90 a {{new concept}} to avoid bycatch of fish in shrimp trawl has been {{developed}} in Norway. The system consists of an aluminium grid, 0. 6 - 1. 0 m wide and 1. 3 - l. 5 m long, with bars spaced 19 mm. The grid is installed in the extention piece in front of the codend, angled 45 º, and with a fish outlet on the top. In front of the grid is mounted a <b>guiding</b> <b>funnel</b> or flapper. Several practical tests with commercial trawlers are conducted. Performance of the system and behaviour of fish and shrimp relative to it has been studied with a remote controlled underwater TV-vehicle. Escapement of fish like cod, haddock, redfish and Greenland halibut is better than with any bycatch device tested earlier. Handling cause no significant problems, neither on small nor larger shrimp trawlers. Loss of shrimp when using the system is acceptable, less than 5 %. An extensive effort is taking place to introduce this selective device in all Norwegian shrimp fisheries. From March 1. 1990 the separator grid was introduced by law in the northern coastal shrimp fishery...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the bycatch problem when trawling for shrimp was initiated in Norway in 1984 utilizing the difference in swimming behaviour of fish and shrimp. A radial escape section (RES) in the aft belly of the trawl allowed fish to activly escape as shrimp was <b>guided</b> by <b>funnels</b> of netting towards the codend. The performance of the new selective device (RES) as well as behaviour of fish in trawls has been observed by a remote controlled television vehicle (RCTV). Comparative fishing experiments to evaluate its selective properties was conducted with a siamese twin trawl {{as well as with}} two trawlers fishing in the same area...|$|R

These are {{adapted to}} long-tongued Lepidoptera, {{particularly}} sphingid moths such as Macroglossum, Pieridae and Nymphalidae {{but also some}} long-tongued bees, and flies, {{all of which are}} primarily seeking nectar. The narrow tube admits only the insect's proboscis, while the short corona serves as a <b>funnel</b> <b>guiding</b> the tip of the proboscis into the mouth of the perianth tube. The stigma is placed either in the mouth of the tube, just above two whorls of three anthers, or hidden well below the anthers. The pollinators then carry pollen on their probosci or faces. The long tongued bees cannot reach the nectar at the tube base and so collect just pollen.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} simple but {{rigorous}} model of protein [...] protein association kinetics based on diffusional association on free energy landscapes obtained by sampling configurations within and surrounding the native complex binding <b>funnels.</b> <b>Guided</b> by results obtained on exactly solvable model problems, we transform the problem of diffusion in a potential into free diffusion {{in the presence of}} an absorbing zone spanning the entrance to the binding funnel. The free diffusion problem is solved using a recently derived analytic expression for the rate of association of asymmetrically oriented molecules. Despite the required high steric specificity and the absence of long-range attractive interactions, the computed rates are typically on the order of 10, several orders of magnitude higher than rates obtained using a purely probabilistic model in which the association rate for free diffusion of uniformly reactive molecules is multiplied by the probability of a correct alignment of the two partners in a random collision. As the association rates of many protein [...] protein complexes are also in the 10 range, our results suggest that free energy barriers arising from desolvation and/or side-chain freezing during complex formation or increased ruggedness within the binding funnel, which are completely neglected in our simple diffusional model, do not contribute significantly to the dynamics of protein [...] protein association. The transparent physical interpretation of our approach that computes association rates directly from the size and geometry of protein [...] protein binding funnels makes it a useful complement to Brownian dynamics simulations...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion in one {{dimensional}} rugged energy landscape (REL) {{is predicted to}} be pathologically different (from any higher dimension) with a much larger chance of encountering broken ergodicity D. L. Stein and C. M. Newman, AIP Conf. Proc. 1479, 620 (2012) ]. However, no quantitative study of this difference has been reported, despite the prevalence of multidimensional physical models in the literature (like a high dimensional <b>funnel</b> <b>guiding</b> protein folding/unfolding). Paradoxically, some theoretical studies of these phenomena still employ a {{one dimensional}} diffusion description for analytical tractability. We explore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an effective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them with the available computer simulation results. We find that at an intermediate level of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion is well-defined, {{the value of the}} effective diffusion coefficient depends on dimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (similar to 5 - 10) in going from 1 d to 2 d. In contrast, the changes in subsequent transitions (like 2 d to 3 d and 3 d to 4 d and so on) are far more modest, of the order of 10 - 20 % only. When ruggedness is given by random traps with an exponential distribution of barrier heights, the mean square displacement (MSD) is sub-diffusive (a well-known result), but the growth of MSD is described by different exponents in one and higher dimensions. The reason for such strong ruggedness induced retardation in the case of one dimensional REL is discussed. We also discuss the special limiting case of infinite dimension (d = infinity) where the effective medium approximation becomes exact and where theoretical results become simple. We discuss, for the first time, the role of spatial correlation in the landscape on diffusion of a random walker. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|R
40|$|The Centre for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia (CRS 4) is {{participating}} in an Italian R&D program, together with Ansaldo, ENEA and INFN, {{devoted to the}} design of a 80 MW prototype of the Energy Amplifier proposed by C. Rubbia et al [...] The use of advanced numerical tools has been of practical support in the design of critical elements of the machine such as the fuel element and the beam target. The aim of this work is to show the design and optimization of the Liquid Metal Spallation Target, which consists in an axial-symmetric vertical cylinder, where a Pb-Bi eutectic, in a natural convection driven flow regime, works {{at the same time as}} spallation material and coolant for the target and the beam window. The most critical part of the target is the window itself, where the highest temperatures and thermal stresses are reached. The minimization of such temperatures and stresses is the goal of the optimization. The main geometrical dimensions of the target (i. e. beam pipe, beam window and external container) are somehow fixed since they are related to the proton beam distribution and to the EA core design. The optimization therefore acts on the suitable design of the flow guide which separates the hot rising flow from the cold one. In the region where the flow is heated by the proton beam the flow <b>guide</b> has a <b>funnel</b> shape which accelerates the liquid metal. The numerical simulations are performed by using three different tools. The FLUKA Montecarlo code is used to calculate the heat source distribution in the window and in the coolant generated by the interaction with the proton beam. The results of these calculations are used as input data for the thermal fluid dynamic simulations performed with the STAR-CD commercial software. The resulting temperature and pressure fields are finally introduced in the NASTRAN code used for the structural analysis of the solid components...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, the {{numerical}} simulation of ion trajectories within collision free environments was established as basis {{for the design of}} mass analyzers, electrostatic lenses and other ion optical devices. With the advent of atmospheric pressure ionization (API), ions are generated at elevated background gas pressures and in chemically reactive environments. Today, numerical simulations of charged particles have to consider physical and chemical interactions with the background gas. At the same time, the continuously increasing performance of modern computer systems allows to apply computationally demanding numerical models on such simulation problems. In this work, the motion of gas phase ions at atmospheric and intermediate pressure is simulated to investigate the performance, validity and applicability of numerical methods for typical simulation problems in API. Furthermore, new numerical models are developed to simulate the chemical dynamics of charged particles in reactive environments. This work is structured in three sections: First, two established numerical approaches, particle tracing in SIMION with the Statistical Diffusion Simulation (SDS) extension and electrokinetic flow simulation in Comsol Multiphysics, are validated with a benchmark experiment. A bulk gas flow simulation performed in Comsol serves as input for both ion migration models. The SIMION calculation reproduces the experimental result well, while the electrokinetic flow simulation exhibits a significantly lower validity. Second, the ion migration in a complex commercial ion source (MPIS) is simulated with SIMION/SDS. A validated simulation of the complex bulk gas flow, which is required as input, is available from a joint research project. The comprehensive set of SIMION/SDS simulations reproduces the experimental spatially resolved ion signal (DIA) in the ion source very well. This demonstrates that the simulation approach is valid. In contrast, the temporal evolution of the ion signal is not well reproduced by the simulations. Rationales for the discrepancies are discussed and assessed with proof-of-concept calculations. In the third part, Reaction Simulation (RS), a module for the Monte-Carlo simulation of chemical kinetics of ions, is presented. The dynamics of proton bound water clusters are simulated with RS to describe the observed drift of the Reactant Ion Peak in Ion Mobility Spectrometry. Comparison with experimental data validates the simulation results gathered with RS. Furthermore, RS is expanded with a model for the increasing effective ion temperature at elevated electrical fields. With this extension the simulation of high field ion dynamics and chemical kinetics with significant electrical heating of ions is possible with RS, allowing the simulation of ion dynamics in e. g. RF ion <b>guides</b> or ion <b>funnels.</b> The validity of the modified RS module is assessed by comparing simulations of high field devices (e. g., collision cells, differential ion mobility analyzers) with literature data. The simulations performed in this work require the transfer of data from gas dynamics calculations to the ion dynamics models. This is achieved with custom programs which are described in detail. The analysis of raw simulation data and the visualization of the calculation results is also conducted with custom software. Particularly, a web based data browser (DIA explorer) is presented, which visualizes calculated and experimental DIA in a complex multidimensional parameter space. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the developed numerical methods for productive ion dynamics simulations, for example in the domains of instrument design and fundamental research and outlines future development opportunities...|$|R
