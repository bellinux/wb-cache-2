The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain a better understanding of the adoption of electronic invoicing in SMEs, by describing the factors that affect the adoption of electronic invoicing in SMEs and how adoption of electronic invoicing can be facilitated. In order to provide understanding of the subject, case studies of three SMEs were made. The SMEs studied were: NKV, J. Petterssons Chark and BD Fisk. The findings of this thesis indicate that there are several factors that affect adoption of <b>e-invoicing</b> in SMEs. Pressure from customers is considered to be an important factor for <b>e-invoicing</b> adoption in SMEs. Furthermore, the SMEs perceive that adoption of <b>e-invoicing</b> can be beneficial, and lead to increased internal efficiency as well as impact on business processes and relationships. The innovativeness of the owner/manager was also found to influence adoption of <b>e-invoicing.</b> The results from this study also indicate that technologically, the SMEs are ready for an adoption of <b>e-invoicing</b> and in general the SMEs in the study also have enough financial resources to adopt <b>e-invoicing.</b> However, technological and financial assistance and coercive methods are considered to facilitate adoption of <b>e-invoicing</b> in SMEs.

40|$|In recent years, {{countries}} around the world have realised the immense advantages electronic invoicing can bring for businesses, government, and even whole nations. A new trend is to legally require all businesses and companies, whether small or big, to make and receive all invoices electronically. This study investigates the effects of forced <b>e-invoicing</b> use on satisfaction and perceived benefits in SMEs. It had the goal to better understand the usefulness of <b>e-invoicing</b> in SMEs where they are not ready for the implementation, but must do so to because of the legal requirements. This study is motivated by three research questions: (1) How does the obligatory use of <b>e-invoicing</b> influence perceived benefits and satisfaction?, (2) How does organisational readiness influence satisfaction and perceived benefits in a forced environment?, and (3) Why do some SMEs find <b>e-invoicing</b> in a forced environment beneficial why others do not?. Previous research has shown that forced use is relatively useless for companies who are not ready. Concerning <b>e-invoicing,</b> many studies have been made looking at why or why not companies adopt this new process, however, few have studied perceptions of experienced and long-term users. I examine how SMEs that are forced to use <b>e-invoicing</b> perceive its satisfaction and benefits of the system. I conducted two in-depth case studies of SMEs in Mexico. A qualitative and deductive approach through interviews was used to better understand the perceptions of the managers. Using comparative case analysis, this research explored one company that adopted <b>e-invoicing</b> before it became legally enforced and one that adopted it just in time to comply with the law. The findings from the research show that forced use and satisfaction is more complex than previously assumed. Organisational readiness plays a vital role even in mandatory environments, especially technological readiness. Contrary to my expectations, one company thrived in the use of <b>e-invoicing,</b> whereas the other did not, as previously expected.

To obtain detail-rich findings, multiple case study research was preferred over other research methods. The results of the three case studies were analysed through the prism of IT business value literature and compared to other papers on benefits of e-invoicing. The cases showed that electronic invoice handling technology enhanced control over company invoicing, allowed better management of payables, and indeed increased labour productivity in invoice handling units. These and other realized benefits, such as processing time and cost savings, reduced interest on over due payments, decreased paper waste, etc., are expected to grow as the level of true <b>e-invoice</b> penetration and the development condition of the technology itself will mature. Due to insufficiency of data, the re-utilization patterns of labour released after the automation of invoicing in other more productive duties across the organization were found indecisive. As a transactional type of IT that is prone to network externalities, electronic invoicing system is posited to aid company financials largely through contracting costs, rather than boosting sales.

The purpose is to identify the key factors that influence the adoption of electronic invoicing in Chinese enterprises. A background study on global <b>e-invoicing</b> adoption and current <b>e-invoicing</b> development in China is conducted. A research model integrated by the diffusion of innovation theory, the technology, organization, and environment framework and Iacovou et al. (1995) model is postulated. The research model consists of three constructs which are technological context, organizational context and environmental and external context. Key factors that are analyzed in the research are perceived benefits and barriers, leader’s attitude, technology and financial readiness, top management support, partner and competitive pressure, government pressure, and regulatory concern. Based on the research model and the theoretical basis for each of the explanatory variables, nine hypotheses stating the relationships between the key factors and enterprises’ <b>e-invoicing</b> adoption intention are proposed. An online survey has been conducted and 72 responses have been collected from management of Chinese enterprises. Descriptive statistics and paired-samples T test are used to describe the values distribution and test the difference between the variables. Factor analysis and reliability test are performed to evaluate the validity of variables and assess the stability of constructs. Linear regression analysis is employed in order to examine six proposed hypotheses, i. e. the relationships between technological and organizational characteristics and enterprises’ adoption of <b>e-invoicing.</b> The results generally offer support for the research model and eight of the hypotheses hold while one rejects. Analysis has shown that perceived barriers, management attitude and support, technology and financial readiness are the determinant factors of <b>e-invoicing</b> adoption. Results also indicate that environmental and external factors strongly influence enterprises’ adoption decision, whereby government pressure and policy support have the most significant effect.

40|$|Electronic Invoicing (E-invoicing) {{has been}} going through fast {{development}} during recent years. It is believed to bring great savings for companies. There {{has been a lot}} of research and studies on E-invoicing. This study is going to study on how E-invoicing operators could create value but from users' perspective. The study is going to build its own value creation framework based on Amit and Zott's value creation model in E-business, which defines four value creation dimensions, i. e., efficiency, complementarity, lock-in and novelty. First, extensive literature reviews on value creation theories, including value chain, transaction cost economy, resource-based view of firms and network economy, were conducted. Besides, enterprise application integration and expert opinion were also taken into consideration. As a result, the new value creation framework came out with four modified value drivers, namely efficiency, complementary services, integration and network effects. The changes were made because it is more suitable in the context of E-invoicing. Furthermore, for each of the value drivers, a set of measurement items were identified to evaluate how an E-invoicing operator performed in providing the service. In the empirical part, two case studies are completed. Interviews were prepared and done with E-invoicing managers inside the company. It turns out that all the four value creation sources, efficiency, complementary services, integration and network effects, are observed in the company. As users of E-invoicing, the companies thought E-invoicing improves efficiency by reducing the invoice cycle time, saving costs, and eliminating human touch in the process. Supplier activation is seen as an important area where operators could improve their services. Integration of systems especially automatic accounting is regarded as the future development of E-invoicing but not yet under development in practice. Standardization is needed to enable <b>E-invoice</b> usage between different operators and networks. This study is important in providing a new perspective on E-invoicing research and development.

On the other hand, {{it can be used}} to reduce emissions in other sectors. The new area of study, Green IT, focuses on these abilities. The purposes of this research are twofold. Firstly, the goal is to determine Finnish businesses Green IT Readiness -levels. It means companies’ maturity in integrating environmental viewpoint to IT related activities throughout its lifecycle. The G -Readiness framework is also used to test the role of eco-sustainability in adoption of e-invoicing. The second part of the research is about IT’s enabling role in reducing carbon footprint of invoicing as invoices are turned from paper to electronic format. According to the research, the respondent companies’ G -Readiness seems to be mediocre. The framework with four measures (Attitude, Paperless Office, Management and Virtualization) was studied through a survey and tested using Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS). The study concludes that G -Readiness is currently being characterized as an attitude rather than a set of planned and coordinated tasks. Interestingly, the study indicates that environmental considerations do not explain adoption of e-invoicing. The case study on carbon footprint of invoices indicates that an <b>e-invoice</b> is four times more environmentally friendly than a paper invoice. The most reductions arise from increased productivity of IT enabled work, which is measured by office worker’s carbon footprint. Use of paper products and traditional mail delivery were also found to have noticeable impact, while technology and the use of it generated only a fraction of the footprint. The footprint of an office worker had not been accounted for in the previous research. Thus this finding produced totally new information to the field. The findings raise an important point about the link between eco-sustainability and productivity. Adoption of e-invoicing increases productivity and reduces emissions, but businesses have not truly accounted for this link. This indicates that many IT enabled process improvements could easily be accounted for in sustainability reporting. To reach the highest possible reductions in emissions, companies should integrate the eco-sustainability and productivity link to value chain thinking rather than focus on single processes alone...|$|E

Based on those studies, useful suggestions for the developing of <b>e-invoicing</b> in China are supposed to be put forward. Academic background and methodology: The theoretical part of this thesis is based on the theory of reasoned behavior (TRA) introduced by Fishbein (1967), the technology acceptance model (TAM) proposed by Davis (1986), and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (Venkatesh et al., 2003). A framework will be adapted from the previous studies to better illustrate <b>e-invoicing</b> in China, and a new factor-promotional effort, will be included to examine whether it is able to affect user's intention to adoption. The empirical part will adopt an online survey conducted among Chinese citizens, and the responds data will be analyzed to test whether the framework is able to explain individuals' attitudes and intention to adoption, whether the proposed factors are significant, and whether hypothesis about determinants related to attitudes and intention are true or not. Findings and conclusions: The results attained from the analysis indicate that, PU is the most significant variable that affecting individual's attitude to <b>e-invoicing,</b> while the power of PEU and T are much weaker.
