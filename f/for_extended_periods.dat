5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room {{temperature}} <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods.</b> Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain essentially in the same area <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring quickly if startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{on the bus}} tunnel {{project began}} with partial {{closures}} of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour.

5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time, not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began to grow a mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would {{continue}} to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off.

5|$|If seen {{flying at}} a {{distance}} from where size estimates are unreliable, the distinctly larger common ravens (C. corax) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge-shaped tail and their larger-looking heads. They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows, only more so. Ravens also soar <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> unlike crows, which rarely fly more than a few seconds without flapping their wings.|$|E

Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly {{because in the}} frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so.

5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods.</b> Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E

5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé {{to have said}} that he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E
5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway shows. As the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods</b> of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration. It {{is no longer}} recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended <b>for</b> <b>extended</b> <b>periods,</b> owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E

There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid eggs were cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E
