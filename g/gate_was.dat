The first two are the work of Al-Adil, {{although}} the northern gate has been repaired in the Mamluk period, while the current west gate is of later date.

5|$|After Kapoor's {{design for}} the {{sculpture}} was selected during a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. Cloud <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams. Cloud <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, horse-drawn coaches {{became much}} more common in Canterbury, which lay at the centre of a new turnpike road system. This {{required}} extensive changes to the city streets and gateways, which were typically too narrow to be easily navigated by these vehicles. By 1779, Northgate and Burgate had been destroyed to allow wider entrances for the city. Riding <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 1782, but in 1791 the local citizen James Simmons built a new, brick archway on the old foundations, which was rapidly occupied by a new house, blocking most of the gateway. An iron bridge was later built over the site of Riding Gate. The Worth <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 1791 and reused in a local garden, a new entrance being built in its place. Newingate's drum towers were used as a water reservoir for the city, and the gatehouse was not demolished until 1801. Sections of the wall were cut away to allow new roads to be built; the walls near St Radiguns's Public Baths were demolished in 1794 and the city wall around London <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> demolished around 1800.|$|E
5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The <b>gate</b> <b>was</b> locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham <b>Gate</b> <b>was</b> widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E
5|$|A major {{restoration}} of Mdina's fortifications was {{undertaken in the}} 1720s by the French military engineer Charles François de Mondion, during the magistracy of António Manoel de Vilhena.

A Baroque portal was also added to the Greeks Gate. The remaining medieval towers in the land front were demolished and the Torre dello Standardo was built {{on the site of the}} Turri Mastra, while the entire western walls of the city were demolished to make way for a single casemated curtain wall known as Magazine Curtain. D'Homedes Bastion was modified with the addition of a bastionette, while traverse-like batteries were built at the extremities of the land front. The city was further protected with the construction of outworks, including a covertway, two places-of-arms and a glacis.|$|E

5|$|According {{to a story}} {{related by}} Niketas Choniates, in 1189 the <b>gate</b> <b>was</b> walled off by Emperor Isaac II Angelos, because {{according}} to a prophecy, it was this gate that Western Emperor Frederick Barbarossa would enter the city through.
