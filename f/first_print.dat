5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The <b>first</b> <b>print</b> run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E

50|$|It {{can not be}} {{said with}} {{certainty}} where the <b>first</b> <b>printing</b> press was set up in Bangladesh. It is conjectured that the <b>first</b> <b>printing</b> press in Bangladesh was in Rangpur during 1847, about 335 km away from Dhaka. The <b>first</b> <b>printed</b> piece from this printing press was a weekly newspaper named Rangapur Barttabaha (রঙ্গপুর বার্ত্তাবহ) in August 1847. In addition the first two Bengali weekly newspapers were from Rangpur. Printing machines took more than sixty years to reach East Bengal or Dhaka from Kolkata. The first English weekly newspaper, The Dacca News, was printed and published from Dhaka in 1856. So, it is assumed that after nine years of Rangpur press, the <b>first</b> <b>printing</b> machine of Dhaka was established and the press was named 'Dacca Press'.|$|R

5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. <b>First</b> <b>print</b> runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E

5|$|Since its {{original}} announcement, {{release of information}} became sporadic, leading to video game journalists labeling it as vaporware and eventually to rumors of its cancellation. After its public rebranding in 2013, the silence continued until its appearance at the 2014 Tokyo Game Show, at which point development and progress information was released on a regular basis. A demo for the game, Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae, was released in March 2015 with <b>first</b> <b>print</b> copies of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. Promotion for the title was effectively restarted at the 2015 Gamescom.
