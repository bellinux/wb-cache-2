A LIDAR-based terrain {{relative}} navigation (TRN) approach lets us achieve this goal and also land under any illumination conditions. Results from field test data showed that the LIDAR TRN algorithm obtained position estimates with mean error of about 20 meters {{and standard deviations of}} about 10 meters. Moreover, the algorithm was capable of providing 99 percent correct estimates by assessing the local terrain relief in the data. Also, the algorithm was able to handle initial position uncertainty of up to 1. 6 <b>kilometers</b> without <b>performance</b> degradation...|$|R

Snyder,Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri Dietary nitrate supplementation {{has been}} shown to lower the oxygen cost of {{exercise}} and improve exercise performance. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if dietary nitrate supplementation in the form of beetroot juice ‘shots’ improved 5 <b>kilometer</b> race <b>performance</b> in an ecologically valid race-like setting. METHODS: 11 male and 2 female runners ran two 5 k races, two weeks apart in a double blind, crossover design in which they drank 2 x 70 mL ‘shots’ of concentrated beetroot (8 mmol Nitrate) juice or a nitrate-depleted beetroot juice placebo 2. 5 hours before each race. RESULTS: Beetroot juice consumption resulted in a significantly slower 5 k race performance (1371 +/- 253 s vs. 1350 +/- 249 s, P=. 042). There was no significant difference between the kilometer split times. CONCLUSION: Our study found acute dietary nitrate consumption in the form of beetroot juice resulted in a significantly slower 5 k race performance.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. Shiptracks {{are known to}} be a relatively common phenomenon, often appearing in AVHRR channel 3 imagery as anomalous, curvilinear cloud lines. Despite their significance to remote ship surveillance studies, the formation mechanisms responsible for shiptrack production are still largely unknown and their specific characteristics still undefined. A shiptrack detection algorithm being developed at the Naval Postgraduate School seeks to objectively detect and locate shiptracks on AVHRR imagery. This algorithm is a major step in objectively defining specific shiptrack characteristics and automating the search for additional shiptrack examples. The {{purpose of this study was}} to outline the logic of the detection algorithm and present a subjective performance summary of its usefulness. After careful analysis of the algorithm output files on several full satellite passes, it was determined that the algorithm is capable of successfully detecting up to 65 % of the fresh shiptracks within a full pass AVHRR image with a false detection rate of only 1. 31 tracks per million square <b>kilometers.</b> This <b>performance</b> is likely to improve further with continued work focused on designing adequate filters to categorically reject many of the recurring false detections.

40|$|Predictors of {{performance}} can aid coaches and trainers in prescribing exercise programs for rowing athletes. To date, {{most of the}} prediction models {{have been developed for}} runners and cyclists. PURPOSE: The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a regression model to predict performance of a simulated 2 kilometer rowing ergometer time trial. METHODS: A group of mixed gender rowing athletes (n= 12) completed in a counterbalanced order a 2 Kilometer rowing time trial and a continuous progressively incremented graded exercise test on a rowing ergometer. Subjects were 23. 91 ± 4. 99 years old, weighed 79. 14 ± 12. 85 kg, were 187. 38 ± 12. 60 cm, had a VO 2 max of 55. 48 ± 10. 32 ml/kg/min and had 3. 17 ± 2. 79 years of rowing experience. Physiological measures were recorded during both testing protocols. RESULTS: Maximum Power/Stroke Ratio (r = - 0. 96, p< 0. 001), Power/Stroke Ratio at the ventilatory breakpoint (r = - 0. 90, p< 0. 001), Maximal Oxygen Uptake (r = - 0. 84, p< 0. 001) and Oxygen Uptake at the ventilatory breakpoint (r = - 0. 82, p< 0. 001) were found to be strong and significant predictors of 2 <b>kilometer</b> rowing <b>performance.</b> CONCLUSION: The four significant predictors of rowing performance suggest training should focus on improving both aerobic capacity and strength...|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} {{program designed}} to investigate kinematic and dynamic aspects of plate tectonics in the Pacific region by means of satellite observations is proposed. Accuracy studies are summarized showing that for short baselines (less than 100 km), the measuring accuracy of global positioning system (GPS) receivers {{can be in the}} centimeter range. For longer baselines, uncertainty in the orbital ephemerides of the GPS satellites could be a major source of error. Simultaneous observations at widely (about 300 km) separated fiducial stations over the Pacific region, should permit an accuracy in the centimeter range for baselines of up to several thousand <b>kilometers.</b> The optimum <b>performance</b> level {{is based on the assumption}} of that fiducial baselines are known a priori to the centimeter range. An example fiducial network for a GPS study of the South Pacific region is described...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an original computer code for double difference hypocenter determination including an independent routine for the cross-correlation estimate of the time difference between two waveform segments, relative to different events recorded by the same stations. This computer code has been tested relocating a set of 26 events recorded by the seismic stations of the telemetered Italian national network operated by the INGV. The hypocentral solutions so obtained are characterized by standard deviations typically {{of the order of}} magnitude of 50 m, in comparison with the errors of a few <b>kilometers</b> characterizing the <b>performance</b> of the INGV bulletins. The proximity of hypocenters in several groups of events closely separated in time shows that our relocations are the result of an accurate analysis, rather than that of random errors. The method developed in this study is suitable for rapid and accurate hypocentral determination carried out by a permanent sparsely distributed network of stations, even before that mobile equipment installed in the area affected by new seismic activity allows higher resolution locations...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of a 4 -week {{reduction}} in training volume and intensity on performance of distance runners. Ten well-conditioned males underwent 4 -weeks of base training (BT) at their accustomed training distance (71. 8 ± 3. 6 km/wk) and pace (76 % of total distance above 70 % V 02 max intensity), before reducing training (RT) for an additional 4 weeks. Training volume was decreased by -. 66 % to 24. 8 km/wk and frequency by 50 % to 3 runs per week. Training intensity was reduced such that all running was at less than 70 % V 02 max (68. 2 ± 1. 6 %). At the end of BT (week 0), and weeks 2 and 4 of RT, resting heart rate, calculated plasma volume, testosterone and cortisol levels, and submaximal treadmill efficiency were assessed. At weeks 0 and 4, V 02 max and 5 <b>kilometer</b> race <b>performance</b> was determined. The ratio of testosterone to cortisol was increased significantly with RT (0. 054 ± 0. 008 at week 0 to 0. 082 ± 0. 020 at week 4), although the individual testosterone and cortisol concentrations were not significantly altered. Maximum oxygen consumption, and time to exhaustion during the max tests were not altered with RT. Body weight tended to increase (p= 0. 09) due to a significant increase in percent body fat (p< 0. 05). Submaximal treadmill runs at 65 %, 85 %, and 95 % V 02 max revealed no alterations in absolute V 02 while relative V 02 decreased significantly. This decrease in relative V 02 was due partially to the weight increases and partially to a significant increase in respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Resting and submaximal treadmill heart rate (HR) were unchanged with FIT, while maximal treadmill HR and race HR were increased significantly. Calculated plasma volume was unaltered. Leg and overall ratings of perceived exertion were decreased during RT with the overall rating reaching significance (p< 0. 05). Blood lactic acid concentration was found to be significantly higher at the 95 % V 02 max workload following RT (8. 39 ± 0. 46 vs 9. 89 ± 0. 46 mmol/L at week 0 and 4, respectively). Five kilometer race time increased significantly from 16. 6 ± 0. 3 at week 0 to 16. 8 ± 0. 3 minutes at week 4 (12. 1 seconds). It is concluded that a 4 -week reduction in training volume and intensity in these runners resulted in a significant decrease in race performance despite the maintenance of aerobic capacity.

40|$|We {{present a}} real-time, accurate, {{large-scale}} monocular visual odometry system for real-world autonomous outdoor driving applications. This dissertation makes four important contributions: First, we demonstrate robust monocular Structure from Motion (SFM) {{with a series}} of architectural innovations including a novel epipolar searching module in a parallel thread to replenish 3 D points through a series of validation mechanism, a novel combination of local and global bundle adjustment that ensures accuracy, robustness and efficiency and so on. These architectural innovations address the challenge of robust multithreading even for scenes with large motions and rapidly changing imagery. Our design is extensible for three or more parallel CPU threads. The novel epipolar searching module, operating in parallel with other threads to generate new 3 D points at every frame, together with the local bundle adjustment in the primary thread, significantly boost robustness and accuracy. Secondly, we demonstrate robust monocular SFM with accuracy unmatched by prior state-of-the-art; over several <b>kilometers,</b> we achieve <b>performance</b> similar to stereo that far exceeds other monocular architectures. The key to this performance is scale drift correction using ground plane estimation that combines cues from sparse features and dense stereo. Our third contribution is a data-driven mechanism for cue combination that learns models from training data to relate observation covariances for each cue to error behavior of underlying variables. During testing, this allows per-frame adaptation of observation covariances based on relative confidences inferred from visual data. Finally, we present a framework for highly accurate 3 D localization of objects like cars and a lane detection system based on our SFM poses and ground planes. Our accurate ground plane and SFM poses easily benefit 3 D localization frameworks and vision-based lane detection for those applications, as demonstrated by our experiments. Our baseline SFM system is optimized to output pose within 50 ms in the worst case, while average case operation is over 30 fps. Evaluations are presented on the challenging KITTI dataset for autonomous driving, where we achieve better rotation and translation accuracy than other state-of-the-art system...|$|R
