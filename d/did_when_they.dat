5|$|In 2004, Tecmo began {{releasing}} low-priced episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for AT and Verizon {{mobile phones}} on both BREW and Java platforms. The official English Tecmo Games mobile website advertised {{it for a}} future release along with a mobile version of Tecmo Bowl. They planned to release the entire game throughout 2004 {{in a series of}} four installments – similar to what Upstart Games <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> ported the NES version of Castlevania to mobile phones. The port featured the same visuals and soundtrack found on the NES version, and each installment was to consist of several levels of gameplay at a time. The first installment, titled Ninja Gaiden EpisodeI: Destiny, was released on , and it included only the first Act from the NES version but added two new levels. The second installment was planned to be released in North America and was previewed by GameSpot in September 2004, but it – along with the third and fourth installments – was never released.|$|E
25|$|CBS had {{originally}} planned {{on making the}} As the World Turns expansion {{at the beginning of}} the new season in September 1975. ABC's daytime schedule was full at the time, and the earliest they could have a spot open on the schedule would be December. This meant that it would be approximately three months at least before Edge would air its first episode on ABC and the network did not want to do that. Instead, a compromise was struck. CBS would keep The Edge of Night on its schedule for the time being, and once ABC found a place for it, which it <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> cancelled You Don't Say! in November 1975, the expansion and network change would take place.|$|E

Some date {{from the beginning of}} the 20th century or earlier, but many of the original tram and streetcar systems were closed down in the mid-20th century, with the exceptions of many Eastern Europe countries. Even though many systems closed down over the years, there are still a number of tram systems that have been operating much as they <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were first built over a century ago. Some cities (such as Los Angeles and Jersey City) that once closed down their streetcar networks are now restoring, or have already rebuilt, at least some of their former streetcar/tram systems. Most light rail services are currently committed to articulated vehicles like modern LRVs, i.e. trams, with the exception of large underground metro or rapid transit systems.|$|E

Camitz was hired on Fuller's recommendation because of his commercials for Volkswagen, Diesel, and Nike.

A few days before the shoot on 19 April 1996, Camitz was unable to get permission to use the building, and the shoot was relocated to the Midland Grand Hotel in St Pancras, London.|$|E

Biden stated: [...] "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous.

The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Matt Stone and Trey Parker [...] "probably hit their zenith when they made fun of Tom Cruise and Scientology".

500|$|Fred [...] "Curly" [...] Morrison, {{a former}} Browns running back {{who worked as}} an {{advertising}} executive for CBS television, learned in 1960 that Dave Jones was looking to sell the Browns and told the story to Art Modell, a 35-year-old advertising and television executive from Brooklyn. Modell was intrigued, {{partly because of the}} potentially lucrative television rights that one of the NFL's most successful franchises could bring as football began to challenge baseball as America's biggest sport. Having borrowed as much money as he could, Modell completed the purchase in March 1961 for $3.925 million. Bob Gries, who had a share in the Browns from the beginning, agreed to buy in again at the new valuation and take a stake of almost 40%, defraying Modell's costs substantially. As the previous owners <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> took over, Modell quickly assured Cleveland fans that Brown would [...] "have a free hand" [...] in running the organization and awarded him a new eight-year contract.

[...] A review from the Hamilton Spectator noted that the album's concluding tracks [...] "If You Believe" [...] and [...] "The Wonderful Future" [...] demonstrated a particular facility for mixing sonic textures and that there were [...] "actually moments when vocalist Raine Maida varies from his impersonation of a singing head cold." [...] Ashley Bird of Kerrang! noted that the album was packed with crisp, clean songwriting, odd searing post-grunge riffs and Raine Maida's nasal croon.

Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the harp seal. An endangered seal is the Mediterranean monk seal. In 1971, the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system. The system was competitive, with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed, which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> knew that year's quota had been reached. Because it was thought that the competitive element might cause sealers to cut corners, new regulations were introduced that limited the catch to 400 seals per day, and 2000 per boat total.
