5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a {{scriptwriter}} for Terra Filmkunst, {{mentioned his}} idea to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom he}} was working on the script for Central Rio. Ebbecke shot down the idea, raising a number of objections <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Mendes had already done a film on the same topic in England and the concern that German audiences might confuse the proposed film with Feuchtwanger's novel which was not antisemitic.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} {{describes}} the physical geography and geology {{of the islands}} with {{particular attention to the}} role of volcanoes and earthquakes. It also discusses the overall pattern of the flora and fauna <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the islands can be divided, by what would eventually become known as the Wallace line, into two parts, those whose animals are more closely related to those of Asia and those whose fauna is closer to that of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained inside one underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{objections}} to {{the interpretation of the}} structure as being a road at all, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> several burial cists along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m, highly unusual for a road surface. Since 1997, authorities including English Heritage have accepted the possibility that the structure may not be a road. Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner suggested in 1997 that the structure may be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a Neolithic or Bronze Age boundary wall or dyke. There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including boundary dikes, although Knight et al. report that the later Neolithic is very poorly represented archaeologically in the North York Moors area and neolithic use of the moors was likely very limited in extent. Bronze Age presence in the moors, including earthworks, is well represented generally in the archaeology of the area, and therefore is a more plausible origin. Evidence against the identification of the causeway as an early Neolithic structure includes the statement by Elgee in 1912 that the causeway had been identified as cutting across an earlier British earthwork just north of Julian Park, suggesting that it must post-date it. One possibility that could explain several of the anomalies in trying to definitively identify the site is the suggestion by Knight et al. that it was commonly observed practice in the area for dykes to be reused as trackways.|$|E

Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Aoki still had his privately held restaurants of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} interest in the investigation is {{the design of the}} exit itself. Several factors played a possible role, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the exit was an atypical left exit; inadequate advance notice was given of this setup; the HOV exit was signed differently than standard exits; the arrow on the exit sign misled drivers about where the HOV lane continued; and the exit ramp itself had poor signage.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{high-profile}} baby rapes appeared since 2001 (<b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems). In 2001, a 9-month-old was raped and likely lost consciousness as {{the pain was}} too much to bear. In February 2002, an 8-month-old infant was reportedly gang raped by four men. One has been charged. The infant has required extensive reconstructive surgery. The 8-month-old infant's injuries were so extensive, increased attention on prosecution has occurred.|$|E
25|$|It {{is still}} not clear whether {{magnetic}} resonance venography, venous angiography, or Doppler sonography should be considered {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of magnetic resonance venography for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques. Others have stated that magnetic resonance venography is a valid measure which has advantages over Doppler <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> results are more operator-independent.|$|E
25|$|Emanuel was a {{published}} poet, scholar, and critic. As a poet, Emanuel {{published more than}} 300 poems and 13 individual books.

Critics have put forward several reasons for Emanuel's poetry being neglected by the larger literary world, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Emanuel wrote more traditional poetic forms, that he left the United States, {{and the fact that he}} refused to take part in the politically correct world of Black academia.|$|E

25|$|The incident, ruled an {{accident}} by the police, was {{called into question}} at the time by El Mundo writer Adelia Di Carlo.

25|$|Levantine Art {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Teruel in 1903. The Spanish prehistorian Juan Cabre {{was the first}} to study this art, defining it as a regional Palaeolithic art. Assessment as Palaeolithic was challenged for various reasons <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> no glacial fauna was depicted. Antonio Beltrán Martínez and others place the beginning of this art in the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic, placing its heyday in the Neolithic period. Accepting a post-Paleolithic age for the art, Ripio devised a new chronological scheme in the 1960s, dividing the art into four stages:naturalistic, stylized static, stylized dynamic, and final phase of transition to the schematic.|$|E
25|$|Eric Ives, the biographer of Anne Boleyn (1986), {{believes}} that the play is really a parallel {{of the fall of}} the queen, who was beheaded on false charges of adultery on the orders of her husband HenryVIII in 1536. There are numerous parallels between the two stories– <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> one of Henry's closest friends, Sir Henry Norreys, was beheaded as one of Anne's supposed lovers and he refused to confess in order to save his life, claiming that everyone knew the Queen was innocent. If this theory is followed then Perdita becomes a dramatic presentation of Anne's only daughter, Queen ElizabethI.|$|E
