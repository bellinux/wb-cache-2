Prior to the establishment of the Islamic State in 1979, the Organization of Intelligence and National Security also allegedly performed a number of political motivated assassinations against dissidents and opposition leaders.|$|E
25|$|Separatist tendencies, led by {{some groups}} such as the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran and Komalah in Iranian Kurdistan, for example, had led to {{frequent}} unrest and occasional military crackdown throughout the 1990s and even to the present. In Iran, Kurds have twice had their own autonomous regions independent of central government control: The Republic of Mahabad in Iran which was the second independent Kurdish state of the 20th century, after the Republic of Ararat in modern Turkey; and the second time after the Iranian Revolution in 1979.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{throughout}} West Beirut, Amal {{continued to}} suppress the remaining predominately Sunni, pro-Palestinian militias such as the small Nasserite Sixth of February Movement in June 1986. The PLO was also aided by Lebanese-Kurdish fighters from the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> – Lebanon (KDP–L), who lived with their families alongside the Palestinians in the refugee camps. Many leftist Lebanese-Kurdish militants joined Palestinian guerrilla movements during the 1975-76 Lebanese civil war, and these militiamen now fought to protect their homes from Amal, as well as supporting their Palestinian comrades. The situation began to cool on 24 June 1986, when the Syrians deployed some of their Commando troops, assisted by a special task-force of 800 Lebanese Army soldiers and Gendarmes from the Internal Security Forces.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{autonomy}} {{had been}} agreed in 1970, local population enjoyed no particular democratic freedom denied {{to the rest}} of the country. Things began to change after the 1991 uprising against Saddam Hussein at the end of the Persian Gulf War. United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 gave birth to a safe haven following international concern for the safety of Kurdish refugees. The US and British government established a No Fly Zone over a large part of northern Iraq (see Operation Provide Comfort), however, it left out Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk and other important Kurdish populated regions. Bloody clashes between Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops continued and, after an uneasy and shaky balance of power was reached, the Iraqi government fully withdrew its military and other personnel from the region in October 1991 allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function de facto independently. The region was to be ruled by the two principal Kurdish parties; the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The region also has its own flag and national anthem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{president}} of Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Massoud Barzani, condemned Turkey's raids and warned Ankara {{to stop the}} strikes, and the Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, {{who is a member}} of the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (KDP), expressed concern that [...] "unilateral actions" [...] could harm Iraqi and Turkish interests.|$|E

2500|$|Protests in the Kurdish {{inhabited}} {{areas of}} Syria evolved into armed clashes [...] after the opposition <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> Union <b>Party</b> (PYD) and Kurdish National Council (KNC) signed a cooperation agreement on 12 July 2012 {{that created the}} Kurdish Supreme Committee as the governing body of all Kurdish controlled areas.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 November 2012, the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> Union <b>Party</b> (PYD), which {{controls}} {{territory in the}} north of Syria, rejected the new coalition and criticised it for [...] "obedience to Turkey and Qatar".

2500|$|However, {{with the}} party {{increasingly}} weak, al-Radi himself saw no alternative to a continued policy of critical support for Qasim, despite a renewed wave of repression in May 1962 following Communist-led demonstrations against the Kurdish war. In late 1962, the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> [...] suggested that the Communists collaborate with them in a coup attempt, but the latter rejected the idea. In January 1963, they warned Qasim that plans were afoot for a nationalist coup.|$|E
2500|$|The Republic of Mahabad {{depended}} on Soviet support. Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt, Jr., grandson {{of the former}} U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, wrote in [...] "The Kurdish Republic of Mahabad" [...] that a main problem of the People's Republic of Mahabad was that the Kurds needed {{the assistance of the}} USSR; only with the Red Army did they have a chance. However, its close relationship to the USSR alienated the republic from most Western powers, causing them to side with Iran. Qazi Muhammad did not deny that his republic was funded and supplied by the Soviets, but did deny that the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (KDP) was a communist party. He claimed that this was a lie fabricated by the Iranian military authorities, and added that his ideals were very different from the Soviets'. Following the fall of Mahabad, the Soviets allowed for the safe passage of Mustafa Barzani and his followers into the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|While {{most of its}} {{military}} and political activity in Iran was greatly overpowered after the 1979 rebellion, the <b>Kurdish</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Iran (KDPI) had continued its opposition activities through 1980s.
