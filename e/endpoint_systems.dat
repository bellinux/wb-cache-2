50|$|Endpoint (data in use) systems run on {{internal}} end-user workstations or servers. Like network-based systems, endpoint-based technology can address internal {{as well as}} external communications. it can therefore be used to control information flow between groups or types of users (e.g. 'Chinese walls'). They can also control email and Instant Messaging communications {{before they reach the}} corporate archive, such that a blocked communication (i.e., one that was never sent, and therefore not subject to retention rules) will not be identified in a subsequent legal discovery situation. <b>Endpoint</b> <b>systems</b> have the advantage that they can monitor and control access to physical devices (such as mobile devices with data storage capabilities) and in some cases can access information before it is encrypted. Some endpoint-based systems provide application controls to block attempted transmissions of confidential information and provide immediate user feedback. They must be installed on every workstation in the network, cannot be used on mobile devices (e.g., cell phones and PDAs) or where they cannot be practically installed (for example on a workstation in an Internet café).|$|E

IT management applications delivered as a service may need to connect {{to tens of thousands}} of <b>endpoint</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to validate the application's reliability and performance at these very large scales, its scalability needs to be tested before being deployed in the cloud. We use an emulation approach, whereby endpoints are modelled and then executed in an emulation environment, which we call 'Kaluta'. The key aspect is to balance the modelling of the <b>endpoint</b> <b>systems</b> such that it is rich enough to 'fool' an unmodified application-under-test into thinking that it is talking to real systems, but lightweight enough such that tens of thousands of instances of model systems can be executed simultaneously in the emulation engine. We present an industry case study [...] -CA IdentityMinder(TM) -as-a-Service [...] -to demonstrate the effectiveness of using emulation to validate the scalability of a cloud hosted application...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system for}} externally monitoring endpoint configuration compliance of an end user system that provides a high assurance monitoring function and data. Typical approaches to monitoring for endpoint configuration compliance rely on {{the integrity of the}} <b>endpoint’s</b> operating <b>system</b> and do not protect the monitoring function from subversion or spoofing by threats from within the monitored system. Our approach utilizes (1) a virtual machine architecture on the <b>endpoint</b> <b>system</b> to protect the monitoring function and (2) virtual machine introspection of the end user’s environment. In this paper we describe our approach to external monitoring of endpoint configuration compliance, present the technical details of our monitoring system, and discuss some of the issues associated with external monitoring...|$|R

50|$|The key {{component}} of the Cisco Network Admission Control program is the Cisco Trust Agent, which resides on an <b>endpoint</b> <b>system</b> and communicates with Cisco routers on the network. The Cisco Trust Agent collects security state information, such as what antivirus software is being used, and communicates this information to Cisco routers. The information is then relayed to a Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) where access control decisions are made. The ACS directs the Cisco router to perform enforcement against the endpoint.|$|R
40|$|Testing {{enterprise}} {{software that}} communicates {{with a large}} number of other software systems is a challenging task as {{it is often difficult to}} replicate the size and heterogeneity of large enterprise environments. In particular, it is challenging to conduct testing of non-functional properties related to scalability, performance, and robustness of enterprise software systems when deployed into such environments. In order to address this issue, we propose the use of a scalable emulation environment enabling non-functional testing of enterprise software in realistic and large-scale settings. In this paper, we illustrate our approach by using deterministic finite state machines to specify a scalable and interactive emulation of a modeled environment. To demonstrate the practicality and scalability of the approach, a prototype tool is presented that is used to emulate a large-scale environment of up to 10, 000 <b>endpoint</b> <b>systems</b> for an enterprise class software system. 1...|$|E
40|$|Client <b>endpoint</b> <b>systems</b> are a prime {{target for}} attackers of every sophistication level. These systems {{take part in}} many {{transactions}} demanding a degree of trust that cannot {{be placed in a}} general-purpose, commodity, com-puter system. We propose that these sensitive transac-tions can be made more secure by creating a new kind of trusted path, one that connects a server directly to a client’s hardware peripherals. This capability has been designed to isolate a compromised endpoint from its pe-ripherals during security sensitive applications. Such connectivity could be made unforgeable, strong against eavesdropping and tied to a user’s credentials using end-to-end cryptography. We present a prototype Secure Remote Peripheral En-cryption Tunnel (SeRPEnT) for the Universal Serial Bus (USB). Our device is a small, low-power “cryptographic switchboard ” that tunnels connected peripherals to a server with Virtual Machine(VM) -hosted applications. SeRPEnT can also pass-through devices to the client sys-tem, allowing normal use of the local system by the user. SeRPEnT enables secure transactions between the user and server applications by only allowing input to these VMs to originate from our portable embedded device. SeRPEnT thus drastically reduces the attack surface cur-rently exposed to an adversary...|$|E
40|$|The {{progression}} toward spatially {{scalable video coding}} (SVC) {{solutions for}} ubiquitous <b>endpoint</b> <b>systems</b> introduces challenges to sustain real-time frame rates in downsampling high-resolution videos into multiple layers. In addressing these challenges, we put forward a hardware accelerated downsampling algorithm on a parallel computing platform. First, we investigate the principal architecture of a serial downsampling algorithm in the Joint-Scalable-Video-Model reference software to identify the performance limitations for spatially SVC. Then, a parallel multicore-based downsampling algorithm is studied as a benchmark. Experimental results for this algorithm using an 8 -core processor exhibit performance speedup of 5. 25 × against the serial algorithm in downsampling a quantum extended graphics array at 1536 p video resolution into three lower resolution layers (i. e., Full-HD at 1080 p, HD at 720 p, and Quarter-HD at 540 p). However, the achieved speedup here does not translate into the minimum required frame rate of 15 frames per second (fps) for real-time video processing. To improve the speedup, a many-core based downsampling algorithm using the compute unified device architecture parallel computing platform is proposed. The proposed algorithm increases the performance speedup to 26. 14 × against the serial algorithm. Crucially, the proposed algorithm exceeds the target frame rate of 15 fps, {{which in turn is}} advantageous to the overall performance of the video encoding process...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT | Because of {{a concern}} that in {{developing}} transitional energy <b>systems</b> the <b>endpoint</b> <b>system</b> requirements {{should be kept in}} mind, this paper focuses on storage in a renewable energy system that uses no fossil fuels. Based largely on the current seasonal patterns of consumption and wind and solar energy generated, it is estimated that the energy storage capacity that would be required to supply the electrical energy for the United States for a year given that the source of the electricity is from solar, wind, or a combination of the two, is in the order of 10 %– 20 % of the total annual demand. While the uncertainty within and between published estimates of biomass availability is quite large, a partial review of the literature indicates that the global biomass primary energy potential could satisfy seasonal energy demands in a sustainable manner. The storage volumes required for biomass and hydrogen, another storage possibility, to meet seasonal storage needs are considerably smaller than that required for compressed air or elevated water...|$|R

The System consists of three polish platens, {{each of which is}} equipped with an optical <b>endpoint</b> detection <b>system.</b> The process consists of three steps with different polish slurries, and is designed to polish copper with a tantalum based barrier, and to achieve good defect performance.
