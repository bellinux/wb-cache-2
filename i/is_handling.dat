5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it <b>is</b> <b>handling.</b> It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it only knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
