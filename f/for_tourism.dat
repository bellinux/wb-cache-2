5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive <b>for</b> <b>tourism</b> from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site.

Although the ranch was not developed <b>for</b> <b>tourism,</b> the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
