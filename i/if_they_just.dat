5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E

During a break between {{the development of the}} first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co-creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the [...] "standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought about who they were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell? What <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> make a rash decision and get hitched?" ...|$|E

500|$|Series {{producer}} Ryan Murphy first planned {{an episode}} entitled [...] "Original Song" [...] to air in early 2010, during the series' first season. Prior to this episode, most of Glees musical performances were cover versions, and by October 2009 {{he had received}} offers from multiple songwriters willing to devise original tracks. At the time, he stated that Diane Warren would write two ballads for the show, and if successful, Glee may continue to use original music in the future, {{but not all the}} time. These plans did not come to fruition, nor did a December 2009 claim by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder that he had been recruited by Glees music supervisor, Adam Anders, to write an original song for the series. Murphy later stated that he planned to showcase original music during the second season, aiming to find a way for this to occur organically, as: [...] "It wouldn’t work [...] <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> broke out and started singing their own songs. You wouldn't get it. I {{think it has to be}} an assignment." ...|$|E
500|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{received}} some praise for graphical improvements over its predecessor. Among {{the aspects of}} the game which received positive reactions were the game's environments. Just Adventure called the game environments [...] "head and shoulders above And Then There Were None," [...] describing the train's carriages on the Orient Express as oozing with elegance, and a faithful and accurate recreation of the 1930s. The site criticized the game for suffering graphically in later stages, but praised it overall for improving on the graphics of And Then There Were None. Game Chronicles was less enthusiastic, calling the graphics above average, but standard fare for a current adventure game. Character models were another aspect of Murder on the Orient Express which received positive attention. Quandary described the character modelling as much improved from And Then There Were None, and while still a tinge woody, [...] "all the characters feel as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> {{stepped out of the}} book." [...] Adventure Gamers called the characters [...] "some of the best seen in recent adventure games," [...] saying that each character has a unique design and costume perfect for the game's setting. The reviewer also pointed out several small touches added to the characters, such as the main character shivering when she is outside the train in the cold weather, and also brushing lint off her clothing while waiting for the player {{to decide what to do}} next. Adventure Gamers also complimented AWE Productions for lighting effects in the game, and for creating a [...] "very soft glow to the scenes, which give a much more lifelike look to the characters." [...] IGN agreed that the interior of the Orient Express is quite sharp, but complained that character models lack detail and are animated awkwardly. Another complaint from IGN was that the compression used for cutscenes causes the animations to look [...] "washed out and blocky," [...] and that this problem continues as the cutscenes are noticeably pixelated throughout Murder on the Orient Express.|$|E

2500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{magazine}} {{gave the}} episode a positive review. He started {{by noting that}} the episode [...] "shows us how Awake will most likely work as a series". According to Bonaime, [...] "the show never shows the faces of either MacKenzie, not even letting us know if {{they are supposed to}} be the same person or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> share the same name". He stated that [...] "Awake is also showing a great ability to show the impact of Britten's decisions he makes throughout the realities, regardless of how small they are". The episode had [...] "sweet moments", stated Bonaime. Like other reviewers, Bonaime criticized the final scene of the episode". Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode an [...] "8.4 out of 10" [...] rating, classifying it as [...] "commendable". Caroline Preece from Den of Geek called it [...] "promising", [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "fortunate", claiming that [...] "the genre elements of Awake have received much more attention than the generic cop show trappings they're wrapped in". Despite this, she called it [...] "strange".|$|E

2500|$|At {{least four}} veined octopus (Amphioctopus marginatus) {{individuals}} were witnessed retrieving coconut shells, manipulating them, stacking them, transporting them some distance (up to 20 metres), and then reassembling {{them to use}} as a shelter. The octopuses use coconut shells discarded by humans which have eventually settled in the ocean. They probe their arms down to loosen the mud, then rotate the shells out. After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards, the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their arms around the shell—or if they have two halves, stacking them first, one inside the other. They then stiffen their legs and move away in a manner which has been called [...] "stilt-walking". The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter in areas where little other shelter exists. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> have one half, they simply turn it over and hide underneath. But if they are lucky enough to have retrieved two halves, they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside. This behaviour [...] The authors of the research article claimed this behaviour falls under the definition of tool use because the shells are carried for later use. However, this argument remains contested by a number of other biologists who state that the shells actually provide continuous protection from abundant bottom-dwelling predators in their home range.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Verver, it may further be mentioned, {{had taken}} at no moment {{sufficient}} alarm to have kept {{in detail the}} record of his reassurance; but he would none the less not have been unable, not really have been indisposed, to impart in confidence to the right person his notion {{of the history of}} the matter. The right person--it is equally distinct--had not, for this illumination, been wanting, but had been encountered in the form of Fanny Assingham, not for the first time indeed admitted to his counsels, and who would have doubtless at present, in any case, from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees, repeated his secret. It all came then, the great clearance, from the one prime fact that the Prince, by good fortune, hadn't proved angular. He clung to that description of his daughter's husband as he often did to terms and phrases, in the human, the social connection, that he had found for himself: it was his way to have times of using these constantly, as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> then lighted the world, or his own path in it, for him--even when for some of his interlocutors they covered less ground. It was true that with Mrs. Assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anything covered; she disputed with him so little, agreed with him so much, surrounded him with such systematic consideration, such predetermined tenderness, that it was almost--which he had once told her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby. He had accused her of not taking him seriously, and she had replied--as from her it couldn't frighten him--that she took him religiously, adoringly. She had laughed again, as she had laughed before, on his producing for her that good right word about the happy issue of his connection with the Prince--with an effect the more odd perhaps as she had not contested its value. She couldn't of course, however, be, at the best, as much in love with his discovery as he was himself. He was so much so that he fairly worked it--to his own comfort; came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred if friction, so to speak, had occurred. He pointed it frankly one day to the personage in question, mentioned to the Prince the particular justice he did him, was even explicit as to the danger that, in their remarkable relation, they had thus escaped. Oh, if he HAD been angular!--who could say what might THEN have happened? He spoke--and it was the way he had spoken to Mrs. Assingham too--as if he grasped the facts, without exception, for which angularity stood.|$|E
