She spent the war in the Mediterranean, covering the Otranto Barrage in the Adriatic. France, accompanied by her sister ship , was sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to oppose the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Her crew briefly mutinied in April 1919 from a combination of war-weariness, Communist sympathizers in the crew and difficult conditions. The mutiny and general lack of morale among her crew caused her to return to France later that month.

5|$|Tropical Storm Abby was an {{exceptionally}} small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression {{out of a}} trough south of Louisiana on August5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system {{and it became a}} tropical storm just 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August8 southwest of San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{period of}} rapid deepening began early on September30 as a well-defined eye became clearly visible on satellite imagery. Ophelia intensified into a Category2 hurricane with winds of 100mph (155km/h) by 0600UTC {{and became the}} season's third major hurricane—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale—twelve hours later. Cloud tops continued to cool in the system's eyewall late on October1, with cloud tops {{in the eye of}} the system warming. Ophelia intensified into a Category4 hurricane at 0000UTC on October2 and simultaneously attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 940mb (hPa; 27.76inHg) as it passed east of Bermuda. Weakening ensued the following day as the hurricane entered cooler sea surface temperatures and an environment characterized by significantly more stable air. Ophelia weakened below major hurricane intensity by 1800UTC and became a tropical storm for the final time by 0600UTC on October3. The system lost its tropical characteristics and was subsequently declared an extratropical cyclone <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> while positioned just southwest of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger weather system by the afternoon hours of the following day.|$|E

5|$|Land {{interaction}} during Krovanh's {{passage of}} Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000UTC on August22, Krovanh {{was classified as}} only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August24, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on Cẩm Phả, Vietnam at approximately 1500UTC on August25. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.|$|E
5|$|On July13, Typhoon Nangka {{began moving}} northward toward Japan through {{a break in}} the ridge. The typhoon {{completed}} an eyewall replacement cycle, and according to the JTWC attained a secondary peak of 195km/h (120mph). The re-intensification was also aided by a decrease in wind shear, but was short-lived due to drier air from the north and west. As the eye became more ragged, the winds continued to decrease. At 14:00UTC on July16, Nangka made landfall along the Japanese island of Shikoku near Muroto, Kōchi, still at typhoon status. <b>Four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the typhoon weakened into a severe tropical storm, and after crossing the Seto Inland Sea, Nangka made a second landfall on Honshu near Kurashiki, Okayama at 21:00UTC. The convection greatly weakened as it crossed Honshu into the Sea of Japan, and the storm deteriorated further due to lower water temperatures. At 12:00UTC on July17, the JMA downgraded Nangka to a tropical depression, and early the next day the JTWC discontinued advisories. On July18, Nangka dissipated in the central Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. <b>Four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E

Case Report The patient, a single women aged 54 years, was first admitted to hospital in December 1950 because she had suddenly lost consciousness for a short period the day before, and this had been followed by weakness in the left leg. On admission her blood pressure was found to be 210 / 100 but settled to 160 / 80 within a few days.

5|$|The Battle of Aspern-Essling {{started at}} 2:30pm on 21 May. The initial and poorly coordinated Austrian attacks against Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods {{to the south}} failed completely, but Charles persisted. Eventually, the Austrians managed to capture the whole village but lost the eastern half. The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6pm because {{the fourth and fifth}} columns had longer marching routes. The French {{successfully}} repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the 21st. Fighting commenced by 3am on the 22nd, and <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> the French had captured Aspern again. Napoleon now had 71,000 men and 152 guns {{on the other side of}} the river, but the French were still dangerously outnumbered. Napoleon then launched a massive assault against the Austrian center designed to give enough time for the III Corps to cross and clinch the victory. Lannes advanced with three infantry divisions and travelled for a mile before the Austrians, inspired by the personal heroics of Charles with his rally of the Zach Infantry Regiment (No. 15), unleashed a hail of fire on the French that caused the latter to fall back. At 9am, the French bridge broke again. Charles launched another massive assault an hour later and captured Aspern for good, but still could not lay claim to Essling. A few hours later, however, the Austrians returned and took all of Essling except the staunchly defended granary. Napoleon replied by sending a part of the Imperial Guard under Jean Rapp, who audaciously disobeyed Napoleon's orders by attacking Essling and expelling all Austrian forces. Charles then kept up a relentless artillery bombardment that counted Marshal Lannes as one of its many victims. Fighting diminished shortly afterwards, and the French pulled back all of their forces to Lobau. Charles had inflicted the first major defeat in Napoleon's military career.|$|E
