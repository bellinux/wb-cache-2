5|$|The {{records of}} the priory and abbey have not survived, but the {{excavations}} {{and the study of}} other documents have produced evidence of how the monastic lands were managed. The principal source of income came from farming. This income was required not only for the building and upkeep of the property, but also for feeding the canons, their guests, and visiting pilgrims. The priory also had an obligation from its foundation to house travellers fording the Mersey. It has been estimated that nearly half of the demesne lands were used for arable farming. The grain grown on priory lands was ground by a local windmill and by a watermill outside the priory lands. Excavations revealed part of a stone handmill in the area used in the monastic kitchen. In addition to orchards and herb gardens in the moated enclosures, it is likely that beehives were maintained for the production of honey. There is evidence from bone fragments that cattle, sheep, pigs, geese and chickens were reared and consumed, but few bone fragments from deer, rabbits or hares have been discovered. <b>Horseflesh</b> was not eaten. Although few fish bones have been discovered, it is known from documentary evidence that the canons owned a number of local fisheries. The fuel used consisted of wood and charcoal, and turf from marshes over which the priory had rights of turbary (to cut turf).|$|E
500|$|Stallions {{were often}} used as destriers due to their natural aggression. However, {{there may have been}} some use of mares by European warriors, and mares, who were quieter and less likely to call out and betray their {{position}} to the enemy, were the preferred war horse of the Moors, who invaded various parts of Southern Europe from 700 AD through the 15th century. [...] Geldings were used in war by the Teutonic Knights, and known as [...] "monk horses" [...] (German Mönchpferde or Mönchhengste). One advantage was if captured by the enemy, they could not be used to improve local bloodstock, thus maintaining the Knights' superiority in <b>horseflesh.</b>|$|E
500|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known about Sviatoslav's {{childhood}} and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. Sviatoslav's father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 945, and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of <b>horseflesh,</b> game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor {{did he have a}} tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise.|$|E
2500|$|One man, in particular, was {{impressed}} by the young man. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, reported to Cromwell in August 1536 that his son was in good health and, [...] "sparing no <b>horseflesh</b> to run after the deer and hounds. I trust you will not be discontent that I now cause him to forbear his book. Be sure you shall have in him a wise quick piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|Siege life {{took its}} toll on both the {{defending}} soldiers and the civilians in the cities of Mafeking, Ladysmith, and Kimberley as food began to grow scarce after a few weeks. In Mafeking, Sol Plaatje wrote, [...] "I saw <b>horseflesh</b> {{for the first time}} being treated as a human foodstuff." [...] The cities under siege also dealt with constant artillery bombardment, making the streets a dangerous place. Near the end of the siege of Kimberley, it was expected that the Boers would intensify their bombardment, so Rhodes displayed a notice encouraging people to go down into shafts of the Kimberley Mine for protection. The townspeople panicked, and people surged into the mine-shafts constantly for a 12-hour period. Although the bombardment never came, this did nothing to diminish the anxious civilians distress. [...] The most well-heeled of the townspeople, such as Cecil Rhodes, sheltered in the Sanatorium, site of the present-day McGregor Museum; the poorer residents, notably the black population, did not have any shelter from the shelling.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed Sir Thomas, who indulged {{himself in}} a taste for <b>horseflesh,</b> and pretended to know one animal from another.|$|E
60|$|Then Eudena's {{heart was}} light, {{and she laughed}} with him; and {{afterwards}} she ate what he had left of the <b>horseflesh</b> with gladness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brought you Flip, my fast trotter," [...] he explained. [...] "He {{ought to}} be able to {{overtake}} any bit of <b>horseflesh</b> in these parts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{he fell to}} {{work like}} a wolf. I niver seed a man pitch into {{anything}} like as that Natter-list did into that <b>horseflesh.</b>|$|E
60|$|Maisie {{looked at}} the lamps, the fog, and the hideous turmoil. Dick was right; but <b>horseflesh</b> did not make for Art as she {{understood}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My, but ain't he a looker! Ever see {{anything}} like him? Best piece of <b>horseflesh</b> I ever straddled, and I've seen {{a few in}} my time." ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{a strange}} look {{came into the}} faces of the riders! Did, they think he cared more for <b>horseflesh</b> than for his own flesh and blood? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's {{a bit of}} <b>horseflesh,</b> Hugh!' said John, when he had {{recovered}} enough self-command to appear at the door again. 'There's a comely creature! There's high mettle! There's bone!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “My housekeeper’s nephew, {{who is a}} shoeing-smith in {{the mounted}} section of the Church Lads’ Brigade, and an {{authority}} on <b>horseflesh,</b> expects him {{to be among the}} first three.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not sparin' <b>horseflesh,</b> Captain," [...] {{he muttered}} {{in a low}} voice. [...] "An' what {{in the name of}} Sam Hill are they hard-riding for if it ain't for us?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Horseflesh</b> for Horses. A {{singularly}} senseless and disagreeable word which, when used, as it commonly is, {{with reference}} to hippophilism, savors rather more of the spit than of the spirit.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they spoke}} exact truth. What will that hay turn into by Christmas? Can't you tell? Into milk, of course, {{which you will}} drink; and into <b>horseflesh</b> too, which you will use.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at Longbarns certainly, I should say," [...] replied John. [...] "Fancy mother {{having to}} curtsey {{to her as}} Mrs. Lopez! And I doubt whether Sir Alured would like him. He isn't of our sort. He's too clever, too cosmopolitan,--a sort of man white-washed of all prejudices, who wouldn't mind whether he ate <b>horseflesh</b> or beef if <b>horseflesh</b> were as good as beef, and never had an {{association}} in his life. I'm not sure that he's not on the safest side. Good night, old fellow. Pluck up, and send us plenty of grouse if you do go to Scotland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer! By George, I'll {{back her}} for the queerest bit of <b>horseflesh</b> going any way about these diggings. I thought she was mad at first, but I believe she knows what she's about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a fine bit of <b>horseflesh</b> you have," [...] {{observed}} Fred, as they sped {{along the}} level road leading to Valley Brook farm. [...] "I like {{the manner in}} which he steps out first-rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember what I {{told you}} about horses," [...] he reiterated to Saxon; and, {{assisted}} by his hostess, he gave a very creditable disquisition on <b>horseflesh</b> and its management from a business point of view.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{must get}} rid of nunnery breeding. We want no trim and dainty lassies here," [...] growled her father. [...] "Look you, Ridley, that horse of Hob's--" [...] and the rest was lost in a {{discussion}} on <b>horseflesh.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'A friend!' {{repeated}} the voice. 'Who {{calls himself a}} friend and rides like that, abusing Heaven's gifts {{in the shape of}} <b>horseflesh,</b> and endangering, not only his own neck (which might be no great matter) but the necks of other people?' ...|$|E
60|$|At last we {{left behind}} us all these wrecks of <b>horseflesh,</b> these {{poisonous}} streams, {{and came down}} upon Lake Bennett, where the water was considered safe to drink, and where {{the eye could see}} something besides death-spotted ledges of savage rocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{is strange}} how some folk can't abide {{anything}} in the meat way they han't bin used to. D'ye know I've actually knowd men from the cities as wouldn't eat a bit o' <b>horseflesh</b> for love or money. Would ye believe it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then they dismounted, and a hired man, who had {{lagged behind}} through {{indifferent}} <b>horseflesh</b> and {{no fault of}} his own, was despatched to prepare breakfast, {{and it was a}} merry party that assembled round the table. Even the ruler of Carrington's grim face relaxed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Among Lord Arthur Skelmerton's many {{expensive}} tastes {{there was}} certainly that for <b>horseflesh</b> and cards. After some successful betting {{at the beginning of}} his married life, he had started a racing-stable which it was generally believed--as he was very lucky--was a regular source of income to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} tried <b>horseflesh</b> myself, {{at least that}} I know of, but {{they say it is}} not so bad; but I cannot think that they will have to kill the horses for food. The country will not wait until we are reduced to that extremity." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{the lads}} were {{accustomed}} from childhood to horses, but those Chris had {{selected as the}} committee of inspection were admitted by their friends {{to be the best}} judges of <b>horseflesh</b> in the party, their fathers being wealthy men who always bought the finest horses money could obtain.|$|E
60|$|Marshall Boufflers only {{surrendered}} {{the citadel}} on the express order of Louis the 14th not {{to throw away}} any more lives of the brave men under him. At {{the time of the}} surrender the last flask of powder was exhausted, and the garrison had long been living on <b>horseflesh.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So he isn't. Must {{have missed}} the boat. Come along, please," [...] and Peleg Snuggers {{led the way to}} where a large and {{extra-heavy}} carryall stood. A splendid team of iron-grays was attached to the carriage; and Dick, who loved good <b>horseflesh,</b> could not help but admire the animals.|$|E
6000|$|... --I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That {{was a rare}} bit of <b>horseflesh.</b> Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue {{jacket and}} yellow cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Watch for {{an attack}} now maybe, Captain," [...] Aaron Cochrane said to father. [...] "That man the boys seen has rid in for a purpose. The whites are holding the Indians till they get orders from higher up. Maybe that man brung the orders {{one way or the}} other. They ain't sparing <b>horseflesh,</b> that's one thing sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pump and I {{have always}} been rather distant. Not having the {{slightest}} notions about <b>horseflesh,</b> he has a natural contempt for me; and in our mother's lifetime, when the good old lady was always paying his debts and petting him, I'm not sure {{there was not a}} little jealousy. It used to be Polly that kept the peace between us.|$|E
60|$|For {{the runaway}} team were {{struggling}} wildly, amid {{the rocks and}} {{the wreck of the}} harness. But Tom was already up, and he and Larry Colby dragged Dick to a place of safety. In the meantime some of the other cadets who were used to managing <b>horseflesh</b> took care of the team and led them away and tied them fast to a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "A noble animal, Jasper. Although I never studied <b>horseflesh</b> much, {{even in my}} {{university}} days, I can admire {{a spirited}} nag on occasion. But I have to content myself with humbler means of locomotion in my own calling. A poor parson cannot entertain his friends as a magnate like you can. Have you any one at the hall now, besides the girls?" ...|$|E
