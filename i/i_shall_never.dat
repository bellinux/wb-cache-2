5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E

25|$|Confederate Lieutenant Robert M. Smith was {{captured}} and imprisoned at Johnson's Island, Ohio. He {{is unique in}} {{that he was able}} to secretly construct a wet-plate camera using a pine box, pocket knife, tin can, and spyglass lens. Smith acquired chemicals from the prison hospital to use for the photographic process. He used the camera clandestinely to photograph other prisoners at the gable end of the attic of cell block four. No other prison had an on-site photographer providing images for the imprisoned to send home. His contribution is well presented in David R. Bush's I Fear <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Never</b> Leave This Island: Life in a Civil War Prison (2011).|$|E
25|$|In particular, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> {{forget the}} Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland {{and we knew}} {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{sentiment}} {{was expressed}} in a 1968 episode of the animated series Wacky Races titled [...] "The Wrong Lumber Race", where the villainous Dick Dastardly chops down a tree and uses it as a roadblock against the other racers, declaring proudly: [...] "I think that <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> see / A roadblock lovely as a tree." ...|$|E

500|$|Shelagh Jones, {{an athlete}} from England, {{wrote of the}} nature of {{competition}} [...] " [...] As the various sports on the program got under way, more and more we realised a full-blooded fight was on.

Yet within this tiny cross section of life <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> forget the honour and privilege of mounting the rostrum to collect a 'gold' for England." ...|$|E
500|$|Synge later {{developed}} {{an interest in}} Irish antiquities and the Aran Islands, and {{became a member of}} the Irish League for a year. He left the League because, as he told Maud Gonne, [...] "my theory of regeneration for Ireland differs from yours... I wish to work on my own for the cause of Ireland, and <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> be able to do so if I get mixed up with a revolutionary and semi-military movement." [...] In 1893 he published his first known work, a poem influenced by Wordsworth, Kottabos: A College Miscellany.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the varied}} {{reception}} to Kilmer's poem and its simple rhyme and meter, {{it has been}} the model for several parodies written by humorists and poets alike. [...] While keeping with Kilmer's iambic tetrameter rhythm and its couplet rhyme scheme, and references to the original poem's thematic material, such parodies are often immediately recognizable, as is seen in [...] "Song of the Open Road" [...] written by poet and humorist Ogden Nash: [...] "I think that <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> see / A billboard lovely as a tree. / Indeed, unless the billboards fall, / I'll never see a tree at all." ...|$|E

500|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1950s, {{the story was}} told, re-told and likely embellished in columns by Grantland Rice, Art Carlson, Frank Blair and Dave Lewismore than one of them writing that they had seen the game in person. [...] In Carlson's 1925 account, [...] "the giant center had been {{rendered}} practically useless from the Penn attack", but refused to leave the game. [...] Carlson recalled Schulz's removal from the game this way: [...] "It was a scene <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> forgetthe giant Schulz, towering above {{the rest of the}} combatants, literally dragged off the field, tears streaming down his mud-spattered cheeks as he frantically protested his removal from the game".|$|E
500|$|Although {{in later}} life he had a {{reputation}} for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner. Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions. He commented, [...] "I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me. But I am not, I have never been, and <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> be of the Wagnerian religion." ...|$|E
500|$|The depot {{was reached}} on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, {{was unable to}} pull or to eat {{anything}} but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: [...] "BY GOD <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit". A few days later, {{the rest of the}} party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. Fortunately a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.|$|E

500|$|Whatever {{the true}} story of the {{rebellion}} on the ice, neither Worsley nor McNish ever mentioned the incident in writing. Shackleton omitted it entirely from South, his account of the expedition, and referred to it only tangentially in his diary: [...] "Everyone working well except the carpenter. <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> forget him in this time of strain and stress". The event was recorded in the ship's log, but the log entry was struck during the sea voyage in the James Caird, Shackleton being impressed by the carpenter's show of [...] "grit and spirit". Nevertheless, McNish's name appeared on the list of the four men not recommended for the Polar Medal in the letter sent by Shackleton on his return. Macklin thought the denial of the medal unjustified: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Ibn Ishaq's {{biography}} of Muhammad, {{one woman who}} had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. 'Ã'isha, one of Mohammad's wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: 'By Allah,' she said,' that is me.' I said to her 'You poor soul, what is to happen to you?' She said:"I must be killed." [...] "Why?" [...] I asked her. [...] "For something I did," [...] she answered. She went away and was beheaded. By Allah,('Ã'isha adds) <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> forget her cheerfulness and her great laugh when {{she knew that she}} was to be killed.' ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed Huskisson {{continued}} to weaken. The doctors {{had concluded that}} without amputation {{he would continue to}} deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at last she calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>never</b> live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain." [...] After further laudanum, he complained [...] "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings." ...|$|E
