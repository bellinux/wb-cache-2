The results show clearly that interference {{is not only a}} problem of beginners, but also of advanced learners at university level. About 25 % {{of the total number of}} errors are caused by negative transfer (mainly from Polish, in some cases also from English as a third language).

40|$|There is {{significant}} room for improving users ’ experiences with model checking tools. An error trace {{produced by a}} model checker can be lengthy and is indicative of a symptom of an error. As a result, users can spend considerable time examining an error trace {{in order to understand}} the cause of the error. Moreover, even state-of-the-art model check-ers provide an experience akin to that provided by parsers before syntactic error recovery was invented: they report a single error trace per run. The user has to fix the error and run the model checker again to find more error traces. We present an algorithm that exploits the existence of correct traces in order to localize the <b>error</b> <b>cause</b> in an error trace, report a single error trace per <b>error</b> <b>cause,</b> and gen-erate multiple error traces having independent causes. We have implemented this algorithm in the context of Slam, a software model checker that automatically verifies temporal safety properties of C programs, and report on our experi-ence using it to find and localize errors in device drivers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of others' explanations for unexpected test results on auditors' judgments of the likelihood that the explanation is correct. Auditors may inherit explanations from various sources. Two primary sources of such explanations are the auditee (client) and a fellow auditor. Two basic types of explanations are error and non-error. Without gathering additional information, auditors cannot know whether a particular unexpected difference is caused by an error (misstatement) or non-error (no misstatement). A between-subjects design is employed to examine how different combinations of source and type of explanation influence auditors' likelihood assessments. This study utilizes an audit scenario wherein subjects inherit an explanation for an unexpected test result. The explanation is attributed to either a fellow auditor or to an auditee. The explanation specifies either an <b>error</b> <b>cause</b> or a non-error cause for the unexpected test result. The description of each source is identical with respect to competency. However, professional skepticism suggests that subjects will attribute varying reliability to the two sources. The two explanations, although different in type, are equally plausible (as determined by a separate of group of subjects who responded to a plausibility survey). Experimental results provide evidence that type of explanation has a significant effect on participants' judgment performance in the form of their assessments of the likelihood of the inherited explanation. Explanations specifying a non-error cause were judged as more likely than explanations specifying an <b>error</b> <b>cause.</b> However, contrary to predictions, the source of the explanation did not affect participants' likelihood assessments. Findings of this study suggest that auditors are more likely to begin with a non-error explanation for an unexpected difference than an error explanation and that the source of an inherited explanation does not have a strong effect on auditors' selection of an initial preferred hypothesis...|$|E

By introducing error resilience and error concealment techniques, many researchers have tried to eliminate quality degradation of reconstructed picture in decoding a corrupted data.

Hence, system designers need to use different methods to restrict the <b>error</b> <b>cause</b> by channel within a tolerable extent.

In this paper, we propose a way to protect the video header information in application layer without modifying standardized syntax. Beside, we also consider channel condition of wireless transmission and propose a way to reduce redundant bits used in channel coding. By doing this, the bitstream can be simply transmitted over practical wireless network and the reconstructed picture quality outperforms the original one. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{deployed}} transport layer protocols. It responds to all packet losses, either due to congestion or link breakages, by invoking various congestion control mechanisms. All these mechanisms imply a reduction in the amount of transmitted data. Computing a proper value of the retransmission timeout (RTO) is a challenge for TCP. In mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), mobility and bit <b>error</b> <b>cause</b> a lot of packet losses which degrades TCP throughput. In this paper we introduce an adaptation of TCP NewReno in order to improve its performance during the fast recovery phase. Our adapted algorithm, which we called TTAF, does not rely only on round trip time samples but also takes into consideration fast retransmit events in tuning the value of RTO. A set of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effect of TTAF over MANET with various mobility speed, traffic load, and bit error rates. Results have shown an improvement in TTAF throughput compared wit...|$|E

After analyzing the <b>error</b> <b>cause</b> of conversional used Kalman filter of SINS/DVL integrated navigation systems in maneuver state, a novel method was proposed which is to use the output of complex navigation systems to revise the SINS in real-time, and an improved adaptive Kalman filter was discussed here to reach the seamless changing of the whole system. The measurement remnant method was introduced to judge whether the bearing change event happened or not. The whole design was aiming to reach the smooth transition between the different motion states and improve the maneuver capability of the AUV navigation system. The simulation results confirms the new approach could restrain the oscillation of Kalman filter in motion changing state and improve the accuracy of the AUV integrated navigation systems.

The path of a vehicle is represented as a vector-valued curve in three-space. The construction of the confidence region about the curve takes advantage of an assumption that the deviation of the actual path from the predicted path will satisfy the conditions for a conditioned Brownian motion process. Using a cubic spline to estimate the predicted path, it is possible to obtain parameter values for the conditioned Brownian motion process, as well as error bounds for constructing the confidence region. An example is given to illustrate the forecasting technique, showing good results in predicting the path, constructing th [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Stern-judging {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} {{assessment}} rules in indirect reciprocity. Indirect reciprocity is a fundamental mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. It relies on mutual monitoring and assessment, i. e., individuals judge, following their own assessment rules, whether other individuals are "good" or "bad" according to information on their past behaviors. Among many assessment rules, stern-judging is known to provide stable cooperation in a population, as observed when all members in the population know all about other's behaviors (public information case) and when the members never commit an assessment error.
