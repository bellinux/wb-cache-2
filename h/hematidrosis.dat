500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held {{in the guest room}} of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from <b>hematidrosis,</b> a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E
2500|$|The story {{takes place}} at the [...] abbey of the [...] "happy and dauntless and sagacious" [...] Prince Prospero. Prospero and 1,000 other nobles have taken refuge in this walled abbey to escape the Red Death, a terrible plague with gruesome {{symptoms}} that has swept over the land. Victims are overcome by [...] "sharp pains", [...] "sudden dizziness", and <b>hematidrosis,</b> and die within half an hour. Prospero and his court are indifferent to the sufferings of the population at large; they intend to await the end of the plague in luxury and safety behind the walls of their secure refuge, having welded the doors shut.|$|E
5000|$|The New Testament {{indicates}} that Jesus underwent <b>hematidrosis</b> before the Crucifixion, during the Agony in the Garden (Luke 22:44). [...] These claims are plausible, {{given that the}} modern day dermatological research notes the presence of <b>hematidrosis</b> in people awaiting execution. It has also been proposed as a possible explanation for claims associated with stigmata.|$|E
50|$|A 2015 {{case study}} {{investigated}} <b>hematidrosis</b> {{with a patient}} who has epilepsy.|$|E
50|$|While {{the extent}} of blood loss {{generally}} is minimal, <b>hematidrosis</b> also results in the skin becoming extremely tender and fragile.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hematidrosis</b> is a {{condition}} in which capillary blood vessels that feed the sweat glands rupture, causing them to exude blood, occurring under conditions of extreme physical or emotional stress. Severe mental anxiety activates the sympathetic nervous system to invoke the stress-fight or flight reaction to such a degree as to cause hemorrhage of the vessels supplying the sweat glands into the ducts of the sweat glands. It has been suggested that acute fear and extreme stress can cause <b>hematidrosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hematidrosis,</b> {{also called}} blood sweat, {{is a very}} rare {{condition}} in which a human sweats blood. The term is from Greek haima/haimatos αἷμα, αἵματος meaning blood and hidrōs ἱδρώς meaning sweat.|$|E

50|$|After a {{conversation}} with Wilson, House consults his patients, and Jerry reveals that he is of Middle-Eastern descent, and changed his Muslim name after the first Iraq invasion to avoid confrontation from others. House figures out that he and Samantha have familial Mediterranean fever, a genetic condition which caused all their symptoms: anhedonia, vasculitis, lactose intolerance, <b>hematidrosis,</b> and kidney failure. (Medical commentators complain that this presentation does not match the real-life disease.) After the father and daughter are treated, they are shown smiling, playing and laughing together happily, {{in stark contrast to}} their earlier emotionlessness. Even as he awakes he notices beauty and color contrast to the grey of e.g. the empty room before.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number three}} occurs a {{significant}} number of times here. Jesus travels with three disciples, and leaves and prays three times. He has predicted all this will occur three times. Some have seen the occurrence of three a divine symbol, others a sign of Mark's narrative ability. The use of three is perhaps indicative of an oral source for Mark, as three is a common feature of orally transmitted stories, such as jokes (So Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha walk into a bar...). (Brown 145) Matthew has him leave and return three times but Luke seems to say he only went away once, and that he was visited by an angel and his sweat became [...] "...like drops of blood...", perhaps a symptom of <b>hematidrosis.</b>|$|E
