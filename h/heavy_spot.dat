50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22.5 mm. The head, thorax and abdomen are evenly dotted with brownish grey and white scales. There are single blackish dorsal dots in hind {{margins of the}} segments of the abdomen. The antennae have grey-brown and white scales, finely banded. The costal margin of the forewings is dark brownish grey, lighter outward with a <b>heavy</b> <b>spot</b> beyond {{the base of the}} cleft. The remainder of the wing is lighter brownish grey with white scales. There is a small dark dot in the cell and a larger one before the cleft. A few scattered dark scales are found near the inner margin. The fringes are darker than the wing and darkest in the cleft, cut by a few white hairs and tufts especially on the outer margin of the second lobe. The hindwings and fringes are light brownish grey.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to arrange the weight distribution of the wheels for better balancing. There are several methods of doing this, all being conceptually analogous to tire balancing with wheel weights. Most bench grinders never have these operations performed, because wheel dressing alone is enough to keep them sufficiently balanced, but these additional methods are not unusual for bench grinders and are quite common for machine tools that do grinding, such as surface grinders and cylindrical grinders. This is sometimes achieved by drilling a few holes in the steel flanges that hold the grinding wheels and then finding the angular orientation at which the holes' lack of weight balances out a <b>heavy</b> <b>spot</b> elsewhere on the rotating mass. Another method is a dedicated type of large flange with little weights that can be screwed down wherever needed for balancing (called a balancing flange).|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 105 Balancing {{rotating}} equipment {{is a form}} of correction for things that were either not uniform in material sciences or in assembly of components on a rotating shaft. The single plane balancing procedures are addressed, wherein one substitutes a corrective mass moment to compensate for these nonuniform distributions of imbalance. The approach to be used concentrates in several areas. The first area is the vibration sensors and related instrumentation. The next area is the response of a rotor as it runs up to operating speeds, with some introduction to the mode shapes involved. The third area is the plotting of data, specifically the polar plot, to give the balancer some insight on the ?<b>heavy</b> <b>spot?</b> vs ?high spot? relationship. Fourth, the balancing procedures creating a response vector (T) from a calibration or trial weight and shifting that vector to effectively cancel the ?original? vector, resulting in smooth 1 x synchronous motion are discussed. The fifth area is the calculation of the correcting influence coefficient in terms of a weight (or moment) vector unit per vibration unit with an ?additive? angle to affect a future ?one shot correction. ? Finally, some other single plane techniques are discussed balancing with the coupling?s original residual unbalance, balancing without phase information, introduction of static-couple vector logic, and the review of some of the industry balancing standards. The tutorial will, in fact, takes a ?balanced rotor,? unbalance it, plot its runup, determine a correction, vectorially, and plot the result. Multiple plane balancing will not be reviewed herein, primarily because of timing and the addition of three other vector triangle relationshi...|$|E

50|$|During the {{transition}} to menopause, menstrual patterns can show shorter cycling (by 2-7 days); longer cycles remain possible. There may be irregular bleeding (lighter, <b>heavier,</b> <b>spotting).</b> Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore (polyp or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The European Menopause and Andropause Society has released guidelines for assessment of the endometrium, which is usually {{the main source of}} spotting or bleeding.|$|R

5000|$|Ninety-nine {{percent of}} it (Migrant) was written on piano, so I think it felt right to keep that a focal point. But also, I think, it was a {{conscious}} decision to make it a slightly more stripped-down record, as far as the scope and the grandeur goes. The idea was to keep the tone in general a little bit smaller with not so many doubles and big rock guitar and <b>heavy</b> <b>spots</b> on the record...with the lyrics of this new record being transparently about myself, I think it was important to not dehumanize the performances by over-layering them or over-doubling them. As you double vocals, they lose their intimate inflection, and whatever transparent emotion that's trying to be conveyed in them is washed out, which can be a good thing. For this record, I think it was important not to do that.|$|R

50|$|The African golden cat has {{variable}} fur color, {{ranging from}} chestnut or reddish-brown, greyish brown to dark slaty. Some are spotted, with the spotting ranging from faded tan to heavy black in color. In others the spotting pattern {{is limited to}} the belly and inner legs. Its undersides and areas around the eyes, cheeks, chin, and throat are lighter in color to almost white. Its tail is darker on the top and either heavily banded, lightly banded, or plain, ending in a black tip. Cats in the western parts of its range tend to have <b>heavier</b> <b>spotting</b> than those in the eastern areas. Two color morphs, a red and a grey phase, were once thought to indicate separate species, rather than variations of the same species. Melanistic individuals occur, but are not common. Despite the wide variation in coat color, pelts of African golden cats can be identified by the presence of a distinctive whorled ridge of fur in front of the shoulders, where the hairs change direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} of Hellinsia venapunctus is 15 - 18 mm. The {{color of}} the head is whitish ochreous between the antennae and elsewhere it is light brown. The antennae and palpi are pale brownish ochreous, almost white. The thorax and legs are of the same shade of pale brownish ochreous, the fore and middle legs tinged with brown inside. The abdomen is similar both above and below, with a fine, brown, middorsal line. The forewings are concolorous with the thorax, but darker toward the costa, especially in the first lobe, though this shade is scarcely evident in some specimens. Just before and below {{the base of the}} cleft is a small blackish-brown spot. In the outer margin of the second lobe there are four short, dark dashes on the tips of the veins. A similar but <b>heavier</b> <b>spot</b> occurs on the inner margin of the first lobe a short distance before its apex. The fringes are concolorous, slightly darker toward the apex of the wing and with their bases slightly paler. The hindwings are somewhat paler than the forewings and with a more greyish tinge. The fringes are concolorous with slightly paler bases.|$|R

50|$|The {{adult male}} African olive pigeon {{is a large}} pigeon at 37 to 42 cm in length and a weight of 300 to 450 g. Its back and wings are maroon, with the {{shoulders}} heavily speckled with white spots. The underparts are maroon with <b>heavy</b> white <b>spotting,</b> and the head is grey with yellow patches around the eye, and a yellow bill. The neck plumage, used in display, is streaked maroon and white, the underwing and undertail are dark grey, and the feet are yellow.|$|R
50|$|Breeding is {{in spring}} and summer, with one to three pale blue green eggs, with <b>heavy</b> brown <b>spotting,</b> being laid. They nest either {{together}} in colonies, or singly in mixed colonies of other tern and gull species. The nest {{is on the ground}} among gravel and sand, or sometimes on vegetation; incubation lasts for 26-28 days. The chicks are variable in plumage pattern, from pale creamy to darker grey-brown; this variation assists adults in recognizing their own chicks when returning to the colony from feeding trips. Fledging occurs after 35-45 days.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 11-16 mm. The forewings are crossed {{by a wide}} median band, margined narrowly with white, which forks on {{the first}} two lobes.
