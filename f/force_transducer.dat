40|$|The {{continuous}} {{calibration method}} of <b>force</b> <b>transducer</b> represents a very helpful method since the calibration {{can be carried}} out in a short time compared with the step by step method. Another advantage of the continuous calibration method is the possibility of recording the responses of the standard <b>force</b> <b>transducer</b> and the <b>force</b> <b>transducer</b> to be calibrated synchronously. This could be done using two different channels of the displaying device. The disadvantage of this method is the difficulty to define exactly constant certain loads at each loading series during the calibration. The continuous method shows better measurement uncertainty than the step by step method, where as a lot of calibration points are considered in the analysis. One important factor for the results of the continuous calibration method is the response rate. Rates less then 0. 08 mV/Vs showed good agreement results of the two methods...|$|E
