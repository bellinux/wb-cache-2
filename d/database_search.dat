25|$|The {{homology}} modeling procedure can {{be broken}} down into four sequential steps: template selection, target-template alignment, model construction, and model assessment. The first two steps are often essentially performed together, as the most common methods of identifying templates rely on the production of sequence alignments; however, these alignments may not be of sufficient quality because <b>database</b> <b>search</b> techniques prioritize speed over alignment quality. These processes can be performed iteratively {{to improve the quality of}} the final model, although quality assessments that are not dependent on the true target structure are still under development process.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{factorization}} and discrete logarithms, quantum algorithms {{offering a}} more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics, the approximation of Jones polynomials, and solving Pell's equation. No mathematical proof {{has been found that}} shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely. For some problems, quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup. The most well-known example of this is quantum <b>database</b> <b>search,</b> which can be solved by Grover's algorithm using quadratically fewer queries to the database than are required by classical algorithms. In this case the advantage is provable. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.|$|E
25|$|Partial DNA matches are not {{searches}} themselves, but are {{the result}} of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one allele at every locus. Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional Y-STR analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States, and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. Darryl Hunt was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina. Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA <b>database</b> <b>search</b> produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{landmark}} {{discovery of the}} prototypic second messenger cAMP in 1957, three families of eukaryotic cAMP receptors have been identified to mediate the intracellular functions of cAMP. While protein kinase A (PKA) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cyclic nucleotide regulated ion channel (CNG and HCN) were initially unveiled in 1968 and 1985 respectively; EPAC genes were discovered in 1998 independently by two research groups. Kawasaki et al. identified cAMP-GEFI and cAMP-GEFII as novel genes enriched in brain using a differential display protocol and by screening clones with cAMP-binding motif. De Rooij and colleagues performed a <b>database</b> <b>search</b> for proteins with sequence homology to both GEFs for Ras and Rap1 and to cAMP-binding sites, {{which led to the}} identification and subsequent cloning of RAPGEF3 gene. The discovery of EPAC family cAMP sensors suggests that the complexity and possible readouts of cAMP signaling are much more elaborate than previously envisioned. This {{is due to the fact}} that the net physiological effects of cAMP entail the integration of EPAC- and PKA-dependent pathways, which may act independently, converge synergistically, or oppose each other in regulating a specific cellular function.|$|E

2500|$|On March 5, 2009, {{on behalf}} of Joe Wurzelbacher, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in Columbus {{charging}} that Jones-Kelley and fellow ODJFS employees Fred Williams and Doug Thompson improperly searched [...] "confidential state databases" [...] {{in an attempt to}} retaliate against Wurzelbacher's criticism of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.

2500|$|The {{critical}} {{first step}} in homology modeling is {{the identification of the}} best template structure, if indeed any are available. [...] The simplest method of template identification relies on serial pairwise sequence alignments aided by <b>database</b> <b>search</b> techniques such as FASTA and BLAST. More sensitive methods based on multiple sequence alignment – of which PSI-BLAST is the most common example – iteratively update their position-specific scoring matrix to successively identify more distantly related homologs. This family of methods has been shown to produce a larger number of potential templates and to identify better templates for sequences that have only distant relationships to any solved structure. Protein threading, also known as fold recognition or 3D-1D alignment, can also be used as a search technique for identifying templates to be used in traditional homology modeling methods. Recent CASP experiments indicate that some protein threading methods such as RaptorX indeed are more sensitive than purely sequence(profile)-based methods when only distantly-related templates are available for the proteins under prediction. When performing a BLAST search, a reliable first approach is to identify hits with a sufficiently low E-value, which are considered sufficiently close in evolution to make a reliable homology model. [...] Other factors may tip the balance in marginal cases; for example, the template may have a function {{similar to that of the}} query sequence, or it may belong to a homologous operon. [...] However, a template with a poor E-value should generally not be chosen, even if it is the only one available, since it may well have a wrong structure, leading to the production of a misguided model. [...] A better approach is to submit the primary sequence to fold-recognition servers [...] or, better still, consensus meta-servers which improve upon individual fold-recognition servers by identifying similarities (consensus) among independent predictions.|$|E

Besides the modular structure, the key features are the <b>database</b> <b>searches</b> based on SIMD instructions.

40|$|Peptide {{sequencing}} by tandem {{mass spectrometry}} {{is the cornerstone}} of proteomics technology. This computationally intensive task of assigning tandem mass spectra to their peptide identifications is predominantly accomplished by sequence <b>database</b> <b>searching,</b> which is slow and error-prone. A newer method, spectral library searching, has been recently proposed and was shown to be much faster and more sensitive than sequence <b>database</b> <b>searching</b> in limited studies. In this thesis, we performed a systematic comparison between sequence <b>database</b> <b>searching</b> and spectral library searching using a wide variety of data to better demonstrate, and understand, the superior sensitivity of spectral library searching. Our conclusions are as follows. Firstly, we showed, using several large datasets and a more robust statistical validation approach, that spectral library searching consistently outperforms sequence <b>database</b> <b>searching</b> by several different search engines employing different algorithms. Secondly, we demonstrated that the sensitivity advantage of spectral library searching is primarily due to the use of real library spectra, as opposed to simplistic theoretical spectra used in sequence <b>database</b> <b>searching,</b> for matching. Thirdly, we found that spectral library searching is more sensitive than sequence <b>database</b> <b>searching</b> only when the library spectra and the query spectra are acquired on the same type of instruments. Fourthly, we determined that the use of real peak intensities and the inclusion of non-canonical fragment ion peaks are both important factors in the sensitivity advantage of spectral searching, and that state-of-the-art spectrum prediction tools are still far from reproducing those favorable effects. Fifthly, we confirmed that spectral library searching is disproportionately more successful in identifying low-quality spectra. Our results answered important outstanding questions about this promising yet unproven method using well-controlled computational experiments and sound statistical approaches...|$|R
