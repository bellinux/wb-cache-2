40|$|The {{removal of}} trace gases from the {{troposphere}} is, in most cases, initialized by reactions with hydroxyl radicals, and {{the products of}} these reactions are eventually deposited on the Earth's surface. The concentration of these hydroxyl radicals is therefore a measure of atmospheric self-cleansing. In theory, <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> concentrations can be enhanced by the recycling {{of some of the}} reaction products. The only known efficient recycling process involves nitrogen oxide and leads to production of ozone, yet observations in regions with high hydrocarbon and low nitrogen oxide concentrations show substantially elevated <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> concentrations, up to ten times higher than expected. If we normalize observed <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> concentrations to the maximum achievable in model calculations with variable nitrogen oxide concentrations, this photochemical coordinate system uncovers a common feature in almost all of these observations: even in the presence of inadequate amounts of nitrogen oxides, <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> concentrations are enhanced to the theoretical maximum obtainable at very much higher nitrogen oxide concentrations. This means that this important part of the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere is working at maximum efficiency even in regions with a high burden of biogenic hydrocarbons and low nitrogen oxide concentration. Since these processes do not involve nitrogen oxides, tropospheric ozone production is greatly reduced compared with the expectation from current theor...|$|E

As Figure  1 and Table  2 shown, WBM leaf extracts exerted hydroxyl radical and NO scavenging activities. The most impressive radical-scavenging activity is against hydroxyl radical, which {{is considered to be}} the most reactive one among ROS. The IC 50 values for hydroxyl radial ranged from 22 to 42  μg/mL. The wild variety and HL- 2 were superior to HL- 1. Leaf extract of Thai bitter melon possesses <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavenging activity with an IC 50 value of 167 [*]±[*] 0.96  mg/mL (Kubola and Siriamornpun [2008]). Lu et al. ([2012]) demonstrated fruit extract of the most effective WBM cultivar in Taiwan exerted potent <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavenging activity (IC 50, 37  μg/mL). These results further supported that leaf and fruit of WBM possess strong <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavenging activity.|$|E

In order {{to characterize the}} nucleoids of M. tuberculosis, we have attempted to identify NAPs, and report an interesting finding that a chaperonin-homolog, GroEL 1, is nucleoid associated. We report that M. tuberculosis GroEL 1 binds DNA with low specificity but high affinity, suggesting {{that it might have}} naturally evolved to bind DNA. We are able to demonstrate that GroEL 1 can effectively function as a DNA-protecting agent against DNase I or <b>hydroxyl-radicals.</b> Moreover, Atomic Force Microscopic studies reveal that GroEL 1 can condense a large DNA into a compact structure. We also provide in vivo evidences that include presence of GroEL 1 in purified nucleoids, in vivo crosslinking followed by Southern hybridizations and immunofluorescence imaging in M. tuberculosis confirming that GroEL 1 : DNA interactions occur in natural biological settings. These findings therefore reveal that M. tuberculosis GroEL 1 has evolved to be associated with nucleoids...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{antioxidant}} and antimicrobial activity of ophiurasaponin extracted from Ophiopholis mirabilis (overall). Ophiurasaponin was extracted with solvent extraction and purified through AB- 8 macroporous resin, silica gel column chromatography, Sephadex LH- 20 gel column chromatography, and C 18 ODS column chromatography. The antioxidant activity of ophiurasaponin was detected by the chemiluminescence assay. The paper filtering method and the modified agar dilution method were used to determine antimicrobial activity. The results showed that the content of crude ophiurasaponin and the refined ophiurasaponin was 46. 75 % and 96. 72 %, respectively. The values of the IC 50 of <b>hydroxyl-radicals,</b> superoxide anions, and peroxide were 25. 54 [*]mg/mL, 9. 98 [*]mg/mL, and 1. 37 [*]mg/mL, respectively. The refined ophiurasaponin had a good inhibitory effect on Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Proteusbacillus vulgaris, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0. 0443 [*]mg/mL. In conclusion, ophiurasaponin from Ophiopholis mirabilis had obvious antioxidant activities and antimicrobial activities which could provide the theoretical basis for further research and development of antioxidant and antimicrobial marine drugs...|$|R

Methods Human IgG was modified by <b>hydroxyl-radicals.</b> Immunogenicity of native and modified human IgG was probed by inducing polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Cross-reactions of induced antibodies with nucleic acid, chromatin, different blood proteins and their ROS modified conformers were determined by competitive inhibition ELISA. The binding characteristics of circulating autoantibodies in SLE patients (n = 72) against native and modified IgG were screened by direct binding and competition ELISA {{and the results were}} compared with healthy age-matched controls (n = 39). Results Induced antibodies against ROS-modified human IgG exhibited diverse antigen binding characteristics. Native DNA, native chromatin and their ROS-modified conformers were found to be effective inhibitors of induced antibody-immunogen interaction. Induced antibodies against native human IgG showed negligible binding to the above mentioned nucleic acid antigens. SLE sera (48. 6 %) showed strong binding to ROS-human IgG in comparison with its native analogue (P 0. 05). Conclusion ROS-induced modifications in human IgG present neo-epitopes, and make it a potential immunogen. The induced antibodies against ROS-modified human IgG resembled the diverse antigen-binding characteristics of naturally occurring SLE anti-DNA autoantibodies.

Here, {{a group of}} novel chitosan quaternary ammonium derivatives containing pyridine or amino-pyridine were designed and successfully synthesized through chemical {{modification of}} chitosan.

The chitosan derivatives&# 39; antioxidant activity against <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> and 1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) -radical was tested in vitro. The results showed that chitosan derivatives had better water solubility and stronger antioxidant activity compared with chitosan in all assays. Especially, compounds 3 C and 3 E (with 3 -amino pyridine and 2, 3 -diamino pyridine as substitute respectively) exhibited stronger <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> and DPPH-radical scavenging ability than other synthesized compounds.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} between the mechanism of microsomal ethanol oxidation and <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> formation, the rate of cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450) -dependent oxidation of dimethyl sulphoxide (Me 2 SO) was determined in the presence {{and in the absence of}} iron-chelating compounds, in liver microsomes from control, ethanol- and phenobarbital-treated rats. Ethanol treatment resulted in a specific increase (3 -fold) of the microsomal ethanol oxidation and NADPH consumption per nmol of P- 450. A form of P- 450 was purified to apparent homogeneity from the ethanol-treated rats and characterized with respect of amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Specific ethanol induction of a cytochrome P- 450 species having a catalytic-centre activity of 20 /min for ethanol and consuming 30 nmol of NADPH/min could account for the results observed with microsomes. Phenobarbital treatment caused 50 % decrease in the rate of ethanol oxidation and NADPH oxidation per nmol of P- 450. The rate of oxidation of the <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavenger Me 2 SO was increased 3 -fold by ethanol or phenobarbital treatment when expressed on a per-mg-of-microsomal-protein basis, but the rate of Me 2 SO oxidation expressed on a per-nmol-of-P- 450 basis was unchanged. Addition of iron-chelating agents to the three different types of microsomal preparations caused an 'uncoupling' of the electron-transport chain accompanied by a 4 -fold increase of the rate of Me 2 SO oxidation. It is concluded that ethanol treatment results in the induction of P- 450 forms specifically effective in ethanol oxidation and NADPH oxidation, but not in <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> production, as detected by the oxidation of Me 2 SO...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{concentrations}} of ca. 250 C 6 –C 15 hydrocarb on and C 4 –C 12 oxygenated {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) including alkanes, benzene and alkyl benzenes, monoterpenes and aldehydes were measured in August 1994 during the POPCORN campaign (POPCORN = Photo-Oxidant formation by Plant emitted Compounds and OH Radicals in North-Eastern Germany). About 80 substances together contributed 90 % of the atmospheric carbon in this range of molecular weight. During this field campaign VOC-emissions from several crop and tree species and the ambient {{concentrations of}} CO, C 2 –C 7 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), C 1 and C 2 aldehydes, nitrogen oxides, ozone and <b>hydroxyl-radicals</b> (OH) were also measured. These data were used to interpret the VOC measurements presented here. The on-line GC–MS used for the VOC measurements combines adsorptive sampling with thermal desorption and GC–MS analysis in an automated system. Internal standards were used to quantify the measurements. Ozone was destroyed prior to the sample preconcentration through the gas phase reaction with NO. Aromatic compounds like benzene, toluene and xylenes were the most abundant compound class among the measured substances, -pinene and 3 -carene, most probably originating from pineforests ca. 1 km away from the measuring site, were the most abundant monoterpenes. The highest mixing ratios of most compounds were measured in nights with strong inversion situations. The toluene mixing ratios then reached 630 pptv; -pinene mixing ratios went up to 430 pptv. The median of all toluene and -pinene measurements during the campaign was 125 pptv or 22 pptv, respectively. These values are on {{the lower end of}} ambient measurements reported for continental sites. In most samples also n-pentanal, n-hexananl, n-nonanal and n-undecanal were present. Median mixing ratios were 9, 16, 14 and 8 pptv, respectively. Emission studies indicate that these highly reactive compounds are most probably emitted from maize. It is shown by a simple first order approach that the potential for ozone formation during the POPCORN campaign was roughly equal for anthropogenic and biogenic VOC. From measured concentrations of ozone, OH-radicals, methane, CO, C 2 –C 15 nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and C 5 –C 11 aldehydes a photochemical production of ozone in the order of 3. 5 ppb/h can be estimated. Apart from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are at least partly products of VOC oxidation, the substance group with the largest contribution to the VOC turnover are the monoterpenes. They contribute ca. 30 %. However, the mechanism of terpene oxidation is very complex and presently only partly understood. Thus the actual contribution of monoterpenes to ozone formation is very uncertain. Other measured compound classes such as light alkenes, alkanes, aromatics, and C 5 –C 11 aldehydes contribute each between 10 % and 15 % to ozone formation. The measuring site was not influenced directly from strong biogenic or anthropogenic sources, and the results obtained during the POPCORN campaign can be regarded as a typical picture of a remote rural central European environment...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are innovative, cost-effective, catalyzed {{chemical}} oxidation {{processes for}} treating pollutants in low or high concentration from contaminated soil, sludge and water. The common used AOPs {{in drinking water}} treatment include UV/H 2 O 2 process, UV/Ozone Process, UV/Titanium Dioxide and Fenton’s Reagent. AOPs are ultraviolet driven, which share predominance from photochemical technology, and often, give the clients dual benefit of both environmental contaminant treatment and disinfection. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are very disturbing contaminants measured in natural waters. Phenols and their tert-butyl derivatives are important contaminants belonging to EDCs. After a successful workshop for developing alternative drinking water treatments at Shanghai, AOPs with UV/H 2 O 2 technology are chosen to remove 4 -tert-butylphenol (4 TBP) from Shanghai water. The kinetics of reaction was studied {{in the first part}} of this thesis. The results show that UV/H 2 O 2 process can effectively decrease 4 TBP concentration than hydrogen peroxide alone. Good free oxidation radical production can be achieved within UV dose range from 0 to 200 mJ/cm 2 by a low pressure mercury lamp. The 4 TBP degradation process fits with pseudo first order equation for UV-dose and H 2 O 2 -dose. However, at very high H 2 O 2 -doses, the scavenging of <b>hydroxyl-radicals</b> needs to be taken into account. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of UV reactor and validation of CFD model were studied in the second part of this thesis work in order to provide an applicable UV reactor design for the 4 TBP treatment and also give possible reactor improvement suggestions. The CFD model used in this study is a 2 -D model developed using software Comsol, V 3. 3 a, based on a current UV reactor design at Kiwa Water Research, the Netherlands. The developed UV dose model includes three parts, a k-? flow model, a UV intensity model and a random walk model. Different feed flow rates and different lamp configurations were studied by the model. The calculation results show that a higher feed flow rate contributes to a relative narrow UV dose distribution than the lower flow rate. With three lamp configurations, position 0 is the best among the three with the highest average UV dose as well as the narrowest dose distribution pattern. Model also predicted low pressure lamps have about 8 % higher power output to UV dose efficiency than medium pressure lamps. Validation of the flow model was helped by flow measurements at Delft University of Technology. Experimental studies of velocity measurements by Laser Doppler Velocity Meter were conducted together with salt and dye dose experiments. After comparisons of model predictions and experimental measurements, it was found that the k-? CFD flow model demonstrated generally good qualitative prediction of flow inside the reactor but failed to give correct prediction of recirculation zones behind the quartz tubes. There are dead zones of water at the top and bottom near the inlet of the reactor. Bigger areas exist behind the quartz tubes that have water recirculation than the model predicted, which may result 25 % of more UV dose prediction by the model. And differences caused by 2 -D model and 3 -D measurements may result about 20 % less UV dose model prediction. Current UV reactor design at Kiwa Water Research, position 0 and low pressure mercury lamps applied at a feed flow rate of 4. 1 m 3 /h appears to be an applicable design for advanced oxidation treatment of 4 TBP by UV/H 2 O 2 in Shanghai. High roughness quartz tubes walls and relative smaller ratio of reactor to feed pipe diameters are recommended to improve reactor performance in the recirculation and dead zones with current design. Further investigations of the dose model and UV-sensitive dyed microspheres particle tracking experiments are recommended. Sanitary EngineeringWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Indeed, this ribozyme constitutes the catalytic domain of an accurate and general RNA polymerase ribozyme.

40|$|Rat liver microsomes (microsomal fractions) {{catalyse}} the oxidation of straight-chain {{aliphatic alcohols}} and of hydroxyl-radical-scavenging agents during NADPH-dependent electron transfer. The iron-chelating agent desferrioxamine, which blocks {{the generation of}} hydroxyl radicals in other systems, was found to inhibit the following microsomal reactions: production of formaldehyde from either dimethyl sulphoxide or 2 -methylpropan- 2 -ol (t-butylalcohol); generation of ethylene from 4 -oxothiomethylbutyric acid; release of 14 CO 2 from [I- 14 C]benzoate; production of acetaldehyde from ethanol or butanal (butyraldehyde) from butan- 1 -ol. Desferrioxamine also blocked {{the increase in the}} oxidation of all these substrates produced by the addition of iron-EDTA to the microsomes. Desferrioxamine had no effect on a typical mixed-function-oxidase activity, the N-demethylation of aminopyrine, nor on the peroxidatic activity of catalase/H 2 O 2 with ethanol. H 2 O 2 appears to be the precursor of the oxidizing radical responsible for the oxidation of the alcohols and the other <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavengers. Chelation of microsomal iron by desferrioxamine most likely decreases the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which results in an inhibition of the oxidation of the alcohols and the <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavengers. Whereas desferrioxamine inhibited the oxidation of 2 -methylpropan- 2 -ol, dimethyl sulphoxide, 4 -oxothiomethylbutyrate and benzoate by more than 90 %, the oxidation of ethanol and butanol could not be decreased by more than 45 - 60 %. Higher concentrations of desferrioxamine were required to block the metabolism of the primary alcohols than to inhibit the metabolism of the other substrates. The desferrioxamine-insensitive rate of oxidation of ethanol was not inhibited by competitive <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavengers. These results suggest that primary alcohols may be oxidized by two pathways in microsomes, one dependent on the interaction of the alcohols with hydroxyl radicals (desferrioxamine-sensitive), the other which appears to be independent of these radicals (desferrioxamine-insensitive) ...|$|E

Whereas changes in snRNA conformation are well documented {{at the level of}} secondary RNA–RNA interactions, {{little is known about the}} tertiary structure of this RNA–RNA network, which comprises the spliceosome's catalytic core. Here, we have used the <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> probe Fe-BABE, tethered to the tenth nucleotide (U+ 10) of the 5 ′ end of a pre-mRNA intron, to map RNA–RNA proximities in spliceosomes. These studies revealed that several conserved snRNA regions are close to U+ 10 in activated spliceosomes, namely (i) the U 6 snRNA ACAGAG-box region, (ii) portions of the U 6 intramolecular stem-loop (U 6 -ISL) including a nucleotide implicated in the first catalytic step (U 74), and (iii) the region of U 2 that interacts with the branch point. These data constrain the relative orientation of these structural elements with respect to U+ 10 in the activated spliceosome. Upon conversion of the activated spliceosome to complex C, the accessibility of U 6 -ISL to <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> cleavage is altered, suggesting rearrangements after the first catalytic step...|$|E

Their antioxidant properties against <b>hydroxyl-radical,</b> DPPH-radical, and superoxide-radical were evaluated in vitro, respectively. The antioxidant activity of the obtained novel amphiprotic starch derivatives via 'click reaction' exhibited remarkable improvement over starch.

Moreover, the scavenging effect of the products against superoxide-radical attained 90 % above at 0. 1 mg/mL. Generally, the antioxidant activity decreased in the order: HBTST > HPTST > HETST >HMTST > starch. Furthermore, the order of their antioxidant activity was consistent with the electron-donating ability of different substituted groups of the 1, 2, 3 -triazoles. The substituted groups with stronger electron supplying capacity provided more electrons to the various radicals, which relatively enhanced the capacity for scavenging free radicals.

The results showed that 200 μg/ml of alpha-bromocinnamaldehyde (Br-CA) was capable of killing all E. coli cells during the exponential phase. Considering the heterogeneous nature of persisters, multiple types of persisters were induced and exposed to Br-CA. Our results indicated that no cells in the ppGpp-overproducing strain or TisB-overexpressing strain survived the treatment of Br-CA although considerable amounts of persisters to ampicillin (Amp) and ciprofloxacin (Cip) were induced. Chemical induction by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) {{led to the formation}} of more than 10 % persister to Amp and Cip in the entire population, and Br-CA still completely eradicated them. In addition, the cells in the stationary phase, which are usually highly recalcitrant to antibiotics treatment, were also completely eradicated by 400 μg/ml of Br-CA. Further studies showed that neither thiourea (<b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavenger) nor DPTA (Fe 3 + chelator to block the <b>hydroxyl-radical)</b> affected the bactericidal efficiency of the Br-CA to kill E. coli, indicating a ROS-independent bactericidal mechanism.

The <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> formation enhanced by SOD was inhibited by catalase and desferrioxamine, and stimulated by EDTA and diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid, suggesting that both hydrogen peroxide and iron ions participate in the reaction. The <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> formation enhanced by SOD may be considered to proceed via the following steps. First, 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid is spontaneously auto-oxidized {{in a process that}} requires molecular oxygen and yields superoxide anions and anthranilyl radicals. This reaction seems to be reversible. Secondly, the superoxide anions formed in the first step are dismuted by SOD to generate hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen, and hence the equilibrium in the first step is displaced in favour of the formation of superoxide anions. Thirdly, hydroxyl radicals are generated from hydrogen peroxide through the Fenton reaction. In this Fenton reaction Fe 2 + ions are available since Fe 3 + ions are readily reduced by 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid. The superoxide anions do not seem to participate in the reduction of Fe 3 + ions, since superoxide anions are rapidly dismuted by SOD present in the reaction mixture...|$|E

The decreased rates of <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> generation at lower O 2 concentrations correlates with lower rates of {{production of}} H 2 O 2, the precursor of hydroxyl radical, whereas the decreased rates at elevated O 2 concentrations correlate with lower rates (relative to 20 % O 2) of activity of NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase, which reduces iron and is responsible for redox cycling of iron by the microsomes. The oxidation of aniline or aminopyrine and the cytochrome P- 450 /oxygen-radical-independent oxidation of ethanol also displayed a biphasic response to the concentration of O 2, reaching a maximum at 20 % O 2, which correlates with the dithionite-reducible CO-binding spectra of cytochrome P- 450. Microsomal lipid peroxidation increased as the concentration of O 2 was raised from 3 to 7 to 20 % O 2, {{and then began to}} level off. This different pattern of malondialdehyde generation compared with <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> production probably reflects the lack of a role for hydroxyl radical in microsomal lipid peroxidation.

The proposed electrochemical method can be used for the estimation of DNA oxidative damage from a new point of view...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A key to {{understanding}} RNA function is to uncover its complex three-dimensional structure. Experimental methods used for determining RNA three-dimensional structures are technological-ly challenging and laborious, which makes the development of com-putational prediction methods of substantial interest. Previously we developed the iFoldRNA server that allows accurate prediction of short (< 50 nucleotides) tertiary RNA structures starting from primary sequences. Here we present {{a new version of}} the iFoldRNA server that permits the prediction of tertiary structure of RNAs as long as a few hundred nucleotides. This substantial increase in the server capacity is achieved by utilization of experimental information such as base-pairing and <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> probing. We demonstrate a significant benefit provided by integration of experimental data and computational methods...|$|E
40|$|The Neurospora crassa {{mitochondrial}} tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (CYT- 18 protein) {{functions in}} splicing group I introns by promoting {{the formation of}} the catalytically active RNA structure. Previous work suggested that CYT- 18 recognizes a conserved tRNA-like structure of the group I intron catalytic core. Here, directed <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> cleavage assays show that the nucleotide-binding fold and C-terminal domains of CYT- 18 interact with the expected group I intron cognates of the aminoacyl-acceptor stem and D-anticodon arms, respectively. Further, three-dimensional graphic modeling, supported by biochemical data, shows that conserved regions of group I introns can be superimposed over interacting regions of the tRNA in a Thermus thermophilus TyrRS/tRNATyr cocrystal structure. Our results support the hypothesis that CYT- 18 and other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases interact with group I introns by recognizing conserved tRNA-like structural features of the intron RNAs...|$|E
40|$|A {{rectangular}} combustor with acoustic forcing {{was used}} to study flame-acoustic interaction under injection conditions which are representative of industrial rocket engines. Hot-fire tests using liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen were conducted at pressures of 40 and 60 bar, which are sub-and supercritical conditions respectively for oxygen. To our knowledge, acoustic forcing has never before been conducted at pressures this high in an oxygen-hydrogen system. Examined samples of <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> emission imaging, collected using a high-speed camera during periods of forced acoustic resonance, show significant response in the multi-injection element flame. Transverse acoustic velocity causes shortening of the flame, concentrating heat release near the injection plane. Fluctuating acoustic pressure causes in-phase fluctuation of the emission intensity. Based on these observations, a theorized flame-acoustic coupling mechanism is offered as an explanation for how naturally occurring high frequency combustion instabilities are sustained in real rocket engines...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of the hydroxyl radical, generated by a Fenton system, with pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides was investigated by using the e. s. r. technique of spin trapping. The spin trap t-nitrosobutane was employed to trap secondary radicals formed by the {{reaction of}} the hydroxyl radical with these nucleotides. The results presented here show that <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> attack on thymidine, 2 -deoxycytidine 5 -monophosphate and 2 -deoxyuridine 5 -monophosphate produced nucleotide-derived free radicals. The results indicate that. OH radical attack occurs predominantly at the carbon-carbon double bond of the pyrimidine base. The e. s. r. studies showed a good correlation with previous results obtained by authors who used x- or gamma-ray irradiation to generate the hydroxyl radical. A thiobarbituric acid assay was also used to monitor the damage produced to the nucleotides by the Fenton system. These results showed qualitative agreement with the spin-trapping studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a transcriptionally active complex by RNA polymerase involves a series of short-lived structural intermediates where protein conformational changes are coupled to DNA wrapping and melting. We have used time-resolved KMnO 4 and <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> X-ray footprinting to directly probe conformational signatures of these complexes at the T 7 A 1 promoter. Here we demonstrate that DNA melting from m 12 to m 4 precedes the rate-limiting step in the pathway and takes place prior to the {{formation of}} full downstream contacts. In addition, on the wild-type promoter, we can detect the accumulation of a stable off-pathway intermediate that results from the absence of sequence-specific contacts with the melted non-consensus – 10 region. Finally, the comparison of the results obtained at 37 °C with those at 20 °C reveals significant differences {{in the structure of the}} intermediates resulting in a different pathway for the {{formation of a}} transcriptionally active complex...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse grown tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Petit Havana) {{plants were}} exposed to {{supplemental}} UV centred at 318 nm and corresponding to 13. 6 kJ m- 2 d- 1 biologically effective UV-B (280 - 315 nm) radiation. After 6 days this treatment decreased photosynthesis by 30 %. Leaves responded by a large increase in UV-absorbing pigment content and antioxidant capacities. UV-stimulated defence against ROS was strongest in chloroplasts, since activities of plastid enzymes FeSOD and APX had larger relative increases than other, non-plastid specific SODs or peroxidases. In addition, non-enzymatic defence against hydroxyl radicals was doubled in UV treated leaves as compared to controls. In UV treated leaves, the extent of activation of ROS neutralizing capacities followed a peroxidases > <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> neutralization > SOD order. These results suggest that highly effective hydrogen peroxide neutralization {{is the focal point}} of surviving UV-inducible oxidative stress and argue against a direct signalling role of hydrogen peroxide in maintaining adaptation to UV, at least in laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|We have {{estimated}} the activation energy for aromatic oxidation by compound I in cytochrome P 450 for a diverse set of 17 substrates using state-of-the-art density functional theory (B 3 LYP) with large basis sets. The activation energies vary from 60 to 87 kJ/mol. We then test if these {{results can be}} reproduced by computationally less demanding methods. The best methods (a B 3 LYP calculation of the activation energy of a methoxy-radical model or a partial least-squares model of the semiempirical AMI bond dissociation energies and spin densities of the tetrahedral intermediate for both a hydroxyl-cation and a <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> model) give correlations with r(2) of 0. 8 and mean absolute deviations of 3 kJ/mol. Finally, we apply these simpler methods on several sets of reactions for which experimental data are available and show that we can predict the reactive sites by combining calculations of the activation energies with the solvent-accessible surface area of each site...|$|E
40|$|Nine low-Mr thiols were {{compared}} {{with regard to their}} ability to function as myeloperoxidase-oxidase substrates under conditions where no auto-oxidation of the thiols could be observed. The methyl and ethyl esters of cysteine were found to be about twice as active as cysteamine at pH 7. 0, in terms of increased O 2 consumption. Cysteine itself was poorly active, whereas glutathione, N-acetylcysteine and penicillamine were completely inactive as myeloperoxidase-oxidase substrates under these conditions. The structure-activity relationships indicated that both a free thiol and free amino group were required for peroxidase-oxidase activity, and also that a free carboxy group abolished activity. In analogy with cysteamine, the activities of both cysteine esters were inhibited by superoxide dismutase (less than 5 micrograms/ml) and by catalase and not by the <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> scavenger mannitol. In contrast with cysteamine, the activities of both cysteine esters were stimulated more than 2 -fold by high concentrations (greater than 5 micrograms/ml) of superoxide dismutase. The activities of both cysteine esters exhibited broad pH optima at pH 7. A mechanism for the myeloperoxidase-oxidase oxidation of the cysteine esters is proposed, which is partly different from that previously proposed for cysteamine...|$|E
40|$|CatR, a LysR family protein, {{positively}} {{regulates the}} Pseudomonas putida catBC operon, which {{is required for}} growth on benzoate as a sole carbon source. Transcriptional {{studies show that the}} catR and catBC promoters are divergent and overlapping by 2 bp. A beta-galactosidase promoter probe vector was constructed to analyze expression from the catR and catBC promoters under induced and uninduced conditions. As predicted, the catBC promoter is expressed only under induced conditions, while the catR promoter is constitutive. CatR has been shown to specifically bind the catRBC promoter region, and this property was used to devise a purification protocol for CatR. Linear M 13 DNA containing the catRBC control region was covalently bound to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose in order to construct a DNA affinity column. Crude extracts containing hyperproduced CatR protein were then incubated with the affinity resin under binding conditions, and the CatR protein was eluted with 1 M NaCl. CatR was also purified by heparin-agarose chromatography. This highly purified protein was used for gel retardation and <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> footprinting studies. From this analysis, it was shown that CatR binds upstream of the catBC promoter within the transcribed region of catR...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we have {{examined}} the performance of PbO 2  anodes in the EC degradation of MTBE. It was shown that electrochemical oxidation of MTBE at lead dioxide anodes is effective method of anodic conversion of the organic pollutant to acetic acid as untoxic product. Proposed method is formally reagent treatment of water {{at the same time}} it does not need   addition of any reagent in reaction media. All needed reagents formed directly from the solvent (water) thanks to electrochemical reactions. According to obtained data the main electrochemical stages of the process of anodic conversion of MTBE are formation of hydroxyl-radicals and molecular oxygen. Then formed compounds take part in stages of chemical MTBE oxidation and intermediate species that led to deeper oxidation to form acetic acid as the result. Proposed mechanism of MTBE electrochemical oxidation is in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. Dependence of MTBE conversion rate from the nature of micro-doped and composite lead dioxide anodes is explained by difference in <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> bond strength with an electrode surface that determined it reaction ability in secondary chemical reactions of organic compounds oxidation...|$|E
40|$|During {{transcription}} initiation at bacterial promoters, the C-terminal {{domain of}} the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (alphaCTD) can interact with DNA-sequence elements (known as UP elements) and with activator proteins. We have constructed a series of semi-synthetic promoters carrying both an UP element and a consensus DNA-binding site for the Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP; a factor that activates transcription by making direct contacts with alphaCTD). At these promoters, the UP element was located {{at a variety of}} distances upstream of the CRP-binding site, which was fixed at position - 41. 5 bp upstream of the transcript start. At some positions, the UP element caused enhanced promoter activity whereas, at other positions, it had very little effect. In no case was the CRP-dependence of the promoter relieved. DNase I and <b>hydroxyl-radical</b> footprinting were used to study ternary RNA polymerase-CRP-promoter complexes formed at two of the most active of these promoters, and co-operativity between the binding of CRP and purified alpha subunits was studied. The footprints show that alphaCTD binds to the UP element as it is displaced upstream but that this displacement does not prevent alphaCTD from being contacted by CRP. Models to account for this are discussed...|$|E
