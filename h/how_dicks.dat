6000|$|... "Nobody knows <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> was hurt, Miss Cornelia. It may {{not have}} been in a drunken brawl at all. He may have been waylaid and robbed." ...|$|R
60|$|She said it so sweetly, {{with her}} pretty Scotch accent, that I couldn't imagine <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> had {{the heart to}} refuse her. But he did, all the same.|$|R
60|$|He laughs boisterously. We may be {{sure that}} he flings back his head. You {{remember}} <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> used to fling back his head when he laughed?--No, you didn't know him.|$|R
60|$|As Peterson {{was curious}} to know <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> was faring, he agreed to {{accompany}} Sam and Tom to the hotel, and all three boarded a handy street car for that purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Free once more," [...] he thought. [...] "And I shan't go {{back until}} I am certain Captain Putnam is {{on hand to}} receive me. I wonder <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> and Sam are faring?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We can't {{expect to}} go to weddings all the time," [...] {{returned}} Sam Rover, a grin showing on his own face. [...] "Wonder <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> and Dora are making out," [...] he mused.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{previous}} episode, Mary sees <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> defeats Liam, and becomes distrusting of Dick. After being convinced by Nina and Judith, Mary breaks off {{her relationship with}} Dick. In response, Dick reveals his true identity to her.|$|R
50|$|As part of Dick Van Patton's post-Eight is Enough popularity, it {{was written}} by Van Patton's son Jimmy to depict in a comedic fashion <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> is able to defeat a skilled {{opponent}} in a tennis game by using poor sportsmanship cheats.|$|R
50|$|The story flashes back to <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> and Nicole met. A {{distinguished}} psychiatrist, he {{made the}} classic mistake of {{falling in love with}} a patient, Nicole Warren, and marries her over the warnings from his mentor, Dr. Dohmler, that it will ruin Dick's career.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time I told it with all the details that {{concerned}} myself,-- how I had been waylaid by the Models, <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Blair had released me, what Stumpy had done at the tool house, and all, not forgetting about the statement Kate and I wished so much to find.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had a close}} shave," [...] {{returned}} Tom, {{and then}} he and Sam told of how they had struck, and of <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> had been dragged out of the way. By this time the oldest Rover boy was feeling more like himself and he managed to stand up, even though somewhat dizzy.|$|R
60|$|Then Bostil {{told her}} <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Sears had menaced him--how Slone had foiled the horse-thief. He {{told the story}} bluntly, but eloquently, with all a rider's praise. Lucy rose with hands pressed against her breast. When had Bostil seen eyes like those--dark, shining, wonderful? Ah! he remembered her mother's once--only once, as a girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, old lad, it {{does look}} very natural to see you. I often used to think of you walking the deck o' nights. Uncle and the girls are all right, then? But is the old pony dead yet? And <b>how's</b> <b>Dick</b> the smith, and Nancy? Grown a fine maid by now, I warrant. 'Slid, it seems half a life that I've been away.|$|R
60|$|Here I {{must bring}} to a close, for the present, {{the story of the}} Rover Boys' doings at Putnam Hall and elsewhere.

60|$|Pan knew him. The {{recognition}} meant nothing, yet it gave Pan a start, a twinge, {{and then}} sent a slow heat along his veins. He laughed to find the boyishness of old still alive in him. After eight years of hard life on the ranges! By that sudden resurging of long forgotten emotion Pan judged the nature of what the years had made him. It {{would be interesting to}} see <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Hardman met him.|$|R
60|$|But then Mrs. Follingsbee's {{situation}} was confidentially stated to Lillie, and by Lillie confidentially stated to Rose, and by Rose to Mrs. Van Astrachan; {{and it was}} made to appear <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Follingsbee had entirely abandoned his wife, going off {{in the ways of}} Balaam the son of Bosor, and all other bad ways mentioned in Scripture, habitually leaving poor Mrs. Follingsbee to entertain company alone, so that he was never seen at her parties, and {{had nothing to do with}} her.|$|R
60|$|Bradner {{was about}} to bend over his victim to {{ascertain}} <b>how</b> badly <b>Dick</b> was hurt when the footsteps of two men approaching made him draw back.|$|R

40|$|During WW II the Japanese {{airforce}} flew {{air raids}} not only over the mainland of the Northern Territory of Australia, but also over the sparsely populated islands off the coast. The informants describe {{the changes in}} their everyday life on Croker Island during the war time, and name several hunting and camping places where their parents {{and other family members}} used to stay and take refuge. They also retell the locally famous story of <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Malwagu and Lazarus Lamilami found a Japanese soldier on Croker and delivered him as prisoner of war to the authorities in Darwin...|$|R
5000|$|Babyface, who {{had been}} {{frustrated}} {{in his role as}} a background singer with The Deele, credited Griffey with encouraging him to step out on his own and pursue a solo career, saying that Griffey told him [...] "If they don’t want you to sing all the time, you should be doing your own thing". In a statement released after Griffey's death, producer Quincy Jones said Griffey's [...] "fingerprints were on some of the biggest hits of the '80s". Stevie Wonder, one of the artists that Griffey promoted, said that [...] "Professionally, I could not talk about my life without there being a chapter on <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Griffey, as a promoter, helped to build my career".|$|R
6000|$|... "That is well, {{as far as}} it goes," [...] {{said the}} king. [...] "But, Jaqueline, about that mosquito?" [...] for she had told him this part of the adventure. [...] "That was a very {{convenient}} mosquito, though I don't know <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> was able to observe it from any distance. I see your hand in that, my dear, and I am glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the good Fairy Paribanou. Jaqueline," [...] he added solemnly, laying his hand on her head, [...] "You have saved the honour of Pantouflia, which is dearer to me than life. Without your help, I tremble to think what might have occurred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know when}} I'm beaten," [...] he said. [...] "Keep your report, and be damned to you. But {{remember}} that you and I have a score to settle, and you can ask those who know me <b>how</b> often <b>Dick</b> Horser comes out underneath in the long run." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>Dick!</b> <b>How</b> glad I am {{that you}} have come!" [...] gasped Anderson Rover, when he could speak. [...] "That towel nearly smothered me!" ...|$|R
5000|$|At the church, seeing Nick's body, Ted {{talks to}} Fr. Niall Haverty, then notices Nick's expensive, technologically-advanced coffin that Niall has bought, {{along with a}} pair of fake hands and a {{remote-controlled}} wheelchair, and Ted tells Niall he should stop throwing money away on useless impulse buys, which would only be of use in a [...] "completely ludicrous situation". Talking about his team's injury problems, Ted admits that fears defeat even more because of the forfeit system he and Dick use; the previous year, Ted had to photocopy his rear end (at the library) after Craggy Island lost. Matters are not helped by the fact Dick phones the church and taunts Ted. When Ted asks <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> knew where he was, the line goes dead and an ice-cream van jingle plays. Ted is furious to learn he has been spied upon.|$|R
60|$|I {{forced from}} myself a laugh, that only in part, however, broke the spell, and inquired of <b>Dick</b> <b>how</b> he had {{acquired}} possession of it.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} several {{carriages}} had come up, also {{a number of}} folks on bicycles and on foot, and {{to all of these}} the situation had to be explained. Among the last to put in an appearance was Captain Putnam, and he was at once all attention, and desired to know <b>how</b> seriously <b>Dick</b> and Frank were injured.|$|R
25|$|The {{second half}} of the novel, Books 3–5, tells <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> rescues Joanna from Sir Daniel with the help of both the Black Arrow {{fellowship}} and the Yorkist army led by Richard Crookback, the future Richard III of England. It centres on Shoreby, where the Lancastrian forces are entrenched. Robert Louis Stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of Book 3, wherein Dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of Joanna. They are unsuccessful, and after Joanna is moved to Sir Daniel's main quarters in Shoreby, Dick visits her {{in the guise of a}} Franciscan friar Stevenson, the populariser of the tales of the Arabian nights, has Dick tell the tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves in Book 4, chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain Arblaster, whose ship Dick and the outlaws had stolen.|$|R
5000|$|Eugene Paul {{reviewed}} {{a production}} mounted by the New York Musical Theatre Festival in 2010 and wrote that [...] "Virtue ... {{is the message}} and {{the thrust of the}} show." [...] In his plot summary, Paul wrote that Ragged Dick is working his way slowly up the ladder of respectability when an opportunity to improve his prospects is offered him in Snobden's haberdashery. He faces a setback when his wicked stepfather, Luke, arrives on the scene. Dick avoids him and pursues his goals. [...] "But everything comes crashing down when the darling son of a noble banker who has befriended Dick is kidnapped by none other than his stepfather, Luke. Suspicion and hatred, none of which Dick deserves, force him out of his job ... If you want to know <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> overcomes these tribulations—but then, you already know, don’t you. There is always a happy ending in Horatio Alger’s stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nellie!" [...] gasped the sufferer. [...] "Oh, yes, Nellie! As if I {{could ever}} forget her! Say, <b>Dick,</b> <b>how</b> soon will I see her, do you suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The mother apologized. [...] "He doesn't know you, <b>Dick.</b> <b>How</b> could he? He {{was only}} nine months old {{when you went}} away. He'll go to you by and by." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nightwing: Secret Files & Origins #1 and Nightwing: Year One {{tell the}} full post-Crisis version of <b>how</b> <b>Dick</b> Grayson gives up his {{identity}} as Robin (having been [...] "fired" [...] by Batman). Uncertain {{what to do}} with his new-found independence, Dick considers giving up fighting crime to study law, but he could not imagine his life in any other way. Turning to someone that he knows would understand, Dick asks Superman what he should be, if not Robin. In reply, Superman tells a tale of long ago on Krypton, about a man who was cast out of his family, just like Dick. He dreamt of a world ruled by justice, and set out to protect the helpless and victimized as Nightwing. Dick then decides to honor the legendary Kryptonian by renaming himself Nightwing. This tale retroactively erases the notion that anyone else before Grayson and Bette Kane ever held the titles of Nightwing and Flamebird, except for the birds and the legendary figures named after them.|$|R
