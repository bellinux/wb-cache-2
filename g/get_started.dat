5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to <b>get</b> <b>started</b> presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

5|$|In his profession, Coward {{was widely}} admired and loved for his {{generosity}} and kindness {{to those who}} fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive {{way in which he}} relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to <b>get</b> <b>started</b> in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward {{to play a role in}} The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.|$|E
5|$|While {{boarding}} at the Hale {{house in}} Harmony, Pennsylvania, Smith met and began courting Emma Hale. When Smith proposed marriage, Emma's father, Isaac Hale objected, primarily {{because he believed}} Smith had no means to support Emma besides money-digging. Smith and Emma eloped and married on January 18, 1827, after which the couple began boarding with Smith's parents in Manchester. Later that year, when Smith promised to abandon treasure seeking, Hale offered to let the couple live on his property in Harmony and help Smith <b>get</b> <b>started</b> in business.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to <b>get</b> <b>started</b> again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

5|$|The camera app {{includes}} a new shooting mode known as Zoe (alluding to the zoetrope), which captures a short video alongside each photo taken. Individual frames {{can be saved}} from the clip, while the frames {{can also be used}} with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a montage video from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options. The resulting video can be exported, or posted online through the HTC Share service (where they are accessible for 30 days). A television guide app is also provided, which incorporates remote control functionality via an infrared blaster hidden in the One’s power button, show recommendations powered by Peel, and the ability to display show reminders as stories on BlinkFeed. An updated music app now {{includes a}} visualizer and support for on-screen lyrics. An updated version of the <b>Get</b> <b>Started</b> feature (as introduced by HTC One X+) allows users to perform initial setup for their One via a web-based service, while a new Sync Manager allows data to be migrated from iOS device backups or HTC devices with Android 4.0 and higher. As with all devices in the One series, 25GB of Dropbox storage is available free for two years. Using NFC, the One can also share content between other compatible Android devices with Android Beam, and conduct mobile payments where compatible systems (such as FeliCa in Japan) are available.|$|E

25|$|No {{enrichment}} {{and fuel}} element fabrication. Since 100% of natural thorium {{can be used}} as a fuel, and the fuel is in the form of a molten salt instead of solid fuel rods, expensive fuel enrichment and solid fuel rods' validation procedures and fabricating processes are not needed. This greatly decreases LFTR fuel costs. Even if the LFTR is started up on enriched uranium, it only needs this enrichment once just to <b>get</b> <b>started.</b> After startup, no further enrichment is required.|$|E

25|$|Less fissile fuel needed. Because LFTRs are thermal {{spectrum}} reactors, they need much less fissile fuel to <b>get</b> <b>started.</b> Only 1-2 tons of fissile {{are required to}} start up a single fluid LFTR, and potentially as low as 0.4 ton for a two fluid design. In comparison, solid fueled fast breeder reactors need at least 8 tons of fissile fuel to start the reactor. While fast reactors can theoretically start up very well on the transuranic waste, their high fissile fuel startup makes this very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for New Zealand, most {{of these}} {{projects}} only came on line {{at the same time}} as oil prices dropped during the 1980s oil glut.

Because these Think Big projects required massive borrowing to <b>get</b> <b>started,</b> public debt soared from $4.2 billion in 1975 when Muldoon became Prime Minister to $21.9 billion when he left office nine years later. Inflation remained rampant, averaging 11% in the 1980s. Once Labour came to power in 1984, many of these projects were sold to private industry as part of a wider sale of state-assets.|$|E
