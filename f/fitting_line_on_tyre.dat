In this article, we present a method that relies {{on the idea that}} a plane appears as a line segment in a 2 D scan, and that by tracking those lines frame after frame, it is possible to estimate the parameters of that plane. The method is therefore divided in three steps: <b>fitting</b> <b>line</b> segments <b>on</b> the points of the 2 D scan, tracking those line segments in consecutive scan and estimating the parameters with a graph based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping) algorithm...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} the buildup and decay of threshold elevation {{during and after}} adaptation to sinewave gratings {{in a series of}} experiments investigating the effects of adapting time, adapting contrast, spatial frequency and retinal eccentricity. Contrast thresholds for vertical sinewave gratings truncated in space by a one-dimensional Gaussian envelope were measured before and after adaptation to a full-field suprathreshold grating of the same spatial frequency and orientation. Thresholds were measured intermittently after adaptation in a “seen/not-seen” single presentation procedure until these thresholds returned to baseline values. The first test grating was presented 300 msec after the offset of the adapting stimulus, and thereafter at regular intervals. At different times after adaptation, contrast thresholds were estimated by off-line analysis of the data using the QUEST algorithm. Adapting time was either 1, 10, 100 or 1000 sec and adapting contrast was either 9, 19, 29 or 39 dB (re. 1 %). The test gratings were presented centered either at the fixation point or at 5 and 10 deg eccentricity along the horizontal meridian. The results suggest that up to the saturation level the buildup and the decay of adaptation to contrast is well described by a power function of time. The slope of the best <b>fitting</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> log-log axes is fairly constant for the adaptation times tested. As reported earlier, thresholds increased with adapting contrast and these contrast-dependent differences were evident 300 msec after the termination of adaptation. Adaptation at 10 deg eccentricity yielded slightly higher threshold elevations than for central vision. Based on these results, a description is given of the dynamic response of the underlying neural mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Present paper {{deals with}} using the total {{least squares method}} (TLSM), the so called {{orthogonal}} distance regression (ODR) for system identification, instead of the classical least squares method (LSM), as ODR is a suitable tool for <b>fitting</b> <b>lines</b> and surfaces in multidimensional space, while even the use of classical re-gression in 2 D is not so natural. A new method for identification of systems of arbitrary real order based on numerical solution of fractional differential equa-tions and orthogonal distance fitting is proposed. In order to define a model of observed data a system of fractional-order differential equations (FODEs) will be considered, which solution represents the optimal fitting of given points in space. The solution is obtained using Grünwald-Letnikov definition of fractional derivative, which allows to get an approximate numerical solution to given an-alytical systems of FODEs. For obtaining of both, the sum of distances of the data points from the <b>fitting</b> <b>line</b> in 2 D and 3 D space and the numerical solution {{of a system of}} FODEs, MATLAB-functions were developed. The sum of orthog-onal distances between the data points in space and a <b>fitting</b> <b>line</b> is considered as the criterion for optimization, which is performed using fminsearchbnd-function (created by John D’Errico). The results are presented in 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional space. ...|$|R

40|$|Outflows {{promote the}} escape of Lyman-α (Lyα) photons from dusty {{interstellar}} media. The process of radiative transfer through interstellar outflows is often modelled by a spherically symmetric, geometrically thin shell of gas that scatters photons emitted by a central Lyα source. Despite its simplified geometry, this `shell model' has been surprisingly successful at reproducing observed Lyα line shapes. In this paper we perform automated <b>line</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>on</b> {{a set of}} noisy simulated shell model spectra, {{in order to determine}} whether degeneracies exist between the different shell model parameters. While there are some significant degeneracies, we find that most parameters are accurately recovered, especially the HI column density (N_ HI) and outflow velocity (v_ exp). This work represents an important first step in determining how the shell model parameters relate to the actual physical properties of Lyα sources.
