50|$|It is {{also called}} {{hydrostatic}} pressure, and more intricately {{defined as the}} pressure measured by a fluid, measured {{at a certain point}} within itself when at equilibrium. Generally, turgor pressure is caused by the osmotic <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and occurs in plants, fungi, and bacteria. The phenomenon is also observed in protists that have cell walls. This system is not seen in animal cells, seeing how the absence of a cell wall would cause the cell to lyse when under too much pressure. The pressure exerted by the osmotic <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is called turgidity. It is caused by the osmotic <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through a selectively permeable membrane. Osmotic <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> through a semipermeable membrane is when the water travels from an area with a low-solute concentration, to one with a higher-solute concentration. In plants, this entails the water moving from the low concentration solute outside the cell, into the cell's vacuole.|$|R
