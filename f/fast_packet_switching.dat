40|$|Broadband ISDN networks, {{of which}} ATM is the {{accepted}} transfer mode solution, require <b>fast</b> <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> {{to move the}} ATM cells along their respective virtual paths. The prime purpose of an ATM switch is to route incoming cells (packets more generally) arriving on a particular input link to the output link, which is also called the output port, associated with the appropriate route. The subject of this thesis is to discuss the three basic techniques that have been proposed {{to carry out the}} switching (routing) function: space-division, shared-medium, and shared-memory. The basic example for a space-division switch is a crossbar switch, which has also served circuit-switched telephony networks for many years. The inputs and outputs in a crossbar switch are connected at switching points called crosspoints, resulting in a matrix type of structure. New decomposed crossbar switches architecture is developed recently so as to minimize the input and output cell contention, this new architecture is discussed in this thesis. The operation of a shared-medium switch, on the other hand, is based on a common high-speed bus. Cells are launched from input links onto the bus in round-robin fashion, and each output link accepts cells that are destined to it. A more enhanced architecture of this type; a TDM-Based Multibus <b>Packet</b> <b>Switch</b> is discussed in this project. The shared-memory (SM) switch, consists of a single dual-ported memory shared by all input and output lines. Packets arriving on all input lines are multiplexed into a single stream that is fed to the common memory for storage; inside the memory, packets are organized into separate output queues, one for each output line. Simultaneously, an output stream of packets is formed by retrieving packets from the output queues sequentially, one per queue; the output stream is then demultiplexed, and packets are transmitted on the output lines. This project presents a survey of the buffer management methods that have been proposed for shared-memory <b>packet</b> <b>switches.</b> Several buffer management policies are described, and their strengths and weaknesses are examined. The performances of various policies are evaluated using computer simulations. A comparison of the most important schemes is obtained {{with the help of the}} simulation results and the results provided in the literature.

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{efficient}} frame loss guarantees for video communication over ATM-like <b>fast</b> <b>packet</b> <b>switched</b> networks, we propose a simple to implement, yet effective, strategy called Frame-Induced Packet Discarding (FIPD), in which, upon detection of loss of a threshold number (determined by an application's video encoding scheme) of packets belonging to a video frame, the network attempts to discard all the remaining packets of that frame.

40|$|The {{explosion}} {{in the size of}} communication networks as well as the need for integration of voice, video and data have pioneered a need for <b>fast</b> <b>packet</b> <b>switching.</b> The economical implementation of <b>fast</b> <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> has become a reality with the recent advances in VLSI technology. This has introduced opportunities for new applications like video conferencing, that demand severe performance requirements in terms of allocated bandwidth, delay, delay jitter, and loss rate. Packet scheduling is an effort to reduce delay, delay-jitter and losses thereby providing Quality of Service to such delay- and loss-sensitive applications. [...] The upshot of this research will influence the resolution of a most appropriate method of providing guaranteed but paid service to users of real-time applications like video conferencing, unlike the Internet, which is designed to provide best-effort service. Various packet-scheduling algorithms have been studied. Among the several existing packet-scheduling algorithms, Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) and Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing Plus (WFÂ²Q+) are selected in this thesis for comparison based on their delay properties. The performance is investigated for both fixed-sized packets and variable-sized packets. It has been found that WFÂ²Q+ is fair and introduces lower delay than WFQ. Due to the lower hardware as well as time complexity, WFÂ²Q+ can be considered as a prospective algorithm for use in high-speed packet-switched networks. The performance is studied on a network with and without the presence of cross-traffic for various traffic loads. Simulation results and hardware realization are discussed.
