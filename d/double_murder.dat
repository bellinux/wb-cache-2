5|$|Robert Anderson was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} CID on 1 September, but he went on sick leave to Switzerland on the 7th. Superintendent Thomas Arnold, {{who was in charge}} of H (Whitechapel) Division, went on leave on 2 September. Anderson's absence left overall direction of the enquiries confused, and led Chief Commissioner Sir Charles Warren to appoint Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to co-ordinate the investigation from Scotland Yard. A German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was taken into custody on 18 September on suspicion of the murders, but he was released less than two weeks later when a <b>double</b> <b>murder</b> demonstrated that the real culprit was still at large.|$|E

5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, {{who was convicted}} of a <b>double</b> <b>murder</b> in 1990 and sentenced to death by lethal injection. A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed the warrant and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E

5|$|Robert Keable (6 March 1887 – 22 December 1927) was a British novelist, {{formerly}} a missionary and priest in the Church of England. He resigned his ministry following {{his experiences in}} the First World War and caused a scandal with his 1921 novel Simon Called Peter, {{the tale of a}} priest's wartime affair with a young nurse. The book sold 600,000 copies in the 1920s alone, was referenced in The Great Gatsby, and was cited in a <b>double</b> <b>murder</b> investigation.

5|$|Filming {{took place}} in both Los Angeles and Miami. The scenes filmed in Miami were shot in July 2006; those in Los Angeles were shot later. Scenes at the beach where Yelina talks with Rita and where her fiancé's body washes up were filmed at South Beach Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, north of Miami. A {{waterfront}} house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida stood in for the Castillos' home. The abandoned hospital where Dexter and the police find Tucci was filmed at the former Linda Vista Community Hospital in East Los Angeles, and Dexter's childhood home was filmed at {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California, where Rita's house is also filmed. Scenes in the salvage yard were filmed at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter commits the <b>double</b> <b>murder</b> was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio sound stage for shooting scenes inside the trailer.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling <b>double</b> <b>murder</b> of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
5000|$|Krishna Maharaj (born 26 January 1939) is a Trinidadian businessman.

50|$|Rohini Salian is {{a leading}} Indian public {{prosecutor}} in the sessions court. Salian has handled several important cases such as the Borivali <b>double</b> <b>murders,</b> diamond merchant and film financier Bharat Shah’s case, the J J shootout case, the Sara Sahara shopping complex case and the Ghatkopar and Mulund blast cases. Salian, who is also an accomplished painter, was initially an urban planner with the then Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, and joined the legal profession in 1982.|$|R
5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the <b>double</b> <b>murder,</b> and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E
25|$|Larey {{moved to}} Frederick, Oklahoma {{two months later}} {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle.
