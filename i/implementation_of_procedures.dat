50|$|The {{status of}} an {{individual}} within a society is somehow changed and reflected in social status {{after the birth of}} a child. The theoretical concept of a Rite of Passage was coined by ethnographer Arnold van Gennep. Birth as a rite of passage incorporates the three stages that are essential to this process of symbolism. Rituals are symbolic; made up of an action, idea, or object and they contain ritualistic meaning. Obstetric procedures act as rituals for pregnant women and medical personnel with intention to improve attitudes for all individuals involved in the birthing process. For example, when the woman is hooked up to an IV machine there is a feeling of security that is set in place. A reassuring cultural order is imposed on the daunting and complicated event. This ritualization of birth reaffirms beliefs that center around science, technology and authoritative knowledge. To ensure a future for the cultural beliefs that are held {{at the center of a}} society's ideology, these ideas are perpetuated. Through birth, the treatment of the women's body and the doctor's <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures,</b> a rite of passage is created and enacted within American culture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Combining term {{rewriting}} and modal logics, {{this paper}} addresses confluence and termination of rewrite systems introduced for only-knowing logics. The rewrite systems contain a rule scheme that {{gives rise to}} {{an infinite number of}} critical pairs, hence we cannot check the joinability of every critical pair directly, in order to establish local confluence. We investigate conditions that are sufficient for confluence and identify a set of rewrite rules that satisfy these conditions; however, the general confluence result makes it easier to check confluence also of stronger systems should one want additional rules. The results provide a firm logical basis for <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> that compute autoepistemic expansions. Keywords.

40|$|Which gates are {{universal}} for quantum computation? Although {{it is well}} known that certain gates on two-level quantum systems (qubits), such as the controlled-not (CNOT), {{are universal}} when assisted by arbitrary one-qubit gates, it has only recently become clear precisely what class of two-qubit gates is universal in this sense. Here we present an elementary proof that any entangling two-qubit gate is universal for quantum computation, when assisted by one-qubit gates. A proof of this important result for systems of arbitrary finite dimension has been provided by J. L. and R. Brylinski [arXiv:quant-ph/ 0108062, 2001]; however, their proof relies upon a long argument using advanced mathematics. In contrast, our proof provides a simple constructive procedure which is close to optimal and experimentally practical [C. M. Dawson and A.
