30|$|In the {{components}} discussed so far, the changing number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> leads to a proportional {{change in the}} volume of work. This would result in an excessively volatile productivity development caused by calendar-effects. Therefore, working time elasticities specific to economic branches are needed to approximate the correlation between a change of number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> and a change of labour volume. These working-time elasticities should measure by how many hours the annual hours worked change when more or less <b>working</b> <b>days</b> are available, and hence the latter {{are not included in}} annual hours worked one-to-one. As suitable data for estimating these effects are not available, we take the elasticities to correspond to <b>working</b> <b>days</b> elasticities of production calculated by the German Bundesbank. These elasticities indicate the percentage by which the production increases if the potential working hours are extended by one per cent due to (the fraction of) an additional <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> The estimated <b>working</b> <b>day</b> effect reflects the difference of production carried out at a normal work day and the production carried out at a weekend day.|$|R

30|$|In the {{calculations}} {{of the number}} of potential <b>working</b> <b>days</b> a five-day week is assumed throughout. This common assumption presumes that employees are given compensatory time off on other days when they work on saturdays, sundays, or on public holidays. 6 The number of potential <b>working</b> <b>days</b> therefore results from the number of calendar days minus saturdays, sundays, and public holidays. Regional holidays that do not apply throughout Germany are weighted with the number of employees subject to social insurance contributions within the states (Bundesländer) level to calculate averages. The different numbers of annual <b>working</b> <b>days</b> have a nonnegligible irregular effect on annual hours worked. In addition to the resulting number of days, the effect of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> on the collectively agreed annual working time is presented in Table A. 1 (see Appendix A).

Methods Patients with CRC diagnosed in six hospitals in southern Netherlands during January to December in 2005 (n = 445) and January to July in 2008 (n = 353) were included. The time between diagnosis and start of treatment was assessed, and the proportion of patients treated within the recommended time (5 <b>working</b> <b>days)</b> was calculated. Results The time to treatment for colon cancer patients was 13 <b>working</b> <b>days</b> in 2005 and 17 <b>working</b> <b>days</b> in 2008.
