It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a <b>foetal</b> <b>position,</b> which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E

40|$|Foetal {{movements}} commence {{at seven}} weeks of gestation, with the foetal movement repertoire including twitches, whole body movements, stretches, isolated limb movements, breathing movements, {{head and neck}} movements, jaw movements (including yawning, sucking and swallowing) and hiccups by ten weeks of gestational age. There are two key biomechanical aspects to gross foetal movements; the first being that the foetus moves in a dynamically changing constrained physical {{environment in which the}} freedom to move becomes increasingly restricted with increasing foetal size and decreasing amniotic fluid. Therefore, the mechanical environment experienced by the foetus affects its ability to move freely. Secondly, the mechanical forces induced by foetal movements are crucial for normal skeletal development, as evidenced by a number of conditions and syndromes for which reduced or abnormal foetal movements are implicated, such as developmental dysplasia of the hip, arthrogryposis and foetal akinesia deformation sequence. This review examines both the biomechanical effects of the physical environment on foetal movements through discussion of intrauterine factors, such as space, <b>foetal</b> <b>positioning</b> and volume of amniotic fluid, and the biomechanical role of gross foetal movements in human skeletal development through investigation of the effects of abnormal movement on the bones and joints. This review also highlights computational simulations of foetal movements that attempt to determine the mechanical forces acting on the foetus as it moves. Finally, avenues for future research into foetal movement biomechanics are highlighted, which have potential impact for a diverse range of fields including foetal medicine, musculoskeletal disorders and tissue engineering...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{capacity}} of pre-induction sonographic assessment of occipital <b>position</b> of the <b>foetal</b> head to predict the outcome of delivery, and to assess whether sonographic <b>foetal</b> head <b>position</b> before induction of labour is related to foetal presentation at delivery. Study design: A prospective cohort {{study was conducted in}} the Maxima Medical Centre, The Netherlands. We included consecutive women in whom labour was induced. Immediately prior to induction a transabdominal ultrasound was performed to determine the <b>position</b> of the <b>foetal</b> occiput. The primary outcome was mode of delivery. We recorded maternal demographics, labour and delivery characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes. The association between <b>position</b> of the <b>foetal</b> head before induction of labour and the occurrence of caesarean section was addressed using univariable and logistic regression analysis. Results: From the 50 of the 183 foetuses that started labour in occipitoposterior position, 11 persisted in occipitoposterior position until birth, whereas from the 120 foetuses that were in occipitoanterior position before induction, three children were born in an occipitoposterior position. Although we found a difference in caesarean section rate between OP position and OA <b>position</b> of the <b>foetal</b> head at sonography prior to induction, this was not statistically significant (14 % versus 6. 7 %, OR 2. 3, 95 % Cl 0. 78 - 6. 7).

5000|$|The ritual {{lives of}} animals are of {{interest}} to paleoanthropologists, as they provide a convenient insight into how religious belief systems may have developed in our ancestors. [...] "The skeletal remains of Cro-Magnon man are found buried in the <b>foetal</b> <b>position</b> {{in line with the}} primitive myth that such a position facilitates rebirth. The study of allied behaviours in non-human animals provides an opportunity to understand their nature and function in man." [...] Indeed, some have seen superficial similarities between the funeral rituals of African elephants and the burial rituals of Neanderthals. Evolutionary psychologist Matt Rossano has theorised that religion evolved in three stages. In the pre-Upper Palaeolithic, religion was characterised by ecstatic rituals used to facilitate social bonding. Later, shamanic healing rituals developed in the Upper Palaeolithic. Finally, religious expressions developed over time to include cave art, ritual artefacts, ancestor worship and the development of myth and moral structures. [...] If this is true then the behaviour of chimpanzees witnessed by Goodall may be interpreted as similar to pre-Upper Palaeolithic Human religion. However, De Waal notes that bonobo chimpanzees show no evidence of ritual behaviour yet are extremely peaceful and demonstrate moral agency. This casts doubt on the co-development of morality and proto-religion.|$|E

Principal photography took place from 27 August to 23 October. Scenes in Jerusalem were filmed in Tamnougalt. Many scenes were filmed with hand-held cameras {{to make it appear}} that the audience is [...] "eavesdropping" [...] on characters' conversations. A significant scene was the crucifixion in Episode 3. The scene was filmed over three days and was frequently interrupted by torrential downpours. Mawle's make-up call came at 3.30 a.m. and it took five hours to apply cuts, bruises and blisters to his body. As he carried the cross over the sand, Mawle imagined the pain and exhaustion Jesus felt when he did it. Contrary to traditional depictions of the crucifixion, where Jesus is shown nailed to the cross by his hands, production designer Simon Elliot chose to show Jesus in the <b>foetal</b> <b>position,</b> with the nails through his arms. Mark Goodacre advised that this was the most common and effective method of crucifixion used by the Romans, and Elliot believed that [...] "the Victorian image" [...] did not match historical evidence; The Passions interpretation was based on a skeleton of a crucified man that was discovered near Jerusalem in the 1960s. 3,000 extras participated in the trial scenes in Episode 3.|$|E
50|$|In Building D2a, one of {{the group}} of {{buildings}} at the west end of the site, cattle bones were piled up alongside one wall in a way which led the excavator to suggest that this was a temple, used in cult practice. Numerous inhumation burials occupied the site, and amongst them, the grave of a child, tightly trussed up in <b>foetal</b> <b>position.</b> The body occupied only half of the grave area, while in the other half was placed a cow's tooth; another hint of cult practice involving cattle. A grave on the threshold of the Great Hall A4 contained a goat's skull which might indicate another animal cult associated with the name of the place, the goat's hill. The two prehistoric burial monuments which were already on the site, the Western and Eastern Ring Ditches were brought back into use. The centre of each was marked with a post (a totem pole) and burials were set out around these. Some of the burials are undoubtedly of pagan tradition; but Yeavering runs into the Christian era: Bede’s text is the narrative of a conversion episode in 627. It is suggested that the refurbishment of the ‘temple’ building D2a (re-built in the same position as D2b) was a Christianisation as recommended by Pope Gregory I (see Bede's Ecclesiastical History, Book 1 Chapter 30). Building B, associated with the cemetery, was initially interpreted as a church. However, this has since been criticised on the basis that burials did not become associated with churches until the 9th century, and building B is thought to be earlier than this. An alternative explanation since offered is that this was a building dedicated not to worship, but to mortuary preparations.|$|E

40|$|Simulation, training, {{pregnancy}} simulator, midwifery training ABSTRACT: This paper describes {{research for}} development of a pregnancy simulator training tool. It addresses an important training need for enhanced skill training of the midwifery graduate. Midwives use tactile inspection of <b>foetal</b> <b>position</b> as a primary tool for decision making in the clinical setting. When the baby is lying in an abnormal position, {{it is important to}} be able to quickly recognise this and act accordingly. In the current Midwifery education system it is difficult to reinforce practical skills. During courses there are limited clinical placements to allow a student to gain practical experience. In the course of this experience students mostly gain exposure to normal cases, with little exposure to important abnormal cases. The aim in developing this simulator is to provide a skill development tool that can be easily used in an educational setting. Central to the simulator is tactile feedback. A simulated <b>foetal</b> <b>position</b> is provided, and the student uses tactile assessment in an attempt to determine the foetus position. Since students are timid they tend to be reticent and can miss important tactile information. There is some research on generic tactile feedback, but this simulator is unusual in that it is dedicated to detailed simulation and recognition of tactile information. We present results of limited trials of the system. 1...|$|E
