25|$|In FETs, {{electrons}} can flow {{in either}} direction through the channel when operated in the linear mode. The naming convention of <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> and source terminal is somewhat arbitrary, as the devices are typically (but not always) built symmetrically from source to drain. This makes FETs suitable for switching analog signals between paths (multiplexing). With this concept, one can construct a solid-state mixing board, for example.|$|E
25|$|FETs can be majority-charge-carrier devices, {{in which}} the current is carried {{predominantly}} by majority carriers, or minority-charge-carrier devices, {{in which the}} current is mainly due to a flow of minority carriers. The device consists of an active channel through which charge carriers, electrons or holes, flow from the source to the drain. Source and <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> conductors {{are connected to the}} semiconductor through ohmic contacts. The conductivity of the channel {{is a function of the}} potential applied across the gate and source terminals.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} the {{terminals}} refer to their functions. The gate terminal may {{be thought of as}} controlling the opening and closing of a physical gate. This gate permits electrons to flow through or blocks their passage by creating or eliminating a channel between the source and drain. Electron-flow from the source terminal towards the <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> is influenced by an applied voltage. The body simply refers to the bulk of the semiconductor in which the gate, source and drain lie. Usually the body terminal is connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, {{depending on the type of}} the FET. The body terminal and the source terminal are sometimes connected together since the source is often connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, although there are several uses of FETs which do not have such a configuration, such as transmission gates and cascode circuits.|$|E
50|$|Oxide punch-through, {{formation}} of a conductive path through the insulating layer between two conductors or semiconductors; the gate oxides are thinnest and therefore most sensitive. The damaged transistor shows a low-ohmic junction between gate and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{threshold}} voltage, {{also called}} the gate voltage, commonly abbreviated as Vth or VGS (th), of a field-effect transistor (FET) is the minimum gate-to-source voltage differential {{that is needed to}} create a conducting path between the source and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Unlike bipolar transistors, JFETs are {{exclusively}} voltage-controlled in {{that they}} do not need a biasing current. Electric charge flows through a semiconducting channel between source and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals.</b> By applying a reverse bias voltage to a gate terminal, the channel is [...] "pinched", so that the electric current is impeded or switched off completely. A JFET is usually on when there is no potential difference between its gate and source terminals. If a potential difference of the proper polarity is applied between its gate and source terminals, the JFET will be more resistive to current flow, which means less current would flow in the channel between the source and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals.</b> Thus, JFETs are sometimes referred to as depletion-mode devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{trend is}} towards lower core voltages, which {{conserve}} power. This presents the CMOS designer with a challenge, because in CMOS the voltages go only to {{ground and the}} supply voltage, the source, gate, and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals</b> of the FETs have only the supply voltage or zero voltage across them.|$|R
50|$|The basic TFET {{structure}} {{is similar to}} a MOSFET except that the source and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals</b> of a TFET are doped of opposite type (see figure). A common TFET device structure consists of a P-I-N (p-type, intrinsic, n-type) junction, in which the electrostatic potential of the intrinsic region is controlled by a gate terminal.|$|R
50|$|Trench {{capacitors}} have numerous advantages. Since the capacitor {{is buried}} in {{the bulk of the}} substrate instead of lying on its surface, the area it occupies can be minimized to what is required to connect it to the access transistor's <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> without decreasing the capacitor's size, and thus capacitance (Jacob, pp. 356-357). Alternatively, the capacitance can be increased by etching a deeper hole without any increase to surface area (Kenner, pg. 44). Another advantage of the trench capacitor is that its structure is under the layers of metal interconnect, allowing them to be more easily made planar, which enables it to be integrated in a logic-optimized process technology, which have many levels of interconnect above the substrate. The fact that the capacitor is under the logic means that it is constructed before the transistors are. This allows high-temperature processes to fabricate the capacitors, which would otherwise be degrading the logic transistors and their performance. This makes trench capacitors suitable for constructing embedded DRAM (eDRAM) (Jacob, p. 357). Disadvantages of trench capacitors are difficulties in reliably constructing the capacitor's structures within deep holes and in connecting the capacitor to the access transistor's <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> (Kenner, pg. 44).|$|E

50|$|The {{analogous}} connection {{used with}} MOS transistors is an open-drain connection. Open-drain outputs {{can be useful}} for analog weighting, summing, and limiting as well as digital logic. An open <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> is connected to ground when a high voltage (logic 1) {{is applied to the}} gate, yet presents a high impedance when a low voltage (logic 0) is applied to the gate. This high impedance state occurs because the terminal is at an undefined voltage (floating) thus such a device requires an external pull-up resistor connected to the positive voltage rail (logic 1) in order to provide a logic 1 as output.|$|E

The top the capacitor {{is connected to the}} access transistor's <b>drain</b> <b>terminal</b> via a polysilicon strap (Kenner, pp. 42-44).

5000|$|Thermal {{oxidation}} of any variety {{produces a}} higher-quality oxide, {{with a much}} cleaner interface, than chemical vapor deposition of oxide resulting in Low Temperature Oxide layer (reaction of TEOS at about 600 °C). However, the high temperatures required to produce High Temperature Oxide (HTO) restrict its usability. For instance, in MOSFET processes, thermal oxidation is never performed after the doping for the source and <b>drain</b> <b>terminals</b> is performed, because it would disturb {{the placement of the}} dopants.|$|R
2500|$|When {{a voltage}} is applied between {{the gate and}} body terminals, the {{electric}} field generated penetrates through the oxide and creates an [...] "inversion layer" [...] or [...] "channel" [...] at the semiconductor–insulator interface.

40|$|This paper investigates {{anomalous}} capacitance-voltage (C-V) degradation in amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film-transistors (TFTs) under {{hot carrier}} stress. In vacuum hot carrier stress, both the gate-to-drain capacitance (CGD) and the gate-to-source capacitance (CGS) curves exhibited positive shifts due to electron trapping in the gate dielectric. In addition, an observed increase in capacitance value {{at a lower}} gate voltage in the CGD measurement only can be ascribed to interface state creation. However, when the hot carrier stress was performed in an oxygen-rich environment, the CGD-VG curve showed a significantly positive shift due to the electric-field-induced oxygen adsorption near the <b>drain</b> <b>terminal.</b> The degradation in the CGS-VG curve is due {{not only to the}} positive shift, but also the anomalous two step turn-on behavior.
