25|$|<b>I</b> <b>challenge</b> the {{prevalent}} marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz {{in the standard}} jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.|$|E

500|$|Third Day, {{intending}} to [...] "shake things up", made some significant changes to its management {{prior to the}} production of Revelation. The band left Creative Trust Management and signed with Red Light, which represented such artists as Dave Matthews Band, Switchfoot, and Rodney Atkins. They also chose to work with mainstream producer Howard Benson, who had worked on projects with other bands that Third Day had enjoyed. Benson decided he wanted to work with Third Day after Chris Daughtry drew his attention to Mac Powell's vocal ability. Benson, who is Jewish, said that he enjoys working with Christian artists such as Third Day because they believe in something. He added that their different religious beliefs prompted discussions about faith between himself and the band, which Benson said [...] "comes out in the record because of the way <b>I</b> <b>challenge</b> them and they challenge me". Third Day were initially uncomfortable at first working with Benson, as the band's achievements in the Christian music realm meant nothing in the world of mainstream record production. Despite the band's insecurity at the start, they appreciated the experience the end of the process. The decision to use Benson led to the band recording the album in Los Angeles instead of Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Cross, a {{resolute}} Christian, {{converted to}} Christianity while {{on leave from}} a posting to Cyprus in 1981. He visited Jerusalem over the Easter weekend and {{was inspired by a}} retired British Army officer he met there to convert. After converting, he considered leaving the Army, but has said in interviews that he reconciled his beliefs with his military service, contending that [...] "the British Army as a community [...] recognises the issue of spirituality and goodness and righteousness and justice and evil and wrong probably far more than most". He is a licensed lay reader in the Church of England and has involvement with a number of Christian organisations, including as a trustee of the British and Foreign Bible Society and {{a former president of the}} Armed Forces Christian Union. In an interview for the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2009, he said [...] "The moral component of fighting power is about leadership, it's about ethics, it's about culture, it's about how do you get people to fight and embedded within that is an element of justice and righteousness. f you lose the moral component, you lose everything. I think we – collectively in the West – have gone through 30 - 40 years really of pretending that this moral component is not important, and that I don't need to have a biblical foundation in my life. And <b>I</b> <b>challenge</b> that." [...] He has written on the subject in the British Army Review, an in house publication aimed at generating professional debate, where he described ideas of a secular Army as 'tripe' and 'dangerously wrong' and the rewrite of the motto of the Girl Guides, removing reference to God, as 'vapid and anodyne'.|$|E
