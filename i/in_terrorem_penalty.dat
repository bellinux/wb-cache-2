50|$|<b>In</b> <b>terrorem</b> clauses (referred to in English as No-contest clauses) {{are also}} used in wills to keep {{beneficiaries}} from contesting the will by either completely disinheriting them from any share, or reducing their share to a nominal amount.

To talk, and especially to act like Self-will affords the fullest proof that a man never came in at the gate.

A few days previously I had shot one loud-mouthed singer and suspended his carcass <b>in</b> <b>terrorem</b> about fifty yards from my tent-door.

50|$|Historically, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. Therefore, the U.S. financial services industry has lobbied since the mid-19th century for faster foreclosure procedures that would not clog up state courts with uncontested cases, and would lower the cost of credit (because it must always have the cost of recovering collateral built-in). Lenders have also argued that taking foreclosures out of the courts is actually kinder and less traumatic to defaulting borrowers, as it avoids the <b>in</b> <b>terrorem</b> effects of being sued.|$|R
5000|$|A will {{may include}} an <b>in</b> <b>terrorem</b> clause, with {{language}} {{along the lines}} of [...] "any person who contests this will shall forfeit his legacy", which operates to disinherit any person who challenges the validity of the will. Such no-contest clauses are permitted under the Uniform Probate Code, which most American states follow at least in part. However, since the clause is within the will itself, a successful challenge to the will renders the clause meaningless. Many states consider such clauses void as a matter of public policy or valid only if a will is contested without probable cause.|$|R

60|$|And {{though of}} all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit, {{instantaneous}} obedience; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or <b>in</b> <b>terrorem,</b> or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab {{was by no means}} unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.|$|R
50|$|A no-contest clause, {{also called}} an <b>in</b> <b>terrorem</b> clause, is a clause {{in a legal}} document, such as a {{contract}} or a will, {{that is designed to}} threaten someone, usually with litigation or criminal prosecution, into acting, refraining from action, or ceasing to act. The phrase is typically used to refer to a clause in a will that threatens to disinherit a beneficiary of the will if that beneficiary challenges the terms of the will in court. Many states in the United States hold a no-contest clause in a will to be unenforceable, so long as the person challenging the will has probable cause to do so.|$|R
5000|$|Because false {{statements}} do not effect market prices and investors are {{indifferent to the}} price they pay anyway, Thomas sees the Basic presumption as doing no good and much harm. Noting that on merits only six defendants have successfully rebutted individual plaintiffs’ reliance on price integrity, Thomas fears that the Basic presumption in practice is “largely irrebuttable”. What’s worse for Thomas, the huge damages resulting from securities fraud creates “substantial <b>in</b> <b>terrorem</b> settlement pressures” for large publicly traded companies to pay deceived shareholders. [...] Concluding that reliance in security fraud is “inherently individualized”, Thomas would overrule Basic and require every deceived shareholder to sue separately.|$|R
5000|$|With the Revolution of 1688 came a {{new crop}} of penal laws. These laws {{were more likely to be}} enforced. The sanguinary {{penalties}} of the sixteenth century had, in great measure, defeated their own end but were generally left on the statute book <b>in</b> <b>terrorem.</b> That is, the Elizabethan laws were so harsh that no one was willing to actually enforce them. In 1689 (1 William and Mary, i, c. 9) a shorter form of the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy was substituted, the clause aimed against Catholics being carefully retained. It was likewise ordered that all Papists and reputed Papists should be [...] "amoved" [...] ten miles (16 km) from the cities of London and Westminster.|$|R
5000|$|The {{term was}} used in the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, which stated: [...] "The requirement of allegations suggesting an agreement serves the practical purpose of preventing a plaintiff with [...] "a largely groundless claim" [...] from [...] "taking up the time of a number of other people, with the right to do so representing an <b>in</b> <b>terrorem</b> increment of the settlement value" [...] (quoting Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores). In other words, the Court worried that the threat of an expensive lawsuit (that was ultimately groundless) would nevertheless encourage settlements, and thus payments by innocent defendants, particularly in the case of antitrust lawsuits, which have a long and very expensive discovery process.|$|R
6000|$|The New York press holds this {{argument}} over English people <b>in</b> <b>terrorem.</b> [...] "We Americans may be ever so {{wrong in the}} matter in dispute, but if you push us to a war, we will confiscate your English property." [...] Very good. It is peace now. Confidence of course is restored between us. Our eighteen hundred peace commissioners have no occasion to open their mouths; and the little question of confiscation is postponed. Messrs. Battery, Broadway and Co., of New York, have the kindness to sell my Saginaws for what they will fetch.

The names of most of the parties concerned, as well as the fact itself, would, he was well aware, sound odiously in the ears of his colleagues in administration, and most likely instigate them to make an example of young Ravenswood, at least, <b>in</b> <b>terrorem.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I {{have talked}} {{during the last}} week with many English holders of American securities, who, of course, have been aware of the threat held over them.

Let its {{forfeiture}} be held over England as a weapon <b>in</b> <b>terrorem.</b> British subjects have two or three hundred millions of dollars invested in shipping and other property in the United States. All this property, together with the stocks, would be seized, amounting to nine hundred millions of dollars. Will England incur this tremendous loss for a mere abstraction?" ...|$|R

Yet for some groups, in terroremis a way of life - particularly for those whose lives are performed under social and political spotlights. At the core of the limitations imposed on certain groups in Australia is the use of language to police the behaviours of these groups, and to create a social environment that makes hiding one’s identity the most effective mechanism to avoid terror.
