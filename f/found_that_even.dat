5|$|In an {{interview}} with Fortune magazine, Activision's CEO of Publishing Eric Hirshberg <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> after five years without a game, the Guitar Hero brand still enjoyed high social media attention, with over 10 million followers on the Guitar Heros Facebook page. However, Hirshberg stated that Activision realized they needed to reinvent the series so that consumers would not consider it {{much the same as}} previous games and to help sway those that were turned off by the earlier saturation of music games.|$|E
5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
50|$|The Zantops' {{bodies were}} <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> by family friend Roxana Verona, {{who had arrived}} as an invited guest for dinner. She {{notified}} police.|$|R
60|$|The {{camp was}} {{situated}} twenty days' march from Carthage {{at the foot}} of some hills in which lions and other beasts of prey were known to abound, and there was no doubt that they would be <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|R
60|$|On {{opening his}} eyes he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> had sunk to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness. The young girl with the remarkably {{pleasant}} lips and white teeth was beside him. More than this--astonishingly more--his head was upon her lap, his face and neck were disagreeably wet, and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar.|$|R
5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance {{about the consequences of}} radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A study of the long-term psychological effects of the bombings on the survivors <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> 17–20 years after the bombings had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{fipronil}} {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, {{in a study by}} the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, {{to a level of}} 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E
50|$|Eventually they <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if {{the pivotal}} event wouldn't occur the result {{eventually}} be the same.|$|R
60|$|This is why Clarence Colfax <b>found</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> on a {{hospital}} steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St. Louis.|$|R
50|$|On May 9, 1996, Nina Yefimova, 25-year-old, {{was found}} dead from a shot {{to the back of}} the head. Her 73-year-old mother was also killed, after they were both {{abducted}} from their apartment on the outskirts of Grozny. Yefimova's body was found the following morning in Grozny's Leninsky District, while her mother's was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> in a deserted canned food factory in Grozny.|$|R
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> single cells {{were far more}} complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, {{and found that}} it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E
60|$|In {{the cabin}} of the {{captured}} Spaniard, Jasper Leigh <b>found</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> {{face to face}} with Sakr-el-Bahr, haled thither by the corsair's gigantic Nubians.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the evening}} of a bright and {{beautiful}} day--one of those days in which the air seems fresher and the sky bluer, and the sun more brilliant than usual. They had <b>found,</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>that</b> the trail led them away to the right towards one of the numerous clumps of woodland which rendered that part of the prairie more like a nobleman's park than a wild wilderness.|$|R

5|$|The {{results of}} the Outer Solar System Survey (OSSOS) {{suggests}} that the observed clustering {{is the result of}} a combination of observing bias and small number statistics. OSSOS, a well-characterized survey of the outer Solar System with known biases, observed eight trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU with orbits oriented on a wide range of directions. After accounting for the known observational biases of the survey, no evidence for the arguments of perihelion (ω) clustering identified by Trujillo and Sheppard was seen and the orientation of the orbits of the objects with the largest semi-major axis was statistically consistent with random. A previously released paper by Mike Brown analyzed the discovery locations of eccentric trans-Neptunian objects. While identifying some biases he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> with these biases the clustering of longitudes of perihelion of the known objects would be observed only 1.2% of the time if their actual distribution was uniform.|$|E
5|$|While Mackay's account {{held that}} {{a wide array of}} society was {{involved}} in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases {{it is not clear that}} tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not changed hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.|$|E
25|$|Studies have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> serious sunburns {{could not}} affect sweat gland {{function}} and thermoregulation. There are no data or studies that support that sunburn can cause damage so serious {{that can affect}} reproductive success.|$|E
50|$|A {{study on}} Discovery News <b>found</b> <b>that</b> elephants, during an {{intelligence}} test employing food rewards, had <b>found</b> shortcuts <b>that</b> not <b>even</b> the experiment's researchers had thought of.|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} to the cave was soon covered, and the boys tied their team to a tree in that vicinity. They went inside and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> everything, <b>even</b> to the empty boxes, had been taken away. The place had been explored {{by a number of}} curiosity seekers.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Rover {{could not}} be <b>found</b> until <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> when the party {{came back from the}} visit to the flower gardens. He listened with deep {{interest}} to what was said, and then went off on a hunt for Sid Merrick and the tramp steamer Josephine without delay.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the first}} studies on the cation-π {{interaction}} involved looking at the interactions of charged, nitrogenous molecules in cyclophane host-guest chemistry. It was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> when anionic solubilizing groups were appended to aromatic host capsules, cationic guests preferred to associate with the π-system in many cases. The type of host shown to the right was also able to catalyze N-alkylation reactions to form cationic products.|$|E
25|$|Twin {{studies have}} {{estimated}} that approximately 20-30% {{the variation in}} human lifespan {{can be related to}} genetics, with the rest due to individual behaviors and environmental factors which can be modified. Although over 200 gene variants have been associated with longevity according to a US-Belgian-UK research database of human genetic variants, these explain {{only a small fraction of}} the heritability. A 2012 study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> modest amounts of leisure time physical exercise can extend life expectancy by as much as 4.5 years.|$|E
25|$|Childhood {{inactivity}} {{is linked}} to obesity in the United States with more children being overweight at younger ages. In a 2009 preschool study 89% of a preschoolers' day {{was found to be}} sedentary while the same study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> when outside, 56 percent of activities were still sedentary. One factor believed to contribute to the lack of activity found was little teacher motivation, but when toys, such as balls were made available, the children were more likely to play.|$|E
50|$|By 1844 Tawell {{was having}} severe {{financial}} problems. He bought {{two bottles of}} Scheele's prussic acid, a treatment for varicose veins containing hydrogen cyanide, and on 1 January 1845 travelled to Salt Hill, where he poisoned Sarah while sharing a beer in her cottage. She was <b>found</b> later <b>that</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|R
50|$|On April 26, 2004, eight-year-old Amy Yates {{went missing}} while riding her bike around her trailer park in Carrollton, Georgia. Her body was <b>found</b> later <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> {{at the bottom}} of a nearby hill, and the heavy {{bruising}} on her chest and neck areas indicated that she had been strangled to death.|$|R
40|$|Most on-road {{assessments}} do {{not make}} use of standardized scoring to determine driver safety. The current study sought to find a subset of driving errors that were related to on-road Pass and Fail outcomes {{in a group of}} 60 older drivers with cognitive impairment, and that were also considered important contributors to a Fail outcome by the driving specialist occupational therapist who administered the assessment. A number of useful errors were <b>found</b> <b>that</b> suggest <b>that</b> <b>even</b> a non-standardized driving assessment could incorporate a short list of driving errors that may assist in the determination of driving ability...|$|R
25|$|A study {{published}} by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more {{support to the}} idea that dinosaurs were endothermic. After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, the crocodiles' ectothermic metabolisms provided less endurance and only 14% of the muscle power of a similar sized mammal. Seymour reasoned that dinosaurs would have needed to be endothermic since they would have needed powerful muscles and endurance to compete with and dominate mammals throughout the Mesozoic era.|$|E
25|$|Tatangelo {{was also}} {{committed}} to cutting county spending and lowering property tax rates, issues that attracted Republican support. Homeowners, however, <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> when the county cut the {{ad valorem tax}} rates, their property taxes continued to climb because the Webb County Appraisal District in Laredo routinely increases the valuation of their properties on an annual basis. The district points out that state law requires the higher evaluations each year. Then {{it is up to}} the taxing bodies to set the actual tax rates per $100 assessed value.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{adopted a}} plan in 2009 {{with the goal of}} turning the country into {{one of the leaders of}} all-electric and hybrid vehicles by 2012. The government's intention was to create a world-leading industry that would produce jobs and exports, and to reduce urban pollution and its oil dependence. However, a study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though local air pollution would be reduced by replacing a gasoline car with a similar-size electric car, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by only 19%, as China uses coal for 75% of its electricity production.|$|E

60|$|It was, however, thirty {{hours before}} they reached the {{opposite}} shore--Godfrey accounting for the difference on the supposition that the stream {{must have been a}} good deal stronger than they expected, and must have drifted them down a long way.

5000|$|Lewisburg {{was founded}} in 1785 by Ludwig Derr. A settler of the area (since as early as 1763-1769), Derr had {{purchased}} several tracts of land from the William Penn family and other neighboring land owners, the largest of which was known as [...] "The Prescott". Having been on the land {{for such a long}} time, Derr had befriended the local Native Americans of the area. His relationship with these indigenous peoples was so well <b>founded</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> as many of the other local settlers' homesteads we routinely were sacked by Native Americans, Derr's lands remained free from attacks. Subsequently, in 1784, he worked with Samuel Weiser to lay out his combined land tracts, and create Derrstown. The name was later changed to Lewisburgh when Union County was separated from Snyder County.|$|R
