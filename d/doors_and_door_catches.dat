40|$|Today, the {{requirements}} on <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>door</b> sections in buildings are often many and tightly restricted. Especially in public buildings, {{the requirements}} for safety and functionality must cover the needs of larger groups of people. These strict requirements have often led to <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>door</b> sections in public buildings being very complex and difficult to correctly install without any complications. This diploma work {{has been carried out}} in cooperation with Werket Architects, which estimates a high percentage of flaws regarding aforementioned components, in projects of the type described. The company therefore wanted to investigate how they could develop their remit in door production, which is the projection and design of blueprints. By taking part of installers opinions on how they want the blueprints of <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>door</b> - sections to be designed for the best installation possibilities, develop¬ment areas, and to some extent improvements regarding the company's use of accounting techniques, could be provided to the company. The study shows, among other things, that there is a possibility of development in the functional descriptions that entail the doors' fitting components. The technique that Werket Architects uses to present these components does not allow the detailed description of functions that is often required. Furthermore a part of the study shows that the problems regarding <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>door</b> sections usually are based on more than simply how the architects choose to present their blueprints. It instead shows that the lack of knowledge in key parts, such as locks and alarms, at architectural firms also greatly contributes to the insufficient end results...|$|R
