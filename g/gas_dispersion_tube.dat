ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Currently {{the three}} main algae strains that are {{manufactured}} commercially are Chlorella, Spirulina and Dunaliela salina, which are produced for biomass and bioproducts. Photobioreactors (PBR) allow the exploitation of over 50 000 known microalgae species with over 15 000 novel compounds having been chemically identified to date. Many of these algae could be sources of high-value products which are produced using a method that delivers them from renewable resources. Designing an optimal photobioreactor is a complex process because a large array of variables {{is included in the}} design, with several of the variables interacting with each other directly. The interactions of most of these variables have not been established. The initial information that is available is inadequate because most photobioreactors have been tested on a laboratory scale and the information given does not include the manufacturing materials, the size of tubing used and other design variables. Before designing a photobioreactor, {{it is important to understand}} the best conditions for the production of algae because these have a direct influence on the requirements. In order to produce algae biomass under the specific conditions, one has to investigate current photobioreactors that have been designed in order to establish whether they are capable of optimum production under the production conditions; determine possible factors that could influence the production negatively and how they could be prevented; and undertake a cost analysis to determine whether the production of algae is an economically viable process using the specific reactor. All of these criteria have to be met for a photobioreactor to be viable in the production of algae biomass. Currently a Bubble column reactor is considered to be the best design for a photobioreactor and also the most scalable. Due to the limited information available, testing was conducted to determine the effect of: 1) different manufacturing materials, 2) the gas dispersion unit, 3) the diameters of the tubing and 4) the density. Bubble column reactors were used to test the effects of the four variables and were considered to be the most important aspects in the design. For testing these variables and their interaction, Chlorella Vulgaris was used because it is one of the most popular algae species used for production currently. As temperature and the availability of light play a large role in the production of algae, all testing was done in a laboratory environment to ensure small temperature changes and the constant availability of light. The reactors that were tested were made of PVC couplings, with the clear tubing used being made of either PVC or acrylic tubing. Enriched air was supplied at a 5 % volume per volume ratio of CO 2, with a flow rate of 0. 02 volume per volume per minute (vvm) for the 50 mm diameter reactors and 0. 36 vvm for the 90 and 110 mm diameter reactors. Two gas dispersion units were used to determine whether they would have any effect on the production. The gas dispersion units create small bubbles to ensure a high surface area to volume ratio and thereby they allow for maximum CO 2 and O 2 mass transfer. A growth rate of 0. 14 gram per litre per day was found to yield the best production of all the reactors and configurations that were tested. The 50 mm diameter reactors showed the best growth followed by the 110 mm diameter reactors. The 90 mm diameter reactors all had a negative growth rate which appeared to be due to an insufficient gas flow rate. The 50 mm reactors had the best growth rate of 0. 14 and 0. 10 grams per litre per day for the acrylic tubing, while 0. 08 grams per litre per day was achieved with PVC tubing. The 110 mm reactors had a highest growth rate of 0. 05 grams per litre per day with PVC tubing. It was found that the 50 mm and 90 mm reactors showed a better performance with acrylic tubing while the 110 mm reactors showed a better performance with PVC tubing. The gas dispersion unit is affected by the gas flow rate, the density, the diameter of the tubing and the material that is used. The gas dispersion units’ effect is dependent on the diameter of the reactor seeing that the 50 mm reactor shows better performance with the small unit, while the 110 mm reactor shows better performance with the large unit, due to the gas flow rate that is required in the reactors. Because the gas flow rate and gas dispersion unit directly affect the agitation, the optimal density is affected directly due to the availability of light and therefore the tubing material. The gas dispersion units should fit properly into the reactor and be capable of handling the gas flow rate that is required. The diameter of the tubing does not show any effect but could have an effect under different testing conditions and could not be conclusively eliminated. The density of algae does have an effect, although most reactors showed a better production rate at a higher culture density. The scale up of the bubble column reactor creates a dead zone when a module is constructed. The scale up of a bubble column reactor could range from increasing the vertical tubing length, increasing the diameter of the tubing to adding vertical tubing to a module. The dead zone is formed at the bottom of the reactor where the module interconnects the vertical growth tubes, because these fittings are not constructed from a clear material, due to cost of such a construction. The dead zone that is created causes a large portion of algae to form a sediment, which directly affects the production of the system because it is in a dark zone of the reactor. Improved results would be obtained if the algae were kept at a homogeneous density that would ensure maximum expose to light. The ratio of gas flow rate to reactor volume and diameter of the tubing was found to be crucial. It is suspected that the 90 mm tubing reactor had a negative growth rate as this ratio was not correct. The 50 mm reactors had to be run at a much lower reactor volume per volume gas flow rate which could consist of air, carbon dioxide enriched air or other gases as required. The inclusion of the tubing diameter in the ratio is of vital importance and should be studied further. A cost analysis shows that the bubble column reactors under the tested conditions are not financially viable. A large component of the cost is carbon dioxide and medium, which is a composition of nutrients. This could be removed if a free source were obtained, which would make the system financially viable. These sources could include waste water and flue gas from industrial processes. It is recommended that a <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>tube</b> be positioned at the bottom of the reactor to ensure that no sedimentation occurs and that there is a homogeneous culture, and to maximise the production capabilities of a bubble column reactor. It is also recommended that the gas flow rate inside the reactor be studied to obtain a ratio where the volume of the reactor, the height of the reactor and the diameter of the tubing are included to obtain a sufficient rate of flow. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Tans is daar drie belangrike alg stamme wat kommersieel geproduseer word, Chlorella, Spirulina en Dunaliela salina. Fotobioreaktors het meegebring dat meer as 50 000 bekende alg spesies met meer as 15 000 komponente tot op datum chemies geïdentifiseer is. Baie van hierdie alge kan hoë waarde produkte wees, wat met behulp van hernubare metodes geproduseer kan word. Die ontwerp van 'n optimale fotobioreaktor is 'n komplekse proses aangesien 'n groot verskeidenheid veranderlikes ingesluit moet word wat ‘n invloed op mekaar kan hê. Die interaksie van meeste van hierdie veranderlikes is nog nie vasgestel nie. Die inligting oor hierdie onderwerp is beperk aangesien die meeste fotobioreaktors in 'n laboratorium getoets is en dus nie die vervaardigingsmateriale, die grootte van buise en ander ontwerp veranderlikes insluit nie. Voordat 'n fotobioreaktor ontwerp kan word, moet die ideale alg produksie toestande verstaan word, aangesien dit 'n direkte impak op die produksie vereistes kan hê. Om alg biomassa onder spesifieke omstandighede te produseer, moet die bestaande fotobioreaktor ontwerpe ondersoek word. Daar moet vasgestel word of die bepaalde ontwerp oor die kapasiteit beskik om optimale produksie te lewer; identifisering van faktore wat produksie negatief kan beïnvloed en hoe dit voorkom kan word; en 'n koste ontleding moet gedoen word om te bereken of die produksie van alge met die geidentifiseerde ontwerp 'n ekonomies lewensvatbare proses is. Daar moet aan al die vereistes voldoen word om te bepaal of 'n fotobioreaktor lewensvatbaar is vir die produksie van alg biomassa. 'n Borrel-kolom reaktor ontwerp word tans as die beste ontwerp vir 'n fotobioreaktor geag, asook die mees aanpasbare ontwerp. As gevolg van die beperkte inligting wat beskikbaar is, is navorsing gedoen om die invloed van verskillende faktore te bepaal, naamlik: vervaardigingsmateriaal, gasverspreidingseenheid, buisdeursnee en digtheid. Borrel-kolom reaktors is gebruik om die vier belangrikste veranderlikes in die ontwerp te toets. Om die veranderlikes en hul interaksie te toets, is Chlorella vulgaris gebruik, aangesien dit een van die gewildste alg spesies is vir die produksie van biomassa. As gevolg van die belangrike rol wat temperatuur en lig beskikbaarheid in die produksie van alge speel, is al die toetse in 'n laboratorium-omgewing gedoen om temperatuur wisseling te beperk en konstante lig beskikbaarheid te verseker. Die reaktors wat getoets is, is vervaardig uit PVC koppelstukke, met die deurskynende buise wat uit PVC of akriel vervaardig is. Verrykte lug is verskaf op 'n 5 % volume per volume verhouding CO 2, met 'n vloei tempo van 0, 02 volume per volume per minuut (vvm) vir die 50 mm deursnee reaktors en 0, 36 vvm vir die 90 mm en 110 mm reaktors. Twee gasverspreidingseenhede is gebruik om hulle invloed op die produksie te bepaal. Die gasverspreidingseenhede skep kleiner borrels, om 'n hoë oppervlak area tot volume verhouding te skep en daardeur 'n maksimum CO 2 en O 2 massa-oordrag te verseker. 'n Groeikoers van 0, 14 gram per liter per dag is gevind as die beste produksie van al die reaktors en konfigurasies wat getoets is. Die 50 mm deursnee reaktors het die beste groei getoon, gevolg deur die 110 mm deursnee reaktors. Die 90 mm deursnee reaktors het 'n negatiewe groeikoers getoon, wat moontlik toegeskryf kan word aan onvoldoende gas vloei tempo. Die 50 mm reaktors het die beste groeikoers van 0, 14 en 0, 10 gram per liter per dag vir die akriel buise getoon, terwyl ‘n 0, 08 gram per liter per dag behaal is met 'n PVC buis. Die 110 mm reaktors het die hoogste groeikoers aangedui van 0, 05 gram per liter per dag met 'n PVC buis. Daar is bevind dat die 50 mm en 90 mm reaktors 'n beter prestasie met akriel buise gehad het, terwyl die 110 mm reaktors 'n beter prestasie met 'n PVC buis gehad het. Die gasverspreidingseenheid word beinvloed deur die gas vloei tempo, digtheid, buisdeursnee en die vervaardigingsmateriaal wat gebruik word. Die gasverspreidingseenhede word verder beinvloed deur die reaktor se buisdeursnee aangesien die 50 mm reaktor ‘n beter prestasie getoon het met die kleiner gas eenheid, terwyl die 110 mm reaktor ‘n beter prestasie getoon het met die groter gas eenheid, as gevolg van die gas vloei tempo wat vereis is. Die gas vloei tempo en gasverspreidingseenheid het ‘n direkte invloed op die groei van die kultuur, dus is die optimale digtheid afhanklik van die lig beskikbaarheid en dus die vervaardigingsmateriaal van die buise. Die gasverspreidingseenhede moet stewig in die reaktor pas en in staat wees om die gas vloei tempo wat vereis word te kan hanteer. Hoewel die deursnee van die buise nie 'n invloed getoon nie, kan dit 'n invloed onder verskillende toets omstandighede toon en kon nie finaal uitgeskakel word. Die digtheid van die alge het wel 'n effek, hoewel die meeste reaktors ‘n beter produksie tempo op 'n hoër kultuur digtheid toon. Die groter skaal borrel-kolom reaktor ontwikkel 'n dooie sone indien ‘n module saamgestel word. Die groter skaal borrel-kolom reaktor kan insluit: die verhoging van die vertikale buis lengte, 'n toename in deursnee van die buise en toevoeging van vertikale buise in die module. Die dooie sone het gevorm aan die onderkant van die reaktor waar die module se vertikale groei buise met mekaar verbind is. Hierdie area is uit nie-deurskynende materiaal vervaardig as gevolg van die konstruksie koste. Die dooie sone het veroorsaak dat groot hoeveelhede van die alge ‘n sediment gevorm het en ‘n direkte invloed op die produksie van die stelsel gehad het aangesien dit 'n donker sone in die reaktor gevorm het. Beter resultate kan verwag word indien die alge op 'n homogeniese digtheid gehou kan word om maksimum lig blootstelling te verseker. Daar is bevind dat die verhouding van gas vloei tempo tot reaktor volume en buisdeursnee deurslaggewend is. Die negatiewe groeikoers in die 90 mm reaktor word toegeskryf daaraan dat hierdie verhouding nie korrek was nie. Die 50 mm reaktors het op 'n laer reaktor volume per volume gas vloei tempo gefunksioneer wat kan bestaan uit die lug, verrykte lug of ander gasse soos benodig. Dit dui daarop dat die insluiting van die buis deursnee in hierdie verhouding van kardinale belang is en verder bestudeer moet word. 'n Koste ontleding toon dat die borrel-kolom reaktors onder hierdie getoets omstandighede nie finansieel lewensvatbaar is nie. 'n Groot deel van die koste is die medium, wat 'n samestelling van voedingstowwe is, en koolstofdioksied koste. Om finansieel lewensvatbaar te raak, moet hierdie kostes deur 'n gratis bron vervang word. Die bronne kan bestaan uit afval water en oortolige CO 2 uit industrie. Daar word aanbeveel dat 'n gasverspreidingsbuisie aan die onderkant van die reaktor geplaas word. Dit sal verseker dat geen sediment vorm nie en 'n homogeniese kultuur gehandhaaf kan word om maksimum produksie in 'n borrel-kolom reaktor te handhaaf. Verder word aanbeveel dat die gas vloei tempo binne die reaktor verder bestudeer word om 'n verhouding tussen die volume van die reaktor, die hoogte van die reaktor en die deursnee van die buise te bepaal deur sodoende 'n voldoende tempo van vloei te verkry...|$|E
40|$|The {{alarming}} {{rate at which}} atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are increasing due to the {{burning of fossil fuels}} will have incalculable consequences if disregarded. Fuel cells, a source of energy that does not add to carbon dioxide emissions, have become an important topic of study. Although signifi cant advances have been made related to fuel cells, the problem of cheap and renewable hydrogen production still remains. The cyanobacterium Plectonema boryanum has demonstrated potential as a resolution to this problem by producing hydrogen under nitrogen defi cient growing conditions. Plectonema boryanum cultures were tested in a series of experiments {{to determine the effects of}} light intensity, initial nitrate concentration, and photosystem II inhibitor DCMU (3 -(3, 4 - dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea) upon hydrogen production. Cultures were grown in sterile Chu. No. 10 medium within photobioreactors constantly illuminated by halogen lights. Because the enzyme responsible for hydrogen production is sensitive to oxygen, the medium was continuously sparged with argon/CO 2 (99. 7 %/ 0. 3 % vol/vol) by <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> <b>tubes</b> immersed in the culture. Hydrogen production was monitored by using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. In the initial experiment, the effects of initial nitrate concentration were tested and results revealed cumulative hydrogen production was maximum at an initial nitrate concentration of 1 mM. A second experiment was then conducted at an initial nitrate concentration of 1 mM to determine the effects of light intensity at 50, 100, and 200 μmole m- 2 s- 1. Cumulative hydrogen production increased with increasing light intensity. A fi nal experiment, conducted at an initial nitrate concentration of 2 mM, tested the effects of high light intensity at 200 and 400 μmole m- 2 s- 1. Excessive light at 400 μmole m- 2 s- 1 decreased cumulative hydrogen production. Based upon all experiments, cumulative hydrogen production rates were optimal at an initial nitrate concentration of 1 mM and a light intensity of 100 μmole m- 2 s- 1. DCMU was shown in all experiments to severely decrease hydrogen production as time progressed. With the information acquired so far, future experiments with reducing substances could determine maximum rates of hydrogen production. If maximum hydrogen production rates proved to be large enough, Plectonema boryanum could be grown on an industrial scale to provide hydrogen gas as a renewable fuel...|$|R

40|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{characteristics}} in mechanical flotation cells {{have a significant}} effect on the overall flotation performance. Three major properties that can be measured in characterising the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in a flotation cell are bubble size, gas hold-up, and superficial gas velocity. Another property that is equally important in flotation is bubble surface area flux which is calculated from bubble size and superficial gas velocity. Despite the importance of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in flotation, not much work has been reported previously in this area. Moreover, the study of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in flotation has typically considered only a few points in a flotation cell and the average values were assumed to represent the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{characteristics in}} the entire volume of the cell. It is known however, that the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics are not uniformly distributed in a mechanical flotation cell. This thesis seeks to understand better the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in mechanical flotation cells with a view to optimisation, modelling, cell comparison and selection. The main aim of this thesis was to measure comprehensively the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in a mechanical flotation cell, analyse the behaviour in the entire volume of the cell, and develop a methodology for modelling the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in the whole volume of the cell as well as develop the models themselves. For this purpose, a fully instrumented 3 m³ glass rectangular flotation cell at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland was used. The cell was fitted with a Dorr-Oliver impeller-stator mechanism and was provided with facilities to change impeller speed and gas flow rate. Sensors to measure the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics were also acquired and modified. This cell could only be operated in a two-phase (air-water) system but the opportunity was taken to make some comparative measurements in an operating plant in a three-phase slurry to compare the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in two and three-phase systems. The comprehensive measurements of the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics (i. e. bubble size, gas hold-up, and superficial gas velocity, with subsequent calculation of bubble surface area flux) throughout the entire volume of the 3 m³ rectangular flotation cell show that the properties do vary with distance from the impeller, the cell bottom, and the walls. Statistical analysis to test the homogeneity of the properties in the cell confirmed that the differences (variation with distance) were real. It was found that the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> was poor in the corners of a rectangular flotation cell. These corners are referred to as dead zones. It can be interpreted that in these zones, flotation is less effective compared to other zones in a cell. The results of mapping the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics throughout the entire volume of the flotation cell were used to determine the best location to measure <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in a flotation cell in order to represent the overall values. It was established that this location in a flotation cell is about halfway between the impeller and the wall, and halfway between the bottom of the flotation cell and the pulp-froth interface. Statistical analysis also showed that there is quarter symmetry, i. e. there is no significant difference between equivalent positions in different quarters in a horizontal plane. In any future work, therefore, measurements of the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics need only be made in one quarter, and symmetry in the rest of the cell can be assumed. Following from the statistical analysis that established quarter symmetry in the 3 m³ glass rectangular flotation cell, a methodology to model <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in the entire volume of a rectangular mechanical flotation cell was developed, based on an experimental design known as CCRD (central composite rotatable design) which then modified. Using the methodology, models to predict bubble size, gas hold-up, superficial gas velocity and bubble surface area flux in the entire volume of a rectangular flotation cell were developed as a function of air flow rate and impeller speed. The validity of the models was tested using a predictive (cross) validation method, from where it was concluded that the models were valid. These models were then used to analyse the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in detail in the flotation cell, as a function of flow rate, impeller speed, and location in the cell. Finally, a comparison of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics in two and three-phase systems in flotation cells was made. Comprehensive measurements of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> characteristics were performed in a three-phase slurry in an industrial OK 38 m³ rectangular flotation cell at the PT Freeport Indonesia concentrator, and the results were compared to those measured previously in the two-phase system in the 3 m³ rectangular cell. It was found that the profiles of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> were generally similar in both cells but the magnitude of the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> properties differed between the two systems. The presence of solid particles had greater effect on the bubble size than on gas hold-up and superficial gas velocity...|$|R

Then, the solid suspension and <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> performance in this optimized bioreactor are systematically studied. It is found that a smaller sparger (D-s/T = 0. 32) achieves better performance in <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion.</b> A pitched-blade disc turbine down-pumping (PDTD) as a bottom impeller achieves the lowest N-jsg value, and has lower N-f value compared with PBTD (pitched blade turbine down-pumping) and TBHA (three-bladed helical agitator).

40|$|The {{flotation}} {{process is}} designed to collect hydrophobic particles by attachment on to bubbles dispersed in slurry. The effectiveness of the flotation process depends on {{the properties of the}} bubble dispersion. For example, the ability of a machine to form small bubbles at a given flow rate of air will control the quantity of surface area available for bubble-particle collision. The <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion,</b> defined {{for the purposes of this}} thesis as bubbles suspended in slurry, is quantified by a group of "so-called" <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> parameters including: superficial gas velocity (gas rate, Jg), gas holdup (epsilong), bubble size (Db) and bubble surface area flux (Sb). Cell characterization is a commonly used term in the study of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> parameters referring to any test designed specifically to increase understanding of the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> inside a particular machine, including how the dispersion can be manipulated by adjusting the operating variables and how the dispersion parameters vary with location inside a machine. Industrial tests were done to study mechanisms of manipulating the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in forced air and self-aerated mechanical flotation machines, demonstrating that gas rate can be used to manipulate the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in forced air machines, while froth depth, impeller speed and impeller submergence can be used to manipulate the dispersion in self-aerated machines.

Based on industrial tests, recommendations regarding sample point selection for down-the-bank optimization are offered.

40|$|Foams {{represent}} an important {{area of research}} due to their relevance in many industrial processes. Where there are geographical constraints, which can limit access to fresh water, there is an economic incentive in using recycled water, bore water and even seawater for industrial purposes. This creates a growing interest in determining the effect of inorganic electrolytes on foaming and <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> properties of non-ionic surfactant solutions. The present study compares the foaming and <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> properties of the non-ionic surfactants 1 -pentanol, tri(propylene glycol) methyl ether, and poly(propylene glycol) 425. For all surfactants, the stabilisation mechanism {{was influenced by the}} concentration of surfactant and the presence of salt with PPG being affected to a lesser extent. Sodium chloride was observed to have a detrimental effect on foaming at higher surfactant concentrations but improved foaming at low surfactant concentrations. At low surfactant concentrations, the addition of salt improved foaminess by dampening the hydrophobic force. An increase in gas holdup with increasing surfactant concentration was observed and was attributed to a decrease in bubble size. For poly(propylene glycol) an initial decrease in gas holdup was observed at very low concentrations. Salt mainly affected <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> properties at a higher concentration...|$|R

The present study is aimed at the Consequence Analysis, which {{was an integral part}} in the QRA for the transportation of ammonia by rail from Gurun to Port Klang. The software package SAFETI has been used to model the resulting behavior of the released ammonia and the extent of the damage expressed in terms of distance to certain effect levels. Besides, sensitivity analysis was also carried out to identify the impacts of atmospheric conditions on ammonia <b>gas</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The results indicated an increase in the ammonia <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> distances for releases at higher atmospheric temperatures of lower atmospheric humidity (e. g. for rupture case with wind speed 3 m/s, at 15 oC, the dispersion distance was 835. 4 m, while at 35 oC, it increases to 866. 2 m). However, further analysis of the effects atmospheric humidity on the ammonia <b>gas</b> <b>dispersions</b> was required to determine the differences in the trend for the 25 mm and 100 mm leak cases compared to the rupture case...|$|R

40|$|In a stirred vessel {{with the}} aspect ratio of 2. 4, the gas-liquid mass {{transfer}} characteristics of triple-impeller configurations with surface aeration have been studied. The way by adding {{one or more}} impellers below the aerating impeller could not overcome the problem of poor <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the region close {{to the bottom of}} the gas-liquid vessel stirred only by a surface aerator. With the combination of surface aeration and sparger aeration, <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> is greatly improved. Triple-inipeller configurations and volumetric gas flow rates are optimized based on the volumetric mass transfer coefficient per power consumption. It is found that the sparging gas has only a little effect on the surface aeration, because the vessel is stirred by the triple-impeller configuration and with a larger aspect ratio...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{most popular}} method of {{aluminium}} refining is blowing of refining gas through the liquid metal. The way the refining gas is {{introduced to the}} liquid metal significantly influences the time and course of degassing process. Rotary impellers {{seem to be the}} best solution, especially taking into account reaching good level of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the liquid aluminium. However, the construction of impellers also influences the obtained <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in liquid metal, especially considering the processing parameters such as flow rate of refining gas and rotary impeller speed. Design/methodology/approach: To observe the phenomena occurring during the aluminium refining process physical modelling was applied. Test stand for such modelling was built at 1 : 1 scale with the transparent tank to observe the level of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the liquid. The built model has to fulfill the rules coming from the theory of similarity. Findings: The choice of optimal parameters is very important to the particular type of impeller. As a result of research the processing parameters were chosen to the appropriate type of <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The most desirable type of dispersion is an uniform dispersion. According to the research the best impeller seems to be impeller No 1. Research limitations/implications: There are differences between results coming from modelling research and industrial test. So, the further research should be conducted with a chosen impeller in industrial conditions. Practical implications: From industrial point of view it is important to test the impeller construction and their geometry in laboratory before industrial test. It gives some ideas how the particular impeller will behave in industry. To control the process of aluminium refining and conducting it optimally it is really important to know its mechanism better. Originality/value: This paper presents original modelling research of aluminium refining process conducted in URO- 200 reacto...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} dense <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> at {{atmospheric}} conditions {{is critical to}} understand the safety concerns of industrial operations where large amounts of toxic or flammable materials are stored and generated. A large airborne release of these materials into the atmosphere could have catastrophic effects. The Chemical Hazards Research Center (CHRC) at the University of Arkansas performs important research on dense <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The CHRC houses the world’s largest ultra-low speed wind tunnel, {{which is used to}} simulate dispersion at atmospheric conditions. Substantial amounts of data, including velocities, are recorded for modeling real life <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> events. Before conducting experiments, an accurate characterization of air flow within the wind tunnel, especially at the lower boundary layer, must be established. The goal of this project was to upgrade the existing two-component LDV system to a three-component system and use the system to characterize the vertical velocity profile of the wind tunnel. The major phases of the project included the physical installation of the LDV system, alignment of the laser probes within the tunnel, and characterization velocity measurements. Once the system was properly installed, the vertical velocity profile of the wind tunnel was determined as part of the characterization process. The air velocity decreased for measurements closer to the wind tunnel floor, which agreed with the previous experimental data from the CHRC’s wind tunnel and other ultra-low speed wind tunnels...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of nearby early-type galaxies contain detectable amounts of emission-line gas at their centers. The nuclear gas kinematics form a valuable diagnostic {{of the central}} black hole (BH) mass. Here we analyze and model Hubble Space Telescope STIS observations of a sample of 27 galaxies; 16 Fanaroff-Riley Type I radio galaxies and 11 (more) normal early-type galaxies. We focus here on what {{can be learned from}} the nuclear velocity dispersion (line width) of the gas as a complement to the many studies dealing with gas rotation velocities. We find that the dispersion in a STIS aperture of similar to 0. " 1 - 0 B 2 generally exceeds the large-scale stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy. This is qualitatively consistent with the presence of central BHs but raises the questions of whether the excess <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion</b> is of gravitational or nongravitational origin and whether the implied BH masses are consistent with our current understanding of BH demography (as predicted by the M-sigma relation between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion). To address this we construct purely gravitational axisymmetric dynamical models for the gas, both thin-disk models and models with more general axis ratios and velocity anisotropies. For the normal galaxies the nuclear <b>gas</b> <b>dispersions</b> are adequately reproduced assuming disks around the BHs with masses that follow the M-sigma relation. In contrast, the <b>gas</b> <b>dispersions</b> observed for the radio galaxies generally exceed those predicted by any of the models. We attribute this to the presence of nongravitational motions in the gas that are similar to or larger than the gravitational motions. The nongravitational motions are presumably driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN), but we do not find a relation between the radiative output of the AGN and the nongravitational dispersion. Given the uncertainties about the dynamical state of the gas, {{it is not possible to}} uniquely determine the BH mass for each galaxy from its nuclear <b>gas</b> <b>dispersion.</b> However, for the sample as a whole the observed dispersions do not provide evidence for significant deviations from the M-sigma relation...|$|R
