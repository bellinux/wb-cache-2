5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is {{the national}} bird of Sweden, which has a breeding population of 1–2 million pairs, and was featured on a 30öre Christmas postage stamp in 1970; it has also featured {{on a number of}} other stamps issued by European and Asian countries, including a 1966 4d British stamp and an 1998 Irish 30p stamp. This bird—arguably—also gives rise to the Serbian name for Kosovo, which is the possessive adjectival form of Serbian kos ("blackbird") as in <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> ("Blackbird Field").|$|E
25|$|As {{animosity}} between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo deepened {{during the}} 1980s, Milošević {{was sent to}} address a crowd of Serbs in <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> on 24 April 1987. While Milošević {{was talking to the}} leadership inside the local cultural hall, demonstrators outside clashed with the local Kosovo-Albanian police force.|$|E
25|$|The Tomb of Sultan Murad, {{a site in}} <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> where Murad I's {{internal}} organs were buried, has gained a religious significance for the local Muslims. A monument was built by Murad I's son Bayezid I at the tomb, becoming the first example of Ottoman architecture in the Kosovo territory.|$|E
25|$|The Ottomans faced little {{resistance}} from these divided and weak Bulgarian states. In 1362 they captured Philippopolis (Plovdiv), and in 1382 they took Sofia. The Ottomans then turned their attentions to the Serbs, whom they routed at <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> in 1389. In 1393 the Ottomans occupied Tarnovo after a three-month siege. In 1396 the Tsardom of Vidin was also invaded, bringing the Second Bulgarian Empire and Bulgarian independence to an end.|$|E
25|$|With Turkish invaders {{beginning}} their {{conquest of}} the Balkans in the 1350s, a major conflict ensued {{between them and the}} Serbs, the first major battle was the Battle of Maritsa (1371), in which the Serbs were defeated. With the death of two important Serb leaders in the battle, and with the death of Stephen Uroš that same year, the Serbian Empire broke up into several small Serbian domains. These states were ruled by feudal lords, with Zeta controlled by the Balšić family, Raška, Kosovo and northern Macedonia held by the Branković family and Lazar Hrebeljanović holding today's Central Serbia and a portion of Kosovo. Hrebeljanović was subsequently accepted as the titular leader of the Serbs because he was married to a member of the Nemanjić dynasty. In 1389, the Serbs faced the Ottomans at the Battle of Kosovo on the plain of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje,</b> near the town of Pristina. Both Lazar and Sultan Murad I were killed in the fighting. The battle most likely ended in a stalemate, and Serbia did not fall to the Turks until 1459.|$|E
25|$|Within {{a year of}} Tito's {{death the}} first cracks began to show when {{in the spring of}} 1981 when on 11 March, 26 March, and 31 March to 2 April an {{escalating}} series of increasingly large protests spread from the campus of the University of Pristina to the streets of several cities in Kosovo demanding the upgrading of the Autonomous Region to the status of full Republic – these protests were violently suppressed by the Police with many deaths, and a state of emergency was declared. Serbian concerns about the treatment of Serb minorities in other republics and particularly in Kosovo were exacerbated by the SANU Memorandum, drawn up by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and published in Sep 1986 byVečernje novosti, which claimed that Serbs were suffering a genocide {{at the hands of the}} Kosovo Albanian majority. Slobodan Milošević leader of the League of Communists of Serbia since May 1986, became the champion of the Serbian Nationalists when on 24 Apr 1987 he visited <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> and, after local Serbs had clashed with the Police declared, 'No one has the right to beat you'.|$|E
25|$|Hunyadi {{departed}} {{for the new}} campaign {{at the head of}} an army of 16,000 soldiers in September 1448. About 8,000 soldiers from Wallachia also joined his campaign. For Đurađ Branković refused to assist the crusaders, Hunyadi treated him as the Ottoman's ally and his army marched through Serbia plundering the countryside. In order to prevent the unification of the armies of Hunyadi and Skanderbeg, Sultan Murad II joined battle with Hunyadi on <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> on 17 October. The battle, which lasted for three days, ended with the crusaders' catastrophic defeat. Around 17,000 Hungarian and Wallachian soldiers were killed or captured and Hunyadi could hardly escape from the battlefield. On his way home, Hunyadi was captured by Đurađ Branković who kept him prisoner in the fort of Smederevo. The Despot was initially contemplating to surrender Hunyadi to the Ottomans. However, the Hungarian barons and prelates who assembled at Szeged persuaded him to make peace with Hunyadi. According to the treaty, Hunyadi was obliged to pay a ransom of 100,000 gold florins and to return all the domains that he had acquired from Đurađ Branković. Hunyadi's oldest son, Ladislaus was sent to the Despot as a hostage. Hunyadi was released, and he returned to Hungary in late December 1448.|$|E

As the only {{international}} train connection {{there is also the}} InterCity train pair (IC 891/892) from Pristina via <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> to Skopje and back. In direction of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje,</b> all trains stop at all stations; in the other direction the trains skip various stations, only the local train in the evening stops everywhere. The trains need close to one and a half hours for the trip from <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> to Elez Han.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> saw {{considerable}} violence before, {{during and}} after the Kosovo War. In December 1998, Serbian deputy mayor of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> Zvonko Bojanić was executed by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, despite taking a moderate line on Serb-Albanian relations. At the war's end in June 1999, most of the Albanian population returned while many of the town's Serbs were expelled. The remaining Serb population found themselves in an enclave in an Albanian-dominated region. Thousands of Serbs and Roma from other parts of Kosovo, who had fled their homes, took refuge in <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje,</b> where a large refugee camp was established. Ethnic tension flared repeatedly in the years after the war and a number of Serbs were killed by Albanian nationalists. Under this continuing pressure, the Serb population of <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> shrank steadily until, by July 2002, the newspaper Blic was reporting that only 550 Serbs remained in <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje.</b> The town was seriously affected by the March 2004 unrest in Kosovo, which saw almost all Serb inhabitants expelled and their homes burned down. A number are reported to have returned since then and {{at least some of the}} destroyed properties have been rebuilt by UNMIK.|$|E

50|$|Trainkos {{operates}} 430 km of railway in Kosovo, {{of which}} 333 km serve both {{freight and passenger}} and 97 km only serve freight traffic. The non-electrified network originally consisted of two lines crossing at Fushë Kosovë railway station in Kosovo Polje: A main line going from Kraljevo in western Serbia via Kosovska Mitrovica and <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> to Skopje in Macedonia, and a branch line in east-west direction from Niš in southern Serbia via Pristina railway station in the capital Pristina and <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> with one branch leading to Peć {{and the other one}} to Prizren. Of these lines, the one from Pristina to Peć and the one from <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> to Macedonia are still served by passenger trains. Some more parts of the network are occasionally served by freight trains, like <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> - Obilić; the other parts of the network are currently unused. For years, there have been plans to extend the branch to Prizren across the border to Albania, to create a link to the network of the Hekurudha Shqiptare. However, these projects are no more than letters of intent.|$|E

50|$|The {{peace was}} broken {{in the same}} year by Hunyadi and king Władysław during the Crusade of Varna, which culminated in the Battle of Varna. A crusading army led by Regent John Hunyadi of Hungary was {{defeated}} by Sultan Murad II's forces at <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> in 1448. Đurađ had informed the Sultan of Hunyadi's coming crusade. This was the last concerted attempt in the Middle Ages to expel the Ottomans from southeastern Europe. Although Hungary was able to successfully defy the Ottomans despite the defeat at <b>Kosovo</b> <b>Polje</b> during Hunyadi's lifetime, the kingdom fell to the Ottomans in the 16th century. Branković also captured Hunyadi at Smederevo for a short time when he was going home from Kosovo in 1448.|$|E
