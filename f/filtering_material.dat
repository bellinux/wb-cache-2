In-vessel composting can also refer to aerated static pile composting {{with the addition of}} removable covers that enclose the piles, as with the system in extensive use by farmer groups in Thailand, supported by the National Science and Technology Development Agency there. Offensive odors are caused by putrefaction (anaerobic decomposition) of nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter gassing off as ammonia. This is controlled with a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio, or increased aeration by ventilation, and use of a coarser grade of carbon material to allow better air circulation. Prevention and capture of any gases naturally occurring (volatile organic compounds) during the hot aerobic composting involved is the objective of the biofilter, and as the <b>filtering</b> <b>material</b> saturates over time, it can be used in the composting process and replaced with fresh material.|$|E

5000|$|Beta {{attenuation}} monitoring (BAM) is {{a widely}} used air monitoring technique employing the absorption of beta radiation by solid particles extracted from air flow. This technique allows {{for the detection of}} PM10 and PM2.5, which are monitored as standards by most air pollution regulatory agencies. The main principle is based on a kind of Bouguer (Lambert-Beer) law: the amount by which the flow of beta radiation (electrons) is attenuated by a solid matter is exponentially dependent on its mass and not on any other feature (such as density, chemical composition or some optical or electrical properties) of this matter. So, the air is drawn from outside of the detector through an [...] "infinite" [...] (cycling) ribbon made from some <b>filtering</b> <b>material</b> so that the particles are collected on it. There are two sources of beta radiation placed one before and one after the region where air flow passes through the ribbon leaving particles on it; and there are also two detectors {{on the opposite side of}} the ribbon, facing the detectors. The sources' intensity and detectors' sensitivity being the same (or corrected with appropriate calibration lookup table), the intensity of beta rays detected by one of detectors is compared to that of the other. Thus one can deduce how much mass has the ribbon acquired upon being exposed to air flow; knowing the drain velocity, actual particle mass concentration in air could be assessed.|$|E

40|$|The {{aluminum}} {{recycling plant}} Aluminium Hardenberg emits dioxins through a stack. Also, dioxin containing dust particles are emitted from <b>filtering</b> <b>material</b> {{removed from the}} flue gas, stored {{on the site of}} the plant. The concentrations and deposition of dioxins around the plant were calculated using emission data and a dispersion model. Furthermore, soil and wipe dust samples were taken in the surroundings. Except for the location nearest to the plant (at about 200 m) the measured concentrations in soil (1. 6 to 7. 6 ng WHO-TEQ/kg d. m.) did not significantly differ form the background value. The analyses of the wipe dust samples showed that the deposition was elevated up to 500 m in the surroundings, as a result of the emissions from the stored <b>filtering</b> <b>material.</b> The agreement between the congener patterns of the wipe dust samples and the <b>filtering</b> <b>material</b> confirms this conclusion. Also, the calculated concentrations of dioxins in air exceed the background value in rural areas, up to 500 m from the plant. The extra daily intake resulting from exposition to the emitted dioxins through oral intake and inhalation was estimated to be maximally 0, 4 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight.

The <b>filtering</b> <b>material</b> shows isotropic distributions of the SiC grains and the pores.
