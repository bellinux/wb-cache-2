40|$|This paper {{considers}} <b>image</b> <b>servers</b> {{that has}} to adjust image size and image quality {{to the needs and}} capabilities of the client applications. We compare two different approaches to solve this problem. (1) Transcoding of images and (2) storing multiple versions of each image in the database. We find that, while transcoding provides great flexibility and easy image management, response times and maximum throughput are very disappointing compared to storing multiple versions. In our experiments, the latter aproch demonstrates a performance that is about 25 times better than the performance of transcoding. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Geospatial or mapping has {{particular}} {{need for}} specialized [...] "image servers". Aerial and satellite images are georeferenced {{and can be}} {{hundreds or thousands of}} gigabytes in size. Traditional mechanisms for serving this data have proved inadequate. The first specialized <b>image</b> <b>server</b> for geospatial image data was Image Web Server, released in 1999. Image Web Server, among other protocols, supports ECWP (ERDAS Compressed Wavelet Protocol) that [...] "streams" [...] large images to a user's application, rather than sending a regular image over HTTP. The well known standard for a distributed architecture of geospatial data is Web Map Service.|$|E
50|$|Browser-based viewers {{for high}} {{resolution}} images enable a responsive pan and zoom experience by requesting small tiles (typically square JPEGs or PNGs at 256x256 or 512x512 pixels) {{generated from the}} high resolution source. Only those tiles required to render the user's current viewport and zoom level are loaded, with more requested on demand as the user zooms in to particular areas. This tile generation {{can be done in}} advance and stored on the server file system as an Image Pyramid. However, this results in potentially thousands of small JPEG files with associated storage and management overhead. An <b>Image</b> <b>server</b> can respond dynamically to HTTP requests for the tiles, generating HTTP responses (the tile images) on the fly. The server requires only the single high resolution source image.|$|E
50|$|Server GIS {{products}} provide GIS functionality {{and data}} deployed from a central environment. ArcGIS for Server is an Internet application service, used {{to extend the}} functionality of ArcGIS for Desktop software to a browser based environment. It is available on Solaris and Linux as well as Windows. ArcSDE (Spatial Database Engine) is used as an Relational database management system connector for other Esri software to store and retrieve GIS data within a commercially available database: currently, {{it can be used}} with Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, Informix and Microsoft SQL Server databases. It supports its native SDE binary data format, Oracle Spatial, and ST_geometry.ArcIMS (Internet Mapping Server) provides browser-based access to GIS. As of ArcGIS 10.1, ArcIMS has been depreciated in favour of ArcGIS for Server, but there are still many instances of ArcIMS (10.0 and older) in production environments.Other server-based products include Geoportal Extension, ArcGIS <b>Image</b> <b>Server</b> and Tracking Server as well as several others.|$|E

40|$|Large scale {{networked}} image retrieval systems face {{a number}} of problems that are not fully satisfied by current systems. On one hand, integrated solutions that store all image data centrally are often limited in terms of scalability and autonomy of data providers. On the other hand, WWW-based search engines proved to be fairly scalable, and data providers retain their autonomy. However, such engines often confront users with links to servers that are not available or to images that no longer exist, i. e., they are unable to keep their meta-database consistent with the repositories' contents. Furthermore, existing solutions often neglect the cost of image delivery. The considerable variations in the e ective bandwidth in today's Internet lead to highly unpredictable response times, which are often intolerable from the user's point of view. This paper presents the architecture of Chariot, a networked image search and retrieval system that tackles these concerns. With respect to scalability and autonomy, Chariot follows the approach of WWW-based search engines by maintaining only the meta-data in a central database. Various specialized components (feature extraction, indexes, <b>images</b> <b>servers)</b> are coordinated by a middleware component that employs transactional process management to enforce consistency between the meta-data and all components. Moreover, Chariot incorporates mechanisms to provide more predictable response times for the image delivery over the Internet by employing network-aware <b>image</b> <b>servers.</b> These servers trade off the quality of the images to b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{methodology}} for enabling debugging and tracing of production web applications without affecting its normal flow and functionality. This method of debugging enables developers and maintenance engineers {{to replace a}} set of existing resources such as <b>images,</b> <b>server</b> side scripts, cascading style sheets with another set of resources per web session. The new resources will only be active in the debug session and other sessions will not be affected. This methodology will help developers in tracing defects, especially those that appear only in production environments and in exploring the behaviour of the system. A realization of the proposed methodology has been implemented in Java. Keywords—Live debugging, web application, web resources, I...|$|R
50|$|Image capture is {{only part}} of the image forming process. Regardless of material, some process must be {{employed}} to render the latent image captured by the camera into a viewable image. With slide film, the developed film is just mounted for projection. Print film requires the developed film negative to be printed onto photographic paper or transparency. Prior to the advent of laser jet and inkjet printers, celluloid photographic negative images had to be mounted in an enlarger which projected the image onto a sheet of light-sensitive paper for a certain length of time (usually measured in seconds or fractions of a second). This sheet then was soaked in a chemical bath of developer (to bring out the image) followed immediately by a stop bath (to neutralize the progression of development and prevent the image from changing further once exposed to normal light). After this, the paper was hung until dry enough to safely handle. This post-production process allowed the photographer to further manipulate the final image beyond what had already been captured on the negative, adjusting the length of time the image was projected by the enlarger and the duration of both chemical baths to change the image's intensity, darkness, clarity, etc. This process is still employed by both amateur and professional photographers, but the advent of digital imagery means that the vast majority of modern photographic work is captured digitally and rendered via printing processes that are no longer dependent on chemical reactions to light. Such digital images may be uploaded to an <b>image</b> <b>server</b> (e.g., a photo-sharing website), viewed on a television, or transferred to a computer or digital photo frame. Every type can then be produced as a hard copy on regular paper or photographic paper via a printer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Virtual {{museums are}} {{commonly}} intended as collections of digital resources containing artistic and cultural images. They {{can be an}} appealing enhancement of a museum or can also be accessed by remote hosts (Web Museum). The realization of a virtual museum {{is based on the}} collection of large, high resolution and accurate images, that can be managed using an <b>Image</b> <b>Server.</b> This paper propose a new <b>Image</b> <b>Server</b> realizing functionalities such as crop on demand, image filtering, color correction, access management, zooming, metadata management and access control on large and high resolution images. Users of the proposed <b>Image</b> <b>Server</b> may be using a low bandwidth connection (i. e. trough PSTN), thus a main focus of the design is how to deliver high quality images on a low bandwidth channel. The <b>Image</b> <b>Server</b> finally has been tested on the high resolution images acquired from two Pompeian frescoes and a Roman Hypogeum. 1...|$|E

40|$|Future {{high-speed}} {{computer networks}} {{are projected to}} carry dizzying array of networked multimedia applications including digital libraries, video and <b>image</b> <b>servers,</b> distance learning collaboration, networked virtual environments, and entertainment. A common threat to these applications is the so-called continuous nature of the data. Video-on-demand (VOD) application is a networked multimedia application where the subscribers access a remote server for the multimedia data preferably with VCR operations. These operations impose additional resource requirement on the VOD server in terms of storage space, retrieval throughput and network resources like bandwidth and buffers. In this work, we propose a cost-effective disk-oriented multi-user play-out system with VCR operations.

40|$|Support (NMSIS) was {{developed}} to facilitate LAN management. Among other features, NMSIS integrates tools for the software installation in remote computers, through the network, called image-management. One of the main issues associated with the remote installation of software is the traffic congestion at network intersection points, such as switches and routers. Traffic congestion constrains the quality of services (QoS) in network. This article presents the Bandwidth / Traffic Control (BWTC) tool of NMSIS. The BWTC modulates the traffic flow from the <b>images</b> <b>server</b> to the various clients, depending on the load of the network.
