Since most organic materials {{are sensitive to the}} high energetic particles like neutralized ions and ultraviolet (UV) photons generated in glow discharge, sputtering can deteriorate the performance of organic light emitting diodes (OLED). A p-i-n type orange OLED based on doped charge transport layers and emitting layer consisting of alpha-NPD(4, 4 -bis [N-(1 -naphtyl) -N-phenyl-amino-]biphenyl) and Iridium(III) bis(2 -methyldibenzo-[f,h]quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate) is realized, having low operating voltage and high efficiency. The organic layers are vacuum-evaporated on ITO coated glass substrates in a vertical inline deposition tool, and aluminium is deposited on the organic layers by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering to form a cathode. Various sputter process parameters are selected and applied to form the cathode. Ytterbium was evaporated on the organic layers by the metal evaporation in order to set a reference device. The fabricated OLEDs are characterized by means of I-V-L characteristics and lifetime measurements. The results are explained by sputter parameters in order to identify the effect of Ar neutrals. The OLED having sputtered Al <b>cathode</b> show a <b>driving</b> <b>voltage</b> of 4. 2 V, a power efficiency of 7. 7 lm/W, and a current efficiency of 10. 6 cd/A at 1000 cd/m 2 comparable to the OLED having the evaporated cathode.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new {{approach}} for specifying the waveforms of <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> for a Piezo LEGS motor. A novel idea of coordinate transformation to define the waveforms of <b>driving</b> <b>voltages,</b> based on the motor static model, is presented. This transformation defines <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> according to the desired motion of the motor legs in the x- and y-directions. The approach allows a user to first define force acting on the motor rod in the y-direction and define the rod's x-direction trajectory profile. Waveforms of the <b>driving</b> <b>voltages</b> are subsequently defined to meet these requirements. The proposed approach also enables the possibility of defining the desired step shape for the motor and, according to that definition, producing <b>driving</b> <b>voltages.</b> Based on the given coordinate transformation, a simple method for Piezo LEGS motor control, identified as virtual time control, is presented.

When doping Firpic inside the OXD, the <b>driving</b> <b>voltage</b> of OLEDs greatly decreases because FIrpic dopants facilitate electron injection and electron transport from the electron-transporting layer (ETL) into the EML. With increasing dopant concentration, the recombination zone shifts toward the anode side, analyzed with electroluminescence (EL) spectra. Besides, EL redshifts were also observed with increasing <b>driving</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{which means the}} electron mobility is {{more sensitive to the}} electric field than the hole mobility. To further investigate carrier injection and transport characteristics, FIrpic was intentionally undoped at different positions inside the EML. When FIrpic was undoped close to the ETL, <b>driving</b> <b>voltage</b> increased significantly which proves the dopant-assisted-electron-injection characteristic in this OLED. When the undoped layer is near the electron blocking layer, the <b>driving</b> <b>voltage</b> is only slightly increased, but the current efficiency is greatly reduced because the main recombination zone was undoped.
