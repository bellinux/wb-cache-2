It shows the tumultuous relationships between {{the members of this}} family, especially the offending attitudes of Nina, which also contaminate the austere and enigmatic Ana, resulting in the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> patriarchal values <b>prized</b> by the Meneses family...|$|R

5000|$|In 1670 he was [...] "Governor of His Majesty's Island of Jamaica Commander-in-Chief of all His Majesties Forces {{within the}} said Island {{and in the}} Islands {{adjacent}} Vice-Admiral to His Royal Highness the Duke of York in the American Seas", according to the commission to Henry Morgan to make war upon the Spanish. The issuance of the aforementioned privateer commission to Morgan, who used it to attack and plunder the Spanish possession of Panama, resulted in revocation of Modyford's governorship and arrest in 1671. King Charles II of England, {{in desperate need of}} Spain as an ally in an impending war with the Dutch, had ordered the arrest and revocation merely to appease a Spanish Crown, furious over the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> their <b>prize</b> city. Though charges were never preferred, and no trial was ever held, Modyford spent two years in the Tower of London. He was released in 1674, and returned to Jamaica in 1675.|$|R
50|$|Casey's {{relationship}} with Chuck is complicated. A running gag is that Chuck (always unintentionally) will typically cause Casey distress, embarrassment or physical harm {{at some point}} during an episode (such as the <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> Casey's <b>prized</b> Crown Vic). Typically, Casey is hard on and insulting to Chuck and takes a dark pleasure in making Chuck feel insecure; he shows frustration with Chuck's constant mistakes, inability to perform tasks for which he is not trained, and constantly failing to follow orders. However, although he seldom expresses it openly, he seems to recognize that Chuck is doing the best he can as a civilian forced to act as a spy with little or no training. He does at times show appreciation for him and recognizes that he has potential as an agent. He has expressed respect for Chuck's integrity, intelligence, and inventiveness. He showed particular respect for Chuck's courage in deciding to use the only sample of an antidote in their possession to save his sister's life, even though he had been poisoned and would die without it. The two seem to have a brotherly relationship; Chuck drives Casey crazy but still cares about him.|$|R
