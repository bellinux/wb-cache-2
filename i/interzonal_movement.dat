40|$|Existing {{models of}} {{stochastic}} network equilibrium route choice in transport networks {{are able to}} represent exogenously specified variations in drivers' actual or perceived travel costs, but assume throughout that flows are deterministic. In this paper, a new notion of equilibrium is presented based on stochastic flow variables, in which the impact of variable flows on the variability in travel costs is endogenously handled. Firstly, a very general notion of equilibrium is deduced as a fixed point condition on the joint probability distribution of network flows. Then, an approximation to this condition is derived, which operates by equilibrating moments of order n and below of the joint flow probability distribution, and is termed a Generalized Stochastic User Equilibrium of order n, being denoted GSUE(n). The GSUE(1) model is seen to be a conventional Stochastic User Equilibrium. The paper goes on {{to focus on the}} second order model, GSUE(2). Conditions are presented to guarantee the existence of GSUE(2) solutions. Conditions are deduced to guarantee (a) uniqueness of solutions in networks with a single <b>interzonal</b> <b>movement,</b> and (b) proximity of solutions in networks with multiple interzonal movements. Finally, a simple example is presented...|$|E
40|$|The National Bureau of Standards has {{undertaken}} a research {{effort to develop}} a general indoor air quality simulation program for buildings. At present there exists three computer programs {{which can be used}} to analyze <b>interzonal</b> air <b>movements</b> in multizoned buildings and predict the level of contaminants due {{to a wide variety of}} contaminants. This paper will introduce the reader to the scientific and mathematical basis of the models, the preparation of building input data for these programs, and the use of the models for both residential and commercial buildings. Greater detail may be found in reference [I]. Airborne contaminants introduced into a building disperse throughout the building in a complex manner that depends on the nature of air movement in-to (infiltration), out-of (exfiltration), and within the building system, the influence of the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems on air movementthe posibility of removal, by filtration, or contribution, by generation, of contaminants, and the possibility of chemical reaction or physical-chemical reaction (e. g., adsorption or absorption) of contaminants with each other or the materials of the buildings construction and furnishings...|$|R

The system consists of simple and stand-alone gas injectors and sampling units. The injectors are capable of releasing up to four perfluorocarbon tracer gases in different parts of a build-ing. Following tracer gas injection and mixing, small samples of air are collected using automatic sampling units. Each unit consists of a 16 -position valve and a group of removable stain-less steel tubes packed with solid absorbent. Samples may be taken simultaneously at up to four points in space and up to 16 points in time. These samples are then stored for subsequent analysis in the laboratory using an automatic thermal desorber and gas chromatograph. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the portable sulphur hexafluo-ride (SF 6) system is described, The system incorporates an electron capture detector gas chromatograph and ops 3 rates automatically using a BBC microcomputer. Using this system the air change rates were measured in a number of recently construc-ted houses in the Milton Keynes area, UK. The test data of various measurements are presented together with an analysis of the results...|$|R
40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{approaches to}} assessing {{the effect of}} geographic scale on spatial interactions are pursued. In the first, {{the question of whether}} a distance (d) deterrence function, which explains interactions for one system of zones, can also succeed on a more aggregate scale, is examined. Only the two-parameter function, B 0 + B 1 d, (B 1 B 0 > | B 1 |, 0 dB 0 / B 1) for which it is found that distances between macrozones are weighted averages of distances between component zones, is satisfactory in this regard. Estimation of continuous (point-to-point) functions [...] in the form of quadrivariate cubic polynomials [...] for US interstate migration streams, is then undertaken. Upon numerical integration, these (higher order) trend surfaces yield predictions of <b>interzonal</b> and intrazonal <b>movements</b> at any scale of interest. Tests of spatial stationarity, isotropy, and symmetry of interstate migration are conducted in this framework. ...|$|R
