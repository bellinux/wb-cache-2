5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} <b>frieze</b> in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The dining room was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a <b>frieze</b> just under the ceiling. Today the dining room together with its <b>frieze</b> forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E
5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a wallpaper group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a <b>frieze</b> of <b>frieze</b> group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different <b>frieze</b> groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E

5|$|The Parthenon <b>frieze</b> is the high-relief pentelic marble {{sculpture}} {{created to}} adorn {{the upper part}} of the Parthenon’s naos. It was sculpted between c. 443 and 438 BC, most likely under the direction of Pheidias. Of the 160 meters (524ft) of the original <b>frieze,</b> 128 meters (420ft) survivessome 80 percent. The rest is known only from the drawings attributed to French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674, thirteen years before the Venetian bombardment that ruined the temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon <b>frieze</b> belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the <b>frieze</b> begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the <b>frieze.</b> While those vase paintings that resemble the <b>frieze</b> cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the <b>frieze</b> may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion <b>frieze</b> and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes a debt to the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the <b>frieze</b> for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E

5|$|When Wright {{designed}} the Heller House in 1896, it marked his {{move away from}} styles that were popular into an era of geometric and highly modern designs.

5|$|Interpretations of {{the figures}} varies. The twelve seated deities are taken to be the Olympians, they are one third taller than any other figure on the <b>frieze</b> and are {{arranged}} in two groups of six on diphroi (backless) stools, common forms of ancient furniture, {{with the exception of}} Zeus who is enthroned. Their backs are turned to what must be the culminating event of the procession E31–35; five figures (three children and two adults, and although badly corroded, the two children on the left appear to be girls bearing objects on their heads, while a third, perhaps a boy, assisting an adult who may be the archon basileus, in folding a piece of cloth. This <b>frieze</b> often is interpreted as the presentation of Athena’s peplos, perhaps by the arrhephoroi, but debate exists regarding who the figures represent more than what ritual is represented.|$|E
5|$|The Parthenon <b>frieze</b> is the {{defining}} monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture. It stands between the gradual {{eclipse of the}} Severe style, as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes, {{and the evolution of}} the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the <b>frieze</b> drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the <b>frieze</b> that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them. There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture. This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|The {{contention}} that the scene depicts the festival for Athena is fraught with problems. Later sources indicate {{that a number of}} classes of individual who performed a role in the procession are not present in the <b>frieze,</b> these include: the hoplites, the allies in the Delian league, the skiaphoroi or umbrella bearers, the female hydraiphoroi (only male hydrai bearers are portrayed) thetes, slaves, metics, the panathenaic ship, and some would suggest the kanephoros, although there is evidence that she is accounted for. That what we now see {{was meant to be a}} generic image of the religious festival is problematic since no other temple sculpture depicts a contemporary event involving mortals. Locating the scene in mythical or historical time has been the principal difficulty of the line of inquiry. John Boardman has suggested that the cavalry portray the heroization of the marathonomachoi, the hoplites who fell at Marathon in 490, and that, therefore these riders were the Athenians who took part in the last pre-war Greater Panathenaia. In support, he points out, the number of horsemen, chariot passengers (but not charioteers), grooms, and marshals comes to the same as the number Herodotos gives for the Athenian dead: 192. Equally suggestive of a reference to the Persian War, is the similarity several scholars have noted of the <b>frieze</b> to the Apadana sculpture in Persepolis. This has variously been posited to be democratic Athens counter posing itself to oriental tyranny, or, aristocratic Athens emulating the Imperial East. Further to this zeitgeist argument there is J.J. Politt’s {{contention that}} the <b>frieze</b> embodies a Periclean manifesto, which favours the cultural institutions of agones (or contests, as witnessed by the apobatai), sacrifices, and military training as well as a number of other democratic virtues. More recent scholarship pursuing this vein has made the <b>frieze</b> a site of ideological tension between the elite and the demos with perhaps, only the aristocracy present, and merely veiled reference to the ten tribes.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{appearance}} of [...] "flame palmettes" [...] seem to occur with the stand-alone floral akroteria of the Parthenon (447-432 BCE), and slightly {{later at the}} Temple of Athena Nike. Flame palmettes were then introduced into <b>friezes</b> of floral motifs in replacement of the regular palmette. According to Boardman, although lotus <b>friezes</b> or palmette <b>friezes</b> were known in Mesopotamia centuries before, the unnatural combination of various botanical elements which have no relationship in the wild, such as the palmette, the lotus and sometimes rosette flowers, is a purely Greek innovation, which was then adopted on a very broad geographical scale.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} ranks W21–1 {{along with}} N75–136 and S1–61 {{are all of}} horsemen and constitute 46% of the whole <b>frieze.</b> They are divided into two lines of ten ranks – the same number {{as that of the}} Attic tribes. All figures are beardless youths with the exception of two, W8 and W15, who along with S2–7 wear Thracian dress of fur cap, a patterned cloak, and high boots; these have been identified by Martin Robertson as hipparchs. Next are the four-horse chariots, each with charioteer and armed passenger, there are ten on the south <b>frieze</b> and eleven on the north. Since these passengers are sometimes depicted as dismounting they may be taken to represent the apobatai, participants in the ceremonial race found in Attica and Boeotia.|$|E

W24 is an ambiguous figure who might be either the protesting owner of a rejected horse or a keryx (herald) whose hand held part of an otherwise lost salpinx (trumpet), but either way this point marks the beginning of the procession proper.|$|E
