These organisms were distinguished from previously described Vibrb species by their positive results in tests for gelatinase and lipase activities and their negative reactions in tests for arginine dihydrolase and lysine and ornithine decarboxylase activities, growth {{in the presence of}} 6 % NaCl and at 35 ”C, acid production from sucrose, utilization of D-glucuronate and propionate, and luminescence. The G+C contents of the DNAs of these organisms were 46. 2 to 47. 0 mol%. The levels of DNA relatedness among these six strains were 87 to 99 % (as determined by the membrane filter method), while the levels of DNA relatedness between prawn pathogen strain KH-lT (T = type strain) and members of 28 previously described Vibrio species were less than 18 %. The name Vibrio pemeicidu sp. nov. is proposed for the prawn-pathogenic strains. The type strain is strain KH- 1 (= IF 0 15640 = JCM 9123).

The geometry and coordination environment of the active site of the arthropod PO {{are very similar to}} those of the arthropod hemocyanin (Hc). However, unlike the POs, Hc is an oxygen carrier in crustaceans, and does not possess PO activity in general. Recently, we identified a new type of proPO from a crustacean and designated it proPOβ. This enzyme has many characteristics that are rather similar to those of Hc, such as its maturation, localization, and oligomeric state. Here, we determined the crystal structure of proPOβ prepared from the hemolymph of <b>kuruma</b> <b>prawns</b> (Marsupenaeus japonicus) at 1. 8 -Å resolution. M. japonicus proPOβ forms a homohexamer rather similar to that of arthropod Hc. The geometry of the active copper site in proPOβ is nearly identical to that of arthropod Hc. Furthermore, the well-characterized 'place-holder' phenylalanine is present (Phe 72). However, the accessibility to the active site differs in several ways. First, another phenylalanine, which shields the active site by interacting with a copper-coordinated histidine in crustacean Hc, is replaced by valine in the proPOβ structure. Second, two tyrosines, Tyr 208 and Tyr 209, both of which are absent in Hc, show the alternative conformations and form a pathway providing access to the reaction center. Thus, the present crystal structure clarifies the similarities and differences in the activity of two closely related proteins, PO and Hc...|$|R

Within fifty years, the penaeid life cycle {{had been closed}} by Dr. Motosaku Fujinaga (Hudinaga 1935), and commercial production was accomplished by the late sixties (Hudinaga 1942; Kittaka 1967). Yet, {{more than thirty years}} later, bottlenecks and barriers to profitable commercial culture still plague this industry. Diseases due to inadequate bio-security and environmental degradation; oceanic and coastal zone pollution, and antibiotic, hormone and chemical misuse have together drained resources, profits and consumer confidence from an already struggling industry. This dissertation presents a collection of experiments that aided {{in the development of a}} production protocol for the commercial culture of Litopenaeus vannamei within a zero discharge, very low salinity, inland system. These experiments suggest that the technology exists for profitable commercial culture of this species without dependence on an oceanic nexus. Chapter 1 introduces the science of aquaculture and reviews the state of the industry, including the demand for ocean products and its attendant stresses, as well as stresses caused by aquaculture. Included in this chapter is an overview of factors that contribute to choices of species, research needs and protocol for inland culture. Chapter 2 describes the methods and materials used in experiments related to inland, low-salinity penaeid culture. These include experiments on salinity and ionic acclimation of Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae for zero-exchange inland nurseries; density and feeding for the inland culture of L. vannamei in zero-exchange, freshwater nurseries; density and feeding for the inland culture of L. vannamei in zero-exchange, freshwater ponds; salinity and density for polyculture of both Oreochromis aureus and O. niloticus with L. vannamei within zero-exchange freshwater treatment ponds, and nitrite toxicity in low salinity waters. Chapter 3 presents the results from the experiments described in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 discusses the results found in Chapter 3 and commercial protocols developed with the use and reliance on the experiments presented. in this dissertation.

In this study, enzymically active CTSC of the <b>kuruma</b> <b>prawn</b> was prepared by recombinant expression in the High Five insect cell line. The recombinant enzyme with a polyhistidine tag at its C-terminus {{was considered to be}} initially secreted into the culture medium as an inactive form of zymogen, because Western blot with anti-CTSC antibody detected a 51 &#x 2009;kDa protein corresponding to CTSC precursor. After purification by affinity chromatography on nickel-iminodiacetic acid resin, the enzyme displayed three forms of 51, 31, and 30 &#x 2009;kDa polypeptides.

The prevalence of WSSV (white spot syndrome virus), the causative agent of WSS, was examined in wild <b>kuruma</b> <b>prawn</b> broodstocks by nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction). As a result, WSSV was detected at the highest prevalence (10. 1 %) in the ovary of female prawn. This result indicates that spawners are sources of infection. In 1997, brooders were pre-screened using PCR to detect WSSV before these spawned. WSSV was noted to occur in postlarvae obtained from brooders caught between July and August. In 1998 and 1999, eggs were selected based on WSSV detection by PCR from receptaculum seminis of spawned broodstock. Consequently, WSSV did not occur in their offsprings in both years.

Experimental units consisted of three earthen ponds, 900 m 2, 1100 m 2 and 4600 m 2, respectively with a minimal water exchange. No significant effects in shrimp growth were found with the probiotics used in the trials. Although the survival rates for both species in the first two trials were low and obviously affected by the disease outbreaks, the third trial on extensive polyculture with grey mullet achieved a high survival and growth rate (3. 8 g to 37. 3 g) during the 12 weeks culture period. Dissolved oxygen concentration in three ponds fluctuates on a 24 -hour basis, increases during daylight hours and decreases at nighttime even dropping to a critical level of 2. 03 mg/L. The results obtained from those trials indicate that the culture conditions must be carefully maintained. Although our trials did not achieve good results, they can provide some implications for future research. Also, maintaining an organic ecosystem may simply be too difficult for some aquaculture systems.

([2005]) who reported a decrease in activity of PPO from <b>kuruma</b> <b>prawn</b> with increasing concentrations of copper ion. On the other hand, PPO from white shrimp (Simpson et al. [1987]) and lobster (Opoku-Gyamfua et al. [1992]) had an increased activity with increasing concentrations of copper ion. The increase in copper ion might cause the conformational change of the enzyme by affecting the ionic interaction stabilising the structure of the enzyme (Benjakul et al. [2005]). It was noted that PPO activity from Pacific white shrimp was decreased by the higher concentration of copper acetate. In general, trypsin and copper ion have been reported to be activators of PPO from different sources. The result suggested that PPO in DEAE-Sephacel fraction was in an active state and did not require trypsin or copper ion as activators. Also, the structure or conformation of PPO from Pacific white shrimp might be different from that of PPO from other species. Therefore, activation of PPO by trypsin or copper ion depends on the species and other intrinsic factors determining the activity.|$|E

[1988]) and deep water pink shrimp (Zamorano et al. [2009]), respectively. A lower Km value indicates a higher catalytic efficiency of the enzyme towards its substrate. The Km values for the oxidation of L-DOPA by white shrimp (Chen et al. [1991 b]) and <b>kuruma</b> <b>prawn</b> (Benjakul et al. [2006]) PPO were 3.48 and 0.26 mM, respectively. PPO from the viscera of Norway lobster showed a higher catalytic affinity for catechol than PPO from the carapace with apparent Km values of 5.97 and 19.40 mM, respectively (Gimenez et al. [2010]). Vmax for the oxidation of L-DOPA by PPO in DEAE-Sephacel fraction was 61 × 103 U/mg PPO. Simpson et al. ([1988]) reported that Vmax for PPO from the cephalothorax of pink and white shrimp was 5.6 × 103 and 3.1 × 103 U/mg PPO, respectively. The result suggested that Pacific white shrimp PPO had higher reaction rate of L-DOPA oxidation than pink and white shrimp PPO. The differences in Km and Vmax of PPO from different species were plausibly owing to the differences in molting stage, method of capture, handling and storage conditions (Rolle et al. [1991]).|$|E

The stability of TMs from fish (Huang and Ochiai, 2005) was estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and {{it has been shown that}} fish TM, as rabbit TM (Potekhin and Privalov 1982), contains a few unfolding units. Thus, it would be adequate to measure the thermal stability of peptides or fragments. In Chapter 1, the stability of invertebrate TMs was investigated. TMs from the tail muscle of <b>kuruma</b> <b>prawn,</b> mantle muscle of Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus, foot muscle of tokobushi abalone, and striated and smooth adductor muscles of Yesso scallop were purified and these stabilities were determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry and DSC. The white croaker TM was used as control. In addition, three mRNAs encoding the smooth muscle TMs of the scallop have been sequenced (Hasegawa, 2001) and the major component was determined at the protein level. CD spectrometry and DSC have suggested that the thermal stability is in the order of prawn TM > abalone TM > squid TM ≒ white croaker TM > scallop smooth muscle TM > scallop striated muscle TM. The stability difference between scallop TMs and other TMs reflected the habitat temperature, but the stability difference between scallop striated and smooth muscle TMs could come from other physiological demands. The striated muscle expedites jet water propulsion for quick locomotion, while the smooth muscle can keep the shell closed by maintaining large tension with little energy expenditure for a long time (so-called catch condition). Therefore, the protein components are considered to have different profiles between the two muscles. In Chapter 2, five synthetic peptides of 30 mer were designed, based on the sequence of walleye pollack fast muscle TM: Peptide Nterm (Met 1 -Lys 30) which consisted of N-terminal region, Peptide Var (Asp 84 -Leu 113) which consisted of the variable region, Peptide Mid (Val 128 -Ala 157) which consisted of the middle region of TM, Peptide Cys (Leu 176 -Lys 205) which contained the conserved Cys 190 residue, and Peptide Cterm (Asp 255 -Ile 284) which consisted of C-terminal region. The thermal stabilities of these peptides were determined by CD spectrometry in the presence and absence of 40 % 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol (TFE). In 40 % TFE, the helical contents of these peptides were decreased, as temperature rose, though they showed no clear melting temperature, suggesting that the enthalpy necessary for transition from the highly α-helical conformation to the highly random coil containing conformation of each peptide was low. The calculation by AGADIR, α-helical content prediction software for the monomeric peptides, showed good accordance with the measured α-helical contents of all peptides in the absence of TFE, except for Peptide Cterm. In addition, the α-helical contents did not show concentration dependence in 40 % TFE. Thus, all peptides, except for Peptide Cterm, would not have coiled-coil interaction under these experimental conditions. These results suggested that the stability was in the order of Peptide Cterm > Peptide Var > Peptide Nterm ≒ Peptide Mid ≒ Peptide Cys. The higher stability of Peptide Cterm could be important for the head-to-tail interaction between N and C terminal regions. In Chapter 3, white croaker TM was cleaved by 2 -nitro- 5 -thiocyanatobenzoic acid (NTCB). At the 190 th residue, fish TM has only one conserved cysteine residue, where NTCB cleaves the peptide bond. Fragments produced by NTCB were purified and measured by CD spectrometry. From CD data, C-terminal fragment (Cys 190 -Ile 284) showed higher stability than N-terminal fragment (Met 1 -Lys 189), regardless of its shorter length. It has been reported that the rabbit TM C-terminal fragment shows lower stability than the N-terminal fragment and low stability of the C-terminal fragment is discussed with the interaction with troponin. Thus, the present study suggests that such idea should be reconsidered. In Chapter 4, molecular dynamics simulations for the rabbit and white croaker TM C-terminal fragments were performed by Amber 10. These fragments (rabbit/white croaker) contain four amino acid substitutions (Ala/Ser 191, Ser/Thr 229, Thr/Ala 247, and Ser/Thr 252). The study in this chapter indicates that the substitution at the 229 th residue stabilizes rabbit TM fragment, while the substitutions at the 247 th and/or 252 nd residue stabilize the white croaker TM fragment. In Chapter 5, general discussion was performed, based on the results of the present study to make clear what was established for invertebrate and vertebrate TMs so far and to scope further investigations. 報告番号: 甲 28073; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(農学); 学位記番号: 博農第 3789 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科水圏生物科学専...|$|E
