5|$|The {{origin of}} Cortana is not {{explained}} in the video games, but in the Halo novels. Her first chronological appearance in the story is in , a 2001 prequel to the first Halo game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana makes a reference to this event via voiceover in Halo 3 during a cinematic before gameplay begins. Cortana and the Spartans are assigned a near-suicidal mission: to take the cruiser Pillar of Autumn to the home world of the Covenant, an alliance of alien races, and capture one of their Prophets to force a truce. Cortana's role is {{to act as a}} mission specialist, hacking the Covenant systems and piloting the captured Covenant ship. Before the mission, Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's MJOLNIR battle armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> of Colonel Ackerson, the ONI operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. When the Covenant attacks the planet Reach, one of the largest planetary military bases besides Earth, Cortana guides the Pillar of Autumn based on star charts on a Forerunner tablet, thus bringing them to Halo. During , Cortana serves the same role she did in Halo: Combat Evolved, but her role is expanded such as showing her saving the Master Chief's life from a Flood Infection Form at one point.|$|E

40|$|Summary. This {{article is}} a {{continuation}} of [6]. We present <b>the</b> notion of <b>files</b> and records. These are two finite sequences. One is a record and another is a separator for the carriage return and/or line feed. So, we define the record. <b>The</b> sequential text <b>file</b> contains records and separators. Generally, a record and a separator are paired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> And <b>in</b> a special situation, the separator does not exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> for that <b>the</b> record is only one record or record is nothing. And the record does not exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> for that some separator is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file.</b> <b>In</b> this article, we present a theory for files and records...|$|R
25|$|Rasmussen's father, however, {{believed}} that Stephanie Lazarus, a Los Angeles police officer, was a prime suspect.

25|$|The {{music library}} {{is another of}} the Plex {{metadata}} databases. The music library feature received a major overhaul with a new release announced on April 30, 2015. That version allows for the automatic organization of a music collection by information stored in the ID3 or M4A tags, such as title, artist, album, genre, year, and popularity. If the metadata are not stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> themselves, the naming and organization of the music files are important. If the user has a Plex Pass account, the file naming and organization is not as critical as the music will be matched via sonic fingerprinting.|$|E
25|$|The logical {{conclusion}} {{of these events}} was that the border was heavily militarized, involving the building of castles and reinforcements of troops in the areas surrounding the Trabancos River, with some castles being erected in the west, such as in Alaejos. Paradoxically, the wars increased {{the value of the}} region, {{and for the first time}} there began to appear documents recording the area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> of the cathedrals of Zamora, Salamanca and Segovia including documents regarding: Siete Iglesias de Trabancos ("Seven Churches at Trabancos") in 1178, Alaejos (Falafeios) in 1167, and in 1180, Eván de Arriba, Eván de Abajo, Valdefuentes and Pedroso (which are now deserted villages), together with Nava del Rey in 1265, among others.|$|E

25|$|Nels Rasmussen told Nuttall about Lazarus' {{continued}} {{contact with}} his daughter, which had not been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files,</b> despite him mentioning it frequently during Mayer and Hook's interviews. Realizing that Lazarus was now their prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing {{they would have to}} do so without getting a warrant, which would have let Lazarus know she was under investigation for the murder. While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} two detectives in the nation's only {{full-time}} unit {{devoted to}} that specialty, she had gained some local media attention when she and her partner had recovered a statue stolen from Carthay Circle. To better understand the field, she told a local newspaper, she had begun learning to paint. Off the job, she had been active in the Los Angeles Women Police Officers Association and organized childcare for families of officers. She also made chocolate-covered cherries and homemade soap for her neighbors in Simi Valley for Christmas. Since she was still with the department, they realized they would have to proceed carefully. Still, they ranked Lazarus as the least promising of the five suspects, since from what they read <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> Lazarus and Ruetten had ended any relationship they had had over the summer before the murder.|$|E
25|$|He {{dissolved}} the Dáil on four occasions (in 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1957). On each occasion the Taoiseach {{who advised}} {{him to do so}} (de Valera in the first and third cases, and John A. Costello in the other two) had not been formally defeated in a Dáil vote in a manner showing a loss of support by a majority of TDs. Therefore, under Article 13.2.3° of the Constitution, O'Kelly had no discretion to refuse to act on their advice to dissolve. A more complex case occurred however in 1949 when the First Inter-Party Government was defeated in a snap Dáil vote on a financial measure due to the absence of a number of Government TDs. O'Kelly was advised by the Secretary to the President, Michael McDunphy that had Costello requested a dissolution, he could have refused it. However Costello, on the basis that the loss of the vote was accidental (due to a mistake by the party whips), not evidence of a shift in voting, opted to reintroduce the measure the following morning, rather than seek a dissolution. With all Deputies present this time the Government won the vote. McDunphy later changed his mind and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> on the event concluded that the President could not have refused a dissolution because the loss had merely been a technical loss, not an actual decision by the Dáil to vote against the government.|$|E

50|$|Structured storage {{addresses}} some inherent {{difficulties of}} storing multiple data objects {{within a single}} file. One difficulty arises when an object persisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> changes <b>in</b> size due to an update. If the application that is reading/writing <b>the</b> <b>file</b> expects <b>the</b> objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> to remain <b>in</b> a certain order, everything following that object's representation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> {{may need to be}} shifted backward to make room if the object grows, or forward to fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space left over if the object shrinks. If <b>the</b> <b>file</b> is large, this could be a costly operation.

Known as [...] "engineer Roller" [...] or [...] "Rolea" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> of the Kingdom of Romania's [...] secret police, he first attracted the authorities' attention following the discovery of a secret printing press in the national capital Bucharest. According to PCdR documents, between his arrests Roller negotiated popular front alliances with other socialist groups: in 1934, he was one of several [...] "antifascist committee" [...] members who carried out fusion talks with the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU) of Constantin Popovici. Roller, who also supervised the creation of workers' antifascist sections in Bucharest in September 1934, is mentioned as one of the PCdR and PSU activists who signed a formal protest against [...] "the numerous abusive and illegal acts perpetrated by the organs of repression".

2500|$|It {{was later}} claimed by Richard Meinertzhagen, {{the chief of}} British {{intelligence}} in the area based at Cairo, that the recall message reporting that Lettow-Vorbeck had surrendered was faked. The British, having broken the German naval wireless code, {{were aware of the}} flight and mission. East Africa’s Royal Flying Corps (RFC) squadrons were alerted to watch for the approach of the ship. [...] However, what turned the airship back was a signal relayed from Lettow-Vorbeck. The weak signal was amplified and forwarded by stations in friendly or neutral territories, and after some hours it reached the German naval command. The signal informed headquarters not that Lettow had surrendered, but that the Schutztruppe had been unable to hold the flatlands around Mahenge, the planned destination of the airship, and had been forced by British artillery to retreat into jagged mountains where the airship would have no chance of touching down without risking explosion. With no hope of a place to safely land and with every likelihood of her being destroyed or falling into enemy hands, the German command {{had no choice but to}} order a return. The recall signal was sent from the Admiralty station at Nauen. Despite its failure, [...] "the adventure of L59 was heroic both in scale and spirit." [...] Later a transcript of the radio message was reported to have been found in Germany's World War archives, as well as a Turko-German wireless intercept (marked 'Secret') preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>files</b> of the British Public Records office.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Mau Mau Uprising, {{the records}} {{included}} confirmation of [...] "the {{extent of the}} violence inflicted on suspected Mau Mau rebels" [...] in British detention camps documented in Caroline Elkins' study.

Baring himself was aware of the [...] "extreme brutality" [...] of the sometimes-lethal torture meted out—which included [...] "most drastic" [...] beatings, solitary confinement, starvation, castration, whipping, burning, rape, sodomy, and forceful insertion of objects into orifices—but took no action. Baring's inaction was despite the urging of people like Arthur Young, Commissioner of Police for Kenya for less than eight months of 1954 before he resigned in protest, that [...] "the horror of some of the [...] should be investigated without delay". In February 1956, a provincial commissioner in Kenya, [...] "Monkey" [...] Johnson, wrote to Attorney General Reginald Manningham-Buller urging him to block any enquiry into the methods used against Mau Mau: [...] "It would now appear that {{each and every one of}} us, from the Governor downwards, may be in danger of removal from public service by a commission of enquiry as a result of enquiries made by the CID."
