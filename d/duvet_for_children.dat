Our work is based on a so called hygiene hypothesis, which explains that the immunity system of children is not stimulated sufficiently, if households sterilize excessively, and therefore there is the superiority of Th 2 lymphocytes and an increased level of eosinophils and IgE antibodies in the atopic's blood contrary to the blood of a healthy child. Methods: We have obtained information using a form of questionnaire, which was directed to parents of twelve-year old children. 2 793 questionnaires were sent to sixty-nine elementary schools in all of the Czech Republic. We received 1 697 filled-out questionnaires in total. 420 children were defined evidently allergic and 774 non-allergic. Then we have processed those data subsequently. Results: The influence of washing habits and cosmetics according to our questionnaire is not too significant. The most significant influence on allergy is evident {{in the case of a}} <b>duvet</b> chosen <b>for</b> <b>children.</b> Contrary to feather duvet, synthetic [...] ...|$|R

[...] Ian Jane of DVD Talk highlighted the miniseries' combination of childhood nostalgia with horror elements and praised Curry's performance as Pennywise.|$|R

50|$|Each {{industry}} {{has its own}} specifications and methods for measuring thermal properties. The Shirley Togmeter is unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>duvets</b> because the large scale of their quilted construction makes it impractical to obtain {{a representative sample of}} suitable size. BS5335 describes apparatus <b>for</b> <b>duvet</b> tog testing. This consists of a metal plate at least 1000 mm x 600 mm at skin temperature (33°C) arranged to support the whole duvet, and a mechanism for measuring the air temperature above the quilt. This requires very precise control of the laboratory environment in order to get reliable results.|$|R

Providers who had experience caring <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities {{were more likely to}} re-port a willingness to care for them in the future. Differences in reported services and supports needed to care <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities, as well as explanations for un-willingness to care <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities, were examined for those with and without experience in caring <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities. Family childcare providers who were not willing to care <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities indicated three primary bar-riers: a lack of knowledge about disabilities, the limitation that caring <b>for</b> a <b>child</b> with a disability would impose on caring <b>for</b> other <b>children,</b> and the need to purchase spe-cial equipment. Finally, general attitudes concerning inclusion were compared for providers who had and had not had experience in caring <b>for</b> <b>children</b> with disabilities. As is becoming the norm for U.
