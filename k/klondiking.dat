60|$|Donald and Davy were fair {{specimens}} of frontier inefficients. Canadian- born, city-bred Scots, in a foolish moment they had resigned their counting-house desks, drawn upon their savings, and gone <b>Klondiking.</b> And {{now they were}} feeling the rough edge of the country. Grubless, spiritless, with a lust for home in their hearts, they had been staked by the P. C. Company to cut wood for its steamers, with the promise {{at the end of}} a passage home. Disregarding the possibilities of the ice-run, they had fittingly demonstrated their inefficiency by their choice of the island on which they located. Montana Kid, though possessing little knowledge of the break-up of a great river, looked about him dubiously, and cast yearning glances at the distant bank where the towering bluffs promised immunity from all the ice of the Northland.|$|E

50|$|Alberta's Northlands Association, {{which is}} based in Edmonton, honoured the memory and spirit of the overlanders with <b>Klondike</b> Days. For many years, <b>Klondike</b> Days was a fun summer {{exhibition}} with themed events such as the Sunday Promenade, the Sourdough raft race, free pancake breakfasts, saloons, gold panning and era costume parties. Despite the many sad realities of the gold rush, Edmonton appreciated the <b>Klondike</b> spirit, which was characterised by a tenacious hope for success in the face of hardship, and an energetic zest for life. As a fair theme it was meant to provide the impetus for fun fantasy characters (e.g., <b>Klondike</b> Mike (Bobby Breen), <b>Klondike</b> Kate, The <b>Klondike</b> Kid (Ken Armstrong), <b>Klondike</b> Kitty (Debra Cook), <b>Klondike</b> Kattie to mention but a few) and fun events celebrating an interesting time. Many in the Yukon resented Edmonton's <b>Klondike</b> celebrations because of their historical inaccuracy and the perceived competition with the Yukon's tourism. The sentimental aspect of the gold rush lost its popular appeal in the 1980s and 90s and in 2003 the theme was dropped.|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{ubiquitous}} presence, {{very little}} is known about the odds of winning the simple card game of <b>Klondike</b> Solitaire. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the use of probabilistic planning to shed light on this issue. Unfortunatley, most probabilistic planning techniques are not well suited for <b>Klondike</b> due to the difficulties of representing the domain in standard planning languages and the complexity of the required search. <b>Klondike</b> thus serves as an interesting addition to the complement of probabilistic planning domains. In this paper, we study <b>Klondike</b> using several sampling-based planning approaches including UCT, hindsight optimization, and sparse sampling, and establish empirical lower bounds on their performance. We also introduce novel combinations of these approaches and evaluate them in <b>Klondike.</b> We provide a theoretical bound on the sample complexity of a method that naturally combines sparse sampling and UCT. Our results demonstrate that there is a policy that within tight confidence intervals wins over 35 % of <b>Klondike</b> games. This result is the first reported empirical lower bound of an optimal <b>Klondike</b> policy...|$|R
