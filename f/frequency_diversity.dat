30|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified tensor model for space–frequency spreading-multiplexing (SFSM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems that combine space- and frequency-domain spreadings, {{followed by a}} space–frequency multiplexing. Spreading across space (transmit antennas) and frequency (subcarriers) adds resilience against deep channel fades and provides space and <b>frequency</b> <b>diversities,</b> while orthogonal space–frequency multiplexing enables multi-stream transmission. We adopt a tensor-based formulation for the proposed SFSM MIMO system that incorporates space, frequency, time, and code dimensions {{by means of the}} parallel factor model. The developed SFSM tensor model unifies the tensorial formulation of some existing multiple-access/multicarrier MIMO signaling schemes as special cases, while revealing interesting tradeoffs due to combined space, <b>frequency,</b> and time <b>diversities</b> which are of practical relevance for joint symbol-channel-code estimation. The performance of the proposed SFSM MIMO system using either a zero forcing receiver or a semi-blind tensor-based receiver is illustrated by means of computer simulation results under realistic channel and system parameters.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a general {{framework}} {{to analyze the}} performance of multiband UWB-MIMO systems regardless of specific coding schemes. A combination of space-time-frequency (STF) coding and hopping multiband OFDM modulation is also proposed to fully exploit all of the available spatial and <b>frequency</b> <b>diversities,</b> richly inherent in UWB environments. We quantify the performance merits of multiband UWB-MIMO systems in case of Nakagami-m frequency-selective fading channels. We show that the maximum achievable diversity of the proposed system {{is the product of}} the number of transmit and receive antennas, the number of multipath components, and the number of jointly encoded OFDM blocks. Interestingly, theoretical result shows that the diversity gain does not severely depend on the fading parameter m. Finally, simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.

40|$|In this paper, Orthogonal Space Time Block Coding (OS-TBC) is {{combined}} with linear precoding matrices to improve the exploitation of the different diversities for a multicarrier transmission. The linear precoding matrices based on Hadamard construction are proposed where a simple linear de-precoder can be chosen at the receiver part which performs closely to the Maximum Likelihood (ML) global precoded OSTBC decoder. The system is generalized to different numbers of transmit antennas and different sizes of precoding matrices. Performance results have been obtained in theoretical and real channel environments. It is shown that the combined scheme efficiently exploits the space, time and <b>frequency</b> <b>diversities</b> while using a linear decoder. This system leads to an OSTBC with maximal diversity {{for more than two}} antennas when a Zero Forcing (ZF) or a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizer is chosen. ...|$|R

Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed multipleencoder LSTF architecture is very close to that of the conventional single-encoder LSTF where coding is applied across the whole information stream. However, due to the use of multiple parallel encoders/decoders with a shorter codeword length, the proposed LSTF architecture has much lower hardware processing speed and complexity than the conventional LSTF...|$|R

The radio waves were scattered by the tropopause, returning to Earth beyond the horizon, allowing communication between stations hundreds of kilometers apart. Having two antennas allowed for space diversity, meaning that if tropospheric conditions degrade on one path the second path might still be clear and communications would not be disrupted. For <b>frequency</b> <b>diversity,</b> each antenna transmitted two separate frequencies. Using both frequency and space diversity was called quad diversity.
