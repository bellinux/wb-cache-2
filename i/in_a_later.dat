5|$|According to {{his book}} Doctor Who: The Companions (published {{at about the}} time The Trial of a Time Lord was broadcast), series {{producer}} John Nathan-Turner intended to chronicle the Doctor's first meeting with Melanie Bush <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> episode.

Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the episode}} has aired in Australia (although {{initially}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> than normal time), New Zealand, Europe, and Canada unedited, the above omissions {{mean that the}} show has never been broadcast in the United States in its entirety.

Against Yorkshire, Australia scraped home by four wickets in a low-scoring match with ten men after Sam Loxton succumbed to injury. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>later</b> match against Hampshire, Australia ceded a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} tour, but recovered to win by eight wickets.|$|E
