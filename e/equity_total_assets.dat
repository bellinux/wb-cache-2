40|$|Why do firms pay dividends? If they didn’t their asset {{and capital}} {{structures}} would eventually become untenable as {{the earnings of}} successful firms outstrip their investment opportunities. Had they not paid dividends, the 25 largest long-standing 2002 dividend payers would have cash holdings of $ 1. 8 trillion (51 % of total assets), up from $ 160 billion (6 % of assets), and $ 1. 2 trillion in excess of their collective $ 600 billion in long-term debt. Their dividend payments prevented significant agency problems since the retention of earnings would have given managers command over an additional $ 1. 6 trillion without access to better investment opportunities and with no additional monitoring. This logic suggests that firms with relatively high amounts of earned equity (retained earnings) are especially likely to pay dividends. Consistent with this view, the fraction of publicly traded industrial firms that pays dividends is high when the ratio of earned equity to total <b>equity</b> (<b>total</b> <b>assets)</b> is high, and falls with declines in this ratio, becoming near zero when a firm {{has little or no}} earned equity. We observe a highly significant relation between the decision to pay dividends and the ratio of earned equity to total equity or total assets, controlling for firm size, profitability, growth, leverage, cash balances, and dividend history. In our regressions, earned equity has an economically more important impact than does profitability or growth. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that firms pay dividends to mitigate agency problems. ...|$|E

Purpose of study: The main purpose of this thesis is to find out how the stability of banks within Europe have changed due to regulations. Methodology: The thesis will use quantitative methods to gain an understanding of the stability in banks. Financial data from the database Bankscope, which provides data from banks’ annual reports, is collected and analysed. Annual developments are investigated as well as differences between countries. Correlation analysis and regression analysis is performed. Empirical findings and analysis: In general banks have raised their equity ratios and their Tier 1 ratio. There seems to be a positive relationship between <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> and net interest margin. For some periods the NIM-model holds for some countries. Net interest margin seems to be dependent on <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> as well as other variables. This suggests that regulating equity will also affect other variables. Conclusion: The Basel III regulations seem to have the effect of making banks raise their equity ratios, whether this effect also means that banks are more stable is unclear. The differences found between the investigated countries suggests that further studies would be useful to ensure how the regulations are affecting banks in different countries differently, and if banks really are more stable...|$|R

The samplefor this study consists of 84 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia that became financially distressed in 200 / and 2002 and a matched (by industry and firm size) sample 0 / 84 financially healthy companies. The model is constructed by employing logistic regression analysis based on pooled data of 5 years prior tofinancial distress. The model isfirst derived using the estimation sample andthen tested using the validation sample. Adding to the existing research onfinancial distress prediction models, the current model utilizes measures ofshareholders' <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> liabilities, shareholders' <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets,</b> current liabilities to <b>total</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>total</b> borrowings to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> andinventory turnover. The results are encouraging, as the model developed/or predicting corporatefinancial distress in Malaysia is reliable up to 5 years prior to financial distress. II is also believed thai the prediction model can be useful to different groups of users such as policy makers, financial institutions, creditors, managers, bankers, investors and shareholders...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{external}} financing – cash flow relationship under financial frictions for a large panel of Pakistani non-financial firms to understand why more profitable firms need less external funds. We take the ratio of long-term debt plus shareholders’ <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> {{as a proxy for}} external financing. We use three different classification methods to divide firm-year observations into financially constrained and unconstrained. We find a significant negative relationship between cash flow and external financing. We also find that the negative sensitivity of external financing to cash flow is higher for financially unconstrained firms as compared to their financially constrained counterparts.|$|R

40|$|Applying {{stochastic}} frontier cost function, {{this paper}} examines banks cost efficiency in Hong Kong and China {{from the period}} of 1993 to 2012. One main {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate how banks perform differently between Hong Kong and China. A second step regression analysis is also conducted in the frontier to check deterministic factors of cost efficiency. Overall, the yearly mean efficiency ranges from 0. 57 to 0. 83. Compared with Hong Kong, Chinese banks seem to be holistic more efficient but the top ten efficient banks all come from Hong Kong. In the regression results, unconsolidated banks exhibit more cost efficiency than consolidated banks. And the variables INFL (inflation rate), NIM (net interest margin), ROAE (return on average equity) and CTIR (cost to income) indicate positive relationship with inefficiency while LNTA (logarithm of <b>total</b> <b>assets)</b> ETA (<b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets)</b> demonstrate negative relationship with the inefficiency term...|$|R
40|$|ExtractThis {{chapter is}} {{a guide to}} the {{essential}} operating principles and practices of Islamic banking in some 80 countries in the world. This simplified introduction focuses on how such banks make profits following two fundamental methods of pricing their services: (1) Bank deposits and investments are priced using profit-loss-risk-sharing (PLS) contracts in place of interest in conventional banks, and (2) mortgages, leases, and banking services are based on fee and markup instead of interest/fees. The central theme is that this new form of banking that began in 1963 has grown to the present size of about US$ 500 billion in <b>equity,</b> with <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> of US$ 4, 000 billion, making profits successfully in many legal jurisdictions as a new form of pricing banking products...|$|R
