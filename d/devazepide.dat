40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, it {{has been}} shown that {{infusion}} of the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> induced proliferation of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium in the rat liver. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the influence of <b>devazepide</b> and sulfated cholecystokinin- 8 (CCK- 8 S) on the intact rat liver and rat liver after resection. METHODS: In the first experiment, either saline or <b>devazepide</b> was injected subcutaneously twice daily to rats for 18 and 36 h and 3 and 7 days. In the second experiment, a 70 % liver resection was followed by infusion of either DMSO, <b>devazepide,</b> saline or CCK- 8 S for 2 or 7 days. Prior to sacrifice, all rats received 1 mCi/kg of tritiated thymidine intraperitoneally. The liver was excised and the contents of protein, DNA and water and incorporation of tritiated thymidine were measured. RESULTS: Intermittent injections of <b>devazepide</b> increased the liver protein content after 36 h, followed by a decrease after 7 days. The weight, DNA content or cell proliferation was not affected. Two days after liver resection hyperCCKemia was evoked, which was less prominent after 7 days. <b>Devazepide</b> lowered the plasma concentration of CCK, while the infusion of CCK- 8 S resulted in extremely high concentrations at both time points. The DNA synthesis measured by thymidine incorporation was increased by <b>devazepide</b> on day 2, whereas the weight or protein and DNA contents of the liver were not influenced. CCK- 8 S infusion decreased the body and liver weight throughout the study, and the protein and DNA contents after 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent <b>devazepide</b> treatment did not affect the intact liver. <b>Devazepide</b> increased the DNA synthesis 2 days after liver resection but was without other influences on the liver regeneration. CCK- 8 S induced decreased body weight with ensuing negative effects on the liver regeneration. Neither <b>devazepide</b> nor CCK seem to be of any therapeutic use after liver resection or liver failure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{cholecystokinin}} antagonist <b>devazepide</b> on analgesia and respiratory depression induced by morphine in squirrel monkeys were examined. Pain thresholds were deter-mined using the tail withdrawal procedure, in which monkeys restrained in chairs kept their tails in cool (35 #{ 176 }C) water for at least 20 sec, but withdrew them from warm (55 #{ 176 }C) water in less than 4 sec. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in tail withdrawal latencies from warm water. <b>Devazepide</b> (injected i. p. or p. o) {{had no effect on}} tail withdrawal latencies when given alone but enhanced the analgesic effects of morphine. The <b>devazepide</b> dose-response curve for morphine enhancement was bell-shaped with doses of 3, 1 0, 30 and 1 00 pg/kg injected i. p. increasing morphine analgesia whereas higher and lower does did not. In a separate group of monkeys, morphine pro-duced dose-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and oxygen tension and increases in carbon dioxide tension. In contrast to its effects on morphine analgesia, <b>devazepide</b> had no effect on the various indices of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These data suggest that <b>devazepide</b> may have therapeutic utility as an adjuvant to morphine analgesia allowing lower doses of the opiate to be used to relieve pain and reducing the risk of opiate-induced respiratory depression.

IQM- 95, 333 displaced [3 H]-CCK- 8 S binding to CCKA receptors from rat pancreas with a high potency in the nanomolar range. Conversely, the affinity of this new compound at brain CCKB receptors was negligible (IC 50 > 10 [*]μM). IQM- 95, 333 was a more selective CCKA receptor ligand than <b>devazepide</b> and other CCKA receptor antagonists. Like <b>devazepide,</b> IQM- 95, 333 was a more potent antagonist of CCK- 8 S- than of CCK- 4 -induced contraction of the longitudinal muscle from guinea-pig ileum, suggesting selective antagonism at CCKA receptors. IQM- 95, 333 and <b>devazepide</b> were also potent inhibitors of CCK- 8 S-stimulated amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini, a CCKA receptor-mediated effect. The drug concentrations required (IC 50 s around 20 [*]nM) were higher than in binding studies to pancreas homogenates. Low doses (50 – 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) of IQM- 95, 333 and <b>devazepide,</b> without any intrinsic effect on food intake or locomotion, blocked the hypophagia and the hypolocomotion induced by systemic administration of CCK- 8 S, two effects associated with stimulation of peripheral CCKA receptors. IQM- 95, 333 showed an anxiolytic-like profile in the light/dark exploration test in mice over a wide dose range (10 – 5, 000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1). Typical CCKA and CCKB antagonists, <b>devazepide</b> and L- 365, 260 respectively, were only effective within a more limited dose range. In a classical conflict paradigm {{for the study of}} anxiolytic drugs, the punished-drinking test, IQM- 95, 333, <b>devazepide</b> and L- 365, 260 were effective within a narrow dose range. The dose-response curve for the three drugs was biphasic, suggesting that other mechanisms are operative at higher doses. In conclusion, IQM- 95, 333 is a potent and selective CCKA receptor antagonist both in vitro and in vivo with an anxiolytic-like activity in two different animal models, which can only be attributed to blockade of this CCK receptor subtype...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{defect in}} {{gallbladder}} contraction function {{plays a key}} role in the pathogenesis of gallstones. The cholecystokinin- 1 receptor (CCK- 1 R) antagonists have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases in animal studies and clinical trials. However, it is still unknown whether they have a potential effect on gallstone formation. Design: To study whether the CCK- 1 R antagonists enhance cholelithogenesis, we investigated cholesterol crystallization, gallstone formation, hepatic lipid secretion, gallbladder emptying function and intestinal cholesterol absorption in male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice treated by gavage with <b>devazepide</b> (4 mg/day/kg) or vehicle (as controls) twice per day and fed the lithogenic diet for 21 days. Results: During 21 days of feeding, oral administration of <b>devazepide</b> significantly accelerated cholesterol crystallization and crystal growth to microlithiasis, with 40 % of mice forming gallstones, whereas only agglomerated cholesterol monohydrate crystals were found in mice receiving vehicle. Compared to the vehicle group, fasting and postprandial residual gallbladder volumes in response to the high-fat meal were significantly larger in the <b>devazepide</b> group during cholelithogenesis, showing reduced gallbladder emptying and bile stasis. Moreover, <b>devazepide</b> significantly increased hepatic secretion of biliary cholesterol, but not phospholipids or bile salts. The percentage of intestinal cholesterol absorption was higher in devazepide-treated mice, increasing the bioavailability of chylomicron-derived cholesterol in the liver for biliary hypersecretion into bile. These abnormalities induced supersaturated bile and rapid cholesterol crystallization. Conclusions: The potent CCK- 1 R antagonist <b>devazepide</b> increases susceptibility to gallstone formation by impairing gallbladder emptying function, disrupting biliary cholesterol metabolism and enhancing intestinal cholesterol absorption in mice...|$|E
40|$|The Ewing {{family of}} tumors {{is a group}} of highly {{malignant}} tumors that mainly arise in bone and most often affect children and young adults in the first two decades of life. Despite the use of multimodal therapy, the long-term disease-free survival rate of patients with Ewing tumors is still disappointingly low, making the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies all the more necessary. We have recently shown that cholecystokinin (CCK), a neuroendocrine peptide, involved in many biological functions, including cell growth and proliferation, is a relevant target of the EWS/FLI 1 oncoprotein characteristic of Ewing tumors. CCK silencing inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that CCK acts as an autocrine growth factor for Ewing cells. Here, we analyzed the impact of two CCK receptor antagonists, <b>devazepide</b> (a CCK 1 -R antagonist) and L 365 - 260 (a CCK 2 -R antagonist), on the growth of Ewing tumor cells. <b>Devazepide</b> (10 μmol/l) inhibited cell growth of four different Ewing tumor cells in vitro (range 85 - 88 %), whereas the effect of the CCK 2 -R antagonist on cell growth was negligible. In a mouse tumor xenograft model, <b>devazepide</b> reduced tumor growth by 40 %. Flow cytometry experiments showed that <b>devazepide,</b> but not L 365 - 260, induced apoptosis of Ewing tumor cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Infusion of sulphated cholecystokinin- 8 (CCK- 8 S) in rats transiently {{increased}} {{the proliferation of}} pancreatic acinar cells, whereas the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> decreased such proliferation. This effect ceased after 3 days. CCK- 8 S or <b>devazepide</b> injected twice daily induced a persistent effect on the cell proliferation involving the major cells of the exocrine pancreas. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effect of continuous infusion of CCK- 8 S and <b>devazepide</b> on CCK-A receptor gene expression. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received subcutaneous continuous infusion of 5 microg/kg/h CCK- 8 S, 200 microg/kg/h <b>devazepide,</b> or 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) by means of osmotic minipumps. The rats were killed after 4 days; I h before being killed they received 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally. Plasma was collected for analysis of CCK. The pancreas was dissected, and indirect immunofluorescence for BrdU and CCK-A receptor was performed. In situ hybridization to CCK-A receptor mRNA was performed for examination and semiquantification of receptor gene expression. RESULTS: Continuous infusion of CCK- 8 S led to a sixfold increase in plasma CCK and a 40 % increase in pancreatic weight. <b>Devazepide</b> did not affect the CCK level but decreased the pancreatic weight by 24 % compared with BSA-infused rats. The BrdU labeling indicated that CCK- 8 S had no effect on cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence for the CCK-A receptor showed a decreased labeling intensity after CCK- 8 S infusion. The mean optical density of in situ hybridization labeling of the sections from CCK- 8 S-treated rats was decreased to 37 % +/- 3 % of that in controls. <b>Devazepide</b> did not affect the CCK-A receptor gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous stimulation of the CCK-A receptor led to a downregulation of the receptor gene expression in pancreatic acinar cells and decreased labeling of the receptor at immunohistochemistry.

40|$|Although duodenogastric reflux is a {{physiological}} event, excessive reflux {{may be a}} pathogenetic factor in several diseases of the foregut, including cancer. Long term profound duodenogastric reflux produces pancreatic and gastric tumours in rats. The trophic effect of surgically induced duodenogastric reflux on the pancreas was investigated and the mechanisms involved were examined.

Male rats had infusion of sulfated CCK- 8, the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide,</b> or sodium chloride by osmotic minipumps. After 36 h, 3, 7, or 28 d the rats had ip injections of thymidine, and 1 h later they were sacrificed. The pancreas was excised, weighed, and its content of protein, DNA, water, and enzymes was analyzed. Histologic samples were prepared for autoradiography. Pancreatic weight, protein, and DNA were increased at 36 h after the start of CCK infusion and throughout the study period. CCK stimulation also increased the content of trypsin at days 3 and 28.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pancreas}} is {{the main}} target of the trophic effect of cholecystokinin (CCK), with a transient increase in cell proliferation and persistent effect on DNA content and weight gain when given continuously. Whether CCK exerts similar effects on the liver and biliary tract is not known. Most studies on this subject have hitherto {{been done in the}} rat. The aim of the present experiments was therefore to study the possible concomitant trophic effects of CCK on these three organs in a gallbladder-bearing animal, the hamster. METHODS: CCK- 8 S or the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> were infused subcutaneously by osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks in 11 and 7 hamsters, respectively. Fifteen animals served as untreated controls. One hour before sacrifice tritiated thymidine was injected intraperitoneally. Plasma was collected for determination of CCK and the pancreas, liver, common bile duct and gallbladder were excised. The pancreas and liver were weighed and processed for the contents of protein, DNA and water. Tissue specimens were taken for autoradiography. RESULTS: The concentration of CCK in plasma increased fourfold during the infusion of CCK- 8 S. The pancreas and, to a lesser extent, the liver increased in weight, DNA and protein contents after infusion of CCK- 8 S, whereas the pancreas, but not the liver, decreased in weight and protein content after infusion of <b>devazepide.</b> Pancreatic amylase content was increased after CCK- 8 S treatment, but unaffected by <b>devazepide.</b> Labelling index of pancreatic acinar cells, hepatocytes and gallbladder epithelium was no different from that of controls after four weeks of infusion of CCK- 8 S or <b>devazepide.</b> A correlation was found between the concentration of plasma CCK on one hand and the weights and DNA contents in pancreas and liver on the other.

40|$|Cholecystokinin {{and related}} {{peptides}} {{are involved in}} the control of intestinal motility and cholecystokinin receptor ligands might represent new pharmacological tools for the treatment of symptoms associated with functional bowel disorders. However, the respective roles played by cholecystokinin receptor subtypes and the mechanisms underlying these regulatory actions remain undetermined. This study was designed to examine the influence of cholecystokinin receptor subtypes on the motor activity of guinea-pig distal colon. The effects of drugs acting on CCK 1 and CCK 2 receptors were assessed in vitro on the contractile activity of longitudinal smooth muscle, both under basal conditions and in the presence of transmural electrical stimulation or KCl-induced contractions. The application of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate (cholecystokinin- 8 S) to colonic preparations induced concentration-dependent contractions which were prevented by <b>devazepide</b> (CCK 1 receptor antagonist), enhanced by GV 150013 (CCK 2 receptor antagonist) or N(omega) -nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), and unaffected by tetrodotoxin. The application of gastrin- 17 to colonic preparations resulted in relaxant responses which were insensitive to <b>devazepide,</b> and prevented by GV 150013, L-NAME or tetrodotoxin. L-NAME, N(omega) -propyl-L-arginine (NPA, neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or GV 150013 enhanced electrically evoked contractile responses, whereas <b>devazepide</b> did not.

AIMS: To: 1) investigate possible influence of central cholecystokinin pathways on gastric pepsinogen and acid secretions; 2) characterize pharmacological profile {{and location of}} cholecystokinin receptor subtypes involved in gastric effects of centrally applied cholecystokinin- 8 -sulphate (cholecystokinin- 8 S). METHODS: Urethane-anaesthetized rats were subjected to continuous perfusion of gastric lumen. Pepsin levels in perfusate were determined by enzymatic assay based on spectrophotometric measurement of products generated by peptic digestion of bovine haemoglobin. Acidity was measured by automatic potentiometric titration of hydrogen ions. RESULTS: Following intracerebroventricular injection, cholecystokinin- 8 S increased both pepsinogen and acid output. In addition, intravenous cholecystokinin- 8 S stimulated peptic and acid secretions more promptly and at lower doses than after central injection. Stimulant effects of centrally applied cholecystokinin- 8 S were not affected by intracerebroventricular injection of <b>devazepide</b> (cholecystokinin A receptor antagonist) or L- 365, 260 (cholecystokinin B receptor antagonist) or by bilateral vagotomy. However, intravenous <b>devazepide</b> partly antagonized pepsigogue action of intracerebroventricular cholecystokinin- 8 S without affecting its acid hypersecretory effect, whereas after intravenous injection of L- 365, 260 peptic hypersecretion evoked by intracerebroventricular cholecystokinin- 8 S was partially prevented and acid response was completely blocked. Similar effects were exerted by intravenous <b>devazepide</b> and L- 365, 260 against intravenous cholecystokinin- 8 S. A complete blockade of pepsigogue effects induced by intracerebroventricular or intravenous cholecystokinin- 8 S was obtained after combined intravenous treatment with <b>devazepide</b> plus L- 365, 260. Gastric hypersecretory effects of intravenous cholecystokinin- 8 S were not modified by bilateral vagotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Increase in pepsinogen output evoked by centrally applied cholecystokinin- 8 S {{does not depend on}} interaction with central nervous sites.

40|$|Cholecystokinin (CCK) {{is known}} to exert {{secretory}} and trophic effects on the pancreas. Its release from the intestinal mucosa is regulated by pancresic proteases in the small intestine. However, knowledge about the type of responding exocrine cells and {{the time course of}} events during stimulation with CCK is lacking. Further, the role of CCK in the regulation of growth in other digestive organs is not known. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which under some circumstances interacts with CCK, is found in high concentrations in the pancreas and salivary glands but information of the mitogenic effect in these organs is missing. By performing cholecystectomy, diverting bile by pancreatico-biliary diversion (PBD) or biliodigestive shunt (BDS) {{to the middle of the}} small intestine, or by giving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) the effect on plasma CCK and digestive organ growth following altered bile and enzyme flow and enteral nutrition, respectively, were studied. The time course of mitogenic effects of infusion of CCK- 85, the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> and EGF, respectivley, were studied in the exocrine pancreas, salivary glands, liver and bilary ducts. Absence of bile in the upper small intestine, but not altered bile flow, evoked endogenous hyperCCKemia with ensuing pancreatic growth, whereas the liver and gatrointestinal mucosa were unaffected. Stimulation by exogenous CCK or inhibition of exogenous CCK by <b>devazepide</b> rapidly increased or decreased the cell profileration in pancreatic acinar cells, respectivley, followed by corresponding effects on weight, protein and DNA contents. <b>Devazepide</b> also induced hyperplasia in both liver and bilary tract.

Therefore, we had covalently coupled CCK to a 10 kDa polyethylene glycol and showed that this conjugate, PEG-CCK(9), produced a significantly longer anorectic effect than unmodified CCK(9). The present study assessed the dose-dependency of this response {{and the effect of}} two selective CCK(1) receptor antagonists, with different abilities to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), on PEG-CCK(9) -induced anorexia. Experimental approach:Food intake was measured, for up to 23 h, after i. p. administration of different doses (2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mug kg(- 1)) of CCK(9) or PEG-CCK(9) in male Wistar rats. <b>Devazepide</b> (100 mug kg(- 1)), which penetrates the BBB or 2 -NAP (3 mg kg(- 1)), which does not cross the BBB, were coadministered i. p. with PEG-CCK(9) (6 mug kg(- 1)) and food intake was monitored. Key results:In PEG-CCK(9) -treated rats, a clear dose-dependency was seen for both the duration and initial intensity of the anorexia whereas, for CCK(9), only the initial intensity was dose-dependent. Intraperitoneal administration of <b>devazepide</b> or 2 -NAP, injected immediately prior to PEG-CCK(9), completely abolished the anorectic effect of PEG-CCK(9).

40|$|Acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) {{potentially}} {{offers a}} nonphar-macological approach to reduce {{high blood pressure}} (BP). However, 70 % of the patients and animal subjects respond to EA, while 30 % do not. EA acts, in part, through an opioid mechanism in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM) to inhibit sympathoexcitatory reflexes induced by gastric distention. CCK- 8 opposes the action of opioids during analgesia. Therefore, we hypothesized that CCK- 8 in the rVLM antagonizes EA modulation of sympathoexcitatory cardiovas-cular reflex responses. Male rats anesthetized with ketamine and -chloralose subjected to repeated gastric distension every 10 min were examined for their responsiveness to EA (2 Hz, 0. 5 ms, 1 – 4 mA) at P 5 -P 6 acupoints overlying median nerve. Repeated gastric disten-sion every 10 min evoked consistent sympathoexcitatory responses. EA at P 5 -P 6 modulated gastric distension-induced responses. Micro-injection of CCK- 8 in the rVLM reversed the EA effect in seven responders. The CCK 1 receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> microinjected into the rVLM converted six nonresponders to responders by lowering the reflex response from 21 2. 2 to 10 2. 9 mmHg (first vs. second application of EA). The EA modulatory action in rats converted to responders with <b>devazepide</b> was reversed with rVLM microinjection of naloxone (n 6).

To investigate the mechanism by which simmondsin reduces food intake, fasted and free-feeding rats were given simmondsin-supplemented food and simultaneously injected with <b>devazepide,</b> a specific antagonist of peripheral-type cholecystokinin receptors (CCKA receptors). In free-feeding rats, supplementation of food with 0. 5 % simmondsin caused a reduction in food intake of +/- 40 % {{in the period of}} 4 h following food presentation. Intraperitoneal injection of 100 micrograms devazepide/kg body weight prevented this effect. In rats fasted for 20 h, the food intake in the 30 min after presentation of food supplemented with 0. 15 % or 0. 50 % simmondsin was reduced in a dose-related manner; this was also inhibited by simultaneous application of <b>devazepide.</b> It is suggested that peripheral CCKA receptors are involved in the effect of simmondsin on food intake.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} (1) the pharmacological profile of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor subtypes {{involved in the}} regulation of gastric pepsinogen secretion, (2) the influence of gastric acidity on peptic responses induced by CCK- 8 -sulfate (CCK- 8 S) or gastrin-I; and (3) the mechanisms accounting {{for the effects of}} CCK-like peptides on pepsinogen secretion. In anaesthetized rats, i. v. injection of CCK- 8 S or gastrin-I increased both pepsinogen and acid secretion. The pepsigogue effect of CCK- 8 S was higher than that of gastrin-I, whereas acid hypersecretion after CCK- 8 S was lower than that induced by gastrin-I. Peptic output following CCK- 8 S was partly blocked by i. v. injection of the CCK 1 receptor antagonist, <b>devazepide</b> (- 75. 3 %), or the CCK 2 receptor antagonist, L- 365, 260 [3 R(+) -N-(2, 3 -dihydro- 1 -methyl- 2 -oxo- 5 -phenyl- 1 H- 1, 4 -benzodiazepine- 3 yl) -N'-(3 -methyl-phenyl) urea; - 27. 9 %], but was fully prevented by combined administration of <b>devazepide</b> and L- 365, 260. The gastric acid hypersecretory effect of CCK- 8 S was enhanced by <b>devazepide</b> (+ 84. 5 %) and blocked by L- 365, 260. In contrast, the gastric secretory actions of gastrin-I were insensitive to <b>devazepide,</b> but abolished by L- 365, 260. Excitatory effects of CCK- 8 S and gastrin-I were not modified by vagotomy or atropine, whereas cimetidine or alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (irreversible blocker of histidine decarboxylase) partly prevented acid hypersecretion induced by both peptides without affecting their pepsigogue effects. After pretreatment with omeprazole, both CCK- 8 S and gastrin-I failed to stimulate acid secretion, while they increased pepsinogen output. In rats with gastric perfusion of acid solutions, CCK- 8 S or gastrin-I increased peptic output in a pH-independent manner either with or without pretreatment with omeprazole. Ablation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves as well as application of lidocaine to the gastric mucosa failed to modify the excitatory effects of CCK- 8 S or gastrin-I on pepsinogen and acid secretion. Blockade of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase pathway by N(G) -nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester prevented the pepsigogue actions of both CCK- 8 S and gastrin-I (- 61. 8 % and - 71. 7 %, respectively), without affecting the concomitant increase in acid output. In addition, both these peptides significantly increased the release of NO breakdown products into the gastric lumen. The present results suggest that: (1) both CCK 1 and CCK 2 receptors mediate the peptic secretory responses induced by CCK-like peptides; (2) the excitatory inputs of CCK- 8 S and gastrin-I to chief cells are not driven through acid-dependent mechanisms or capsaicin-sensitive afferent sensory nerves; and (3) under in vivo conditions, the stimulant actions of CCK-like peptides on pepsinogen secretion are mediated, at least in part, by an increase in NO generation...|$|E
40|$|Leptin is a {{circulating}} protein {{involved in the}} long-term regulation of food intake and body weight. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released postprandially and elicits satiety signals. We investigated the interaction between leptin and CCK- 8 in the short-term regulation of food intake induced by 24 -hr fasting in lean mice. Leptin, injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) at low doses (4 – 120 μg/kg), which did not influence feeding behavior for the first 3 hr postinjection, decreased food intake dose dependently by 47 – 83 % during the first hour when coinjected with a subthreshold dose of CCK. Such an interaction was not observed between leptin and bombesin. The food-reducing effect of leptin injected with CCK {{was not associated with}} alterations in gastric emptying or locomotor behavior. Leptin–CCK action was blocked by systemic capsaicin at a dose inducing functional ablation of sensory afferent fibers and by <b>devazepide,</b> a CCK-A receptor antagonist but not by the CCK-B receptor antagonist, L- 365, 260. The decrease in food intake which occurs 5 hr after i. p. injection of leptin alone was also blunted by <b>devazepide.</b> Coinjection of leptin and CCK enhanced the number of Fos-positive cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus by 60 %, whereas leptin or CCK alone did not modify Fos expression. These results indicate the existence of a functional synergistic interaction between leptin and CCK leading to early suppression of food intake which involves CCK-A receptors and capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibers...|$|E
40|$|Deficits in {{satiation}} signaling during obesogenic feeding {{have been}} proposed {{to play a role}} in hyperphagia and weight gain in animals prone to become obese. However, whether this impaired signaling is due to high fat (HF) feeding or to their obese phenotype is still unknown. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the effects of CCK- 8 (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 4. 0 mu g/kg) on suppression of food intake of HF-fed obese prone (OP) and resistant (OR) rats. Additionally, we determined the role of endogenous CCK in lipid-induced satiation by measuring plasma CCK levels following a lipid gavage, and tested the effect of pretreatment with <b>devazepide,</b> a CCK- 1 R antagonist on intragastric lipid-induced satiation. Finally, we examined CCK- 1 R mRNA levels in the nodose ganglia. We show that OP rats have reduced feeding responses to the low doses of exogenous CCK- 8 compared to OR rats. Furthermore, OP rats exhibit deficits in endogenous CCK signaling, as pretreatment with <b>devazepide</b> failed to abolish the reduction in food intake following lipid gavage. These effects were associated with reduced plasma CCK after intragastric lipid in OP but not OR rats. Furthermore, HF feeding resulted in downregulation of CCK- 1 Rs in the nodose ganglia of OP rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate that HF feeding leads to impairments in lipid-induced CCK satiation signaling in obese-prone rats, potentially contributing to hyperphagia and weight gain...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cholecystokinin (CCK) {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be involved in}} the development and course of acute pancreatitis. In the present study we measured plasma CCK concentrations in acute experimental pancreatitis (AEP) in the rat, and evaluated the role of circulating CCK levels on the initial pancreatic damage in pancreatitis. METHODS: Endogenous hyperCCKemia was induced by surgical biliodigestive shunt (BDS) and exogenous hyperCCKemia by infusion of CCK- 8 S. The CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> was used to antagonize the effect of CCK. Pancreatitis was induced by pancreatic duct infusion of sodium taurodeoxycholate 4 wk after the BDS operation or 1 wk after the start of the infusions. Nonpancreatitic sham- and BDS-operated rats, respectively, were used as control animals as were groups of otherwise untreated rats with pancreatitis. The animals were sacrificed 6 h after induction of pancreatitis. Concentrations of CCK were determined in plasma as were protein and amylase levels in the pancreas and peritoneal exudates. The extent of pancreatic necroses was assessed microscopically. RESULTS: Pancreatitis caused an 11 - 20 -fold increase of circulating CCK as measured after 6 h. In pancreatitic rats with induced hyperCCKemia, there was a further marked increase of plasma CCK. Pancreatic weight and edema, protein and amylase contents, and extent of necroses were the same regardless of the level of plasma CCK. <b>Devazepide</b> had no influence on the studied pancreatic parameters. CONCLUSION: We conclude that acute taurodeoxycholate-induced pancreatitis in the rat is associated with elevated plasma CCK concentrations. There seems, however, not to be any correlation between the degree of hyperCCKemia and the extent of initial pancreatic damage...|$|E
40|$|Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK- 8) is {{a potent}} corticotroph secretagogue. Consistent with earlier reports, the present results {{demonstrate}} that CCK- 8 administration to rats elevates circulat-ing -endorphin and adrenocorticotropin, but not a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone concentrations.

40|$|Nutrients in the {{intestine}} initiate {{changes in}} secretory and motor {{function of the}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The nature of the ‘sensors’ in the intestinal wall is not well characterized. Intestinal lipid stimulates the release of cholecystokinin (CCK) from mucosal entero-endocrine cells, and it is proposed that CCK activates CCK A receptors on vagal afferent nerve terminals. There is evidence that chylomicron components {{are involved in this}} lipid transduction pathway. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine (1) the pathway mediating reflex inhibition of gastric motility and (2) activation of duodenal vagal afferents in response to chylomicrons. Mesenteric lymph was obtained from awake rats fitted with lymph fistulas during intestinal perfusion of lipid (Intralipid, 170 μmol h− 1, chylous lymph) or a dextrose and/or electrolyte solution (control lymph). Inhibition of gastric motility was measured manometrically in urethane-anaesthetized recipient rats in response to intra-arterial injection of lymph close to the upper GI tract. Chylous lymph was significantly more potent than control lymph in inhibiting gastric motility. Functional vagal deafferentation by perineural capsaicin or CCK A receptor antagonist (<b>devazepide,</b> 1 mg kg− 1, I. V.) significantly reduced chylous lymph-induced inhibition of gastric motility. The discharge of duodenal vagal afferent fibres was recorded from the dorsal abdominal vagus nerve in an in vitro preparation of the duodenum. Duodenal vagal afferent nerve fibre discharge was significantly increased by close-arterial injection of CCK (1 – 100 pmol) in 43 of 83 units tested. The discharge of 88 % of CCK-responsive fibres was increased by close-arterial injection of chylous lymph; <b>devazepide</b> (100 μg, I. A.) abolished the afferent response to chylous lymph in 83 % of these units. These data suggest that in the intestinal mucosa, chylomicrons or their products release endogenous CCK which activates CCK A receptors on vagal afferent nerve fibre terminals, which in turn initiate a vago-vagal reflex inhibition of gastric motor function...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{evidence}} indicates that duodenal lipid sensing engages gut-brain neurocircuits to determine food intake and hepatic glucose production, but a potential role for gut-brain communication in the control of energy expenditure remains to be determined. Here, we tested the hypothesis that duodenal lipid sensing activates a gut-brain-brown adipose tissue neuraxis to regulate thermogenesis. We demonstrate that direct administration of lipids into the duodenum increases brown fat temperature. Co-infusion of the local anesthetic tetracaine with duodenal lipids abolished the lipid-induced increase in brown fat temperature. Systemic administration of the CCKA receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> blocked the ability of duodenal lipids to increase brown fat thermogenesis. Parenchymal administration of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blocker MK- 801 directly into the caudomedial nucleus of the solitary tract also abolished duodenal lipid-induced activation of brown fat thermogenesis. These findings establish that duodenal lipid sensing activates a gut-brain-brown fat axis to determine brown fat temperature, and thereby reveal a previously unappreciated pathway that regulates thermogenesis...|$|E

The present report describes {{the effect of}} nine cholecystokinin 2 (CCK 2) receptor antagonists and one CCK 1 receptor antagonist on the gastrin-evoked secretion of pancreastatin from isolated ECL cells. The CCK 2 receptor antagonists comprised three benzodiazepine derivatives L- 740, 093, YM 022 and YF 476, one ureidoacetamide compound RP 73870, one benzimidazole compound JB 93182, one ureidoindoline compound AG 041 R and three tryptophan dipeptoids PD 134308 (CI 988), PD 135158 and PD 136450. The CCK 1 receptor antagonist was <b>devazepide.</b> A preparation of well-functioning ECL cells (∼ 80 % purity) was prepared from rat oxyntic mucosa using counter-flow elutriation. The cells were cultured for 48 [*]h {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 [*]nM gastrin; they were then washed and incubated with antagonist alone or with various concentrations of antagonist plus 10 [*]nM gastrin (a maximally effective concentration) for 30 [*]min. Gastrin dose-response curves were constructed in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of antagonist. The amount of pancreastatin secreted was determined by radioimmunoassay. The gastrin-evoked secretion of pancreastatin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. YM 022, AG 041 R and YF 476 had IC 50 values of 0. 5, 2. 2 and 2. 7 [*]nM respectively. L- 740, 093, JB 93182 and RP 73870 had IC 50 values of 7. 8, 9. 3 and 9. 8 [*]nM, while PD 135158, PD 136450 and PD 134308 had IC 50 values of 76, 135 and 145 [*]nM.

40|$|The {{ability of}} 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 4 {{receptor}} antagonists {{to modify the}} disinhibitory profile of diazepam and other agents was investigated in male BKW mice in the light/dark test box. The 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 B/ 2 C receptor antagonists ritanserin, MDL 11939 and RP 62203 and also methysergide, which failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone, caused dose-related enhancements (4 to 8 fold) in the potency of diazepam to disinhibit behavioural responding to the aversive situation of the test box. Ritanserin was shown to enhance the disinhibitory potency of other benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (4 fold), temazepam (10 fold) and lorazepam (10 fold), the 5 -HT 1 A receptor ligands, 8 -OH-DPAT (25 fold), buspirone (100 fold) and lesopitron (500 fold), the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron (100 fold) R(+) -zacopride (100 fold) and S(−) -zacopride (greater than a 1000 fold), the substituted benzamides, sulpiride (10 fold) and tiapride (5 to 10 fold) and the cholecystokinin (CCK) A receptor antagonist, <b>devazepide</b> (100 fold). It also reduced the onset of action of disinhibition following treatment with the 5 -HT synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Ritanserin failed to enhance the disinhibitory effects of the CCKB receptor antagonist CI- 988, the angiotensin AT 1 receptor antagonist losarten or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ceranapril. The 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists SDZ 205 - 557, GR 113808 and SB 204070 caused dose-related reductions in the disinhibitory effect of diazepam, returning values to those shown in vehicle treated controls. The antagonists failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone. GR 113808 was also shown to cause a dose-related antagonism of the disinhibitory effects of chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, 8 -OH-DPAT, buspirone, lesopitron, ondansetron, R(+) -zacopride, sulpiride, tiapride, <b>devazepide,</b> CI- 988, losarten, ceranapril and parachlorophenylalanine. It was concluded that in BKW mice (a) the failure of 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists when administered alone to modify behaviour in the light/dark test indicates an absence of an endogenous 5 -HT tone at the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 4 receptors and (b) the enhancement by the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists and attenuation by the 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists of drug-induced disinhibition indicates a plurality of 5 -HT receptor involvement in the mediation of drug-induced disinhibitory profiles in the mouse...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} cell {{proliferation}} by gastrin {{has been investigated}} in a rat pancreatic tumour cell line, AR 4 - 2 J. Exogenous gastrin, 10 (- 12) to 10 (- 8) M, stimulated cell growth of thymidine-synchronised AR 4 - 2 J cells cultured over 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates of AR 4 - 2 J cells contained an average of 4. 5 and 3. 5 pg gastrin per 10 (6) cells, when grown in serum-supplemented or serum-free media, respectively, as revealed by radioimmunoassay. In serum-free medium, AR 4 - 2 J secrete 34 ng 1 (- 1) 10 (- 6) cells of gastrin over 48 h. Addition of an anti-gastrin immunoglobulin preparation, but not control immunoglobulins, caused a maximum 52 % reduction in cell growth. These data are consistent with an autocrine role for gastrin in the control of AR 4 - 2 J cell growth. These results were supported by studies with gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Six non-peptide gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists inhibited AR 4 - 2 J cell growth in a concentration-related manner. The concentration required for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) of cell growth by the amino acid-derived antagonists proglumide (3. 5 x 10 (- 3) M), benzotript (1. 8 x 10 (- 3) M), loxiglumide (1. 1 x 10 (- 4) M) and lorglumide (6. 7 x 10 (- 5) M) were of the same order and significantly correlated with their IC 50 for inhibition of 125 I-gastrin binding to AR 4 - 2 J cells. Inhibition of cell growth by these antagonists was partially reversed {{by the addition of}} exogenous gastrin. In contrast, the IC 50 for inhibition of cell growth with two benzodiazepine-derived antagonists, the CCK-B receptor antagonist L- 365, 260 (4. 6 x 10 (- 5) M) and the CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>devazepide</b> (1. 7 x 10 (- 5) M) were two-three orders of magnitude greater than those required to inhibit gastrin binding (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 7) M). The growth inhibitory effects of L- 365, 260 and <b>devazepide</b> were not reversed by exogenous gastrin suggesting these benzodiazepine-derived antagonists do not inhibit cell growth by interaction with gastrin receptors. The results are consistent with gastrin being an autocrine growth factor in AR 4 - 2 J cells, and that stimulation of cell growth is due to stimulation of the gastrin, rather than CCK-B, receptor sub-type.
