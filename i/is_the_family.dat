R.C. Dhere and Sontheimer suggests that the Sanskrit Mahatmya was composed around 1460-1510 AD, mostly by a Deshastha Brahmin, to whom Khandoba <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> deity. A version is also available in Marathi by Siddhapal Kesasri (1585).

5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight {{was adapted}} into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first {{performed}} in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised {{for maintaining the}} complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth and the Green Knight, first performed in 2002. This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.|$|E
