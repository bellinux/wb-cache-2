40|$|A {{questionnaire}} to assess various elements of public attitudes towards the mentally <b>ill</b> <b>was</b> given to 108 subjects. 5 hypotheses were tested. 1. Public attitudes towards mental illness are more rejecting than accepting. 2. Social rejection increases with increasing severity of disturbance in behaviour. 3. Public attitudes towards the mentally <b>ill</b> <b>are</b> related to social class {{as measured by}} occupational status and to age of the respondent. 4. Rejection of the mentally <b>ill</b> <b>is</b> decreased by {{the availability of a}} non-deviant alternative label. 5. Attitudes of the general population towards the mentally <b>ill</b> will <b>be</b> influenced by the label of mental illness as well as by behaviour indicative of mental illness. All the hypotheses were confirmed with one exception &mdash; negative public attitudes were not found to be related to social class as measured by occupational status. Public attitudes towards the mentally <b>ill</b> <b>are</b> more diverse than previous research would imply. Possible future research directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Interviewer {{attitudes and}} {{expectations}} about respondents {{are known to}} influence data quality. When respondents are from deviant groups, such as the mentally ill, special problems could develop. Questionnaires were completed by 188 individuals from a potential pool of employable interviewers. Preferences for interviewing targets and locations, prior experience, and perceived dangerousness of the mentally <b>ill</b> <b>were</b> measured. The mentally <b>ill</b> <b>are</b> among the least preferred targets. Locations implying higher levels of control and cooperation were desired.

60|$|It is true such {{complaint}} {{might be}} unjust, {{and if the}} officer had such arguments to use as would convince the magistrate that he was right, and that the people had injured him, he was continued and they reproved. But this part could not well bear a particular inquiry, for the parties could very <b>ill</b> <b>be</b> well heard and answered in {{the street from the}} windows, as was the case then. The magistrates, therefore, generally chose to favour the people and remove the man, as what seemed to be the least wrong and of the least ill consequence; seeing if the watchman was injured, yet they could easily make him amends by giving him another post of the like nature; but if the family was injured, there was no satisfaction could be made to them, the damage perhaps being irreparable, as it concerned their lives.|$|E

Still, lady, as I have been so long in making my way across, it may be that King Richard has been similarly delayed without danger befalling him, and it could hardly be that so important a man as the King of England would be detained, or come to any misfortune, without the news being bruited abroad." ...|$|E

40|$|Louping <b>ill</b> <b>is</b> a tick-borne, zoonotic, {{viral disease}} {{that is most}} {{important}} in sheep and red grouse. Severe clinical signs {{can be seen in}} naive sheep flocks moved into endemic areas. Many animals may develop neurological disease, and up to 60 % of the flock can die. In endemic areas, most losses occur among unvaccinated younger sheep that are no longer protected by maternal antibodies. Louping <b>ill</b> <b>is</b> a serious problem in red grouse populations; few chicks may survive in some endemic areas. The mortality rate can be as high as 80 % in experimentally infected birds. Cases of louping <b>ill</b> <b>are</b> also reported occasionally in other species including goats, llamas, alpacas, swine, horses and deer. Humans can develop flu-like symptoms or neurological signs after exposure, but the illness is rarely fatal...|$|R
