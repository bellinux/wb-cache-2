5|$|Albert {{promoted}} {{many public}} educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings {{in connection with}} these <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, {{he was invited to}} speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
25|$|Within Japan, Koizumi {{pushed for}} new ways to {{revitalise}} the moribund economy, aiming to act against bad debts with commercial banks, privatize the postal savings system, and reorganize the factional structure of the LDP. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for a period of painful restructuring in order to improve the future.|$|E
2500|$|He {{tells the}} Nephites {{that they are}} the [...] "other sheep" [...] that <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> to <b>the</b> Jews. <b>He</b> tells them there are yet other sheep that he will visit.|$|R
5|$|Support for authoritarian governments. In 1985, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> approvingly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governments <b>of</b> Francisco Franco of Spain and António Salazar of Portugal, {{noting that}} their {{neutrality}} in World War II had spared their peoples <b>the</b> suffering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|R
50|$|For a {{short period}} during the post-war {{reconstruction}} period, Lafore worked for the American State Department in Paris, France. <b>He</b> later <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contrast between <b>the</b> superficial luxury <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace where they had their offices and the freezing conditions, which required personnel to wear overcoats indoors.|$|R
25|$|Although sharia is {{not part}} of the British legal system, several British {{establishment}} figures have supported its use in areas of dispute resolution in Islamic communities. For example, in February 2008 Rowan Williams the Archbishop of Canterbury (the head of the Church of England) lectured at the Royal Courts of Justice on Islam and English Law. In this lecture <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility of using sharia in some circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Turner won the byelection, {{increasing}} the Conservative majority from 3,606 to 7,198. In his maiden speech, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for better supply of metals to the factories of his constituency. Later that year, Turner spoke {{on behalf of}} fellow former prisoners of war {{in support of a}} motion calling for compensation. He declared that he was lucky to survive, had never seen a bandage issued by the Japanese, and that prisoners had never received any Red Cross supplies.|$|E
25|$|As the Paroubeks {{were not}} Catholics but freethinkers, {{there were no}} prayers, and the service was read by Rudolf Jaromír Pšenka, editor of the Bohemian Chicago Daily Svornost. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need to {{cooperate}} with police to find Elsie's killers. As the undertaker went to lift the coffin into the hearse, Karolina begged him to open it {{so she could see}} Elsie's face once more, but her relatives persuaded her not to insist on this and led her away. Most of the attendees followed Elsie's casket to Bohemian National Cemetery, where Pšenka gave another address.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{particular}} ruthlessness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alemanni in destroying Christian sanctuaries and plundering churches {{while the}} genuine Franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries. Agathias expresses his {{hope that the}} Alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the Franks, which is by all appearances, {{in a manner of}} speaking, what eventually happened.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> {{extensively}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing estrangement {{between people}} and <b>the</b> primordial power <b>of</b> nature, and his gardens are full of hybrid symbols that seek to reveal the cultural and natural histories their sites. Traditional garden forms are reinterpreted with modern materials and attempt to reengage the viewer with the ever developing continuum of Japanese culture.|$|R
50|$|Aside from rare {{instances}} of mild criticism, Sheikh Shaaban and the IUM were {{careful not to}} antagonize the Syrian authorities, particularly after Syria defeated their militia in late 1986. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> favorably <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian military presence in Lebanon {{as a framework for}} unified, armed action against Israel, a policy which was continued by its successors in the 1990s.|$|R
25|$|When the new Congress {{convened in}} 1935, {{there were only}} twenty-five Republican senators, and Vandenberg {{was one of the}} most {{effective}} opponents of the second New Deal. He voted against most Roosevelt-sponsored measures, notable exceptions being the Banking Act of 1935 and the Social Security Act. He pursued a policy of what he called fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, states' rights, and reduced taxation. He felt that Franklin Roosevelt had usurped the powers of Congress, and <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dictatorship of Roosevelt. But at the 1936 Republican National Convention, Vandenberg refused to permit the party to nominate him for Vice President, anticipating Roosevelt's victory that year.|$|E
25|$|He {{described}} previous rulers in China, underlined {{the importance}} of the revolt by Huang Chao in the late Tang dynasty, and mentioned, though less detailed than for India, Chinese beliefs. His brief portrayal of Southeast Asia stands out for its degree of accuracy and clarity. He surveyed the vast areas inhabited by Turkic peoples, commenting on what had been the extensive authority of the Khaqan, though this was no longer the case by al-Mas‘udi's time. He conveyed the great diversity of Turkic peoples, including the distinction between sedentary and nomadic Turks. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance of the Khazars and provided much fresh material on them.|$|E
25|$|In March 1714, Herville, the French envoy in London, sent to de Torcy, the French foreign minister, the {{substance}} of two long conversations with Bolingbroke in which the latter advised patience till after the accession of George I, when a great reaction {{was to be expected}} in favour of the Pretender. At the same time, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treachery of Marlborough and Berwick, and of one Other (presumably Oxford) whom he refused to name, all of whom were in communication with Hanover. Both Oxford and Bolingbroke warned James Stuart that he could have little chance of success unless he changed his religion, but the latter's refusal {{does not appear to have}} stopped the communications.|$|E
2500|$|Antoine de [...] Noailles, the French ambassador, said in {{a letter}} that Rogers' death {{confirmed}} the alliance between the Pope and England. <b>He</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support given to Rogers by <b>the</b> greatest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people: [...] "even his children assisted at it, comforting him in such a manner that it seemed {{as if he had been}} led to a wedding." ...|$|R
50|$|Born in Peckham Rye, London on 7 July 1909, Grandad {{stated that}} his {{earliest}} memories were <b>of</b> watching <b>the</b> soldiers marching off to World War I and witnessing their return after the armistice in 1918. <b>He</b> later <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horror <b>of</b> these experiences with his description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wartime government policy ("They promised us homes fit for heroes, we got heroes fit for homes!").|$|R
2500|$|A report made by Denison to <b>the</b> Secretary <b>of</b> State, {{in which}} <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> unfavourably <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonists as a whole, was printed as a {{parliamentary}} paper, Denison naturally became very unpopular, and this unpopularity was not lessened by his attitude to the anti-transportation movement. He, however, succeeded in conciliating some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizens by granting [...] {{of land in}} Hobart as a site for an unsectarian school.|$|R
25|$|Surviving crewmembers of Bismarck {{state that}} they {{received}} this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of Lütjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and {{that they may not}} reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted Lütjens' words to mean the Admiral did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U-boats and Luftwaffe that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon Lütjens received messages of best wishes from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. Lütjens purportedly stuffed the paper into his pocket without comment.|$|E
25|$|In President Aquino's fourth {{state of}} the nation address (SONA), <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government's {{achievement}} of zero backlog in facilities such as classrooms, desks and chairs, and textbooks which has addressed the gap in the shortages of teachers, what with 56,085 new teachers for the 61, 510 teaching items in the year 2013. However, the data gathered by the Department of Education shows that during the opening of classes (June 2013), the shortages in classrooms was pegged at 19, 579, 60 million shortages when it came to textbooks, 2.5 million shortages with regard to chairs, and 80, 937 shortages of water and sanitation facilities. Furthermore, 770 schools in Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao were considered overcrowded. The Department of Education also released data stating that 91% of the 61, 510 shortages in teachers was filled up alongside appointments (5, 425 to be specific) are being processed.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Marconi {{companies}} {{gained a}} reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio-telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with continuous-wave transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was the location for the first entertainment radio broadcasts in the United Kingdom in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring Dame Nellie Melba. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the Marconi Research Centre at Great Baddow, forming the prelude to the BBC, and <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with Florence Tyzack Parbury, and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.|$|E
50|$|In 1897 Kerby {{returned}} to CUA {{as its first}} professor <b>of</b> sociology. <b>He</b> often <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{need to get to}} <b>the</b> root causes <b>of</b> poverty rather than solely focusing on immediate relief for those in need. Kerby advocated using social remedies to alleviate poverty. He embraced <b>the</b> progressive reforms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period calling for child labor laws, fair wages, and public health reforms. Kerby was a strong supporter of high education for women.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> main {{character}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cartoon strip Krazy Kat {{spoke in a}} slightly exaggerated phonetically-rendered version of early-20th century Yat; friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Orleans-born cartoonist George Herriman recalled that <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same distinctive pronunciations.|$|R
50|$|Elected {{archbishop}} of Ephesus on February 27, 1668, apostolic nuncio in Tuscany since June 1, 1668; Nuncio to Cologne since 29 November 1672; as Nuncio in Poland, from 30 September 1680 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fight against the}} Turks.|$|R
25|$|De Gaulle {{initially}} reacted angrily to {{news of the}} Royal Navy’s {{attack on}} the French fleet (3 July); Pétain and others wrongly blamed him for provoking it by his 26 June speech (in fact it had been planned at least as early as 16 June). He considered withdrawing to Canada to live as a private citizen and waited five days before broadcasting. Spears called on de Gaulle on 5 July and found him “astonishingly objective” and acknowledging {{that it was the}} right thing from the British point of view. Spears reported to Churchill that de Gaulle had shown “a splendid dignity”. In his broadcast of 8 July <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “pain and anger” caused by the attack and that it was a “hateful tragedy not a glorious battle”, but that one day the enemy would have used the ships against England (sic) or the French Empire, and that the defeat of England would mean “bondage forever” for France. “Our two ancient nations … remain bound to one another. They will either go down both together or both together they will win”.|$|E
25|$|The {{visions of}} the Virgin Mary {{appearing}} to three shepherd children at Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal, in 1917 were declared worthy of belief by the Catholic Church in 1930. Seven popes — Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis — have supported the Fátima messages as supernatural. John Paul I met with Sister Lúcia on July 11, 1977, {{while he was still}} Cardinal Patriarch of Venice. He reported being deeply moved by the experience and vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia as Lucia said Mary had asked. John Paul II was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Fátima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima. Pope Paul VI sent a Golden Rose to the shrine in 1964, and Benedict XVI, on May 13, 2010, prayed in the Chapel of the Apparitions at the shrine and gave a second Golden Rose to Our Lady of Fátima. Before a gathering of more than 500,000 pilgrims, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fátima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "flag of Sharia" [...] {{flying over}} Downing Street by 2020, claimed that some Muslim {{families}} in east London were having [...] "10or12 children each", and that hundreds were converting to Islam each day. [...] Choudary has spoken against {{elements of the}} Christian faith. [...] In December 2008 he posted a sermon on an Islamic website, in which he stated: [...] "Every Muslim {{has a responsibility to}} protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to hellfire. [...] Protect your Paradise from being taken away – protect yourself and your family from Christmas".|$|E
50|$|Graham {{appeared}} on The Price Is Right on June 24, 2009. In the showcase <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> on one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prizes {{which was a}} vacation to Seattle, to go to any 2 home games of Seattle Sounders and watch them play.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} as an MP <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> in {{parliament}} on many matters. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam war and military conscription. He urged <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> nuclear power capacity for peaceful purposes and for deterrent purposes in case of war.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Applewhite posted {{some of his}} teachings on the Internet, but he was stung by the {{resulting}} criticism. That year, <b>he</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> suicide {{as a way to}} reach the Next Level. He explained that everything [...] "human" [...] had to be forsaken, including the human body, before one could ascend. The organization was then renamed [...] "Heaven's Gate". Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth.|$|R
500|$|Shortly after Greece's {{defeat in}} the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, shots were fired at Olga's husband and {{daughter}} by disgruntled Greeks in 1898. Despite the failed assassination, Olga insisted on continuing her engagements without a military guard. Her son Nicolas wrote in his memoirs that one day <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of public opinion to his mother, and she retorted, [...] "I prefer to be governed by a well born lion rather than four hundred rats like me." [...] Olga's interest in political and public opinion was limited. Although she favored Greece's Russian party, she had no political influence over her husband and did not seek political influence in the Greek parliament.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|E
500|$|While {{teaching}} at Syracuse, Cressey continued his travels, and in 1937, he visited Moscow, {{where he was}} invited to consult on the production of the Great Soviet World Atlas. [...] After his trip to Moscow, Cressey traveled widely in the Soviet Union, and after returning to the United States <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great economic potential of the country, despite anti-Soviet sentiment. [...] As a result, he earned [...] "the trust and gratitude of his Soviet colleagues," [...] allowing him access to their knowledge and resources. [...] Cressey also spent the 1930s developing the academic offerings at Syracuse, building [...] "one of the best Master of Arts programs in geography available in the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|Miliband {{described}} himself as a new type of Labour politician, looking to move beyond <b>the</b> divisiveness <b>of</b> Blairism and Brownism, and calling {{for an end to the}} [...] "factionalism and psychodramas" [...] of Labour's past. <b>He</b> also repeatedly <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirement for a [...] "new politics".|$|R
2500|$|Gülen {{criticized the}} Turkish-led Gaza {{flotilla}} {{for trying to}} deliver aid without Israel's consent to Palestinians in Gaza. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> watching <b>the</b> news coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deadly confrontation between Israeli commandos and multinational aid group members as its flotilla approached Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. He said, [...] "What I saw was not pretty, it was ugly." [...] He has since continued his criticism, saying later that the organizers' failure to seek accord with Israel before attempting to deliver aid was [...] "a sign of defying authority, and will not lead to fruitful matters." ...|$|R
500|$|During <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2016 {{election}} cycle, Romney expressed sympathy toward Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton {{since she}} had also experienced claims of not being relatable. She was also puzzled by Republican front-runner Donald Trump's success despite touting his wealth whereas the Romneys had not, yet still were criticized for not relating to common voters because of theirs. Though highly critical of her husband after <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> negatively <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trump candidacy in March 2016, Trump praised Ann Romney as [...] "a lovely woman".|$|R
