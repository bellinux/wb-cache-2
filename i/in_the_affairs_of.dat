5|$|Early in the 1190s, the Georgian {{government}} began to interfere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> the Ildenizids {{and of the}} Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E

5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic. He was allowed to work as law agent in the lower courts, and – being well-known and popular – set up a successful law practice. Until {{the end of his}} life he kept a healthy interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> the state, especially in land cases.|$|E

5|$|The Seaforth's royalist inclinations led to Lewis {{becoming}} garrisoned {{during the}} Wars of the Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway and in 1645 Lewismen fought on the royalist {{side at the}} Battle of Auldearn.

He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al Itibar.|$|E
5|$|The strenuous {{campaign}} took {{a decisive}} toll on Helm's already weakened body. He {{was too weak}} to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's secretary of state read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> the states. Though he promised protections for blacks, he opposed the idea of black suffrage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Acre, Edward's {{international}} role changed {{from that of a}} diplomat to an antagonist. He had long been deeply involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> his own Duchy of Gascony. In 1278 he assigned an investigating commission to his trusted associates Otto de Grandson and the chancellor Robert Burnell, which caused the replacement of the seneschal Luke de Tany. In 1286, Edward visited the region himself and stayed for almost three years. The perennial problem, however, was the status of Gascony within the kingdom of France, and Edward's role as the French king's vassal. On his diplomatic mission in 1286, Edward had paid homage to the new king, Philip IV, but in 1294 Philip declared Gascony forfeit when Edward refused to appear before him in Paris to discuss the recent conflict between English, Gascon, and French sailors (that had resulted in several French ships being captured, along with the sacking of the French port of La Rochelle).|$|E
5|$|Although Louis {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with the Republic of Genoa in October 1352, he did not intervene in the Genoese–Venetian War, because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force. Louis married Elizabeth of Bosnia, who {{was the daughter of}} his vassal, Stephen II, in 1353. Historian Gyula Kristó says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> the Balkan Peninsula. While he was hunting in Zólyom County (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a brown bear attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on his legs. Louis's life was saved by a knight of the court, John Besenyő, who killed the beast with his sword.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{the series}} of secessionist movements, the eighteenth century saw the {{formation}} of a number of minor sects. These included the Glasites, formed by Church of Scotland minister John Glas, who was expelled from his parish of Tealing in 1730 for his objections to the state's intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> the kirk. He advocated a strong form of biblical literalism. With his son-in-law Robert Sandeman, from whose name they are known as the Sandemanians, he founded a number of churches in Scotland and the sect expanded to England and the United States. Closely involved with the Glasites were the followers of industrialist David Dale who broke with the kirk in the 1760s and formed the Old Scotch Independents, sometimes known as the Daleists. He preached a combination of industry and faith that led him to co-found the cotton-mill at New Lanark and to contribute to the Utopian Socialism associated with his son-in-law Robert Owen.|$|E
5|$|Concurrent {{with his}} {{political}} career, Slaughter took {{a leading role}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> his church. He was born into {{the tradition of the}} Church of England, but soon became associated with the Baptist congregation at Shawnee Run. He served as a messenger from this congregation to the various associations with which it was connected for over thirty years. One such association was the South District Association; Slaughter served as clerk at that body's annual meeting in 1808 and 1809, and later served as its moderator for nine years. In 1813, he helped found the Kentucky Bible Society.|$|E
5|$|Governance of {{the states}} is divided between the federal and the state governments, with {{different}} powers reserved for each, and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. Lower-level administration is carried out by local authorities, which include city councils, district councils, and municipal councils, although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by {{the federal and state}} governments to deal with certain tasks. The federal constitution puts local authorities outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government, although in practice the federal government has intervened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> state local governments. There are 144 local authorities, consisting of 11 city councils, 33 municipal councils, and 97 district councils.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} Cagliostro is {{shrouded}} in rumour, propaganda, and mysticism. Some effort was expended to ascertain his true identity {{when he was}} arrested because <b>of</b> possible participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Affair</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Diamond Necklace.|$|R

5|$|Guy's reign {{was troubled}} {{by the threat of}} the Ottoman Turks, against whom, {{according}} to the Chronographia regum francorum, he proved a courageous leader. To strengthen the security of his domains, on 22 July 1362, Guy became a Venetian citizen, a development that heralded active Venetian involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> the area. Two years later, soon after his arrival in the Morea, he was involved in the civil war over possession of the Principality of Achaea between Philip II of Taranto and Maria of Bourbon, widow of Philip's older brother Robert, who died in September 1364 without a direct heir. Guy, along with the Despot of the Morea Manuel Kantakouzenos, supported Maria and her son Hugh of Lusignan until 1370, when the latter sold their claims to Philip.|$|E
5|$|In 963, {{following}} the death of Emperor Romanos II, Nikephoros {{turned his attention to the}} power struggle that saw him ascend the imperial throne. The defeats of the previous years, and particularly the occupation of Aleppo, had dealt a heavy blow on Sayf al-Dawla's power and authority. At the same time, the Hamdanid prince also suffered from physical decline, with the onset of hemiplegia as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, that henceforth confined him to a litter. The disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> his state; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, Qarquya, and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior lieutenants to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that increasingly occurred in his domains.|$|E
5|$|In {{part due}} to his {{advanced}} years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>affairs</b> <b>of</b> other states, including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo.|$|E
