5|$|Sea snakes do {{not occur}} in the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought that Pelamis would be found there were <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cold {{currents}} off Namibia and western South Africa that keep it from crossing into the eastern South Atlantic, or south of 5° latitude along the South American west coast. Sea snakes {{do not occur}} in the Red Sea, believed {{to be due to}} its increased salinity, so no danger exists of them crossing through the Suez Canal. A lack of salinity is also thought to be the reason why Pelamis has not crossed into the Caribbean via the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{settlement}} emboldened the Hungarians, {{who decided}} that Moscow could be defied. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October {{turned into a}} popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, {{and the next morning}} that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions {{for the rest of his}} life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.|$|E

5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist were <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: {{it is not clear that}} creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, were <b>it</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E
