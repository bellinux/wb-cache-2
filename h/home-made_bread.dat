In Newfoundland folklore, the most popular type of fairy protection is bread, varying from stale bread to hard tack or a slice of fresh <b>home-made</b> <b>bread.</b> Bread {{is associated with the}} home and the hearth, as well as with industry and the taming of nature, and as such, seems to be disliked by some types of fairies. On the other hand, in much of the Celtic folklore, baked goods are a traditional offering to the folk, as are cream and butter. “The prototype of food, and therefore a symbol of life, bread was one of the commonest protections against fairies. Before going out into a fairy-haunted place, it was customary to put a piece of dry bread in one’s pocket.” In County Wexford, Ireland, in 1882, it was reported that “if an infant is carried out after dark a piece of bread is wrapped in its bib or dress, and this protects it from any witchcraft or evil.” ...|$|E

Comfortable they certainly were, but neither gorgeous nor even grand; indeed, considering the money that had been spent there, the eye and taste {{might have been better}} served; there was an air of heaviness about the rooms which might have been avoided without any sacrifice of propriety; colours might have been better chosen and lights more perfectly diffused; but perhaps in doing so the thorough clerical aspect of the whole might have been somewhat marred; at any rate, it was not without ample consideration that those thick, dark, costly carpets were put down; those embossed, but sombre papers hung up; those heavy curtains draped so as to half exclude the light of the sun: nor were these old-fashioned chairs, bought at a price far exceeding that now given for more modern goods, without a purpose. The breakfast-service on the table was equally costly and equally plain; the apparent object had been to spend money without obtaining brilliancy or splendour. The urn was of thick and solid silver, as were also the tea-pot, coffee-pot, cream-ewer, and sugar-bowl; the cups were old, dim dragon china, worth about a pound a piece, but very despicable {{in the eyes of the}} uninitiated. The silver forks were so heavy as to be disagreeable to the hand, and the bread-basket was of a weight really formidable to any but robust persons. The tea consumed was the very best, the coffee the very blackest, the cream the very thickest; there was dry toast and buttered toast, muffins and crumpets; hot bread and cold bread, white bread and brown bread, <b>home-made</b> <b>bread</b> and bakers' bread, wheaten bread and oaten bread; and if there be other breads than these, they were there; there were eggs in napkins, and crispy bits of bacon under silver covers; and there were little fishes in a little box, and devilled kidneys frizzling on a hot-water dish; which, by the bye, were placed closely contiguous to the plate of the worthy archdeacon himself.

40|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{electrical}} ovens, it is often found that in the households of the lower-income communities, a <b>home-made</b> steamed <b>bread</b> is prepared in a saucepan on a gas cooker or an open fire. The requirements of flour used to produce high-quality steamed bread are poorly defined. The suitability of Western and Southern Cape wheat for steamed bread production was, therefore, investigated. A marked increase in the nutritive value of steamed bread was reported compared to that of conventionally baked bread, mainly due to the loss of available lysine during conventional baking. Samples of three spring wheat cultivars that were produced during the 1995 and 1996 seasons in the Western and Southern Cape were selected. Flour protein content of these samples varied between 8 and 16 %. Flour protein content, Falling Number determinations, gluten content, Mixograph, Alveograph and Rheofermentometer measurements and the 10 g baking test were performed on each of the flours. Steamed and conventionally baked breads were prepared for each cultivar at the four selected flour protein levels, respectively. Total bread volume, weight, height and texture, crust and crumb colour and lysine availability were measured for each loaf of bread. None of the Rheofermentometer measurements correlated significantly with flour protein content or any of the analytical and rheological measurements performed on the flour. All the crust colour parameters of conventionally baked bread correlated significantly with flour protein content. Even though significant correlation was observed for three crust colour parameters of steamed bread, the correlation was lower compared to that of conventionally baked bread. At the four different protein levels, more variation was observed in the elasticity of conventionally baked bread compared to the steamed bread, the texture of the steamed bread was finer and firmer and the crumb was more sticky. The browning reaction occurring in conventionally baked bread results in less available lysine than would be the case for steamed bread. In this study, higher availability of lysine was only the case when steamed bread was produced from high protein flour. Western and Southern Cape spring wheat, irrespective of protein content are, therefore, suitable for the production of good quality steamed bread. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Acrylamide (AA) is a {{probable}} human carcinogen and undesirable contaminant which {{is produced by}} the reaction of reducing sugars with asparagine in plant foods during their thermal treatment above 120 °C. AA is most often determined by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS in isolates from the matrix {{in a wide range}} of foods. According to our observations, AA intake from food is higher among young people (from 1. 8 to 3. 8 µg/kg bw/day), which is consistent with the estimations of JECFA FAO/WHO from the year 2006. Considering the health risk, it is recommended to reduce AA formation in food during its processing, in particular exploiting the available experience. The aim of this thesis was to extend the knowledge of the possibility of AA elimination in selected types of thermally processed foods. The study was focused on cereal foods that contribute significantly to AA exposure, especially bread and sweet biscuits. The whole AA content in the bread is in the crust, which represents 5 - 15 % of the bread. Crust of <b>home-made</b> <b>bread</b> contains approximately 30 - 75 µg/kg, however the marketed bread contains 2 to 10 times more of AA. This is due to the composition of bread mix, preparation conditions and baking. For maintaining the quality of <b>home-made</b> <b>bread</b> during the dry mixture shelf-life, optimization of bread mixtures was designed by increasing of yeast content, which proved positive effect on the reduction of AA content at sufficiently high activity of the yeast. Monitoring of AA content in assortment of sweet bakery products showed higher levels of AA in diabetic biscuits containing fructose instead of sucrose. Three of them even exceeded the reference value (500 µg/kg) more than 1. 5 times for commodity "cookies". Elimination of AA by applications of the enzyme asparaginase has been designed for minimal interference in technology of their production. The concentration of the enzyme and the appropriate method of its use in industrial environment have been tested previously in model systems. In optimized conditions of the enzyme application, AA content in diabetic biscuits was reduced by more than 40 % without affecting the organoleptic properties of the final product. Effect of the antioxidants on AA formation was also part of the study. AA content in gingerbread was reduced efficiently by the use of fennel, anise, cloves, vanilla and white pepper (by about 9 - 21 %). Conversely, coriander and cinnamon significantly increased its content (by 18 - 54 %). Since correlations between the DPPH• radical quenching activity of the spice extracts and AA content was not observed, the final content of AA was probably influenced by the chemical composition of spices and reactivity of the individual components in the matrix. Investigated methods appear to be suitable ways of elimination AA in some foods; however their specific use must be optimized with regard to the composition of the food, processing and the technology used. Estimated impact of application of the above-mentioned methods to the overall elimination of AA exposure showed that its intake in high school students from the Czech and Slovak Republic can be reduced on average by 10 %. This decrease is a success to reduce the possible risk of cancer disease by eating foods with a high AA content. It is also important piece of information for food producers for further development of relevant methods for AA elimination which would help to reduce the AA intake from foods even more...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate whether there is an association between Obstructive Airways Disease (OAD) and indoor exposure to baking <b>home-made</b> <b>bread</b> smoke (BHBS) in ground oven at home. In this hospital-based case–control study, 83 patients with OAD (cases) were compared with 72 patients without any known pulmonary diseases from the surgical ward (controls) who were frequently matched with cases on age. The interview was performed using the modified questionnaire recommended by the "American Thoracic Society". The questionnaire comprised of demographic information, occupational history, cigarette smoking and indoor exposure to BHBS in ground oven at home. The exposure to BHBS was considered both as a dichotomous and quantitative variable (number of years being exposed to smoke) and the population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated due to BHBS exposure. The percentage of indoor exposure to BHBS was measured as 51. 8 % and 30. 6 % in the cases and the controls, respectively. The average years of exposure to BHBS was 20. 46 years (SD: 11. 60) for the cases and 15. 38 years (SD: 13. 20) for the controls. The univariate analysis comparing the cases and the controls showed that exposure to BHBS (as a binary variable) and occupational exposure to dust was significantly associated with OAD. In the multivariate model, only exposure to BHBS was associated with OAD (OR= 2. 22, 95 %CI = 1. 14 - 4. 35). Duration of exposure to BHBS (as a quantitative variable) was significantly associated with OAD in the univariate model. In the multivariate model, only the duration of exposure to BHBS (years) showed a significant association with OAD (OR= 1. 04, 95 % CI= 1. 01 - 1. 08). Population attributable risk due to BHBS exposure was equal to 28. 5 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{opportunity}} to {{study the effects of}} methylmercury poisoning in humans was provided by the large outbreak in Iraq in 1971 - 2. In adults, poisoning resulted from the ingestion of <b>home-made</b> <b>bread</b> prepared from methylmercury-treated seed grain and there was a highly significant correlation between the amount of bread ingested and blood mercury levels. Poisoning in infants resulted either from prior exposure in utero or from suckling or both. Blood mercury levels were higher in infants and children than in adults. There was no increased incidence of congenital defects. Symptoms and signs of poisoning and histopathological changes were mainly confined to the CNS. Symptoms developed, on average, 1 - 2 months after exposure. In children there was mental retardation with delayed onset of speech and impaired motor, sensory and autonomic function. Severely affected children were blind and deaf. In adults, the clinical picture could be classified as 1, mild (mainly of sensory symptoms) 2, moderate (sensory symptoms accompanied by cerebellar signs) and 3, severe (gross ataxia with marked visual and hearing loss which, in some cases, progressed to akinetic mutism followed by coma). Grades 1 and 2 carried a better prognosis thant grade 3. Interference with transmission at the myoneural junction was found in 14 % of patients studied. There was no evidence of peripheral nerve involvement per se and sensory symptoms may be of central origin. The clinical differences between the Iraqi and Japanese outbreaks may be a result, in part at least, of the severe, prolonged and continuous exposure which occurred in the latter outbreak. Improvement was observed among the mild and moderate group. Treatment with chelating agents, thiol resin, haemodialysis and exchange transfusion lowered blood mercury concentrations but produced no convincing clinical benefit. To be effective, treatment may need to be instituted soon after exposure...|$|E

The univariate analysis comparing the cases and the controls showed that exposure to BHBS (as a binary variable) and occupational exposure to dust was significantly associated with OAD. In the multivariate model, only exposure to BHBS was associated with OAD (OR= 2. 22, 95 %CI = 1. 14 - 4. 35). Duration of exposure to BHBS (as a quantitative variable) was significantly associated with OAD in the univariate model. In the multivariate model, only the duration of exposure to BHBS (years) showed a significant association with OAD (OR= 1. 04, 95 % CI= 1. 01 - 1. 08). Population attributable risk due to BHBS exposure was equal to 28. 5 %. Â© 2012 Qorbani and Yunesian...|$|E
