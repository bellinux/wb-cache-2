In this work, we present a growth scheme for radial nanowire quantum-well structures in the AlGaInP material system using a GaInP nanowire core as a template for radial growth with GaInP as the active layer for emission and AlGaInP as charge carrier barriers. The different layers were analyzed by X-ray diffraction to ensure lattice-matched radial structures. Furthermore, we evaluated the material composition and heterojunction interface sharpness by scanning transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The electro-optical properties were investigated by <b>injection</b> <b>luminescence</b> measurements. The presented results can be a valuable track toward radial nanowire light-emitting diodes in the AlGaInP material system in the red/orange/yellow color spectrum...|$|E
40|$|High quality GaN layers doped with Mg {{were grown}} on Si(111) {{substrates}} using high temperature AlN as buffer layer by using radio-frequency {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (RF-MBE). Nickel ohmic contacts and Schottky contacts using indium was fabricated on Mg-doped p-GaN films. The light emission has been obtained from these thin film electroluminescent devices. These thin film electroluminescent devices were operated under direct current bias. Schottky and ohmic contacts used as cathode and anode were employed in these investigations. Alternatively, two Schottky contacts could be probed as cathode and anode. Thin film electroluminescent devices were able to emit light. However, electrical and optical differences could be observed from the two different probing methods. The red light colour could be observed when the potential between the electrodes was increased gradually under forward bias of 8 V at room temperature. Electrical properties of these thin film electroluminescent devices were characterized by current–voltage (I–V) system, the barriers heights determined from the I–V measurements {{were found to be}} related to the <b>injection</b> <b>luminescence</b> or electroluminescence...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a continuous-wave photoluminescence study of Al 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 N/GaN quantum dots grown by ammonia-assisted {{molecular beam epitaxy}} on sapphire, either on the wurtzite polar (0001) or the semipolar (11 - 22) plane. Due to interface polarization discontinuities, the polar dots are strongly red-shifted by the Stark effect and emit in the visible range. Carrier injection screening of the polarization charges has been studied. A model relying on average dot heights and dot height variances, as measured by transmission electron microscopy, is proposed. It can account for the <b>injection</b> dependent <b>luminescence</b> energies and efficiencies. The electric field discontinuity deduced from the fittings is in good agreement with theoretical expectations for our barrier composition. On the contrary, semipolar quantum dot ensembles always emit above the gap of GaN strained to Al 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 N. Their luminescence linewidth is significantly {{lower than that of}} polar ones, and their energy does not shift with injection. Our study then confirms the expected strong decrease of the Stark effect for (11 - 22) grown (Al,Ga) N/GaN heterostructures...|$|R
40|$|The {{main task}} of this {{research}} is to apply laser backscattering technology to simultaneously predict variations in moisture content and hardness of apples during drying. The backscattering area in pixel numbers, representing the illuminated area after laser light <b>injection,</b> and light <b>luminescence</b> measured by grey values were used for estimating changes in internal quality parameters during drying. Laser light measurement at 635 nm was found to be adequate for predicting changes in moisture content and SSC of apple during drying over different stages. On the contrary, photon scattering at 635 nm is not recommended as estimator of change in hardness during apple drying, based on the results...|$|R
40|$|Nanophotoswitches (NPSs) offer a {{new tool}} for optical {{stimulation}} of neuronal activity, in vitro and also potentially in vivo. Our group previously reported a ruthenium bipyridine (Rubpy) -based NPS that inserts into the plasma membrane and upon visible illumination generates an electrical dipole, triggering action potentials in adrenal chromaffin cells. We have recently demonstrated that after intravitreal injection of this NPS {{into the eyes}} of blind rats, illumination of the eye elicited electrical activity in the contralateral superior colliculus. To better understand the site of action of the NPS in retina, we examined the distribution of the molecules in different retinal layers after intravitreal injection. Methods: Rubpy molecules can be visualized by their luminescence (610 nm) upon visible wavelength illumination (460 nm). To resolve the luminescence from different retinal layers, a rapid-scan twophoton imaging system (LaVison) was used (Ti:Sapphire laser tuned to 900 nm). Intravitreal injection (1 mM, 4 μL Rubpy-based NPSs in BSS), followed by eye removal and retina isolation 2 - 5 hrs after, was performed on young RCS rats. Luminescence images of the wholemount retina were captured by an EM-CCD camera (Andor). Results: At 2 hrs after intravitreal injection and with continuous superfusion of Ames medium, luminescence was confined near the <b>injection</b> site. <b>Luminescence</b> was observed localized to surface membranes of axons and somata of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), demonstrating the impermeability of the cell membrane to the NPS molecules. The outer retina did not show significant luminescence. After 3 additional hours, luminescence was more diffused within the RGC layer and still did not extend to the outer retina. Conclusions: This study shows marked staining of RGC layer by intravitreally injected Rubpy-based NPS molecules, consistent with the hypothesis that the photoactivated NPS molecules induce electrical activity in the superior colliculus by acting on the RGCs that deliver electrical signals to the visual pathway outside the eyes. Distinct from other nano-scale optical cellular modulating approaches using optogenetics or azobenzene-based photoswitches, the NPS approach obviates the need for gene manipulation or toxic UV illumination, highlighting its potential in generating high-acuity prosthetic vision in patients blinded by retinal degenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|Two {{channels}} of the sd exchange interaction are considered in magnetic junctions. The first channel describes {{the interaction of}} transversal spins with the lattice magnetization. The second one describes the interaction of longitudinal spins with magnetization. We show the longitudinal channel leads {{to a number of}} significant effects: 1) drastic lowering of the current instability threshold down to three (or even more) orders of magnitude; 2) creation of large enough distortion of equilibrium due to current driven spin injection leading to inversion of energy spin subband populations and laser-like instability in THz frequency range at room temperature. External magnetic field may tend to lower additionally the instability threshold due to the proximity effect of purely magnetic reorientation phase transition. This effect demonstrates the new properties: the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) becomes strongly current dependent and the exchange switching becomes of very low threshold. We derived some matching condition that should be satisfied to achieve high spin injection level. Some characteristic quantities were appeared in the condition. We investigated also the junctions having variable lateral dimensions of the layers, for example, a ferromagnetic rod contacting with a very thin ferromagnetic film. Large enhancement of the current density may appear near the contact region leading to the spin <b>injection</b> <b>luminescence.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|Surface plasmon polaritons of {{the tip of}} a {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{are used}} to induce fluorescence from tetraphenylporphine molecules on GaAs(110) surfaces at very low coverages. Light spectra exhibiting vibrationally resolved Q-band transitions reveal that the luminescence is of molecular origin. The emission is not directly induced by the tunneling current. Rather, radiationless energy transfer from plasmon modes of the tip leads to molecular excitation. The spin transfer efficiency from a remanently magnetized ferromagnet to p-type GaAs across a tunneling barrier is studied. A strong energy dependence of the circular polarization of the recombination luminescence and unexpectedly high maximum values exceeding 50 % are found. A model of a two-parts light generation process with a plasmon induced excitation dominating at low energies, and a superimposed electron <b>injection</b> <b>luminescence</b> becoming dominant at energies of ≈ 100 meV above the conduction band edge is proposed. The degree of circular polarization above 50 %, seemingly contradictory to the well-known selection rules, is tentatively explained in terms of a dopant induced broadening of the acceptor level and its merging with the valence band. Evidence is presented that individual phthalocyanine molecules on unpassivated GaAs(110) largely preserve their electronic characteristics. The tip of an STM can be used to manipulate the band structure of the substrate, leading to a reversible modification of the charge state of the molecule. The room temperature growth of the planar FePc and the non-planar AgPc on GaAs(110) is discussed. For both species, unidirectionally growing islands with very high long-range order are found, and their electronic as well as structural properties are examined. For AgPc, irreversible switching between different molecular appearances is observed and attributed to a transition between a non-planar and a planar conformation...|$|E
