40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{sinusoidal}} excitation of an {{ultrasonic transducer}} requests {{a knowledge of}} the frequency and the impedance of the used ceramic. These parameters, that vary during the application, depend on the characteristics of the transducer but also on the acoustic load of the propagation medium. In the search for an adaptive excitation, we propose the design of a <b>digital</b> <b>generator</b> assuring the functions of automatic tuning and impedance matching. The design uses the Butterworth-Van Dycke model of pizoelectric ceramics. The method of determination and identification of the model parameters is presented and applied on three different transducers. The negative feedback of the generator is carried out by the signal measured on the transducers. The dynamic voltage being very variable, the output resistor of the driver is controlled by transducer impedance. This feedback control allows the stability of the output voltage to a constant value whatever the frequency and the medium is. A Simulink model of the regulation loop shows that the frequency tuning could be realized by exploiting the command signal of the driver resistance. The precision and the stability of the feedback system are tested for frequencies between 1 to 3  MHz...|$|E

Studies were undertook on the experimental facility, consists of registrating measuring cell, constructed from flat inductors system, formed in oscillatory circuit, herewith investigated biological tissue {{is the part of}} this oscillatory circuit. An excitation of oscillatory circuit fulfilled by means of exciter inductor which forms impulse complex modulated electromagnetic field (ICM EMF). The measurement process and visualizations provided by set of certificated instruments: a digital oscillograph AKTAKOM ADS- 2221 MV, a <b>digital</b> <b>generator</b> АКТАКОМ AWG- 4150 (both with software) and a gauge RLC E 7 - 22. Comparative dynamic studies of fixed volume and weight pig’s blood, adipose tissue, muscular tissue impedance were conducted by contact versus contactless methods. Contactless method in contrast to contact method gives opportunity to obtain the real morphological visualization of biological tissue irrespective of their nature. Results. Comparison of contact and contactless methods of impedance measurement shows that the inductance to capacitance ratio X(L) / X(C) was equal: 17 – for muscular tissue, 4 – for blood, 1 – for adipose tissue. It demonstrates the technical correspondence of both impedance registration methods. If propose the base relevance of X (L) and X (C) parameters for biological tissue impedance so contactless measurement method for sure shows insulating properties of adipose tissue and high conductivity for blood and muscular tissue in fixed volume-weight parameters. Registration of biological tissue impedance complex parameters by contactless method with the help of induced ICM EMF in fixed volume of biological tissue uncovers the most important informative volumes to characterize morphofunctional condition of biological tissue namely X (L) / X (C). Conclusion. Contactless method of biological tissue impedance measurement is more informative and dynamic and able to mirror morphologic features of organ’s tissue, since it does not depend from electric field divergence lines, electrode polarization and their localization, what takes place during contact method of impedance measurement. Contactless method of biological tissue impedance measurement can be applied as the base diagnostic method – dynamic volumogaraphy.  </p...|$|E
5000|$|A <b>digital</b> pattern <b>generator</b> is a {{piece of}} {{electronic}} test equipment or software used to generate digital electronics stimuli. Digital electronics stimuli are a specific kind of electrical waveform varying between two conventional voltages that correspond to two logic states ("low state" [...] and [...] "high state", [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1"). The main purpose of a <b>digital</b> pattern <b>generator</b> is to stimulate the inputs of a digital electronic device. For that reason, the voltage levels generated by a <b>digital</b> pattern <b>generator</b> are often compatible with digital electronics I/O standards - TTL, LVTTL, LVCMOS and LVDS, for instance. <b>Digital</b> pattern <b>generators</b> are sometimes referred to as [...] "pulse generator" [...] or [...] "pulse pattern generator" [...] which may be able to function as <b>digital</b> pattern <b>generators</b> as well. Hence, the distinction between the two types of equipment may not be clear. A <b>digital</b> pattern <b>generator</b> is a source of synchronous digital stimulus; the generated signal is interesting for testing digital electronics at logic level - this is why they are also called [...] "logic source". A pulse generator is of purpose to generate electrical pulse of different shapes; they are mostly used for tests at an electrical or analog level.Another common name for such equipment is [...] "digital logic source" [...] or [...] "logic source".|$|R
