50|$|The Confucian holy <b>halls</b> <b>multiplied</b> {{over the}} {{following}} years and on the 1st November 2015 many Confucian scholars including Jiang Qing, Kang Xiaoguang, Zhang Xianglong and Sheng Hong gathered in Shenzhen for the formal establishment of a national and international Holy Confucian Church which would encompass all local Confucian congregations and civil organisations. Jiang Qing was appointed as the spiritual leader of the church.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLet d be {{the minimum}} {{distance}} of an (n, k) code C, invariant under an abelian group acting transitively {{on the basis}} of the ambient space over a field F with char F × n. Assume that C contains the repetition code, that dim(C ∏ C⊥) = k − 1 and that the supports of the minimal weight vectors of C form a 2 -design. Then d 2 − d + 1 ⩾ n with equality if and only if the design is a projective plane of order d − 1. The case d 2 − d + 1 = n can often be excluded with <b>Hall's</b> <b>multiplier</b> theorem on projective planes, a theorem which follows easily from the tools developed in this paper Moreover, if d 2 − d + 1 > n and F = GF(2) then (d − 1) 2 ⩾ n. Examples are the generalized quadratic residue codes...|$|R
40|$|A purely {{electronic}} four-quadrant {{analog multiplier}} of wide bandwidth and good accuracy {{has always been}} an unobtainable goal to the electrical engineer. With the availability of intermetallic compounds commercially, there has been a renewed interest in the use of <b>Hall</b> effect for <b>multiplying</b> two quantities together. Starting with the classical theory of Hall effect and magnetoresistance, this thesis carries on by comparing those materials that lend themselves to Hall effect multiplication. Due to the ease in obtaining indium arsenide (InAs) wafers commercially, a Hall element was selected which was embodied in a magnetic core of grain oriented silicon steel. In chapter III intrinsic errors, or those errors associated with the Hall element, are rigorously discussed. Several compensation schemes have been suggested to reduce these errors; some of which are incorporated in the final multiplier design. Chapter IV continues on by analyzing the Hall generator errors. These errors, associated with the Hall element in connection with its magnetic circuit, originate mainly because of the nonlinearities of the magnetic core. In essence chapter V is concerned with those errors introduced externally in putting the Hall effect to use. Finally in chapter VI the experimental results of the practical <b>Hall</b> effect <b>multiplier</b> are outlined. The accuracy of the prototype multiplier {{has been found to be}} of the order of 0. 5 % with an effecti 7 e bandwidth of 680 cps...|$|R
40|$|Parker's {{formulation}} of isotopological plasma relaxation process in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is extended to Hall MHD. The torsion coefficient alpha in the Hall MHD Beltrami condition turns out {{now to be}} proportional to the "potential vorticity. " The Hall MHD Beltrami condition becomes equivalent to the "potential vorticity" conservation equation in two-dimensional (2 D) hydrodynamics if the <b>Hall</b> MHD Lagrange <b>multiplier</b> beta is taken to be proportional to the "potential vorticity" as well. The winding pattern of the magnetic field lines in Hall MHD then appears to evolve {{in the same way}} as "potential vorticity" lines in 2 D hydrodynamics...|$|R
40|$|Locally {{asymptotically}} optimal {{tests are}} derived for {{the null hypothesis}} of traditional AR dependence, with unspecified AR coefficients and unspecified innovation densities, against an alternative of periodically correlated AR dependence. Parametric and nonparametric rank-based versions are proposed. Local powers and asymptotic relative efficiencies (with respect, e. g., to the corresponding Gaussian Lagrange multiplier tests proposed in Ghysels and <b>Hall</b> [1992, “Lagrange <b>Multiplier</b> Tests for Periodic Structures,” unpublished manuscript, CRDE, Montreal] and Liitkepohl [1991, Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis, Berlin: Springer-Verlag; 1991, pp. 243 – 264, in W. E. Griffiths, H. Liitkepohl, & M. E. Block (eds.), Readings in Econometric Theory and Practice, Amsterdam: North-Holland] are computed explicitly; a rank-based test of the van der Waerden type is proposed, for which this ARE is uniformly larger than 1. The main technical tool is Le Cam's local asymptotic normality property. ...|$|R
