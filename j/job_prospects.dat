In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period. This was especially true of universities located in predominately Catholic regions. Enrolment at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but enrolment in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors {{had been forced to}} leave the profession, so medical graduates had good <b>job</b> <b>prospects.</b> From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the decision-making process}} of students from an economic perspective {{in order to understand}} what determines an individual's willingness to provide effort. Our theoretical model predicts that ability and <b>job</b> market <b>prospects</b> are positive determinants. Analyzing a novel dataset on thousands of German students, however, we instead find that ability has a significantly negative effect on effort. It seems that the marginal gain of increasing effort in terms of higher expected income after studying is lower for high-ability students compared to low-ability students. In regard to the second determinant, the evidence rejects a similar argument, according to which great <b>job</b> market <b>prospects</b> may impair student effort. Applying an instrumental variable approach based on official unemployment data on regional labor markets, we can confirm our prediction on the positive role of perceived employment prospects in actual student behavior...|$|R
25|$|However, {{after the}} 1960s, the left-wing {{communist}} ideology of People's Republic of China {{and the cultural}} revolution was {{in conflict with the}} capitalist policy of Singapore. To attract western investments, Singapore decided to adopt the fundamental policy of making English its main lingua franca and working language. To prevent the Singaporean Chinese from being influenced by left-wing political thoughts, Singapore greatly promoted English and placed less emphasis on Chinese education. On the one hand, it encouraged Chinese Singaporeans to attend English-medium schools for economic reasons; on the other hand, it initiated a public effort in denouncing communism. Due to a lesser proficiency in English, Chinese-educated Singaporeans often encountered difficulties in finding jobs in Singapore. Thus, the majority of Chinese Singaporeans sent their children to English-medium schools for better <b>job</b> <b>prospects,</b> causing the number of registered students at Chinese-medium schools to drop annually. All these factors (including that of government policy) eventually caused the Chinese-medium education system to perish in Singapore.|$|E

In the United Kingdom, the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, electrotypers had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union.

25|$|Re-localization of {{manufacturing}} infrastructure by multinational corporations (MNCs) to low-cost countries {{has led to}} de-industrialisation. The reduction of human intervention through automation of production and logistics processes has reduced employment opportunities. Differing taxation regimes within the European Union have led to aggressive tax optimization and avoidance by conglomerates and small and medium-sized enterprises. Favourable commercial tax credit agreements and the rampant misuse of special purpose entity (SPE) based in certain EU28 member States (UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxemburg & Belgium) have allowed large corporations to avoid, minimise or indefinitely defer tax dues. Populist movements all over the European Union have campaigned for policies which target loopholes allowing tax avoidance by transnational corporations and scrutinize incentives and subsidies given to factories where automation {{of manufacturing}} processes has improved productivity and enriched share-holders but diminished <b>job</b> <b>prospects</b> for non-specialized workers.

A questionnaire distributed to 18 Universities in England and Wales resulted in over 70 individual responses with the identification of improved quality of entrants, improved teaching quality and increased use of continuous assessment as perceived factors. Evidence supports the notion of improved quality of entrant on the basis of improving A Level grades coupled with a relatively small increase in University undergraduate numbers during the 1980 s.
