25|$|The Bonyu Bar (Mother’s Milk Bar), {{located in}} Tokyo’s {{entertainment}} and red-light district of Kabukicho, employs nursing women who provide customers with breast {{milk in a}} glass for 2,000 yen (about 15 euros) or directly from the nipple for 5000 yen (about 37.50 euros). In the latter case the women can run their <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> customers' hair, coo and say their name as they suckle.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Call the Shots" [...] {{was directed by}} Sean de Sparengo, and filmed in October 2007 in Malibu, California, while Girls Aloud were filming The Passions of Girls Aloud. The video features the girls in purple dresses performing on Malibu Beach at night with flames and white fabric surrounding them. The girls are also shown in different locations with individual story lines. Cole is simply seen looking out of a sunny window. Walsh is {{sat in front of}} a mirror, putting on make-up; her fictional boyfriend comes to get her and they hug, though she appears to be sad. Coyle is seated on a couch, flipping through photographs featuring her and a man. She takes a lighter to the photos and sets them alight. Roberts is lying down by a swimming pool, running her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> water. A young man walks up to her with a bouquet of flowers and tosses them into the water. Harding watches her boyfriend in the shower and goes through his phone. The video premiered on 17 October 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... {{and left}} it {{indelible}} there, so that now if you thrust your <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> grille and touch the place you get off three hundred years of purgatory: not much in the count of eternity, but still something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he demanded. [...] "It's {{about your}} size, comfortable, {{and all the}} air you want" [...] (here Mr. Cooke stuck his <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bit hole). [...] "Damn me, if I were in your fix, I wouldn't stop at a kennel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't {{talk like}} this," [...] she said. [...] "You know you mustn't." [...] She {{put her hand}} on his head and ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hair he had so ruffled.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Brayvo; wery pretty!' said Sam, {{when the}} red-nosed man having finished, pulled his worn gloves on, thereby {{thrusting}} his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> broken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view. 'Wery pretty.' ...|$|E
60|$|His wife {{rested her}} elbows {{against the back}} of the great red chair, and passed her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> statesman's grizzled curls, stooping down as she did so until her lips were close to his ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{a village}} called Allington, certainly. It lies over there." [...] And Johnny pointed with his <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window. [...] "As {{you do not}} know the country you can see nothing, but I can see the Allington trees at this moment." ...|$|R

50|$|Jewellery {{is limited}} to one small (non sovereign) ring per hand and a stud or sleeper in the ears. If a teacher can fit their <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> loop of the earring then it is deemed a health and safety risk. Bracelets are now banned from John Summers High School.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hein? I shall {{give you}} Ciccio's socks, yes? He pushes {{holes in the}} toes--you see?" [...] Madame poked two <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hole in the toe of a red-and-black sock, and smiled a little maliciously at Alvina.|$|E
60|$|The frown {{passed as}} quickly as it came, and the genial smile {{habitual}} to the farmer resumed its place on his countenance as he ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> thick masses of his iron-grey hair, and rose from the table.|$|E
60|$|Cecilia {{sat down}} on the bed and waited, drawing her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> girl's hair, which had fallen loose; and while she sat there she {{experienced}} all that sore, strange feeling--as of being skinned--which comes to one who watches the emotion of someone near and dear without knowing the exact cause.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{took the}} hat {{of the dead}} Squire in his hand, and {{examined}} it with frowning care. He put one <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hole in the crown and moved it meditatively. And Paynter realized how fanciful his own fatigue must have made him; for so silly a thing as <b>the</b> black <b>finger</b> waggling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rent in that frayed white relic unreasonably displeased him. The doctor soon made the same discovery with professional acuteness, and applied it much further. For when Paynter began to tell him of the moving water in the well he looked at him a moment through his spectacles, and then said: ...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, the lateral {{deformation}} of the finger pad propagates to <b>the</b> radial side <b>through</b> <b>the</b> elastic body. Matsuura et al. [20] recently {{confirmed that the}} deformations at the pad and side of a finger exhibit significant causality that can be repeatedly observed in shaking tests. Hence, the deformation at a finger pad {{can be linked to}} that at the side of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> following procedures.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{high demand}} for energy and {{depletion}} of light oil, {{we have to}} investigate technically and economically feasible methods to produce heavy oil. Heavy oil presents great challenges to oil producers. The drastic viscosity difference between heavy oil and water causes injected water to <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> reservoir, leaving large quantities of oil behind. As a result, recovery of heavy oil was often less than 20 % or even less than 10 % (Meyer 2003).|$|R
60|$|Betty {{looked down}} with tear-blurred {{eyes on the}} haggard face. Unconsciously she had been running her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fair hair that lay so damp over his brow. Her pity and {{tenderness}} had carried her far beyond herself, and at the last words she bent her head {{and kissed him on}} the lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Its {{history is}} {{somewhat}} curious," [...] said Mr Donnithorne, passing his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bunch of gay ribbons {{that hung from}} the head of the instrument.

60|$|Petroff {{admitted}} with ready {{grace that}} I was right, and thrusting his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wild clustering curls {{of his black}} hair, as if to let the air circle more freely about his head, he turned sharp round, {{and pointed to a}} cottage which stood at a short distance from the high-road, {{at the entrance to the}} village.|$|E
5000|$|In Rockets and People, {{scientist}} and historian Boris Chertok recounted how Voskresenskiy reacted when a missile being tested developed a leak of a supposedly radioactive substance. As others rushed away, he calmly {{walked up to}} the rocket and climbed the gantry. He ran his <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> liquid, and {{in full view of the}} launch crew, put his finger on his tongue to demonstrate that the substance was harmless. He then called on everyone to return to work.|$|R
50|$|Coffee sample trays - Traditionally coffee sample trays are {{set out on}} {{the coffee}} tasting table behind the cup being tasted. There will be a tray for the green coffee, a tray for the whole roasted coffee beans, and one for the fresh ground coffee; so that the coffee taster can inspect the color, and aroma of all three states that the coffee comes in. The coffee taster will run his/her <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> coffee in the tray, then run his/her nose <b>through</b> <b>the</b> coffee in the tray.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Excell ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tumbled heap of his grizzled hair. [...] "Yes; {{things are}} troubling me a little.

6000|$|On {{reflection}} {{he might}} perhaps recede and say [...] "Not {{the whole of}} Shakespear," [...] but well, Hamlet, The Tempest, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer-Night's Dream. But even these! Are they [...] "generally necessary to salvation"? We run our minds through the treasures of Shakespear as we might run our <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> contents of a box of very precious and beautiful jewels--before equipping a youth for battle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, dear, I believe I {{know the}} very thing to keep your hair from getting loose. It's such lovely hair. And {{this is quite a}} new thing, and doesn't show at all; invented by a very nice hairdresser in Worcester. It's {{simplicity}} itself. Do let me show you!" [...] Quickly going over, she removed the kingfisher-blue fillet, and making certain passes with her <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hair, murmured: ...|$|E
5000|$|Shibboleths, that is, phrases in a {{language}} that are difficult {{for someone who is}} not a native speaker of that language to say might be regarded as a type of tongue-twist. An example is Georgian baq'aq'i ts'q'alshi q'iq'inebs ("a frog croaks in the water"), in which [...] "q" [...] is a sort of gulping sound. Another example, the Czech and Slovak strč prst skrz krk ("stick a <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> throat") is difficult for a non-native speaker due to the absence of vowels, although syllabic r is a common sound in Czech, Slovak and some other Slavic languages.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is how it}} was done; {{and when}} Silver-tree came ashore, {{she began to cry}} out: [...] "Come to meet your own mother, when she comes to see you," [...] Gold-tree said that she could not, that she was locked in the room, and that she could not get out of it. [...] "Will you not put out," [...] said Silver-tree, [...] "your little <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> keyhole, so that your own mother may give a kiss to it?" [...] She put out her little finger, and Silver-tree went and put a {{poisoned}} stab in it, and Gold-tree fell dead.|$|R
60|$|The {{adjutant}} {{turned to}} stare at him. Tremayne was sitting with his head resting on one hand, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> thrusting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> crisp fair hair, and there was gloom in his clear-cut face, a dullness in the usually keen grey eyes.|$|R
