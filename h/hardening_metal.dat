40|$|Commercially {{available}} {{diode laser}} bars usually suffer from an intensity distribution not suited for direct applications like <b>hardening,</b> <b>metal</b> and polymer welding, and surface inspection. For these applications, a top hat distribution {{in one or}} both directions is demanded. In addition, the reliability is increased by homogenization, since the failure of single emitters influences only the output power but not {{the shape of the}} intensity distribution. Various homogenized diode laser systems developed by Fraunhofer ILT will be presented. The results of the ray tracing simulation performed during the design process will be compared to the measured intensity distribution of the realized modules...|$|E
40|$|Diode laser {{systems have}} been {{established}} for material processing and pumping solid state lasers in the recent years, due to flexibility, efficiency and lifetime. In the meantime, diode laser bars with an output power of more than 120 W and a beam parameter product less than 70 mm mrad are available (see fig. 1). Depending on the optical system an energy density in focus of more then 106 Wcm- 2 can be achieved. But for several applications like <b>hardening</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces or welding thin blanks/plates the output power is insufficient. To increase optical output power several diode laser bars are arranged vertically and/or horizontally. With these so called stacks an optical output power of more than 4 kW can be achieved. Due to the incoherent beam coupling the beam parameter product is increased at the same rate. But the energy density or intensity in focus is rather less than constant. Other applications, e. g. welding or marking, require higher intensities, {{which can not be}} achieved with diode lasers. For these applications diode pumped solid state laser are mostly applied...|$|E
40|$|Under tension, a {{freestanding}} thin {{metal film}} usually ruptures at a smaller strain than its bulk counterpart. Often this apparent brittleness does not result from cleavage, but from strain localization, such as necking. By volume conservation, necking causes local elongation. This elongation {{is much smaller}} than the film length, and adds little to the overall strain. The film ruptures when the overall strain just exceeds the necking initiation strain, eN, which for a weakly hardening film is not far beyond its elastic limit. Now consider a weakly <b>hardening</b> <b>metal</b> film on a steeply hardening polymer substrate. If the metal film is fully bonded to the polymer substrate, the substrate suppresses large local elongation in the film, so that the metal film may deform uniformly far beyond eN. If the metal film debonds from the substrate, however, the film becomes freestanding and ruptures at a smaller strain than the fully bonded film; the polymer substrate remains intact. We study strain delocalization in the metal film on the polymer substrate by analyzing incipient and large-amplitude nonuniform deformation, as well as debond-assisted necking. The theoretical considerations cal...|$|E

50|$|Because <b>hardened</b> <b>metal</b> {{is usually}} more brittle than softer metal, through-hardening (that is, <b>hardening</b> the <b>metal</b> uniformly {{throughout}} the piece) {{is not always}} a suitable choice for uses where the metal part is subject to certain kinds of stress.

50|$|Cryogenic rolling or , {{is one of}} the {{potential}} techniques to produce nanostructured bulk materials from its bulk counterpart at cryogenic temperatures. It can be defined as rolling that is carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nanostructured materials are produced chiefly by severe plastic deformation processes. The majority of these methods require large plastic deformations (strains much larger than unity). In case of cryorolling, the deformation in the strain <b>hardened</b> <b>metals</b> is preserved {{as a result of the}} suppression of the dynamic recovery. Hence large strains can be maintained and after subsequent annealing, ultra-fine-grained structure can be produced.|$|R

50|$|A {{valve shim}} is a disc of <b>hardened</b> <b>metal</b> of {{precisely}} calibrated height, used {{to adjust the}} clearance (US: lash) between {{the back side of}} the cam-lobe and the valve on which it operates, where the cam-lobe operates directly on the valve without an intermediate rocker arm. The shim sits atop a shim bucket which itself sits atop the valve-stem, and moves up and down within a machined bore. While hydraulically self-adjusting valves are sometimes preferred, because they require no adjustment, they do not work well in engines capable of high RPMs. In those, shims are most often used. As an example, most motorcycle engines capable of 8000RPM+ use shim-adjustable valves.|$|R
