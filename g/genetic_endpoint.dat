40|$|It is {{at present}} {{considered}} important to include biological tests in measuring programmes of environmental samples {{to supplement the}} chemical and physical parameters that are currently used. A battery of tests is therefore necessary, also within a given “endpoint” (e. g., genotoxicity), because one single test will not give all the answers to our questions. As {{it is not possible}} to include all available tests in routine screening programmes, a selection of tests should be made. According to comparative investigations, the bacterial Ames test remains very important. When no preconcentration step is involved, other bacterial tests (e. g., the umu-C and VITOTOX® tests) may be recommended. The comet assay may be used in Daphnia or human white blood cells. Further validations, comparisons, mechanistic investigations, etc. remain necessary as differences are often found between the tests that are not solely explained by differences in <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoint</b> and that therefore should further be investigated and understood...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Clay mineral genesis was {{studied in}} soils {{representative}} of several different geomorphic surfaces in western Oregon, {{ranging in age}} from Pliocene-early Pleistocene to late Pleistocene. Soil solution studies, clay mineralogy, and soil raicromorphology were employed to provide evidence of clay mineral synthesis and interpret soil genesis. Soils at each study area were characterized by distinct differences in soil solution chemistry, clay mineralogy, plasmic fabric, and genetic history, although parent material compositions between sites were often similar. Soil solution studies suggested that clay mineral synthesis from solution does not occur in soils representing the oldest geomorphic surface. The cxic soil properties at this location were developed during a prior weathering cycle and the soils are at a <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoint</b> in the present environment. Soil solutions from Ultisols on remnants of Pleistocene surfaces in the Oregon Coast Range were in equilibrium with respect to kaolinite in the solum, but stable with respect to Mg-montmorillonite in the zone characterizing active bedrock weathering. Microraorphological, clay mineralogical, and chemical evidence suggested that alteration of Mgchlorite in sedimentary rocks leads to smectite genesis in the Cr horizon of the Ultisols, followed by conversion of smectite to halloysite and chloritic intergrade in the solum. Alteration of basalt in these soils also leads to the formation of smectite, which is unstable with respect to halloysite in well-drained microenvironments within soil profiles. Soil solutions from soils characteristic of silt-mantled late Pleistocene surfaces on the western margins of the Willamette Valley showed compositional variation from pedon to pedon and horizon to horizon within individual pedons, reflecting the influence of soil parent material compositional variation. Soil solutions were generally in equilibrium with respect to kaolinite, although solutions from horizons developed in tuffaceous sediments were in equilibrium with Mg-montmorillonite. Both kaolinite and smectite were observed as products of mineral authigenesis in these soils. Authigenic clay showed delicate honeycomb or hexagonal morphology in contrast to the parallel oriented appearance of illuvial clays. Andesite alteration in wet, unstable soils of Oregon's western Cascades also resulted in the formation of smectite. The sequence of mineral alteration in andesites is similar to that described for basalts; however, the final products of mineral authigenesis are distinctly microenvironment dependent. Morphologic evidence suggests that chemical properties of bulk soil solutions can not always be considered to represent the solution conditions at the site of mineral authigenesis. In the absence of reliable in situ micro-chemical analytical techniques, detailed micromorphological studies can aid'in interpreting soil microchemical properties at weathering surfaces by revealing the identity of neoformed secondary phases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Pharmaceuticals and {{personal}} care products (PPCPs) are emerging contaminants {{that have been found}} ubiquitously in wastewater and surface waters around the world. A major source of these compounds is incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste, resulting in discharge into surface waters by wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. One pharmaceutical found in particularly high abundance in recentWWTP effluent and surface water studies is metformin, one of the world’s most widely prescribed antidiabetic drugs. Interactions between insulin signaling and steroidogenesis suggest potential endocrine-disrupting effects of metformin found in the aquatic environment. Adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were chronically exposed to metformin for 4 wk, at 40 mg/L, a level similar to the average found in WWTP effluent in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. <b>Genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> related to metabolism and endocrine function as well as reproduction-related endpoints were examined. Metformin treatment induced significant up-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) encoding the egg-protein vitellogenin in male fish, an indication of endocrine disruption.

In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and PbCl 2 or Pb(NO 3) 2 did not show significant variations in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots recorded, compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Few human {{studies have been}} {{performed}} with specific <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> coupled with erectile function or dysfunction. Most knowledge of gene expression and the function thereof on penile erection has been aqcuired in experimental models. The {{purpose of the present}} review is to give an overview of the available information obtained in studies of genes or genetic products versus erectile function or dysfunction. Recent findings The association of, for example, systemic vascular disease with diminished erectile function has brought attention to investigations of the distribution, in men with erectile dysfunction, of some genotype variants proposed to be involved in cardiovascular disease. Altered expression or activities of some smooth muscle regulatory components of the ischaemic, diabetic, or ageing penis have been reported. Summary Although penile erection can be considered a polygenic trait, some key effectors for normal erectile function within, for example, the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway may be identified. Findings in future population-based studies may disclose the presence of a particular mutation of a gene or gene variants that may predispose to the development of erectile dysfunction. The exact molecular pathogenesis of erectile dysfunction is not known, and may vary between different forms of erectile dysfunction. With integrated approaches in genetic, molecular, and functional investigations, we can learn more of the impact of a particular genotype on erectile function, and also identify targets for preventive, pharmacological, or molecular measures...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{molecular}} endpoints {{to identify and}} classify potentially toxic compounds provides significant potential for high-throughput in vitro screening. We have developed a highly reproducible and robust method of direct quantification of gene expression based on chemiluminescence. Seven target genes were chosen {{for their ability to}} inform on toxicity and mechanism and assays for their expression were developed and optimised. To assess genotoxicity, p 53, RAD 51 C and CSTA were selected after a study by Westerink et al. (2010) showed that these targets provided good predictive indices of genotoxic potential in the group of compounds screened. Additionally, we have developed gene-based tests for a group of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis (CYP 21, 19, HSD 17 B 2). For the purpose of standardisation, an assay was also developed for beta-actin to be used in parallel with the other assays. Our assay method involves the direct quantitation of RNA transcripts by the use of chemiluminescent -labelled complementary probes and is capable of analytical sensitivity of 10 – 50 attomol of target with a routine coefficient of variance of less than 15 %. In addition to their high sensitivity, these assays have the ability to distinguish between targets differing by a single base pair providing extraordinary specificity for the intended target. These tests are being applied in combination with cell culture technologies to evaluate potentially toxic compounds in a high throughput format.

Therefore, many people are exposed to formaldehyde environmentally and/or occupationally. Considering the latter, there was recommended occupational exposure limits based on threshold mechanisms, limit values and indoor guidelines. Formaldehyde is classified by the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) as carcinogenic to humans (group 1), since {{a wide range of}} epidemiological studies in occupational exposure settings have suggested possible links between the concentration and duration of exposure and elevated risks of nasopharyngeal cancer, and others cancers, and more recently, with leukemia. Although there are different classifications, such as U. S. EPA that classified formaldehyde as a B 1 compound, probable human carcinogen under the conditions of unusually high or prolonged exposure, on basis of limited evidence in humans but with sufficient evidence in animals. Formaldehyde genotoxicity is well-known, being a direct-acting genotoxic compound positively associated for almost all <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> evaluated in bacteria, yeast, fungi, plants, insects, nematodes, and cultured mammalian cells. There are many human biomonitoring studies that associate formaldehyde occupational exposure to genomic instability, and consequently possible health effects. Besides the link with cancer, also other pathologies and symptoms are associated with formaldehyde exposure, namely respiratory disorders such as asthma, and allergic contact dermatitis. Nowadays, there are efforts to reduce formaldehyde exposure, namely indoor.

The present study, however, examined DNA damage in the Comet and micronucleus assays in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with respiratory diseases and healthy individuals using the nanoparticle (NP) and bulk versions of the NSAIDs, aspirin and ibuprofen. Lymphocytes are suitable surrogate cells for cancers and other disease states. DNA damage decreased in lymphocytes from healthy individuals, asthma, COPD and lung cancer patient groups after treatment with aspirin nano-suspension (ASP N) and ibuprofen nano-suspension (IBU N) compared to their bulk version (micro-suspension) in both assays. However, when ASP N was compared to untreated lymphocytes in all groups in the Comet assay, DNA damage significantly decreased in all groups, except the asthma group. When IBU N was compared to untreated lymphocytes, in healthy individuals and the lung cancer group, DNA damage decreased, but increased in asthma and COPD groups. Similarly, micronuclei (MNi) increased after ASP N and IBU N in the healthy individual and lung cancer groups, and decreased in asthma and COPD groups. Also shows that whilst there are basic similarities with different <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> in terms of nano and bulk forms, but highlights some differences between the disease states examined. Furthermore, lymphocyte responses after IBU N and ibuprofen bulk were investigated by patch-clamp experiments demonstrating that IBU N inhibited ion channel activity by 20 %.

40|$|A {{metabolite}} of {{a widely}} used pesticide, paraoxon, exerted a dramatic mutagenic synergistic effect in Salmonella typhimurium {{with a number}} of mammalian-activated or plant-activated aromatic amines and heterocyclic amines. The mutagenic synergy required an activated an aromatic amine, and was not attributable to the generation of new mutagenic products or to the modification of the stability of the activated aromatic amine products. Paraoxon modulated the genotoxic potency of dietaiy heterocyclic amines in human cells. The results of this study raise the concern of the environmental effects of organophosphorus ester insecticides. A clone of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, AS 52, was isolated, characterised and analysed under identical treatment conditions with the mutagens 2 -acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (2 AAAF), ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS), and UV radiation. The <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> included acute DNA damage detected in the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, whole cell clastogenicity detected with laser beam flow cytometry and forward mutation at a target gene. There were statistically significant increases in DNA damage and forward mutation with all three mutagens. Statistically significant increases in chromosome damage were observed with 2 AAAF and EMS but not with UV. A non-uniform distribution of DNA damage throughout the genome was indicated with the chemical mutagens in the SCGE assay. Another type of modulation in genotoxic response was investigated whereby numerous commercial soybean processing products and by-products were analysed for their antimutagenic and antigenotoxic activities. Antimutagenic activity was detected in a soybean processing by-product, soybean molasses and in an ethanol extract, fraction PCC. PCC protected mammalian cells against direct DNA damage, clastogenic damage and point mutation induced by 2 AAAF.

We have studied the genotoxicity of quercetin for different <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints,</b> as a reverse mutagen (Ames Test) and and inducer of SOS functions (SOS chromostest). Qhile in the Ames test the mutagenicity of quercetin is enhanced by the presence of liver microsomal enzymes (S 9) or the respective cytosolic fraction (S 100), the genotoxicity is reduced for induction of SOS functions. This indicates that the DNA-damaging activity of quercetin can be accounted for by various mechanisms. This hypothesis is further supported by our data on the pH- dependent production of superoxide radical by quercetin and the formation of stable autooxidation products. The genotoxicity of red wine was assessed and found to correlate with the levels of free quercetin. White wine and beer which have no quantifiable amounts of quercetin were not significantly genotoxic. In order to get further information on the dependence upon glycosidase treatment for detection of genotoxicity of flavonol glycosides, the beta-glycosidase activity of cell free microbial extracts from human faeces and saliva has been characterized with respect to kinetic parameters and optimal pH and temperature. Assessment of genotoxicity during the wine making process shows that rut is liberated from the grapes during the first 10 days of the process and that it is hydro lysed as the vinification process proceeds.

They studied occupational genotoxicity risk in storage battery renovation workers and car painters using the comet assay and micronucleus (MN) test. Highly significant {{effects of exposure}} were found with both assays. MN-inducing effect of paints in exfoliated buccal cells was shown recently (6 -fold increase compared with control; Pinto et al., 2000), and the authors confirmed strong mutagenic effect of paints (3 -fold increase of cells with MN). The difference in mutagenic effect in two papers {{could be due to}} the different paints used, and also to various levels of cells with MN in control subjects (0. 03 and 0. 11 %, respectively). Discussions concern-ing MN level in exfoliated cells of healthy humans published recently (Nersesyan, 2003, 2005 a,b) raise the importance of this problem. The number of cells with MN in control subjects is about 0. 1 % (Martino-Roth et al., 2003), and it is in accordance with other researches carried out in Brazil. They {{are in the middle of}} the range between 0. 03 - 0. 05 % (Gattas et al., 2001; Ramirez and Saldanha, 2002; Cerqueira et al., 2004) and 0. 2 % (Agostini et al., 1996). The same <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> (the study of MN frequency in buccal cells and the comet assay), used by Martino-Roth et al.

40|$|Formaldehyde, {{classified}} by the IARC as carcinogenic in humans and experimental animals, is a chemical agent that {{is widely used}} in histopathology laboratories. The exposure to this substance is epidemiologically linked to cancer and to nuclear changes detected by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test (CBMN). This method is extensively used in molecular epidemiology, since it provides information on several biomarkers of genotoxicity, such as micronuclei (MN), which are biomarkers of chromosomes breakage or loss, nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), common biomarkers of chromosome rearrangement, poor repair and/or telomere fusion, and nuclear buds (NBUD), biomarkers of elimination of amplified DNA. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the frequency of genotoxicity biomarkers, provided by the CBMN assay in peripheral lymphocytes and the MN test in buccal cells, between individuals occupationally exposed and non-exposed to formaldehyde and other environmental factors, namely tobacco and alcohol consumption. The sample comprised two groups: 56 individuals occupationally exposed to formaldehyde (cases) and 85 unexposed individuals (controls), from whom both peripheral blood and exfoliated epithelial cells of the oral mucosa were collected in order to measure the <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> proposed in this study. The mean level of TWA 8 h was 0. 16 ± 0. 11 ppm (<detection limit until 0. 51 ppm) and the mean of ceiling values was 1. 14 ± 0. 74 ppm (0. 18 – 2. 93 ppm). All genotoxicity biomarkers showed significant increases in exposed workers in comparison with controls (Mann–Whitney test, p < 0. 002) and the analysis of confounding factors showed that there were no differences between genders. As for age, only the mean MN frequency in lymphocytes was found significantly higher in elderly people among the exposed groups (p = 0. 006), and there was also evidence of an interaction between age and gender with regards to that biomarker in those exposed. Smoking habits did not influence the frequency of the biomarkers, whereas alcohol consumption only influenced the MN frequency in lymphocytes in controls (p = 0. 011), with drinkers showing higher mean values.

40|$|Chapter 2 : Micronuclei {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in studies as an easily-evaluated indicator of DNA damage but {{little is known about}} their association with other types of damage such as nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds. Radiation-induced clastogenic events were evaluated via the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in two normal human lymphoblastoid cell lines exposed to neutrons or gamma radiation. Micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds were enumerated by recording the coincident presence of these endpoints within individual cells, and the associations among these three endpoints were evaluated for all treatment conditions. The common odds ratios for micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges were found to be significantly larger than unity, indicating that the presence of one or more micronuclei in a cell imposes a significant risk for having one or more nucleoplasmic bridges in that same cell, and vice versa. The strength of this association did not change significantly with radiation dose. Common odds ratios for association between micronuclei and buds, and between bridges and buds were also found to be significantly higher than unity. However, associations between micronuclei and buds could not be calculated for some treatments due to heterogeneity in the odds ratios, and hence may depend on radiation dose. This study provides evidence for how paired analyses among <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints</b> in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay can provide information concerning abnormalities of cell division and possibly about structural chromosomal rearrangements induced by radiation. Chapter 3 : Bystander effects have been observed repeatedly in mammalian cells following photon and alpha particle irradiation.

When tested in the rec assay in Bacillus subtilis, TBTO was not mutagenic {{and it did not}} induce reverse mutations in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Neither in the presence nor in the absence of rat liver activation system did TBTO produce point mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1530, TA 1535, TA 1538, TA 97, TA 98 or TA 100. TBTO was mutagenic in strain TA 100 in a fluctuation test, but only in the presence of rat liver S 9 (Aroclor-induced). TBTO did not induce gene mutations in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, mitotic gene conversions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nor sister-chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster ovary cells in {{the presence or absence of}} rat or mouse liver S 9. In the latter cells, structural chromosomal aberrations, endoreduplicated and polyploid cells were induced. TBTO did not induce gene mutations in V 79 Chinese hamster cells (to 8 -azaguanine-, ouabain- or 6 -thioguanine-resistance) in the presence of a rat liver postmitochondrial fraction or in cell (hamster embryo cells and human and mouse epidermal keratinocyte) -mediated assays. In mouse lymphoma cells, TBTO did not induce 6 -thioguanine- or BUdR-resistant mutations. As many tumour promoters inhibit metabolic cooperation between V 79 Chinese hamster 6 -thioguanine-resistant/-sensitive cells, TBTO was tested but showed no such activity. TBTO was examined for the induction of recessive lethal mutations in adult Berlin K male Drosophila melanogaster, either by feeding or by injection. Doses of 0. 37 or 0. 74 mM did not increase the number of X-linked recessive lethal mutations. An increased number of micronuclei was observed in the polychromatic erythrocytes of male BALB/c mice 48 h after a single oral dose of TBTO (60 mg/kg bw), while a lower dose (30 mg/kg bw) was ineffective. Neither of the two doses had induced micronuclei 30 h after treatment. The reproductive toxicity of TBTO was studied in NMRI mice. In a 10 -day toxicity study, the LD 50 and LD 10 were 74 and 34 mg/kg bw, respectively. An increased frequency of cleft palates was seen in the fetuses of mice (compared with controls, 0. 7 %) treated orally during pregnancy with 11. 7 mg/kg TBTO (7 %), 23. 4 mg/kg (24 %) or 35 mg/kg (48 %). The two highest doses of the drug also increased the frequencies of irregular ossification centres of sternebrae and of minor abnormalities, such as fusion of the bases of the os occipitalis. Doses of 6 mg of TBTO/kg bw do not produce teratogenic effects in mice. Teratogenic effects were only seen at TBTO doses that were toxic to the maternal organism. Electron microscopy 26 and 48 h after TBTO treatment showed no evidence that embryos were damaged. In contrast, the maternal liver was greatly affected. The tin contents of different organs of the maternal organism and of the whole fetus were determined after TBTO treatment. After a single oral treatment with 117 mg TBTO/kg bw, the total tin content in 11. 5 -day-old embryos 12 h after TBTO administration was 9. 5 nmoles Sn/g wet weight - 70 % greater than the normal value. The total concentration of tin in the maternal liver was increased to a similar extent (by approximately 60 %) over the normal level between 6 and 24 h after treatment. No other organ studied showed similarly high increases in tin content. These results show that TBTO gives negative results in short-term tests using various <b>genetic</b> <b>endpoints.</b> However, at cytotoxic concentrations, it was mutagenic in one bacterial strain, clastogenic in CHO cells in vitro and produced micronuclei in mouse bone marrow cells in vivo. In view of these adverse biological effects, and its high capacity to interfere with morphogenetic differentiation processes in vitro careful evaluations must be made before TBTO is released in large quantities into the aquatic environment, and levels to which humans are exposed must be strictly controlled when it is used as a molluscicide...|$|R
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{have failed}} to replicate common genetic variants associated with antidepressant response, as defined using a single <b>endpoint.</b> <b>Genetic</b> influences may be discernible by examining individual variation between sustained versus unsustained patterns of response, which may distinguish medication effects from non-specific, or placebo responses to active medication. We conducted a GWAS among 1116 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial who were characterized using Growth Mixture Modeling as showing a sustained versus unsustained pattern of clinical response over 12 weeks of treatment with citalopram. Replication analyses examined 585 subjects from the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) trial. The strongest association with sustained as opposed to unsustained response in STAR*D involved a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs 10492002) within the acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3 gene (ACSS 3, p-value= 4. 5 × 10 - 6, odds ratio= 0. 61). No SNPs met our threshold for genome-wide significance. SNP data were available in GENDEP for 18 of the top 25 SNPs in STAR*D. The most replicable association was with SNP rs 7816924 (p= 0. 008, OR= 1. 58); no SNP met the replication p-value threshold of 0. 003. Joint analysis of these 18 SNPs resulted in the strongest signal coming from rs 7816924 (p= 2. 11 × 10 - 7), which resides in chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 gene (CSGALNACT 1). An exploratory genetic pathway analysis revealed evidence for an involvement of the KEGG pathway of long-term potentiation (FDR= 02).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{beneficial}} effects of omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFAs), especially in dyslipidemic subjects {{with a high}} risk of cardiovascular disease, are widely described in the literature. A lot of effects of n- 3 PUFAs and their oxidized metabolites are triggered by regulating the expression of genes. Currently, it is uncertain if the administration of n- 3 PUFAs results in different expression changes of genes related to antioxidative mechanisms in normo- and dyslipidemic subjects, which may partly explain their cardioprotective effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of n- 3 PUFA supplementation on expression changes of genes involved in oxidative processes. Methods Ten normo- and ten dyslipidemic men were supplemented for twelve weeks with fish oil capsules, providing 1. 14 [*]g docosahexaenoic acid and 1. 56 [*]g eicosapentaenoic acid. Gene expression levels were determined by whole genome microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Using microarrays, we discovered an increased expression of antioxidative enzymes and a decreased expression of pro-oxidative and tissue enzymes, such as cytochrome P 450 enzymes and matrix metalloproteinases, in both normo- and dyslipidemic men. An up-regulation of catalase and heme oxigenase 2 in both normo- and dyslipidemic subjects and an up-regulation of cytochrome P 450 enzyme 1 A 2 only in dyslipidemic subjects could be observed by qRT-PCR analysis.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} some of {{the problems}} confronted in evolving a population of three dimensional computer generated shapes according to a set of desired constraints. The eventual aim is to automatically search a design or problem space for a viable solution or range of solutions to 3 -D shapes. Such shapes are often used in generating computer images. Such images are needed in engineering and science and are useful in visualizing output from computer models. There may be applications within the domains of aesthetic design. Previously, most of the successful attempts to evolve three-dimensional computer generated form have used systems of genetic encoding {{with a high degree of}} complexity in the link between the Genotype (the genetic endowment of the individual solution) and the Phenotype (the constellation of all available individual solutions), and have mapped the complete volume of the shape. An approach described is to encode the shape surface. This has the potential to considerably simplify the mapping of the Phenotype to Genotype. The new approach is inspired by the principle behind the operation of a “shape grabber”. In this a mathematical array consisting of a “point cloud” of Cartesian coordinates is created corresponding to those mapped on the surface of a real object. The former can then be used by a CAD program to plot a polygonal mesh and produce a 3 -D representation of the original object. The new approach uses a direction vector, the magnitude of which becomes a floating point “gene” within the <b>Genetic</b> algorithm. The <b>endpoint</b> of the latter defines a point within the point cloud. An enhancement of this model could use an evolved Lindenmayer System to define a point in the cloud. This study compares the Volumetric and Surface Models of shape encoding and surface evolution and points to new exciting possibilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} focused on a {{multi-purpose}} estuarine environment (river Sado estuary, SW Portugal) around which a number of activities (e. g., fishing, farming, heavy industry, tourism and recreational activities) coexist with urban centres {{with a total of}} about 200 000 inhabitants. Based on previous knowledge of the hazardous chemicals within the ecosystem and their potential toxicity to benthic species, this project intended to evaluate the impact of estuarine contaminants on the human and ecosystem health. An integrative methodology based on epidemiological, analytical and biological data and comprising several lines of evidence, namely, human contamination pathways, human health effects, consumption of local produce, estuarine sediments, wells and soils contamination, effects on commercial benthic organisms, and genotoxic potential of sediments, was used. The epidemiological survey confirmed the occurrence of direct and indirect (through food chain) exposure of the local population to estuarine contaminants. Furthermore, the complex mixture of contaminants (e. g., metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) trapped in the estuary sediments was toxic to human liver cells exposed in vitro, causing cell death, oxidative stress and genotoxic effects that might constitute a risk factor for the development of chronic-degenerative diseases, on the long term. Finally, the integration of data from several endpoints indicated that the estuary is moderately impacted by toxicants that affect also the aquatic biota. Nevertheless, the human health risk can only be correctly assessed through a biomonitoring study including the quantification of contaminants (or metabolites) in biological fluids as well as biomarkers of early biological effects (e. g., biochemical, <b>genetic</b> and omics-based <b>endpoints)</b> and <b>genetic</b> susceptibility in the target population. Data should be supported by a detailed survey {{to assess the impact of}} the contaminated seafood and local farm products consumption on human health and, particularly, on metabolic diseases or cancer development.

40|$|Background: Postoperative {{excessive}} bleeding {{is still}} one of the most common complications in cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Major bleeding is a partially modifiable risk factor, and adequate preventive treatment strategies should be used to reduce the incidence of this complication. Prophylactic drug treatments can reduce postoperative bleeding. Prediction modelling strategies can be used for identifying patients at higher risk of bleeding after cardiac surgery and thereby contribute to implementation of prophylactic therapies and early interventions. Genetic variation may contribute to postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, and genetic information could make the prediction of excessive postoperative bleeding more precise. Aims: The overall aim of the thesis was to contribute to better patient care through increased knowledge about postoperative bleeding and about the treatment of this complication in high-risk groups. More specifically, the aim in Study I was to investigate the effects of tranexamic acid on postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in elderly patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery. In Study II the aims were 1) to investigate if risk prediction for postoperative bleeding was possible using clinical variables, by validating the Papworth Bleeding Risk Score and by developing local risk prediction models, and 2) to compare the usefulness of the universal definition of postoperative bleeding proposed by Dyke et al with the definition used in the Papworth Bleeding Risk Score. In Study III the main aim was to validate some earlier identified genetic polymorphisms associated with bleeding after cardiac surgery, and to explore other functional polymorphisms central in the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems or in plateletmembrane receptors related to postoperative bleeding. A secondary aim was to evaluate the additional predictive ability with inclusion of genetic information in risk prediction models based only on clinical variables, thereby investigating whether genetic susceptibility is a clinically relevant factor for further studies. Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial was used to investigate the effect of tranexamic acid in patients, 70 years or older, undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). For Study II and III we used a prospectively recorded local database. All patients included in the studies underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. The predictive ability of the Papworth Bleeding Risk Score was validated, using the universal definition of perioperative bleeding proposed by Dyke et al and the definition used to develop the Papworth Bleeding Risk Score. Clinical prediction models were constructed using multivariate logistic regression analyses, using the two mentioned <b>endpoints.</b> <b>Genetic</b> associations were performed using allelic association tests and logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate whether the genetic information could improve the model with clinical variables. Results: The total number of red cell transfusions given was significantly larger in the placebo group of elderly patients compared with the tranexamic acid group (5 vs. 3 respectively, p = 0. 049). When using both the Papworth Bleeding Risk Score and the locally developed risk prediction models, the positive predictive value was low (0. 15 and 0. 12 respectively) in the high-risk group and the negative predictive value was high (0. 98 and 0. 95 respectively) in the low-risk group. We identified five significant SNPs associated with postoperative bleeding. Addition of the genetic covariates to a logistic regression model with clinical variables significantly improved the model (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Tranexamic acid reduced the need for red cell transfusion in elderly patients undergoing combined AVR and CABG surgery. Neither the Papworth Bleeding Risk Score nor the locally developed risk prediction models were suitable for identifying the patients at high risk of severe postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, but could more precisely identify patients at low risk of bleeding. None of the two endpoint definitions for postoperative bleeding were clearly preferable. We identified five SNPs associated with postoperative bleeding. Inclusion of genetic information to a risk prediction model with only clinical variables improved the model, indicating that genetic predisposition is relevant for postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery...|$|R
