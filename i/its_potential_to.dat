5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> become a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E

5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Soviet {{and native}} Stalinists was {{widespread}} among {{not only the}} general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited the oppressive system's damage in Poland to well below that of other European communist-ruled countries. Political violence after 1947 was not widespread. The Church, subjected to partial property confiscations, remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale collectivization and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the Polish October of 1956.|$|E

Other historical attractions include the Japanese War Cemetery, Confrontation Memorial, the Public Service Memorial and the Twin Town Memorial. Tawau {{is one of the}} top cocoa production centres in Malaysia. The Teck Guan Cocoa Museum has become one of the important historical attractions for the town since it was founded in the 1970s by Datuk Seri Panglima Hong Teck Guan. Varieties of cocoa products including chocolate jam and hot cocoa beverages are sold in the museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} in 1901 proposed a scheme {{similar to that}} of the Glen Grey Act, imposing a tax of £2 to induce natives to work. In 1903, Rhodesian capitalists even proposed a £4 tax but Chamberlain preferred the lower rate of £2 and sought Clarke's opinion on <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> cause trouble. Clarke argued that even £2 was too high. Milner disagreed and wrote to Sir William Milton, the company administrator, saying: 'I am embarrassed by a report form the Resident Commissioner in which he utterly condemns the proposed Native Tax Ordinance'. In 1904, finally, Alfred Lyttelton, Chamberlain's successor refused assent, citing Clarke's reports and an ordinance limited the tax to £1.|$|E

As a result of the worldwide unlicensed 60 GHz band allocation, a number of key applications can be identified using millimeter-wave technology. Despite of <b>its</b> huge <b>potentials</b> <b>to</b> achieve multigigabit wireless communications, 60 GHz radio presents a series of technical challenges that needs to be resolved before its full deployment. Specifically, we will focus on the link budget analysis from the 60 GHz radio propagation standpoint and highlight the roles of antennas in establishing a reliable 60 GHz radio.|$|R
5|$|The stone, {{carved in}} black {{granodiorite}} during the Hellenistic period, {{is believed to}} have originally been displayed within a temple, possibly at nearby Sais. It was probably moved during the early Christian or medieval period, and was eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid (Rosetta) in the Nile Delta. It was rediscovered there in July 1799 by a French soldier named Pierre-François Bouchard during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. It was the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times, and it aroused widespread public interest with <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> decipher this previously untranslated hieroglyphic language. Lithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholars. Meanwhile, British troops defeated the French in Egypt in 1801, and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria and was transported to London. It has been on public display at the British Museum almost continuously since 1802, and is the most-visited object there.|$|E
5|$|Three Amylostereum {{species are}} {{symbionts}} of wood wasps in the genera Sirex, Urocerus, and Xoanon, which infest conifers. The female wood wasps deposit their eggs together with fungal spores and mucus in trees, and the fungus is eaten by the wasp's larva as food. The fungus propagates vegetatively through {{the formation of}} asexual spores in newly emerged females that are stored in special structures adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi. The A.areolatum–Sirex woodwasp (S.noctilio) symbiont complex has been studied extensively because of <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> cause substantial economic losses in the forestry industry, particularly in non-native regions.|$|E
5|$|Titan is {{available}} for any scientific purpose; access depends {{on the importance of}} the project and <b>its</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> exploit the hybrid architecture. Any selected programs must also be executable on other supercomputers to avoid sole dependence on Titan. Six vanguard programs were the first selected. They dealt mostly with molecular scale physics or climate models, while 25 others were queued behind them. The inclusion of GPUs compelled authors to alter their programs. The modifications typically increased the degree of parallelism, given that GPUs offer many more simultaneous threads than CPUs. The changes often yield greater performance even on CPU-only machines.|$|E
