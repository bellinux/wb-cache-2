5|$|Meibomian <b>glands,</b> in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian <b>glands</b> are also known as tarsal <b>glands,</b> Zeis <b>glands</b> and palpebral <b>glands.</b> They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid <b>glands</b> share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid <b>glands.</b> Parathyroid <b>glands</b> {{are derived from}} the epithelial lining of {{the third and fourth}} branchial pouches, with the superior <b>glands</b> arising from the fourth pouch, and the inferior <b>glands</b> arising from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior and superior <b>glands,</b> which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous <b>glands</b> {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous <b>glands</b> have unique names. Sebaceous <b>glands</b> on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and <b>glands</b> on the eyelids are known as meibomian <b>glands.</b> Sebaceous <b>glands</b> of the breast are also known as Montgomery's <b>glands.</b>|$|E
40|$|Histological {{sections}} from 30 {{lower lobe}} bronchi, taken from coalminers' lungs collected for the British National Coal Board's Pneumoconiosis Field Research, were selected {{according to the}} proportion of mucous <b>gland</b> area occupying the non-cartilaginous part of the bronchial wall. The total <b>gland</b> area expressed {{as a percentage of}} the non-cartilaginous wall was called the <b>gland</b> index. Estimations were made of the total number of <b>gland</b> cells and acini on a section and of their numbers per unit area of <b>gland.</b> These estimations were compared with the <b>gland</b> index. The total numbers of <b>gland</b> cells and acini were found to be directly related to the <b>gland</b> index (r= 0. 84 and 0. 86), whereas no relationship was found between the number of <b>gland</b> cells or acini per unit area of <b>gland</b> and the <b>gland</b> index (r= 0. 08 and 0. 02). This indicates that bronchial mucous <b>gland</b> enlargement is primarily a hyperplastic change. A direct relationship between the numbers of <b>gland</b> cells per unit area of <b>gland</b> and acini per unit area <b>gland</b> was found (r= 0. 69), and this suggests that acinar enlargement is likely to be caused by accumulation of mucus in the acinar lumen...|$|R

5|$|Sebaceous <b>glands</b> {{are found}} in hair-covered areas, where they are {{connected}} to hair follicles. One or more <b>glands</b> may surround each hair follicle, and the <b>glands</b> themselves are surrounded by arrector pili muscles. The <b>glands</b> have an acinar structure (like a many-lobed berry), in which multiple <b>glands</b> branch off a central duct. Relative to keratinocytes {{that make up the}} hair follicle, sebaceous <b>glands</b> are composed of huge cells with many large vesicles that contain the sebum. These cells express Na+ and Cl− ion channels, ENaC and CFTR (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in reference).|$|E
5|$|Some {{features}} of the accessory <b>glands</b> in the male genital region vary among oryzomyines. In Transandinomys talamancae, {{a single pair of}} preputial <b>glands</b> is present at the penis.

50|$|There are <b>gland</b> {{cells in}} the suprapedal <b>gland.</b> For example, in the suprapedal <b>gland</b> of the land snail Pomatias elegans there are three types of <b>gland</b> cells: cells {{producing}} mucoproteins, cells producing proteins and cells producing sulphated mucopolysaccharides.

5|$|The fossa {{has several}} scent <b>glands,</b> {{although}} the <b>glands</b> are less developed in females.

5|$|The {{parathyroid}} <b>glands</b> are {{two pairs}} of <b>glands</b> usually positioned behind {{the left and right}} lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6mm long and 3 to 4mm wide, and 1 to 2mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid <b>glands.</b> The two parathyroid <b>glands</b> on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid <b>glands,</b> while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid <b>glands.</b> Healthy parathyroid <b>glands</b> generally weigh about 30mg in men and 35mg in women. These <b>glands</b> are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} <b>glands</b> are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small <b>glands,</b> and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid <b>glands.</b> Rarely, the parathyroid <b>glands</b> may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} <b>glands</b> and sessile (flat) digestive <b>glands.</b> The peduncular <b>glands</b> consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular <b>glands</b> release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more <b>glands</b> and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional <b>glands</b> into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile <b>glands,</b> which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular <b>glands</b> and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile <b>glands.</b> These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E

5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid <b>glands</b> originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the <b>glands</b> reverses during embryological life. The pair of <b>glands</b> which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of <b>glands</b> which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior <b>glands</b> with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The <b>glands</b> are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
