5000|$|The CSF {{tap test}}, {{sometimes}} lumbar tap test or Miller <b>Fisher</b> <b>Test,</b> {{is a medical}} test {{that is used to}} decide whether shunting of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would be helpful in a patient with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The test involves removing 30 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture, after which cognitive function is clinically reassessed. The name [...] "Fisher test" [...] is after C. Miller Fisher, a Canadian neurologist working in Boston, Massachusetts, who described the test.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{spectral}} analysis in time series is to determine what patterns exist in {{a particular set of}} data. To accomplish this, one often calculates the Fourier periodogram of the data and inspects it for peaks. However, since the periodogram is not a consistent estimate of the true spectral density, peaks can be obscured. Therefore, it is necessary to test for significance of the peaks. One of the most widely used tests for significance of periodicities in the periodogram is <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>test</b> statistic for <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> is the quotient of the maximum periodogram ordinate and the sum of all the ordinates. If the test statistic is too large, we reject the null hypothesis that the data are white noise. In this thesis, I develop a test for categorical time series which is an analog of <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> for continuous parameter time series. The test involves finding the Walsh-Fourier periodogram of the data and then calculating the <b>test</b> statistic for <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test.</b> I explain the theory behind Walsh-Fourier analysis and compare the theory to that of Fourier analysis. Asymptotic results for the distribution of <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> for Walsh-Fourier spectra are presented and compared with a simulated distribution. I also perform power studies in order to assess the detection capability of the test. In the presence of multiple peaks, this test tends to loose power. Therefore, I also explore several alternatives to <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> for Walsh-Fourier spectra and apply all of the alternative methods to several real data sets...|$|R
5000|$|Following imaging, lumbar {{puncture}} {{is usually the}} first step in diagnosis and the CSF opening pressure is measured carefully. In most cases, CSF pressure is usually above 155 mmH2O. Clinical improvement after removal of CSF (30 mL or more) has a high predictive value for subsequent success with shunting. This is called the [...] "lumbar tap test" [...] or Miller <b>Fisher</b> <b>test.</b> On the contrary, a [...] "negative" [...] test has a very low predictive accuracy, as many patients may improve after a shunt in spite of lack of improvement after CSF removal.|$|E
50|$|The test {{is useful}} for {{categorical}} data that result from classifying objects in two different ways; {{it is used to}} examine the significance of the association (contingency) between the two kinds of classification. So in Fisher's original example, one criterion of classification could be whether milk or tea was put in the cup first; the other could be whether Dr. Bristol thinks that the milk or tea was put in first. We want to know whether these two classifications are associated—that is, whether Dr. Bristol really can tell whether milk or tea was poured in first. Most uses of the <b>Fisher</b> <b>test</b> involve, like this example, a 2 × 2 contingency table. The p-value from the test is computed as if the margins of the table are fixed, i.e. as if, in the tea-tasting example, Dr. Bristol knows the number of cups with each treatment (milk or tea first) and will therefore provide guesses with the correct number in each category. As pointed out by Fisher, this leads under a null hypothesis of independence to a hypergeometric distribution of the numbers in the cells of the table.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} ABO blood group and thrombosis, we studied 127 patients taking oral anti-vitamin K drugs for thromboembolism prophylaxis and compared them with 700 voluntary blood donors. There were 68 patients with venous thrombosis (VT) - 68 with deep vein thrombosis and 8 with pulmonary embolism-and 51 patients with arterial embolism (AE). There were 61 men and 66 women. Mean age at diagnosis was lower for all women, regardless of if they had VT or AE (43 years) than for men (55 years; Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0. 01). There was an imbalance between blood group A and O frequencies in patients with VT versus blood donors, with a higher frequency of blood group A or a lower frequency of blood group O, represented by a high A/O ratio. A/O ratio for blood donors was 0. 63; it was 1. 50 for men (<b>Fisher</b> <b>test,</b> p = 0. 028) and 1. 44 for women (<b>Fisher</b> <b>test,</b> p = 0. 010). Patients with AE showed the same discrepancy, but it was significant for women (A/O = 2. 25; <b>Fisher</b> <b>test,</b> p = 0. 026) and not for men (A/O = 0. 86; <b>Fisher</b> <b>test,</b> p = 0. 836), suggesting that men with AE might have other risk factors for thrombosis. These data are not conclusive {{about the causes of}} the association between ABO blood groups and thrombosis, and prospective studies are needed to verify whether blood typing could have a predictive value for prophylatic measures in clinical and surgical patients.

5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> gives exact p-values, some authors have argued that it is conservative, i.e. that its actual {{rejection}} rate is below the nominal significance level. The apparent contradiction stems from {{the combination of a}} discrete statistic with fixed significance levels. To be more precise, consider the following proposal for a significance test at the 5%-level: reject the null hypothesis for each table to which <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> assigns a p-value equal to or smaller than 5%. Because the set of all tables is discrete, there may not be a table for which equality is achieved. If [...] is the largest p-value smaller than 5% which can actually occur for some table, then the proposed test effectively tests at the -level. For small sample sizes, [...] might be significantly lower than 5%. While this effect occurs for any discrete statistic (not just in contingency tables, or for <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test),</b> {{it has been argued that}} the problem is compounded by {{the fact that}} <b>Fisher's</b> <b>test</b> conditions on the marginals. To avoid the problem, many authors discourage the use of fixed significance levels when dealing with discrete problems.|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Enrichment {{tests are}} used in {{high-throughput}} experimentation to measure the association between gene or protein expression and membership in groups or pathways. The Fisher’s exact test is commonly used. We specifically examined the associations produced by the <b>Fisher</b> <b>test</b> between protein identification by mass spectrometry discovery proteomics, and their Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments in a large yeast dataset. We found that direct application of the <b>Fisher</b> <b>test</b> is misleading in proteomics due to the bias in mass spectrometry to preferentially identify proteins based on their biochemical properties. False inference about associations can be made if this bias is not corrected. Our method adjusts Fisher tests for these biases and produces associations more directly attributable to protein expression rather than experimental bias...|$|E

Simes test is powerful when the total evidence against the joint null hypothesis is concentrated in one or very few of the tests being combined, but the modified inverse normal method and the modified TPM have good performance when evidence against the joint null is spread among more than {{a small fraction of the}} panel units.
