40|$|Abstract Magnetic {{reconnection}} is {{a process}} that changes magnetic field topology in highly conducting fluids. Traditionally, magnetic reconnection was associated mostly with solar flares. In reality, the process must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions of fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>field</b> lines and magnetic reconnection. We consider magnetic re-connection in realistic 3 D geometry in the presence of turbulence. This turbulence in most astrophysical settings is of pre-existing nature, but it also can be induced by magnetic reconnection itself. In this situation turbulent magnetic field wander-ing opens up reconnection outflow regions, making reconnection fast. We discuss Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) model of turbulent reconnection, its numerical and ob-servational testings, as well as its connection to the modern understanding of the Lagrangian properties of turbulent fluids. We show that the predicted dependences of the reconnection rates on the level of MHD turbulence make the generally ac-cepted Goldreich & Sridhar (1995) model of turbulence self-consistent.

40|$|Magnetic field {{topology}} {{frozen in}} ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and its breakage in near ideal MHD are reviewed in two parts. The first part gives a physically complete {{description of the}} <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>field</b> topology, taking magnetic flux conservation as fundamental and treating four topics, Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of MHD, Chandrasekhar-Kendall and Euler-potential field representations, magnetic helicity, and inviscid vortex dynamics in comparison to ideal MHD. A corollary clarifies the challenge of achieving {{a high degree of}} the frozen in condition in numerical MHD. The second part treats field topology breakage centered on the Parker Magnetostatic Theorem on a general incompatibility of a continuous magnetic field with the dual demand of force free equilibrium and an arbitrarily prescribed, 3 D field topology. Preserving field topology as a global constraint readily results in formation of tangential magnetic discontinuities, i. e., electric current sheets of zero thickness. A similar incompatibility is present in the steady, force and thermal balance of a heated radiating fluid subject to an anisotropic thermal flux conducted strictly along the frozen in magnetic field in the low beta limit. In a weakly resistive fluid the thinning of current sheets by these incompatibilities inevitably results in sheet dissipation, resistive heating and topological changes in the field despite the small resistivity. Faraday induction drives but also macroscopically limits this mode of energy dissipation, storing free energy in self organized, ideal MHD structures. This property of MHD turbulence captured by the Taylor hypothesis is reviewed in relation to the Sun's corona, calling for a basic quantitative description of the breakdown of flux conservation in the low resistivity limit. A cylindrical, initial boundary value problem provides specificity in the review. Comment: Review article, 20 pages, 2 figures, 158 references. see [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The book {{consists}} of four Chapters. Chapter 1 shortly describes main properties of space plasmas and primary CR, different types of CR interactions with space plasmas components (matter, photons, and <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> magnetic <b>fields).</b> Chapter 2 considers the problem of CR propagation in space plasmas described by the kinetic equation and different types of diffusion approximations (diffusion in momentum space and in pitch-angle space, anisotropic diffusion, anomaly CR diffusion and compound diffusion, the influence of magnetic clouds on CR propagation, non-diffusive CR particle pulse transport). Chapter 3 is devoted to CR non-linear effects in space plasmas caused by CR pressure and CR kinetic stream instabilities with the generation of Alfvèn turbulence (these effects are important in galaxies, in the Heliosphere, in CR and gamma-ray sources and in the processes of CR acceleration).

40|$|Ecophysiological features, {{including}} {{survival and}} recovery from freezing and {{determination of the}} freezable water content, are reported for a cold-adapted cockroach Celatoblatta quinquemaculata Johns 1966 (Dictyoptera, Blattidae) inhabiting alpine communities at altitudes greater than 1300 m a. s. l. in mountains of Central Otago, New Zealand. Nymphs ranged from 15 to 51 mg live weight of which 67 % was water. Cockroaches had a mean supercooling point temperature of − 5. 4 ± 0. 1 °C; with recovery from freezing close to this temperature being rapid, but no recovery was observed when frozen at − 9 to − 10 °C. The duration of exposure to freezing conditions and the time allowed for recovery (24 – 96 h) both influenced individual recovery and subsequent survival. Comparison of supercooling point data and survival shows that this species possesses a few degrees of freeze tolerance, and individuals have been found <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> the <b>field</b> when subzero temperatures occur. Differential scanning calorimetry showed ≈ 74 % of body water froze during cooling and between 24 and 27 % of total body water was osmotically inactive (unfreezable under the experimental conditions). Carbohydrates, other than glucose at 7. 5 μg/mg fresh weight, were in low concentrations in the body fluids, suggesting little cryoprotection. No thermal hysteresis from antifreeze protein activity was detected in haemolymph samples using calorimetric techniques.

As a model of the stagnation region/stagnation point in front of the heliospheric nose, we present and discuss the general solution of the ideal MHD Ohm's law in the vicinity of a 2 -D stagnation point, which was found by us. We show that ideal MHD either leads necessarily to a diverging magnetic <b>field</b> strength <b>in</b> the vicinity of such a stagnation point, or to a vanishing mass density on the heliopause boundaries. In the case that components of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field do not exist due to the chosen form of the non-ideal Ohm's law, it is always possible to formulate the transport equation of the magnetic field as a modified ideal Ohm's law. We find that the form of the Ohm's law which is often used in heliospheric physics (see e. g. Baranov and Fahr, 2003), is not able to change magnetic topology and thus cannot lead to magnetic reconnection, which necessarily has to occur at the stagnation point. The diverging magnetic field, for instance, implies the breakdown of the flux freezing paradigm for the heliosphere. Its application, especially at the heliospheric nose, is therefore rather doubtful. We conclude {{that it is necessary to}} search for an Ohm's law which is able to violate magnetic topology conservation...|$|R
