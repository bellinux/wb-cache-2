40|$|Scoping can {{be defined}} as the process of {{deciding}} in which parts of an organization's products, features and domains systematic reuse is economically useful.

40|$|Safety-critical Java (SCJ) avoids garbage {{collection}} {{and uses a}} scope based memory model. This memory model {{is based on a}} restricted version of RTSJ [3] style scopes. The scopes form a clear hierarchy with different lifetimes. Therefore, references between objects <b>in</b> different <b>scopes</b> are only al-lowed from objects allocated <b>in</b> <b>scopes</b> with a shorter lifetime to objects allocated <b>in</b> <b>scopes</b> with a longer lifetime. To ensure memory safety, programmers are required to ei-ther manually annotate the application with complex anno-tations, rely on a runtime test of each reference assignment, or statically analyze all reference assignments and avoid run-time checks when all assignments are proven to be correct. A violation of the assignment rule at runtime leads to an unchecked exception. For safety-critical code that needs to be certified, runtime exceptions must be avoided and the absence of illegal reference assignments needs to be proven. In this paper we present a static program analysis tool that automates the proof that no illegal assignments occur. 1...|$|R

5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow <b>in</b> <b>scope.</b> The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
