Point transformations and line transformations are treated separately. In the context of point transformations, only a brief summary of the known techniques (i. e., homogeneous transforms and quaternion/vector pairs) and their computational behavior is given. Among line transformations, which comprise {{the primary focus of}} this paper, four mathematical formalisms for effecting a general spatial screw displacement are presented and analyzed in terms of computational efficiency in performing (a) general screw <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> <b>lines,</b> and (b) compositions <b>of</b> screw <b>displacement</b> operators.

Stark-effect in iron has been observed in the region 6500 - 3400 A at field strengths in excess of 110, 000 volts/cm. Two hundred and twenty one lines were photographed, twenty eight of which {{were found to be}} displaced.

The relation between Pole-effect and Stark-effect has been discussed, and the conclusion drawn that the Pole-effect cannot be identical with the Stark-effect as has been assumed by many writers. Displaced and undisplaced levels have been classified; the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> many <b>lines</b> not yet photographed is predicted.

The dependences <b>of</b> the <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> HOLZ <b>lines</b> in Si[111] zone axis patterns on the incident electron energy and on the lattice parameter were studied using computer simulations based on the Bloch wave many beam theory. Thus, the angular <b>displacement</b> <b>of</b> HOLZ <b>lines</b> was found to vary with voltage {{at a rate of}} 0. 24 mrad/kV at about 100 kV The HOLZ lines (5, 5, 11), (5, 11, 5) and (11, 5, 5) were found to coincide at an incident electron energy of 103. 15 ke V. Experimental convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns obtained using an electron microscope equipped with either a field emission gun (FEG) or an energy filter are compared with computer simulations. Good agreement between experimental and simulated patterns is found if the electron energy is adequately corrected for materials with known lattice parameters. The high precision of lattice parameter determinations using the coincidences of X-rays from lattice sources according to Walther Kossel and the accurate material analysis using Castaing’s microprobe are mentioned in this context...|$|R
