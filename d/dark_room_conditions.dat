40|$|AbstractPurposeTo analyze single session, intrauser {{reliability}} of a Scheimpflug device for anterior chamber (AC) and corneal parameters. MethodsIn this observational study, 100 normal candidates underwent Scheimpflug analysis with Sirius 3 D Rotating Scheimpflug Camera and Topography System (Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Italy). Two scans in <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> <b>conditions</b> were {{performed by the}} same experienced user. The candidates were asked to keep both eyes closed for 5 min before the scans. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery, corneal scarring and anterior segment/posterior segment anomalies. Only the right eyes {{were used for the}} analysis. Both corneal (central, minimum, and apical thickness, volume, horizontal visible iris diameter, and apical curvature) and anterior chamber (volume, depth, angle, horizontal diameter) measurements were evaluated. ResultsThere was no difference in the means of repeated measurements (p> 0. 05, ANOVA). Intraclass correlations between the measures were high and ranged from 0. 995 – 0. 997 for corneal to 0. 964 – 0. 997 for anterior chamber (AC) parameters. The precision of repeatability measures (1. 96 ×Sw) was approximately 5 μ for the central and minimum corneal thickness, 8 μ for the apical corneal thickness, 0. 06 mm for AC (anterior chamber) depth and less than 2 ° for the AC angle. ConclusionsSirius Scheimpflug system has high repeatability for both corneal and AC parameters in normal eyes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent to which vestibular loss might impair orthostatic responses to passive tilts in the pitch plane in human subjects. Data were obtained from six subjects having chronic bilateral vestibular loss and six healthy individuals matched for age, gender, and body mass index. Vestibular loss was assessed with a comprehensive battery including dynamic posturography, vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and ocular counterrolling. Head up tilt tests were conducted using a motorized two-axis table that allowed subjects to be tilted in the pitch plane from either a supine or prone body orientation at a slow rate (8 deg/s). The sessions consisted of three tilts, each consisting of 20 min rest in a horizontal position, tilt to 80 deg upright for 10 min, and then return to the horizontal position for 5 min. The tilts were performed in darkness (supine and prone) or in light (supine only). Background music was used to mask auditory orientation cues. Autonomic measurements included beat-to-beat recordings of blood pressure (Finapres), heart rate (ECG), cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler), end tidal CO 2, respiratory rate and volume (Respritrace), and stroke volume (impedance cardiography). For both patients and control subjects, cerebral blood flow appeared to exhibit the most rapid adjustment following transient changes in posture. Outside of a greater cerebral hypoperfusion in patients during the later stages of tilt, responses did not differ dramatically between the vestibular loss and control subjects, or between tilts performed in light and <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> <b>conditions.</b> Thus, with the 'exception of cerebrovascular regulation, we conclude that orthostatic responses during slow postural tilts are not substantially impaired in humans following chronic loss of vestibular function, a result that might reflect compensation by nonvisual graviceptor inputs (e. g., somatosensory) or other circulatory reflex mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining haploid {{plants is}} one of the {{important}} tool that shorten the plant breeding process. Anther culture {{is one of}} the method used for obtaining haploid plants. Anther culture studies are carried out for several plant species. In the present study, flowers at different sizes of W. Murcott mandarin were collected at the blooming period. Stage of mononuclear microspore of anthers was determined according to method of acetocarmine. Mononuclear microspore stage of anthers was observed in flowers 4 - 5 mm in diameter. Anther culture experiments were carried out with 4 - 5 mm in diameter anthers. In this study, temperature pre-treatment was performed at 4 ˚C and 25 ˚C for two days. Surface sterilization was performed in flowers and anthers were cultured in nutrient medium N 6. Anther culture assays were performed with the three different concentrations of TDZ (0 mg l- 1 TDZ, 0. 1 mg l- 1 TDZ, 0. 5 mg l- 1 TDZ).

The present study reports an investigation on the HPLC-DAD profiles and contents of coumarin (1), trans-o-coumaric (2), kaurenoic (3), benzoylgrandifloric (4) and cinnamoylgrandifloric (5) acids in dried leaves of Mikania species stored in <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> under controlled <b>conditions.</b> Excepting 2, the constituents were isolated and purified to be employed as reference compounds. The samples were analyzed at three monthly intervals up to 18 months for M. laevigata and 12 months for M. glomerata. trans-o-Coumaric was not detected in both, whereas 1 occurred only in M. laevigata. The concentrations of the assayed constituents did not vary significantly within the evaluated period (p < 0. 05), for both species. In contrast, changes in the chromatographic profiles and spectral purity of peaks from 3, 4 and 5 were detected in samples of both Mikania stored for three months, while the coumarin profile in M. laevigata modified {{after six months of}} storage. The evaluation of chromatographic profiles based on spectral purity analyses of selected peaks was shown to be a more robust tool to access chemical stability of Mikania samples than the quantitation of chemical markers' contents...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} research, a novel method, namely sol-gel/laser-induced {{technique}} (SGLIT), {{has been developed}} to generate nano-structured TiO 2 -based films. The TiO 2 films based on unloaded (pure) TiO 2, Ce-TiO 2, W-TiO 2 and Ag-TiO 2, have been investigated in attempt to stabilise the formation of anatase and consequently of enhancing photo-catalytic and anti-bacterial activities. The TiO 2 precursor loaded with Ce 2 +, W 6 + and Ag 2 + ions (Ce-TiO 2, W-TiO 2 and Ag-TiO 2) were separately prepared by sol-gel method and spin-coated on microscopic glass slides. A pulsed KrF excimer laser with a wavelength of 248 nm and pulse width of 13 - 20 ns was employed to irradiate on the sol-gel prepared films at various operating parameters, in terms of laser fluence, number of laser pulses and repetition rate. The work has been focussed on microstructural characterisation of various films prepared by both SGLIT and furnace, in the consideration of crystallographic structure, phase transformation, crystallite sizes, surface morphology, film thickness and optical properties, by means of Raman spectroscopy, XRD, FEG-SEM/EDX, TEM/HR-TEM/EDX, AFM and UV-Vis spectroscopy etc. The results showed that nano-crystallisation of the films after laser irradiation has been achieved, with controllable amount of anatase formation. These coatings presented a unique feature of surface morphology with meso-porosity and much enlarged surface areas, compared with the films prepared by furnace sintering technique. The addition of Ce and Ag, stabilized the anatase structure during the laser irradiations, whereas the addition of W destabilized the anatase structure. The Ce-TiO 2 films prepared by SGLIT exhibited anatase structure which was stable up to 500 laser pulses at 35 mJ cm- 2 fluence. The anatase was formed after 10 laser pulses only at 65 - 75 mJ cm- 2 fluence in the W-TiO 2 films. When a higher number of laser pulses, fluence or higher W 6 + loading were chosen, rutile structure started to form. On the other hand, the Ag-TiO 2 nano-composite films prepared by SGLIT presented the anatase up to 200 laser pulses at 85 mJ cm- 2 fluence. On average, anatase crystallite size of about 38 nm was achieved from both the W-TiO 2 and Ag-TiO 2 films prepared by SGLIT. In contrast, the furnace-sintered W-TiO 2 and Ag-TiO 2 films produced anatase crystallite size of 49. 4 nm and 29. 8 nm respectively. Another achievement of the present research {{is the development of}} a single-step laser irradiation technique to generate an Ag-TiO 2 nano-composite film on the glass substrate. A pulsed laser beam produced hexagonal Ag nanoparticles along with the crystallization of anatase-based nano-structured TiO 2 film which was accomplished in 1 µs only. The films prepared by SGLIT displayed a higher photo-absorption compared to their furnace-sintered counterparts due to the unique surface features with a higher surface roughness. Overall, an enhanced bactericidal activity against E. coli cells was demonstrated under UV light by each of the W-TiO 2 films compared to furnace-sintered films except the 1 W-TiO 2. The E. coli cells did not survive on the W-TiO 2 films prepared by SGLIT, after 80 minutes under UV (365 nm) light. In contrast, E. coli cells still survived on the surface of furnace-sintered W-TiO 2 films under the same conditions. Ag-TiO 2 nano-composite films prepared by SGLIT, demonstrated an enhanced anti-bacterial activity against E. coli compared to the conventionally- made Ag-TiO 2 films. No bacteria survived on the Ag-TiO 2 films prepared by 50 laser pulses at 85 mJ cm- 2 fluence, whereas E. coli colonies always survived on the furnace-sintered Ag-TiO 2 films under the UV, natural light and the <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> <b>conditions.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceHigher Education CommissionGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
