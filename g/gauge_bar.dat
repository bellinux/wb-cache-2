The cursor slid along the wind bar, allowing the bomb aimer to measure different airspeeds or times. A small scale on the cursor allowed for the conversion of indicated air speed to true air speed, which differs depending on altitude. A small ring on the right side of the cursor was used to accurately place markings on the compass using the grease pencil. A holder for the pencil and a sharpener blade were attached on the left side of the case.|$|E

50|$|The third {{method of}} {{determining}} the wind is {{used in conjunction with}} the wind <b>gauge</b> <b>bar.</b> The aircraft is flown on three different headings, typically 120 degrees apart, and the time for the aircraft to travel a certain distance was measured with the timing beads. The bearing plate was rotated to match the compass heading of each leg, and the cursor was moved along the bar to draw a line on the bearing plate along that direction. After three such measurements a small triangle was formed. The aircraft then turned onto the bomb line. Using the drift angle measured from the auxiliary drift bar, the compass was rotated to that drift angle, and the cursor moved so it lay above the center of the triangle. This indicated the direction and speed of the wind.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study into the development of <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> for the measurement of Pitot pressures in low density expansion tube flows. The <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> developed here are modified from the conventional designs for <b>bar</b> <b>gauges.</b> A steel disc of 9 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness is attached to the front of a shielded sensing <b>bar.</b> Semiconductor strain <b>gauges</b> are used as the strain sensing elements. A PCB impact hammer was used to calibrate the <b>bar</b> <b>gauges.</b> Experiments in flows at 9 km/s, with Pitot pressures close to 750 kPa, were done in the X 1 expansion tube at The University of Queensland. Tests were also performed by changing the operation mode of the X 1 facility to run it as a non-reflected shock tunnel. For those tests the flow speed was around 1. 3 km/s and the Pitot pressure was close to 650 kPa. This test flow was used to check the calibration of the <b>bar</b> <b>gauges.</b> The results indicate that the <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> developed here can be used to measure Pitot pressures in flows with a test period of up to 100 µs. The quality of the signals can be enhanced by ensuring good contact between the front disk and the sensing bar. Moreover, by isolating the sensing bar electrically from the tunnel the effects of ionisation on noise levels on the strain signal is reduced. In order to obtain the true Pitot pressure measurements, the average disc pressures measured using the presented <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> have to be multiplied by a factor of 1. 08 (1 / 0. 93). The overall uncertainty of the Pitot pressure measured is estimated to be ± 7 %, for Pitot pressures of order 600 kPa...|$|R

5000|$|LR55 rail is {{a special}} rail section, {{promoted}} by Tram Power of the UK, designed for use in embedded tramway track installations. The rail itself is like a lop-sided [...] "V". It is a top-suspended rail: the load is transmitted by the rail head, rather than through a web to the rail foot. Slots are cut in the roadway and precast concrete troughs laid in the slots. A polyurethane mastic provides a resilient cushion between the rail and the concrete, minimising transmitted noise, and providing insulation against leakage currents. Since the load is spread across a wider base, it requires less depth for a sub-base than conventional tramway track avoiding the need to disturb existing underground utility services. The installation and maintenance time, and hence cost, is thus greatly reduced. Gauge is maintained by the pavement {{in which it is}} installed; {{there is no need for}} separate <b>gauging</b> <b>bars</b> between the rails. LR55 has been tested in parts of the Sheffield Supertram network.|$|R

This research studied a pressure swing adsorption using cassava-based adsorbent prepared from mixture of cassava starch and cassava pulp for dehydration of ethanol vapor. The apparatus used in the experiments consisted of double adsorption columns, an evaporator, and a vacuum pump. The feed solution contained 90 - 92 %wt of ethanol. Three process variables: adsorption temperatures (110, 120 and 130 °C), adsorption pressures (1 and 2 <b>bar</b> <b>gauge)</b> and feed vapor flow rate (25, 50 and 75 % valve opening of the evaporator) were investigated.

40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. December 2014. Major: Industrial and Systems Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Caroline Hayes. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 349 pages, appendices 1 - 9. This thesis describes a usability study {{designed to increase}} an automotive designer's {{understanding of how to}} design effective dual-fuel gauges for hybrid vehicles. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) aim at reducing dependency on gasoline. While gasoline has one primary source, which is non-renewable, electricity comes from renewable as well as non-renewable sources of energy. As we begin to generate electricity more efficiently from newer power plants that are built using renewable energy, it is important that drivers of HEVs begin to reduce their dependency on gasoline and rely more on electricity for operating their vehicles. Hybrid fuel gauges {{have a role to play}} in the overall user experience and adoption of HEVs. When purchasing a car, people take into consideration how the instrument panel looks and how understandable it is (Green, 1984). Therefore, it is important that these gauges are effective in providing information on fuel levels so that it can be read quickly and accurately. The goal of this work was to identify a class of gauges that support quick and accurate reading so that the driver can understand when to recharge the electric battery or refill the gas tank for efficient trip planning. A set of thirty-three hybrid gauge designs created by designers at General Motors was provided to the University of Minnesota team. The UMN team created four new gauge designs that were different from the ones created by the General Motors. These were reduced to a set of nine gauges by the process of heuristic evaluation. A two-part usability study was conducted with sixty drivers. In the first part, drivers participated in a timed comprehension task in which they were made to view certain gauges and answer questions on them. This was followed by a subjective questionnaire in which participants were asked about their preferences for various <b>gauges.</b> Vertically oriented <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> were found to be most effective. They elicited the highest accuracy rates and lowest response times compared to horizontally oriented <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> and circular gauges. Participants were able to process information in relative form (expressed in graphical or pictorial form) more easily and accurately than information in absolute form (expressed in numeric form). Familiar types of gauges, which appeal to participants, do not always contribute to better performance. Introducing new types of gauges requires more upfront marketing of their benefits (such as higher reading accuracy and speed). A set of recommendations has been created for automotive designers on how to create effective hybrid fuel gauges. These recommendations are important in driving standardization of hybrid fuel gauges to help deliver a consistent user experience and to minimize confusion and user frustration. These gauges encourage fuel-efficient behavior by helping drivers reduce their dependency on gasoline, thereby reducing pollution from carbon dioxide emissions and ultimately resulting in a cleaner environment...|$|R

In order to achieve this effectively knowledge of the nature of time dependent eects such as tension stiffening is required. There is, however, virtually no experimental data available for reinforced concrete with bar diameters greater than 25 mm. This project aims to identify the behaviour of tension stiffening for reinforced concrete specimens with large diameter reinforcement under sustained loading. Four tension specimens with single H 25, H 32, H 40 and H 50 strain <b>gauged</b> reinforcing <b>bars</b> were tested at multiple load stages. In addition, a finite element model was developed in ABAQUS with the aim of evaluating various steel concrete interface models. The applicability of finite element models in the structural analysis of reinforced concrete was also evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the existing conclusions for small diameter cases hold for the larger diameters. Tension stiffening, however, decays at a much higher rate than previously believed and reached a constant value within a maximum of 10 days in each case. The suggestion that only the long-term calculation methods presented in the various building codes for tension stiffening should be used for serviceability limit state calculations is supported. Additionally, a trend is identified which indicates a decrease in tension stiffening decay time with increasing bar diameter...|$|R
