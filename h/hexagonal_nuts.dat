50|$|Square nuts, {{as well as}} bolt heads, {{were the}} first shape made and {{used to be the}} most common largely because they were much easier to manufacture, {{especially}} by hand. While rare today due to the reasons stated below for the preference of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nuts,</b> they are occasionally used in some situations when a maximum amount of torque and grip is needed for a given size: the greater length of each side allows a spanner to be applied with a larger surface area and more leverage at the nut.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{supported}} by two fieldstone abutments and a pier. Its two spans are identical in construction, with one being much longer than the other. The 45 ft span {{at the south end}} is an end-post three-panel pony truss with both cast and wrought iron elements. Its upper chord is a riveted steel girder supported by lattice-braced members riveted to the flanges of the plate girder. The lower chord consists of two double wrought iron tension bars. The central panel is cross-braced with wrought-iron tie rods. All joints, not just in this span but the main one as well, are secured by threaded iron pins two inches (5 cm) wide capped with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cold forging {{has played}} a {{critical}} role in fasteners and has been applied to the automobile industry, construction industry, aerospace industry, and living products so that cold forging presents the opportunities for manufacturing more products. By using computer simulation, this study attempts to analyze the process of creating machine parts, such as <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nuts.</b> The DEFORM- 3 D forming software is applied to analyze the process at various stages in the computer simulation, and the compression test is also used for the flow stress equation in order to compare the differences between the experimental results and the equation that is built into the computer simulation software. At the same time, the metallography and hardness of experiments are utilized to understand the cold forging characteristics of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nuts.</b> The research results would benefit machinery businesses to realize the forging load and forming conditions at various stages before the fastener formation. In addition to planning proper die design and production, the quality of the produced <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nuts</b> would be more stable to promote industrial competitiveness...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion of {{reinforcement}} {{is one of}} the most common causes of deterioration in reinforced concrete bridges. Anchorage, prior to shear and bending moment resistance, is the main uncertainties in the evaluation of the structural behavior of corroded reinforced concrete bridges. Thus, to assess the remaining load-bearing capacity of deteriorated existing bridges, models to estimate the remaining bond and anchorage capacity are needed. Most of our knowledge on the structural behavior of corroded reinforced concrete structures is based on experimental investigations of artificially corroded concrete specimens. In this study, the anchorage capacity of naturally corroded steel reinforcement was investigated experimentally. The test specimens were taken from edge beams of a bridge, Stallbackabron, in Sweden. Since the dimensions and the amount {{of reinforcement}} were given on beforehand, it was only the test set-up which could be chosen freely. A test set-up consisting of a four point bending test indirectly supported with suspension hanger was considered to be the best alternative with the least disturbance and influence of the natural damages. Detailed design was done by using a non-linear finite element method. It was seen that the edge beams needed to be strengthened with transverse reiforcement, else they would have failed in a local failure at the suspension hole or in shear. The technique adopted for the strengthening was an internal mounting of steel reinforcement using epoxy as adhesive. The bond and anchorage behavior was examined in tests through measurements of applied load, free-end slip and mid-span deflection. A first test showed that additional measures were needed to ensure anchorage of the strengthening bars. In subsequent tests, they were therefore anchored at the top of the beam with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nuts</b> and flat steel plates. In two following tests, the beams failed in a splitting induced pull-out failure, i. e. anchorage failure was achieved as wanted...|$|E

40|$|When a bar falling {{or moving}} at any speed strikes the {{opposite}} side of threaded rod fastening a thick circular disk, stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly system, tightening the thick circular disk by the bolt-nut unit. This paper experimentally studies the relationship between the loosening response of bolt-nut fastening assembly system and stress wave modes (tension or compression) along the direction of propagation. The technique of observing the loosening of a bolt-nut assembly system by monitoring the configuration of stress waves reflected from the surface of a thick circular disk is presented. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nut</b> in conjunction with a plain washer, a spring washer or a flanged nut is measured, when a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly system. The shift of axial stress due to tightening by flanged nut is the smallest...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that a bolt-nut {{assembly}} system properly tightened can be loosened under vibrating load or impact. This paper experimentally investigates the loosening response of an assembly when a stress wave is transmitted from a gross area of a bolt, a face of a circular disk, or a screw thread of the thick circular disk assembly fastened by the bolt-nut unit. When a falling bar strikes {{the opposite side of}} a threaded rod fastened to the circular disk, or a falling circular pipe collides with the circular disk or with the anvil attached {{to the end of a}} screw, a stress wave propagating from the collision interface is transmitted into the assembly. The axial stress of a bolt tightened by a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nut</b> in conjunction with a plain washer is measured, while a number of incident waves are impinged into the assembly. The shift of axial stress due to the stress wave transmitted from the portion of the screw thread is the largest. The cause of the loosening is investigated by observing the stress waves transmitted into the circular disk assembly system...|$|R
5000|$|Following the Series 1 {{there was}} a {{transitional}} series of cars built in 1967-68 as model year 1968 cars, unofficially called [...] "Series 1½." [...] Due to American pressure the new features were not just open headlights, but also different switches (black plastic rocker switches {{as opposed to the}} Series 1 toggle switches), de-tuning (using two Zenith-Stromberg carburetters instead of the original three SUs) for US models, ribbed cam covers painted black except for the top brushed aluminum ribbing, hood frames on the OTS that have two bows, and other changes. [...] Series 1½ cars also have twin cooling fans and adjustable seat backs. The biggest change between 1961-1967 Series 1 E-Types and the 1968 Series 1.5 was the {{reduction in the number of}} carburetors from 3 to just 2, resulting in a loss in horsepower from 265 to 246 and a loss in torque from 283 to 263. [...] Series 2 features were gradually introduced into the Series 1, creating the unofficial Series 1½ cars, but always with the Series 1 body style. A United States federal safety law affecting 1968 model year cars sold in the US was the reason for the lack of headlight covers and change in dash switch design in the [...] "Series 1.5" [...] of 1968. An often overlooked change, one that is often [...] "modified back" [...] to the older style, is the wheel knock-off [...] "nut." [...] US safety law for 1968 models also forbid the winged-spinner knockoff, and any 1968 model year sold in the US (or earlier German delivery cars) should have a <b>hexagonal</b> knockoff <b>nut,</b> to be hammered on and off with the assistance of a special [...] "socket" [...] included with the car from the factory. This <b>hexagonal</b> <b>nut</b> carried on into the later Series 2 and 3. The engine configuration of the US Series 1.5s was the same as is found in the Series 2, and per the JCNA Judges Guide, [...] "only MY 68 E-types are true Series 1.5s." ...|$|R

40|$|A new drying-free {{colloidal}} casting {{method was}} developed for shape forming of ceramics with controllable microstructure. A polymerizable solvent such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) was employed to disperse ceramic particles to form a colloidal ceramic suspension with good fluidity. After casting, the solvent was polymerized into a polymer, resulting in solidification of the colloidal suspension. For the purpose of demonstrating this casting method, three types of ceramic powders (NiO/YSZ, Al(2) O(3) and YSZ) were used to fabricate a NiO/YSZ ceramic tube, an Al(2) O(3) ceramic part with a <b>hexagonal</b> screw <b>nut</b> shape, and a YSZ thin film. Our study shows that the microstructure (pore size and porosity) of ceramics can be readily tuned by adjusting the amount of FA, and the drying-free casting method offers better controllability over the shape forming {{of a wide variety}} of ceramic material...|$|R
