25|$|A <b>flexible</b> <b>tube,</b> {{inserted}} into the rectum, {{can be used to}} collect intestinal gas in a flatus bag. This method is occasionally needed in a hospital setting, when the patient is unable to pass gas normally.|$|E
25|$|A small <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> (nasogastric tube) may be {{inserted}} {{through the nose}} into the stomach to help decompress the dilated bowel. This tube is uncomfortable but does relieve the abdominal cramps, distention, and vomiting. Intravenous therapy is utilized and the urine output is monitored with a catheter in the bladder.|$|E
25|$|Although an {{occlusive}} tumor may be suspected on a {{barium swallow}} or barium meal, {{the diagnosis is}} best made with an examination using an endoscope. This involves the passing of a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> with a light and camera down the esophagus and examining the wall, and is called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies taken of suspicious lesions are then examined histologically for signs of malignancy.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is a heat-exchanging {{apparatus that}} {{also serves as}} a handler-transporter of media-containing vessels. The heat-exchanging apparatus is composed of a <b>flexible,</b> holow <b>tube</b> that is generally {{in the shape of a}} coil, which allows for the flow of liquid therein. There is an insulated gripping means for covering the handle of the <b>flexible,</b> hollow <b>tube</b> 2 ̆ 7 s first end and second end to prevent contact with hot or cold temperatures when the present invention is handled or transported. In addition, the <b>flexible,</b> hollow <b>tube</b> is connected to two <b>flexible,</b> heat-insulated <b>tubes.</b> The <b>flexible,</b> heat-insulating <b>tubes</b> are connected to a fluid dispenser and a reservoir to provide a channel for in-coming fluid and out-going fluid. Also, to allow for secure and safe handling/transporting of media-containing vessel, the first and second ends of the <b>flexible,</b> hollow <b>tubes</b> are held together by a locking means...|$|R
50|$|Detachable light guides, {{consisting}} of rigid bent plastic rods or semi-rigid or <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> containing optical fibers, {{are available for}} some flashlights for inspection inside tanks, or within walls or structures; when not required the light guide can be removed and the light used for other purposes.|$|R
50|$|RIBs {{can also}} {{generally}} cope better with rougher seas, although {{this may be}} partially due to an increased level of confidence in knowing that a RIB is hard to sink, and better absorption of heavy loads by the <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes,</b> which therefore make heavy seas less unpleasant.|$|R
25|$|Colonoscopy is the {{endoscopic}} {{examination of the}} large intestine and the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> passed through the anus. It can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied {{with the aid of}} a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. It takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for getting {{around on the}} dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July in the morning, a {{crack in}} a {{polyvinyl}} hose - 30 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide - was found around the outlet of a temporary pump for seawater. At 10AM the pump was shut off, the cooling system of reactor 5 was halted 15 minutes later. The polyvinyl pipe was replaced, and the cooling system was restarted at 13:45PM. The temperature in the reactor rose some 5 degrees Celsius to 47.7 degrees Celsius. Constant tidal movements were probably {{the cause of the}} rupture of the pleated <b>flexible</b> <b>tube.</b> On 4 July TEPCO announced that all tubes and hoses used in the heat removal systems will be checked on possible weaknesses. Tubes like these, that were used to transfer highly radioactive water, did not require replacement because they were not bent at extreme angles. At 10:16 AM on 15 July, TEPCO completed repairs to Pump B of the original Residual Heat Removal Seawater System of Unit 5. The original seawater system was severely damaged in the tsunami requiring the temporary seawater pumps and hoses to be installed which have proven to be leak prone. At 2:45 PM on 15 July, TEPCO began pumping seawater through the residual heat removal heat exchanger with the newly repaired pump.|$|E
40|$|Rotational fluid {{coupling}} mechanism circulates a temperature controlled fluid between a stationary heat exchanger and a coolant plate on a rotating platform. The mechanism {{consists of two}} concentric cylinders containing one or more <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> which are controlled and positioned {{in such a way}} that it eliminates tubing entanglement...|$|R
50|$|Light {{transmission}} efficiency is greatest if the tube {{is short and}} straight. In longer, angled, or <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes,</b> part of the light intensity is lost. To minimize losses, a high reflectivity of the tube lining is crucial; manufacturers claim reflectivities of their materials, in the visible range, of up to almost 99.5 percent.|$|R
40|$|Examination of the gastrointestinal(GI) tract has {{traditionally}} been performed using endoscopy tools that allow a surgeon to see {{the inside of the}} lining of the digestive tract. Endoscopes are rigid or <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> that use fibre-optics or cameras to visualise tissues in natural orifices. This can be an uncomfortable and very invasive procedure for the patient...|$|R
25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{designed}} {{and used a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> stethoscope in June 1840, {{and in the same}} year he published the first description of such an instrument. [...] In his paper he mentions an instrument already in use by other physicians (Drs. Clendinning and Stroud), which he describes as the [...] "snake ear trumpet". [...] He thought this instrument had some severe technical faults; in particular, its great length led to poor performance. [...] The form of Bird's invention is similar to the modern stethoscope, except that it has only one earpiece. [...] An ill-tempered exchange of letters occurred in the London Medical Gazette between another physician, John Burne, and Bird. [...] Burne claimed that he also used the same instrument as Clendinning and Stroud and was offended that Bird had not mentioned him in his paper. [...] Burne, who worked at the Westminster Hospital, pointed with suspicion to the fact that Bird's brother Frederic also worked there. [...] In a reply full of anger and sarcasm, Bird pointed out that in his original paper he had already made clear that he claimed no credit for the earlier instrument.Burne, , p. 471, 11 June 1841Bird, , pp. 510–511, 18 June 1841Burne, [...] p. 590, 2 July 1841 [...] Bird found the flexible stethoscope convenient as it avoided uncomfortably leaning over patients (as would be required by a rigid stethoscope) and the earpiece could be passed to other doctors and students to listen. [...] It was particularly useful for Bird, with his severe rheumatism, as he could apply the stethoscope to the patient from a seated position.Wilks, p. 490Wilks and Bettany, pp. 246–247 ...|$|E
2500|$|The pain {{associated}} with the procedure is not caused by the insertion of the scope but rather by the inflation of the colon {{in order to do}} the inspection.

2500|$|For a {{few years}} in the mid-1950s, Draeger made the Draeger Delfin II (their first scuba {{regulator}} - it was marketed as the Barakuda (now IAC) in the USA): this was a single stage single hose [...] "pendulum"" [...] regulator with only one ambient pressure (corrugated) hose: the exhaled air went back down the hose to the cylinder mounted regulator and was released to outside through a one-way valve inside the casing. The end of the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> {{was connected to the}} mouthpiece by a short quarter-circle of hard tube. The two way hose would have caused dead space similar to a rebreather with a pendulum system.|$|E

50|$|An {{inflatable}} boat is a lightweight boat constructed with its sides and bow made of <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> containing pressurised gas. For smaller boats, {{the floor and}} hull beneath it is often flexible. On boats longer than 3 m, the floor often consists of three to five rigid plywood or aluminium sheets fixed between the tubes but not joined rigidly together. Often the transom is rigid, providing a location and structure for mounting an outboard motor.|$|R

2500|$|The {{stethoscope}} {{was invented}} in France in 1816 by René Laennec at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris. It consisted of a wooden tube and was monaural. Laennec invented the stethoscope because he was uncomfortable placing his ear on women's chests to hear heart sounds. He observed that a rolled notebook, placed between the patient's chest and his ear, could amplify heart sounds without requiring physical contact. Laennec's device {{was similar to the}} common ear trumpet, a historical form of hearing aid; indeed, his invention was almost indistinguishable in structure and function from the trumpet, which was commonly called a [...] "microphone". Laennec called his device the [...] "stethoscope" [...] ( [...] + , [...] "chest scope"), and he called its use [...] " [...] auscultation", because it was auscultation with a tool intermediate between the patient's body and the physician's ear. (Today the word auscultation denotes all such listening, mediate or not.) The first flexible stethoscope of any sort may have been a binaural instrument with articulated joints not very clearly described in 1829. In 1840, Golding Bird described a stethoscope he had been using with a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube.</b> Bird was the first to publish a description of such a stethoscope but he noted in his paper the prior existence of an earlier design (which he thought was of little utility) which he described as the snake ear trumpet. Bird's stethoscope had a single earpiece.Golding Bird, , London Medical Gazette, vol.1, pp.440-412, 11 December 1840.|$|E

50|$|Astronauts {{commonly}} wear a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment {{in order}} to maintain a comfortable core body temperature during extra-vehicular activity (EVA). The LCVG accomplishes this task by circulating cool water through a network of <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> in direct contact with the astronaut's skin. The water draws heat away from the body, resulting in a lower core temperature. The water then returns to the Primary Life Support System (PLSS), where it is cooled in a heat exchanger before being recirculated.|$|R
50|$|Cannulae are hollow <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> {{of varying}} bore, usually 16-22 gauge thick. They are {{commonly}} made {{of stainless steel}} or PTFE for chemical resistance. Stainless steel cannulae are usually 2-3 feet long, due to their relative inflexibility, while PTFE cannulae can be much shorter. The ends are usually sharp and non-coring, allowing them to easily pierce a rubber septum, without being clogged by rubber particles. Flat ends may be chosen on occasion, {{because they tend to}} provide more complete transfer of fluids.|$|R
