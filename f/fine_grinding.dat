25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} into flotation {{began when he}} was at Imperial College London, in 1969. A colleague, Dr J A Kitchener of the Royal School of Mines, pointed out that many of the new mineral deposits being found around the world required <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> to separate the valuable particles from the rock in which they were embedded, and the flotation technologies available at the time were relatively inefficient for recovering fine particles. Kitchener felt that improvements could best be achieved by an increased knowledge of the physics of flotation, rather than the chemistry of the reagents. Jameson had gained some expertise in the properties of bubbles and particles in suspensions whilst a PhD student at Cambridge. He began {{research into}} the fluid mechanics of the flotation process and set in train a series of experimental projects into the effect of particle diameter and bubble size on the flotation rate constant. Much of the research was conducted by honours students in chemical engineering. Jameson accepted the challenge of coming up with practical solutions to remedy the situation, if these could be identified.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{shocked at}} finding, just after this noble {{declaration}} of principles, {{that in a}} little note-book which at that time I carried about with me the celebrated city of Angers is denominated a [...] "sell." [...] I reproduce this vulgar word with the greatest hesitation, and only because it brings me more quickly to my point. This point is that Angers belongs to the disagreeable class of old towns that have been, as the English say, [...] "done up." [...] Not the oldness, but the newness, of the place is what strikes the sentimental tourist to-day, as he wanders with irritation along second-rate boulevards, looking vaguely about him for absent gables. [...] "Black Angers," [...] in short, {{is a victim of}} modern improvements and quite unworthy of its admirable name--a name which, like that of Le Mans, had always had, to my eyes, a highly picturesque value. It looks particularly well on the Shakespearean page (in [...] "King John"), where we imagine it uttered (though such would not have been the utterance of the period) with a <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> insular accent. Angers figures with importance in early English history: it was the capital city of the Plantagenet race, home of that Geoffrey of Anjou who married, as second husband, the Empress Maud, daughter of Henry I. and competitor of Stephen, and became father of Henry II., first of the Plantagenet kings, born, as we have seen, at Le Mans. These facts create a natural presumption that Angers will look historic; I turned them over in my mind as I travelled in the train from Le Mans, through a country that was really pretty and looked more like the usual English than like the usual French scenery, with its fields cut up by hedges and a considerable rotundity in its trees. On my way from the station to the hotel, however, it became plain that I should lack a good pretext for passing that night at the Cheval Blanc; I foresaw that I should have contented myself {{before the end of the}} day. I remained at the White Horse only long enough to discover that it was an exceptionally good provincial inn, one of the best that I encountered during six weeks spent in these establishments.|$|E
50|$|Mining of banded iron {{formations}} involves {{coarse crushing}} and screening, followed by rough crushing and <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> to comminute the ore {{to the point}} where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.|$|E

2500|$|After {{blanching}} the peanuts {{are sent}} to grinding to be manufactured into peanut butter. [...] The peanuts are then sent through two sizes of grinders. The first grinder produces a medium grind, and the second produces a <b>fine</b> <b>grind.</b> At this point, salt, and a vegetable oil stabilizer {{are added to the}} <b>fine</b> <b>grind</b> to produce the peanut butter. [...] This adds flavour and allows the peanut butter to stay as a homogenous mixture. [...] Chopped peanuts may also be added at this stage to produce “chunky” peanut butter.|$|R
50|$|These issues {{provided}} a great incentive for MIM to grind its ores finer. MIM metallurgists had undertaken <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> test work on samples from both deposits using conventional grinding technologies between 1975 and 1985. However, {{it was found}} that conventional grinding had a very high power consumption and that contamination of the mineral surface by iron from the steel grinding media adversely affected flotation performance.It was concluded in 1990 that there was no suitable existing technology for grinding to the fine sizes in the base metals industry. Consequently, Mount Isa’s head of mineral processing research, Dr Bill Johnson, began looking at grinding practices outside the mining industry. He found that <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> was well established for such high-value manufactured products as printer inks, pharmaceuticals, paint pigments and chocolate.|$|E
50|$|The term {{is derived}} from honing {{cylinders}} and holes. A flat workpiece surface is processed, hence the word flat; the word honing is used because the cutting speed is low compared to grinding. A fixed abrasive is used to provide accuracy and optical appearance of the surface finish. Sometimes it is also called <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> or surface grinding using planetary kinematics.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> (sometimes called [...] "polishing"), {{the bond}} should be harder and the {{diamonds}}' quality can be lower, {{as in this}} case the diamonds can last longer and a hard bond can also help the precision of the process. The diamond grit is normally between 80 grit and 120 grit, depending on the grinding requirements. The diamond concentration should be higher.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the Italians {{launched}} the 'age of crema' as the new coffee machines could create a higher pressure, leading to a <b>finer</b> <b>grind</b> and the now classic 'crema'.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the IsaMill was driven by MIM Holdings’ desire to develop its McArthur River lead-zinc deposit in Australia’s Northern Territory, and by the need for <b>finer</b> <b>grinding</b> at its Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator.|$|R

5000|$|The {{secondary}} mirror was manufactured by Corning of ultra low expansion glass and coarse-ground to within 40 μm {{of the desired}} shape. In November 2009, the blank was shipped to Harvard University for storage until funding to complete it was available. On October 21, 2014, the {{secondary mirror}} blank was delivered from Harvard to Exelis (now a subsidiary of [...] Harris Corporation) for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mount Isa Mines Limited ("MIM") {{operates}} the Mount Isa copper, lead, zinc and silver mines near Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia {{as part of}} the Glencore group of companies. For a brief period in 1980, MIM was Australia's largest company. It has pioneered several significant mining industry innovations, including the Isa Process copper refining technology, the Isasmelt smelting technology, and the IsaMill <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> technology, and it also commercialized the Jameson Cell column flotation technology.|$|E
50|$|Hint {{experimented with}} Rotary Impact Mill or Contra Rotating Mill - Disintegrator for decades. The Disintegrator {{processed}} the mixture by <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> and mechanical activation of material components with water, which further strengthened autoclave effects. Silicatsite (Laprex) factories were opened initially in Estonia but then {{all over the}} Soviet Union {{as well as in}} Japan and Italy. His company did not only concentrate on building materials but also manufactured and distributed universal disintegrator-activator and UDA technology.|$|E
5000|$|Strength depends {{instead on}} grind: <b>finer</b> <b>grinds</b> yield a [...] "shorter" [...] (ristretto) espresso (less liquid, so higher brew ratio, at same yield gives more strength), while coarser grinds yield a [...] "longer" [...] (lungo) espresso, while an {{intermediate}} grind yields a [...] "normale" [...] espresso.|$|R
25|$|The type of grind {{is often}} {{named after the}} brewing method {{for which it is}} {{generally}} used. Turkish <b>grind</b> is the <b>finest</b> <b>grind,</b> while coffee percolator or French press are the coarsest grinds. The most common grinds are between these two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.|$|R
50|$|These mills offer a {{wide range}} of grind settings, making them {{suitable}} to grind coffee for various brewing systems such as espresso, drip, percolators, French press, and others. Many burr grinders, including almost all domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely <b>fine</b> <b>grind</b> required for the preparation of Turkish coffee; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.|$|R
5000|$|The primary mirror, {{the most}} {{critical}} and time-consuming {{part of a large}} telescope's construction, was made over a 7-year period by the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory Mirror Lab. Construction of the mold began in November 2007, mirror casting was begun in March 2008, and the mirror blank was declared [...] "perfect" [...] at the beginning of September 2008. In January 2011, both M1 and M3 figures had completed generation and <b>fine</b> <b>grinding,</b> and polishing had begun on M3.|$|E
5000|$|MIM Holdings was {{responsible}} for several significant technological advances in the mining industry, including the Isa Process tank house technology, developed at its subsidiary Copper Refineries Pty Limited in Townsville, Queensland; the Bottom-blown oxygen converter ("BBOCTM") developed at its lead refining subsidiary, Britannia Refined Metals, at Northfleet in England; and the ISASMELT top-entry submerged lance smelting process, Jameson Cell flotation technology, and the IsaMill <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> technology, all developed at its Mount Isa Mines Limited operations in Mount Isa.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} is called roughing, which {{produces}} a rougher concentrate. The {{objective is to}} remove {{the maximum amount of}} the valuable mineral at as coarse a particle size as practical. The finer an ore is ground, the greater the energy that is required, so it makes sense to fine grind only those particles that need <b>fine</b> <b>grinding.</b> Complete liberation is not required for rougher flotation, only sufficient liberation to release enough gangue from the valuable mineral to get a high recovery.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} of rock {{polishing}} is the <b>fine</b> <b>grind.</b> This process {{is the same as}} the coarse grind, differing only in the use of a finer grit, and that the stones are no longer shaped but are beginning to be polished. At the end of this step the rocks would appear shiny when wet, but matte when dry.|$|R
30|$|The {{increasing}} {{levels of}} the remaining metals in recent years, particularly As, may pertain to releases as by-products via the mine wastes. Given the haphazard nature of galamsey operations, the <b>fine</b> <b>grinds</b> that may contain some of these metals are all released directly into water bodies. Therefore the upsurge of galamsey operations with time has invariably generated increasing levels of contamination from various heavy metals as one traversed upwards along the sediment core. The comparatively high levels of As in the sediment core {{was related to the}} gold-bearing ore, which is rich in arsenopyrite (FeAsS) (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2009). Considering that small-scale miners did not treat mine wastes, As in <b>fine</b> <b>grinds</b> were released directly into the environment, while exposure and subsequent oxidation of pyrite (FeS 2) were likely to cause acid mine drainage (AMD). The AMD potentially mobilized toxic metals from the mine wastes and soils resulting in increasing {{levels of the}}se toxic elements in the sediment over time.|$|R
5000|$|Excellerator is a {{co-product}} of downstream {{stainless steel}} furnace slag that undergoes proprietary aging processes, <b>fine</b> <b>grind</b> pulverizing, and extensive metal separation to remove impurities. Over 99.95% of all metals are removed. Particular {{attention is paid}} to the removal of [...] "free lime" [...] (CaO and MgO), which disrupts product stability and consistency of performance. The final product contains both calcium and magnesium silicates in addition to a micronutrient package (see table below).|$|R
50|$|During 1896-97, De Lamar {{acquired}} claims {{within the}} gold district of Mercur and {{had built a}} 500-ton cyanide process mill, later expanded to 1,000 ton, which {{was said to be}} the largest of the time, to work the mines. Jackling followed DeLamar to Utah as mill superintendent. During his Cripple Creek and Mercur operations years, he also invested in gold mines in Lincoln County, Nevada, that from 1896 to 1902 paid him $8,000,000 in profits. At the Delamar Mine, Nevada, the barrel-chlorinating process was installed in 1895 and soon later discarded in favour of <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> and cyaniding.|$|E
50|$|The mineral jig {{has certain}} {{advantages}} in placer and hardrock mill flowsheets. In gold recovery the jigs produce highly concentrated products {{which can be}} easily upgraded by methods such as barrel amalgamation, treating across shaking tables or processing through centrifugal concentrators. In other placer operations the heavy minerals being sought are recovered efficiently and cheaply with similar high ratios of concentration. In iron, manganese and base metal treatment flowsheets, the jigs are operated to produce marketable grades of concentrate; or, as pre-concentration devices, to reject barren gangue prior to the ore entering the <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> section of the mill flowsheet.|$|E
50|$|Abrasive {{machining}} {{works by}} forcing the abrasive particles, or grains, into {{the surface of}} the workpiece so that each particle cuts away a small bit of material. Abrasive machining is similar to conventional machining, such as milling or turning, because each of the abrasive particles acts like a miniature cutting tool. However, unlike conventional machining the grains are much smaller than a cutting tool, and the geometry and orientation of individual grains are not well defined. As a result, abrasive machining is less power efficient and generates more heat.The grain size may be different based on the machining. For rough grinding, coarse abrasives are used. For <b>fine</b> <b>grinding,</b> fine grains (abrasives) are used.|$|E

50|$|Mineral CSA is {{a finely}} ground calcium {{silicate}} feedstock {{produced by the}} U.S.-based company Harsco Minerals, which provides a solution for correcting acidic conditions and managing toxic metals associated with acid mine drainage (AMD). Mineral CSA has been used on operating and abandoned mine sites since 1991. It is a highly refined, repurposed calcium silicate aggregate. Its parent material is a downstream stainless steel furnace slag that undergoes “ageing” processes, <b>fine</b> <b>grind</b> pulverizing, and extensive metal separation (>99.95% of all metals removed) to remove impurities.|$|R
50|$|The company Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL) has {{developed}} a process to extract uranium from the Western and Eastern coastal dune sands of India. After pre-processing with high-intensity magnetic separators and <b>fine</b> <b>grinding,</b> the mineral sands (known as monazite), are digested with caustic soda at about 120C and water. The hydroxide concentrate is further digested with concentrated hydrochloric acid to solubilise all hydroxides to form a feed solution composed of chlorides of uranium and other rare earth elements including thorium. The solution is subjected to liquid-liquid extraction with dual solvent systems to produce uranyl chloride and thorium oxalate. The crude uranyl chloride solution is subsequently refined to nuclear grade ammonium diuranate by a purification process involving precipitation and solvent extraction in a nitrate media.|$|E
5000|$|The {{windmill}} has a pair {{of common}} sails and {{a pair of}} spring sails, carried by a wooden windshaft with a cast iron poll end. The mill has two pairs of millstones, arranged head and tail. The head stones are Derbyshire Peak stones are used for rough grinding, while the tail stones are made from pieces of French , embedded in plaster of Paris. These millstones were used for <b>fine</b> <b>grinding.</b> Each pair of stones is driven by its own wheel, called the head wheel and tail wheel. The Friends of High Salvington Mill have had to rebuild the head wheel, but the tail wheel, an original of a rare [...] "compass arm" [...] design, is now too fragile to be used for grinding.|$|E
50|$|MIM {{decided to}} work with Netzsch, which was {{a pioneer in the}} <b>fine</b> <b>grinding</b> field, and still a leader. Test work was {{undertaken}} using one of Netzsch’s horizontal bead mills. It showed that such a mill could achieve the required grind size. However, the mills used in these industries were used on a small scale and were often batch operations. They used expensive grinding media that frequently needed to be removed, screened and replaced so that the mills would continue to operate properly. The traditional grinding medium consisted of silica-alumina-zirconium beads that, in those days, cost about US$25 per kilogram ("kg") and lasted for only a few hundred hours. Such a high-cost and short-lived grinding medium would be uneconomic in an industry processing hundreds of tonnes of ore an hour.|$|E
50|$|If a brewing {{method is}} used in which the time of {{exposure}} of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time {{can be used for}} finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground coffee unless used to grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation. A <b>fine</b> <b>grind</b> allows the most efficient extraction but coffee ground too finely will slow down filtration or screening.|$|R
50|$|The {{company had}} always {{disposed}} {{of the mill}} tailings (locally called stamp sands) in lakes adjacent to the mills, but about 1900 began investigating methods to recover the copper remaining in the waste tailings. Beginning in 1915, C&H began reprocessing the stamp sands at Lake Linden, using a <b>finer</b> <b>grind</b> and ammonia leaching. Once the process proved profitable, the Tamarack mill also began reprocessing tailings. Through 1949, the company had recovered 535 million pounds (243,000 metric tons) of copper by reprocessing tailings. One of the dredges used, Calumet and Hecla Dredge Number One, is currently sunk in shallow water in Torch Lake.|$|R
40|$|Characterizing surface {{roughness}} {{is important for}} predicting optical performance. Better measurement of {{surface roughness}} reduces grinding saving both time and money and allows the science requirements to be better defined. In this study various materials are polished from a <b>fine</b> <b>grind</b> to a <b>fine</b> polish. Each sample's RMS surface roughness is measured at 81 locations in a 9 x 9 square grid using a Zygo white light interferometer at regular intervals during the polishing process. Each data set is fit with various standard distributions and tested for goodness of fit. We show that the skew in the RMS data changes {{as a function of}} polishing time...|$|R
