5|$|Anti-inflammatory <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> generally {{viewed as}} being the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
40|$|One or more <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> {{detected}} in 81 percent of 440 male drivers, aged 15 - 34, killed in motor vehicle crashes in California; {{two or more}} <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> {{detected in}} 43 percent. Alcohol, the most frequently found <b>drug,</b> <b>was</b> detected in 70 percent of the drivers, marijuana in 37 percent, and cocaine in 11 percent. Each of 24 other <b>drugs</b> <b>was</b> detected in fewer than 5 percent. Except for alcohol, <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> infrequently found alone; typically, they were found in combination with high blood alcohol concentrations. The causal role of <b>drugs</b> in crashes <b>was</b> assessed by comparing drivers with and without drugs {{in terms of their}} responsibility for the crash. Alcohol was associated with increased crash responsibility; the role of other <b>drugs</b> could not <b>be</b> adequately determined...|$|R

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E

5|$|For {{lung cancer}} cases that develop {{resistance}} to {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, new <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> in development.

5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5000|$|Pirfenidone is {{administered}} orally. Though {{the presence of}} food significantly reduces the extent of absorption, the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> to be taken after food, to reduce the nausea and dizziness associated with the <b>drug.</b> The <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> around 60% bound to plasma proteins, especially to albumin. [...] Up to 50% of the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> metabolized by hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme system to yield 5-carboxypirfenidone, the inactive metabolite. Almost 80% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours of intake.|$|R
50|$|When {{choosing}} a cutting agent, the drug manufacturer or dealer would ideally {{attempt to find}} a chemical that is inexpensive, easy to obtain, relatively non-toxic, and mimics the physical attributes of the <b>drug</b> to <b>be</b> adulterated.

Similar melting and boiling points are also important if the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> to be smoked.|$|R
30|$|The TGA {{thermograms}} of PG and CQ {{suggested that}} the <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> not thermally stable. PG exhibited a curve, indicating a rapid rate of degradation (Fig.  6 b).

This observation {{suggested that the}} hydrogels enhanced the thermal stability of the <b>drugs</b> which <b>is</b> attributed to {{the high degree of}} crosslinking of the hydrogel and interaction between rGO and the polymeric network (Fig.  6 b) [17].|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> administered.
