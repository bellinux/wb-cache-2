500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and Vertical Scanning Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or <b>Frequency</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>Analysis</b> (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> <b>analysis</b> of the classical control theory, modern control theory utilizes the time-domain state space representation, a mathematical model of a physical system {{as a set of}} input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations. To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs, and states, the variables are expressed as vectors and the differential and algebraic equations are written in matrix form (the latter only being possible when the dynamical system is linear). The state space representation (also known as the [...] "time-domain approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With inputs and outputs, we would otherwise have to write down Laplace transforms to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the frequency domain approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. [...] "State space" [...] refers to the space whose axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a point within that space.|$|E

A surface profile generation method is put forward. Two cases with different tool-work vibration frequencies are carried out. The spatial frequency spectrum is obtained based on the FFT analysis of the generated profile in the specified direction. After the in-depth analysis, the inherent correlation of the generated spatial frequency components with feed spatial frequency and machine dynamic errors induced spatial frequency under certain machining conditions are found, which is very meaningful for the <b>frequency</b> <b>domain</b> error prediction in the real application.

50|$|The {{operating}} principle {{is based on}} the Doppler effect, which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface. Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways. A scanning laser vibrometer integrates computer-controlled X,Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head. The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object’s surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements.
