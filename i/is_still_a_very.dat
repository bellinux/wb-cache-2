Most {{of the houses}} are fairly modern bungalows, such as those named Barnfield, Heather Moor, Moss View and Tamberry, although there are older two-floor cottages {{on either side of}} the hamlet. Another bungalow is named Anchorage, which features a ship anchor scheme on its gates.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century Stretford was {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} village. The development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town, beginning in the late 19th century, had a significant effect on Stretford's subsequent development. At its peak in 1945 the park employed an estimated 75,000workers; housing and other amenities had to be constructed on what had previously been agricultural land. Trafford Park <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant source of employment, containing an estimated 1,400 companies and employing about 44,000 people. As at the 2001 UK census, 0.3% of Stretford's working population was employed in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The famous white Siberian tigers {{found in}} captivity are {{actually}} not pure Siberian tigers. They are instead {{the result of}} Siberian tigers breeding with Bengal tigers. The gene for white coating is quite common among Bengal tigers, but the natural birth of a white Bengal tiger <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare occasion in the wild, where white tigers are not bred selectively.|$|E

25|$|Graph {{coloring}} enjoys many {{practical applications}} {{as well as}} theoretical challenges. Beside the classical types of problems, different limitations can also be set on the graph, or on the way a color is assigned, or even on the color itself. It has even reached popularity with the general public {{in the form of}} the popular number puzzle Sudoku. Graph coloring <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> active field of research.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor {{understanding}} of the correlation between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures. During the period 1645–1715, {{in the middle of}} the Little Ice Age, there was a period of low solar activity known as the Maunder Minimum. The Spörer Minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period between 1460 and 1550. Other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14 and beryllium-10.|$|E
25|$|The J/24 is {{no longer}} {{considered}} the most modern sailboat in its class, but it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular sailboat among keelboat racers. While some of the world's best J/24 sailors have the latest version J/24, a well-prepared 1977 model, built to the same shape and weight with rigid end-grained balsa core construction can still win sailing the class world championship even after 30,000+ miles of trailering.

25|$|The {{adenovirus}} genome is linear, non-segmented double-stranded (ds) DNA that {{is between}} 26 and 48 Kbp. This allows {{the virus to}} theoretically carry 22 to 40 genes. Although this is significantly larger than other viruses in its Baltimore group, it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple virus and is heavily reliant on the host cell for survival and replication. An interesting feature of this viral genome {{is that it has}} a terminal 55 kDa protein associated with each of the 5' ends of the linear dsDNA. These are used as primers in viral replication and ensure that the ends of the virus' linear genome are adequately replicated.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism is {{an ancient}} {{cultural}} practice in Assam and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important part of Assamese way of life. Various elements {{are being used to}} represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. Tamulpan, Xorai and Gamosa are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. Tamulpan (the areca nut and betel leaves) or guapan (gua from kwa) are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition {{is an ancient}} one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austro-Asiatic culture. Xorai is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, {{but it can be}} very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd. Because this <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E

25|$|Where Herncliffe Gardens and Eddington Gardens stood, {{there is}} now the 1959 sea wall, beach and undersea mud. Knowledge of what had existed there persisted mostly in the mythology of local children, until in the 1990s an {{information}} board featuring a picture of Reid was erected beside the Pier. A Council Oyster Bay Trail cycle route, planned in 2009, is named after the area's history. Today there is an established walking route along the 1959 coastal defence; {{it is part of}} the Saxon Shore Way. The committee for Herne Bay Festival 2008 agreed a cross-marketing strategy with Whitstable Oyster Festival, thus recognising the history of dredging off Herne Bay by the oyster fisheries working from Hampton-on-Sea in the 19th century. There <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small fleet of day fishing boats operating offshore of the Hampton area, and landing on the beach at Herne Bay.|$|E
25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

But Fodor complains that Pinker, Plotkin {{and other members of}} what he sarcastically calls [...] "the New Synthesis" [...] have taken modularity and similar ideas way too far. He insists that the mind is not [...] "massively modular" [...] and that, contrary to what these researchers would have us believe, the mind <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long way from having been explained by the computational, or any other, model.|$|E
500|$|Marrakesh has {{the largest}} {{traditional}} Berber market in Morocco {{and the image of}} the city is closely associated with its souks. Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city: [...] "A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks no bigger than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering Aladdin's Caves once you're inside." [...] Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important part of trade in the souks.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bergen, {{writing for}} The Nation, offered a {{detailed}} {{critique of the}} film. Bergen wrote that even if al-Qaeda is not as organised as the Bush administration stressed, it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dangerous force due to the fanaticism of its followers and the resources available to bin Laden. On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, [...] "This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and {{a small group of}} like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks." [...] Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.|$|E

500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come in here and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E
500|$|Joy Kim of Manga Life also {{praised the}} art style saying the {{characters}} were distinctive. She criticized {{the relationship of}} the lead couple, Si-Joon Lee and Mu-Yeon Park, saying that Mu-Yeon should not be so sweet and protective of someone who does not return her feelings. Kim praised the character Ji-Oh Yun as the most interesting character in the series and that his relationship with Mu-Hwa Park is interesting. Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the first volume and concluded that despite being [...] "somewhat muddled, the visual storytelling is not. The art is clean, lovely, and easy to follow, with a nicely restrained use of elaborate backgrounds and imaginative panel layouts. The character designs are pretty, distinct, and occasionally even creepy, as with Mu-Yeon's eternally smiling mask. The overall look is undeniably [...] "manhwa" [...] – a draw for some and a turn-off for others." [...] Erin Jones of Mania.com noted the distinct and typical romance story in the first volume, but found the first volume enjoyable and noted that the interactions of the [...] "Pig Girl" [...] are what will drive the series despite the volume ending without strong development of the characters. A review of volume two by Pop Culture Shock gave it a [...] "B+" [...] despite confusion caused by the plot and [...] "vagueness on the villain front, Pig Bride <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> entertaining tale." ...|$|E
500|$|Sheila Benson, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, stated, [...] "Intelligent, complex and enthralling, Presumed Innocent ... {{is one of those}} rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the {{machinery}} never shows and after it's over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction." [...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E
