500|$|Steinberg's first {{association}} with U2 came in February 1987. The group's lead singer, Bono, {{was a fan}} of ISO and she was cast for the music video of their hit [...] "With or Without You". In it, director Matt Mahurin portrayed Steinberg in an abstract style, swirling in various positions in shots interposed with the band performing. During a Los Angeles stop on the band's subsequent Joshua Tree Tour, Steinberg met The Edge (actual name Dave Evans) in person {{for the first time}} during a party at her house. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> had a conversation with her and her sister.|$|E

500|$|Among various public activities, Bondfield {{joined the}} {{governing}} body of Ruskin College, the Oxford-based institution founded in 1899 to provide higher education opportunities to working-class men. She {{also became a}} Justice of the Peace. She first sought election to parliament in 1920, as the Labour candidate in a by-election in Northampton. She increased the Labour vote significantly, but lost by 3,371 votes, to the Coalition Liberal candidate. At the general election of 1922 she was again adopted by Labour at Northampton [...] and, as she had at Woolwich in 1913, turned to Shaw for help in the campaign. He was contemptuous of the Labour leadership for not arranging a more promising seat; nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> spoke for her, but her margin of defeat widened to 5,476.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the fast}} tempos and {{instrumental}} virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting {{with the sound}} of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for Columbia Records featured an accordion, soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, while Monroe added banjo player David [...] "'Stringbean" [...] Akeman to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942, Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the string-band tradition from which <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> the musical innovation to follow.|$|E

[...] The website for Jews for Judaism claims that [...] "Since a Nazarene is a resident of the city of Nazareth and this city did not exist during the time period of the Jewish Bible, it is impossible to find this quotation in the Hebrew Scriptures. It was fabricated." [...] However, one common suggestion is that the New Testament verse is based on a passage relating to Nazirites, either because this was a misunderstanding common at the time, or through deliberate re-reading of the term by the early Christians. Another suggestion is [...] "that Matthew was playing on the similarity of the Hebrew word nezer (translated 'Branch' or 'shoot' in [...] and [...] ) with the Greek nazoraios, here translated 'Nazarene.'" [...] Christians also suggest that by using an indirect quotation and the plural term prophets, [...] "Matthew was only saying that by living in Nazareth, Jesus was fulfilling the many Old Testament prophecies that He would be despised and rejected." [...] The background for this is illustrated by Philip's initial response in [...] to the idea that Jesus might be the Messiah: [...] "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought he was great [...] and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laodamia was {{the wife}} of Protesilaus and {{daughter}} of Acastus and Astydameia. After Protesilaus {{was killed in the}} Trojan War he was allowed to return to his wife for only three hours before returning to the underworld because they had only just married. Thereafter Laodamia was described as possibly having committed suicide by stabbing herself, rather than be without him. According to Hyginus' Fabulae, however, the story runs like this: [...] "When Laodamia, daughter of Acastus, after her husband's loss had spent the three hours which she had asked from the gods, she could not endure her weeping and grief. And so she made a bronze likeness of her husband Protesilaus, put it in her room under pretense of sacred rites, and devoted herself to it. When a servant early in the morning had brought fruit for the offerings, he looked through a crack in the door and saw her holding the image of Protesilaus in her embrace and kissing it. Thinking she had a lover he told her father Acastus. When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> burst into the room, he saw the statue of Protesilaus. To put an end to her torture he had the statue and the sacred offerings burned on a pyre he had made, but Laodamia, not enduring her grief, threw herself on it and was burned to death." ...|$|E

It had been well, had you immediately believed Him when <b>He</b> <b>came,</b> <b>and</b> known Him, as He whom Moses and all the prophets signified, Who should {{put an end to the}} law, and reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed Elias shall be sent to you before the second Coming of Christ, when He will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness, shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with the godly thence ensuing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo {{quoted in}} an {{interview}} that [...] "Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>and</b> danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E
