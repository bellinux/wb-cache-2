5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair,</b> and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair</b> for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which {{made it difficult for}} him to communicate, and he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hug {{was born}} in the {{municipality}} of Pfyn in Switzerland in 1986. Born with spina bifida, Hug grew up on a farm, the youngest of four brothers. As a young child, he met Swiss wheelchair racer, and Hug's sporting idol, Franz Nietlispach, beginning Hug's desire to take up athletics. The ten-year-old Hug was introduced to racing when a sports teacher brought in an old racing wheelchair. This led to Hug competing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first <b>wheelchair</b> race that year, the 3 km youth race which was part of the Schenkon Marathon. Winning this event inspired him to take up wheelchair athletics and he joined the Swiss Paraplegic Centre in Nottwil where he teamed up with trainer Paul Odermatt.|$|R

5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges.

However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|R

40|$|Darius Goes West: The Roll of His Life is an {{independent}} film about {{a young man in}} Athens, Georgia, named Darius, who has Duchene's muscular dystrophy. The story centers on Darius's dream to travel out west to “trick his ride, ” as popularized by the MTV program. To Darius, his chair represents his “wheels, ” and he wants a sportier model of power <b>wheelchair</b> just as <b>his</b> nondisabled peers might crave a classier car. Darius's tale begins with scenes of him participating in a camp for children with disabilities <b>in</b> <b>his</b> clunky old <b>wheelchair.</b> To fulfill <b>his</b> dream, 12 camp counselors and their buddies volunteer to drive an accessible recreation vehicle out west to the MTV studios in Los Angeles. The ensuing adventure is filled with many metaphors that represent strengths, facilitators, and challenges. Some metaphors relate to the process of going out west, while others relate to the goal of tricking <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair</b> (e. g., spinner wheels, custom paint job). On a more global level, the experiences of Darius and his friends on this trip represent the notion of strengths and barriers that can affect full participation in society for people with disabilities (Stark, Hollingsworth, Morgan, & Gray, 2007). This story describes the interactive effect of person and environment variables on personal choice and independence...|$|R
