5000|$|... #Caption: From left to right, aqueous {{solutions}} of: Co(NO3)2 (red); K2Cr2O7 (orange); <b>K2CrO4</b> (yellow); NiCl2 (green); CuSO4 (blue); KMnO4 (purple).|$|E
5000|$|The salt is isostructural with K2MnO4, K2SO4, and <b>K2CrO4.</b> The solid {{consists}} of K+ and the tetrahedral FeO42− anion, with Fe-O distances of 1.66 Å. [...] The poorly soluble barium salt, BaFeO4, is also known.|$|E
50|$|Potassium {{chromate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula (<b>K2CrO4).</b> This yellow solid is the potassium salt of the chromate anion. It {{is a common}} laboratory chemical, whereas sodium chromate is important industrially. It is a class two carcinogen as it contains hexavalent chromium.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} rare vug {{fillings}} in nitrate ores {{in association with}} tarapacáite (<b>K2CrO4),</b> dietzeite and ulexite in the Chilean Atacama and is reported from the Bushveld igneous complex of South Africa. Lopezite was first described in 1937 for an occurrence in Iquique Province, Chile and named for Chilean mining engineer Emiliano López Saa (1871-1959).|$|E
50|$|A {{process known}} as the Cronak process is used to create zinc {{chromate}} for use in industry. This process is done by putting zinc or a zinc plated metal in a solution of sodium dichromate and sulfuric acid for a few seconds.Zinc chromate can also be synthesized by using neutral potassium chromate (<b>K2CrO4)</b> and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), which forms a precipitate.|$|E
5000|$|Silver {{chromate}} (Ag2CrO4) is a brown-red monoclinic {{crystal and}} is a chemical precursor to modern photography. It can be formed by combining silver nitrate (AgNO3) and potassium chromate (<b>K2CrO4)</b> or sodium chromate (Na2CrO4). This reaction has been important in neuroscience, as it {{is used in the}} [...] "Golgi method" [...] of staining neurons for microscopy: the silver chromate produced precipitates inside neurons and makes their morphology visible.|$|E
50|$|Tarapacáite is {{the mineral}} form of {{potassium}} chromate with the chemical formula <b>K2CrO4.</b> It forms bright yellow crystals and {{was discovered in}} 1878. It is named for the former Tarapacá Province, Peru; nowadays belonging to Chile. The boundaries between Peru, Bolivia and Chile were vague in the Atacama Desert before the War of the Pacific (1879-1883). Its type locality is Oficina Maria Elena, Maria Elena, Tocopilla Province, Antofagasta Region, Chile. It is unlikely to occur anywhere except in highly arid conditions as it is easily soluble in water.|$|E
50|$|Small amounts (a few tens of milligrams each) of carlosruizite {{were first}} found in nitrate ore from two localities in the Chilean nitrate fields. Carlosruizite was found as ~200 μm platy {{crystals}} in samples of iquiqueite, Na4K3Mg(CrO4)B24O39(OH)·12H2O, obtained by leaching caliche amarillo (yellow nitrate ore) from samples in the Iquique {{office of the}} former Servicio de Minas del Estado of Chile, now the National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN). The field locality of these samples is not precisely known but probably lies {{in the vicinity of}} Zapiga, where caliche amarillo is especially abundant. Of the 25 species of saline minerals that have been identified in the Chilean nitrate ores, 11 are known to be associated with carlosruizite. The dense caliche amarillo containing carlosruizite consists chiefly of a fine-grained mixture of nitratine, halite, and darapskite. The residues of leaching this material in cold water contain dietzeite Ca2(IO3)2(CrO4) briiggenire Ca(IO3)2·H2O, tarapacaite (<b>K2CrO4),</b> lopezite (K2Cr2O7), ulexite NaCaB506(OH)6·5H2O, probertite NaCaB5O7(OH)4·3H2O, and gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O).|$|E
