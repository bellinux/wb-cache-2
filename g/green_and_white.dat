5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a complement of 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E

5|$|Shamrock Rovers wore <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped jerseys until 1926, {{when they}} adopted the <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> hooped strip {{that they have}} worn ever since.

On 26 August 2011 Rovers became the first Irish side to reach the group stages of either of the top two European competitions by beating Partizan Belgrade in the play-off round of the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped jerseys but {{following}} a suggestion {{by a committee}} member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> hooped strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic {{and it was on}} account of this that the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The Hoops lost the game 3–0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> hoops and have done ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around {{the main body of the}} jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a hooped purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all black away strip.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E

It dates from 1964 and {{replaced}} a moored barge used by spectators and crew-members. The last college barge had been purchased {{from one of the}} Livery Companies of the City of London in 1911.

5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours are <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> {{which have}} been used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Millwall's {{traditional}} kit has predominantly {{consisted of}} blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks throughout their 125-year history. For the first 50 years, up until 1936, they {{played in a}} traditional navy blue, similar to the colours of Scotland national team. This colour was chosen because it paid homage to the Scottish roots of the club, with {{the nucleus of the}} first Millwall Rovers squad being from Dundee. In 1936, newly appointed Millwall manager Charlie Hewitt opted to change the kit colour from navy blue to a lighter royal blue, and the team have played in this colour for the best part of 74 years, with the exception of 1968–75 and 1999–2001, in which the team played in an all-white strip. Their kit for the 2010–11 season celebrated the 125th anniversary of the club, with Millwall adopting the darker navy blue of their first strip. The club has retained this colour since. As for change colours, yellow or white has been a frequent choice. The club had a grey away kit for the 2002–03 season, and also a <b>green</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> striped away kit for the 2003–04 season. Millwall wore a special one-off camouflage kit to commemorate the centenary of the First World War against Brentford on 8 November 2014. It went on sale to fans, with proceeds going to Headley Court, a rehabilitation centre for injured members of the British Armed Forces.|$|E
