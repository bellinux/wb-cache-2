5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands.

5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to <b>gain</b> <b>more</b> recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E

The celebrities involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E

5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it.

After the decline of Britpop they began to <b>gain</b> <b>more</b> critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

40|$|A 2 -yr {{study using}} Mashona- (M, yr 1 and 2) and Tuli-sired (T, yr 2) cows {{produced}} from a three-breed diallele cow base comprised of Brahman (BB), Romosinuano (RR), and Angus (AA) {{was conducted to}} determine effects of breed type and growing strategies on growth performance and carcass characteristics in early-weaned calves. Steers and heifers used were between 90 and 200 d old at arrival. Cattle were randomly split into one of two nutritional treatment groups with sex, breed type, and age stratified across treatments. Calves were either fed a roughage diet (P) or placed immediately on a concentrate grower diet (F) for approximately x d, then finished together in the feedlot. In both years, F calves <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 01) than P calves during the growing stage. In yr 1, P calves <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 05) than F calves during the middle, late and overall finishing period. For yr 2, F calves <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 05) during the early finishing phase, but P cattle <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 05) during the middle portion. In yr 1, P calves had higher (P <. 05) USDA marbling scores than F calves. Growing program {{had no effect on}} carcass characteristics during yr 2. In yr 1, MAA calves <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 05) during the overall finishing period. TAA calves <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 01) during the growing stage and TBB calves <b>gained</b> <b>more</b> (P <. 05) for the overall finishing period in yr 2. In yr 1, MAA and MBB were fatter (P <. 05), and MAA and MAR calves deposited more (P <. 01) marbling than others. MAA calves also had less (P <. 05) desirable yield grades than other cattle. In yr 2, TAA calves had more (P <. 05) marbling than other calves, followed by TRR cattle that deposited more (P <. 05) than remaining calves...|$|R
