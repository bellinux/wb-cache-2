It {{first appeared in}} the Fall 1978 issue of the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> even <b>though</b> we often spoke of the matrix exponential, e At, none of my professors could tell me how to compute it. So I did some digging and came up with this. I was just finishing my first masters degree at the time. Since the time of Cayley and Sylvester there has been great interest in the computation of matrix functions. For example, to compute the matrix exponential e At, which satisfies the matrix differential equation with constant coefficients ˙X(t) = AX(t), methods have been developed which rely upon properties of differential equations, the Jordan canonical form, or results from linear algebra such as normality, diagonalizability, etc. [2][4][5] Most techniques for calculating a function f of a matrix A express f(A) as a polynomial in A. Of all such methods, the simplest in concept are those based on an interpolation formula introduced by Sylvester[7], n ∑ n ∏ A − λj...|$|R
