Time and space differences varied between the satellite measurement and the rocketsonde launch, for example HALOE overpasses occurred within 5 days and in some cases there were spatial differences of up to 30 degrees longitude. Validation measurements of the HRDI instrument occurred at Wallops Island when it passed within 20 minutes and 330 kilometers of the launch site.

Some of these measurements were performed near simultaneously (maximum allowed time difference: 1 h) and at the same location, and therefore offered the unique chance of intercomparison of different techniques. In this study, we will report on intercomparisons of data from ground-based instruments (Rayleigh- and sodium-lidar), balloon-borne methods (datasondes and radiosondes) and rocket-borne techniques (<b>falling</b> <b>spheres</b> and ionization gauges). The main result is that there is good agreement between the various measurements when considering the error bars. Only occasionally did we notice small but systematic differences (e. g. for the datasondes above 65 km). The most extensive intercomparison was possible between the Rayleigh lidar and the <b>falling</b> <b>sphere</b> technique, both employed in Biscarrosse (44 deg N, 1 deg W). Concerning densities, excellent agreement was found below 63 km: the mean of the deviations is less than 1 % and the root mean square (RMS) is approximately 3 %. Systematic differences of the order of 5 % were noticed around 67 km and above 80 km. The former can be accounted for by an instrumental effect of the <b>falling</b> <b>sphere</b> (Ma = 1 transition; Ma = Mach number), whereas the latter is tentatively explained by the presence of Mie scatterers in the upper mesosphere. Concerning temperatures, the agreement is excellent between 35 and 65 km: the mean of the deviations is less than +/- 3 K and the variability is +/- 5 K.

We are primarily interested in incompressible fluids exhibiting so-called viscoelastic properties in which a range of phenomena have been observed experimentally. These phenomena are typically manifest {{in the presence of}} a negative wake, an overshoot of the velocity of the <b>falling</b> <b>sphere</b> and drag reduction as well as enhancement in some cases. We consider fluid models which have been designed to capture these effects and use them to simulate the flow numerically with the intention of gaining an insight into the observed phenomena. We begin with the most basic fluid models in order to validate our scheme, considering both Stokes and Newtonian fluids before progressing to viscoelastic fluid models in a range of problems to ensure the robustness of our solver. Our scheme ultimately utilises the Spectral Element Method(SEM) combined with a Discontinuous Galerkin(DG) treatment of the constituitive equation along with a DEVSS-G stabilisation term in the momentum equation. We employ an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian(ALE) scheme when simulating a <b>falling</b> <b>sphere.</b> Our simulations successfully capture the drag reduction when moving fluid past a fixed sphere as well as velocity overshoot for the sedimenting sphere, although we have failed to capture the presence of a negative wake thus far.
