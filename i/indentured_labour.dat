5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the highland clan system. The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent to lowland lairds, providing council in peace and leadership in war, and below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes acted as soldiers. In the early modern period they usually took the clan name as their surname, turning it into a massive, if often fictive, kin group. Because the Highland Clans were not a direct threat to the Restoration government, or relations with England, the same effort was not put into suppressing their independence as had been focused on the Borders, until after the Glorious Revolution. Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century, but the process was accelerated after the rebellion of 1745, with Highland dress banned, the enforced disarming of clansmen, the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions, the exile of many chiefs and sending of ordinary clansmen to the colonies as <b>indentured</b> <b>labour.</b> All of this largely reducing clan leaders to the status of simple landholders within a generation.|$|E

25|$|Farming and {{cultivation}} {{has been}} the traditional occupations of Hakka families from imperial times up until the 1970s. Farming was mostly done by Hakka women while their menfolk sought labouring jobs in the towns and cities.

25|$|The first {{campaign}} against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of <b>indentured</b> <b>labour</b> to the slavery of the past. The {{campaign against}} Coolie emigration was led by Joseph Sturge, with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices. In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when {{the scale of the}} abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and severe penalties were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.|$|E
25|$|Inhabited by the {{indigenous}} Arawak and Taíno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule following {{the arrival of}} Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of {{the indigenous}} people died of disease, and the Spanish transplanted African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. Named , the island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later Great Britain) conquered it and renamed it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on slaves forcibly transported from Africa. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British utilized Chinese and Indian <b>indentured</b> <b>labour</b> to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{provides}} an overview and analysis of industrial relations legislation in Fiji for the time period 1875 - 2017. The first two labour legislation passed by the colonial government were the ‘Fijian Labour Ordinance’ (1875) and the Labour Ordinance’ (1880) and these were enacted to control <b>indenture</b> and <b>indentures</b> <b>labour.</b> The paper also includes the discussion of ERP (2007) and its amendments. This paper {{will argue that the}} labour legislations were passed to support the capital (both during and after colonial rule) at the expense of labour. By situating of industrial relations and labour legislation in the broader socio-economic-political context of Fiji, the paper will unravel the power, politics and class relations that shape and affect the work relations between the three parties of IR (state, employer & trade unions). The paper contributes to the literature on our understanding {{of the role of the}} state and capital in suppressing and exploiting labour. ...|$|R
25|$|From the 1870s to 1903 Malaitan men (and some women) {{comprised}} {{the largest number}} of Solomon Islander participants in the <b>indentured</b> <b>labour</b> trade to Queensland, Australia and to Fiji. The 1870s were a time of illegal recruiting practices known as blackbirding. Malaitans are known to have volunteered as indentured labourers with some making their second trip to work on plantations, although the labour system remained exploitative. In 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy. However many islanders remained and formed the South Sea Islander community of Australia. Many labourers that returned to Malaita had learnt to read and had become Christian. The skills of literacy and protest letters as to being deported from Australia was a precedent for the later Maasina Ruru movement.|$|E
25|$|Upon Chamberlain's resignation, Lyttelton succeeded him as Colonial Secretary, {{despite his}} {{relative}} political inexperience. His {{decision to allow}} Chinese <b>indentured</b> <b>labour</b> into South Africa proved highly controversial and became a major issue for the Liberals in the 1906 election. Lyttelton also attempted ambitious reforms of Britain's management of the colonies towards a more decentralised, imperial vision, but these ideas were abandoned by the Liberals who succeeded him. After the Conservatives' fall from power, Lyttelton remained active politically, opposing Welsh disestablishment and supporting women's suffrage. In the summer of 1913, he was struck in the belly during a cricket match in South Africa. Shortly after his return to Britain, he was taken ill at the Foreign Office and an operation revealed {{the presence of an}} abscess in his stomach. Surgery was unsuccessful and he died, in a nursing home, early in July. His funeral took place {{on the day of the}} annual Varsity cricket match, and play between Oxford and Cambridge was suspended for two minutes as a mark of respect.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the first}} {{settlement}} by the British in 1625, through history {{the economy of}} Barbados was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. Quickly Barbados was then divided into large estate-plantations and using <b>indentured</b> <b>labour</b> mainly from the British Isles for the cultivation of tobacco and cotton crops were first introduced. The island, facing {{a large amount of}} competition from the North American colonies and the neighbouring West Indian islands, switched to the crop of sugar cane. Cultivation of sugar cane was quickly introduced by the exiled Jewish community which immigrated into Barbados from Dutch Brazil during the mid-17th century. The introduction of sugar cane became the single best move for the Barbados economy at the time, the economy boomed and Barbados had become populated with so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of windmills per square mile in the world, second only to the Netherlands. For about the next 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in the Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production caught up in geographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop well into the 20th century and to this day.|$|E

We find that regions using the harsh contract saw lower response to rise in the price of tea. Disaggregating by types of recruiter, we find that the response to market recruitment was high in all regions, but response to recruitment using community networks is statistically insignificant, suggesting that informational asymmetries may be an explanation for continuing migration despite concerns raised by the nationalist movement, social reformers and policy makers. ...|$|R

The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to Sumatra, Indonesia, where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.

Within the context of the sugar estate-dominated agriculture of Barbados, as well as its high population density, the author describes the policies and decisions of the governors and local assemblies regarding emigration. He points out how the sugar industry's need for labourers remained dominant in the policies, but that the drought in 1863 caused privations and unrest among the labourers, resulting in more flexibility regarding allowance of indentured emigration schemes and recruitment, such as toward St Croix and Antigua, and later toward British Guiana, and to a smaller degree Jamaica.
