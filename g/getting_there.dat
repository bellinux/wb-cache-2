United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines serve the airport with direct and connecting service. As of 2017, the airport has non-stop service to 30 destinations. Eppley is situated in East Omaha, with many users driving through Carter Lake, Iowa and getting a view of Carter Lake before <b>getting</b> <b>there.</b> General aviation airports serving the area are the Millard Municipal Airport, North Omaha Airport and the Council Bluffs Airport. Offutt Air Force Base continues {{to serve as a}} military airbase; it is located at the southern edge of Bellevue, which in turn lies immediately south of Omaha.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to enter}} Cortex's castle after <b>getting</b> <b>there</b> via bridge, Crash climbs the tower walls, {{and enters the}} castle through the window he had {{previously}} escaped from. After making {{his way through the}} dark hallways and the Castle's many machines, Crash is confronted by Brio inside his laboratory. Brio uses chemicals to mutate himself into a monster. While Crash is successful in defeating Brio, the castle laboratory catches on fire during the struggle. Crash escapes to Cortex's airship, where he confronts Cortex himself as the castle burns. Cortex attacks him with a plasma gun, but Crash deflects his own projectiles against him and sends Cortex falling out of the sky. Tawna embraces Crash as the two escape the burning castle on Cortex's airship.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was <b>getting</b> <b>there.</b> Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E

25|$|To {{settle the}} dispute {{as to which}} conference is best, a {{championship}} game at Busch Stadium crowns league supremacy.

The first, the LCBL All-Star Game, allows the best individual players to share the same field as the pros. However, <b>getting</b> <b>there</b> a second time requires a total team effort.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{tourists}} visiting Crimea in the 2014 season {{was lower than}} in the previous years due to a combination of Western sanctions, ethical objections by Ukrainians, and the difficulty of <b>getting</b> <b>there</b> for Russians. The Russian government attempted to stimulate the flow of tourists by subsidizing holidays in the peninsula for children and state workers from all Russia which worked mostly for state-owned hotels. In 2015 overall 3 million tourists visited Crimea according to official data, while before annexation it was around 5.5 million on average. The shortage is attributed mostly to stopped flow of tourists from Ukraine. Hotels and restaurants are also experiencing problems with finding enough seasonal workers, who were arriving from Ukraine mostly in the preceding years. Tourists visiting state-owned hotels are complaining mostly about low standard of rooms and facilities, some of them unrepaired from Soviet times.|$|E
25|$|Several {{aberrant}} color {{patterns for}} A. c. contortrix, or populations that intergrade with it, {{have also been}} reported. In a specimen described by Livezey (1949) from Walker County, Texas, 11 of 17 crossbands were not joined middorsally, while on one side three of the crossbands were fused together longitudinally to form a continuous undulating band, surmounted above by a dark stripe that was 2–2.5 scales wide. In another specimen, from Lowndes County, Alabama, the first three crossbands were complete, followed by a dark stripe that ran down {{either side of the}} body, with points of pigment reaching up to the midline in six places but never <b>getting</b> <b>there,</b> after which the last four crossbands on the tail were also complete. A specimen found in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana by Ernest A. Liner, had a similar striped pattern, with only the first and last two crossbands being normal.|$|E

The next morning, he goes to the market square to observe the body language of Prince Aderopo, who suspiciously stares at him in confidence and even winks at him that {{there is no evidence to}} prove he indeed killed the girls. Danladi visits Tawa in the school she works as a teacher, in order to question her about the relationship she has with the Prince. Danladi discovers that Aderopo and Agbekoya are both recipients of a scholarship from a Reverend Father in the town, Father Dowling (Colin David Reese). Danladi visits Agbekoya, who reveals to him that they were constantly molested by the Reverend Father in Lagos city. At a celebration on the eve of Independence, Prince Aderopo invites Tawa to their childhood hideout, which has been renovated. Danladi and Afonja try to trail them, but are unsuccessful; Agbekoya, the only other person who knows the location of the hideout, leads them to it. On <b>getting</b> <b>there,</b> Aderopo is about to make Tawa his sixth victim, representing the end of the six years of violation he received from the Reverend Father. Tawa is saved.|$|E

25|$|Encouraged by {{his friend}} and ex-Birdman compadre Chris Masuak, Deniz came back to Australia in 1991, intent on {{renewing}} himself musically. He began extensive touring in 1992 and, following a near career destroying disaster on the Take It To The Vertical tour of 1992 initiated a line-up that became known as The Deniz Tek Group. This line-up spent {{the next few years}} touring Europe, Australia and the USA, while releasing an EP and several albums (Outside, 444 The Number Of The Beat, La Bonne Route) Geographical difficulties became untenable in late '96 and the group split up. Deniz then continued with US based lineups and recorded albums with Wayne Kramer(MC5)(Dodge Main), skateboard stars Art and Steve Godoy (Golden Breed, The Last Of The Bad Men), a Montana-based trio (Equinox), an experimental electronic duo with Jimi Hendrix's sidekick and amplifier designer Dave Weyer (Glass Insects), east coast hard rockers (Deep Reduction and DR2 featuring Rob Younger), and live work including tours and live albums with the Rationals' Scott Morgan (Three Assassins, Powertrane) and surviving members of Sonic's Rendezvous Band (<b>Getting</b> <b>There</b> Is Half The Fun). Deniz and wife Angie Pepper (Passengers) recorded her album Res Ipsa Loquitor in 2001. Deniz continued to record and tour extensively in the late '90s, while Radio Birdman reunified and began to work again.|$|E

The sympathy that greeted him on his return to New York did not prevent later criticism, {{that he had not}} acted forcefully enough and had, {{according}} to the crewman Tobin, [...] "seemed like a man whose judgment was paralyzed". The captain accepted that his abandonment of Gourlay had been a grave error; the first officer might well have supervised a more disciplined organization of the lifeboats. Luce took a post as an inspector of ships with the Great Western Marine Insurance Company, where he worked until his death in 1879, in his 75th year. His obituarist recorded that [...] "his latter years were embittered by the recollection of the terrible disaster". The Collins Line continued its fortnightly transatlantic mail steamship service with its three remaining ships, but suffered a further blow when, in January 1856, SS Pacific sank with her entire complement of 186 passengers and crew. Nevertheless Collins went ahead with the construction of an even larger ship, the SS Adriatic, which, after a single round trip in November–December 1857, was laid up. Confidence in the line had been damaged; [...] "people concluded that <b>getting</b> <b>there</b> was more important than luxuriating amid ornate trim", and public opinion was increasingly averse to the payment of government subsidies to finance the Collins Line's extravagances. Early in 1858, when these subsidies were heavily cut back, the line ceased business, and the Cunard ships resumed their position of transatlantic supremacy. [...] Vesta, fully repaired, remained in the service of various owners until 1875 when, renamed Amberes, she is recorded as sinking in Santander harbor.|$|E
