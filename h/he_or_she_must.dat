5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|If the {{election}} is a non-reserved election, and the person applied for a community certificate, the certificate issued to him or the Community Committee's written rejection of the application.

50|$|Smaller groups exist {{inside of}} one status group. For instance, one can {{belong to a}} status group based on one's race and a social class based on {{financial}} ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> feels they <b>must</b> choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels {{he has to take}} a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided, and finds his class and status group opposed.|$|R
5000|$|According to U.S. law, {{there are}} four Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force {{appointed}} from civilian life by the President of the United States upon the advice and consent of the United States Senate. They assist the United States Secretary of the Air Force and the United States Under Secretary of the Air Force. One of the four assistant secretaries is the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller), {{who is responsible for}} [...] "the exercise of the comptroller functions of the Department of the Air Force, including financial management functions." [...] The duties expressly given to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management & Comptroller) include determining the Department of the Air Force's budget estimates (in conjunction with the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)), supervising the Department's financial management system, and overseeing the department's asset management system. The Assistant Secretary is also responsible for developing a five year plan for improving the department's financial management, which plan must be updated annually. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> also <b>must</b> submit an annual report to the Secretary of the Air Force detailing the state of the department's financial management.|$|R
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|Within {{three months}} of joining a Rover Crew a {{newcomer}} may be invested as a Squire. Alternatively, a Scout wishing to join the Rover Crew upon their 18th birthday, may complete the Rover Network Badge. If the newcomer was not previously a Scout, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> first be invested as a Scout and must take the Scout Promise. The Squire then chooses a mentor, called a Sponsor, {{from one of the}} existing Rovers; the Sponsor's task is to guide the Squire in learning all the necessary Scouting skills and to aid the Squire in performing a service project as set out by the Rover Crew. Once the service project is completed the Squire can be invested as a fully fledged Rover.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E
50|$|As in the US version, {{a player}} must {{successfully}} answer three {{questions on the}} first prize level ($500) before <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has the option of leaving the game, taking all money earned after this round. If <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> continues, <b>he</b> <b>must</b> answer successfully two questions on the second level ($1,000) before the player may leave the game and take the money. Starting with the third level ($1,500), a player may stop after any successful question. If {{there are more than}} 10 mob members left, contestants must make that decision before seeing questions; once they see a question, they are committed to answering it. With 10 or fewer mob members, the contestant (and the mob) sees the question, but not the answers, for three seconds before making his or her choice to continue. When contestants quit and take their winnings, remaining mob members win nothing, but can compete in the next game.|$|R
5000|$|In Texas Prisons, while serving, {{the server}} must bounce {{the ball on}} the ground before hitting it towards the wall. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she,</b> [...] "AK", <b>must</b> serve behind the line, hit the ball above the line on the wall, and make the ball bounce back past the servers line, and on the {{receivers}} half of the court. If the server is short, i.e. if the rebounding ball comes short of the serving line or does not reach the opponents half but is within bounds, he gets one additional try. Being short twice awards a point to the receiver, who then has the right to serve. A crack balla ball that bounces in the crack between the two wallsis counted as short on the first, but not on the second serve when the server can serve again. A point must be scored by the serving team, otherwise the serving right passes to the opposing team, the teams swap places and no point is awarded.|$|R
50|$|Being greatly {{influenced}} by Gandhiji's satyagraha movement, Premchand weaves this novel around the social goals championed by it. Human life is portrayed as a field of action in which the character and destinies of individuals are formed and revealed through their actions. Some of these actions, which might seem melodramatic in ordinary realistic fiction, gain resonance in Karmabhumi, placed {{as they are in}} this symbolic and philosophical framework. Each character (or group) is depicted as coming to a point of moral awakening where <b>he,</b> <b>she,</b> <b>or</b> they <b>must</b> act on their convictions. The climax takes place in an assembly of the poor and dispossessed, where they voice their demand for land. The youngest of the speakers is put to death by a policeman's bullet, and this incident eventually leads to victory of the cause of land for the poor.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{remedies}} {{that may}} be sought by an applicant for {{judicial review is a}} declaration, which is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. The Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case, but it is possible they may adopt the test laid down in constitutional law cases. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2012), the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist for a person have standing to bring a constitutional challenge: (1) <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, when <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>must</b> save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes {{in an attempt to}} capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work we have posited some {{necessary}} guidelines to reformulate an essential pillar of leadership: the relationship group-leader. The set of enunciations that are developed {{are meant to}} establish {{the basic principles of}} the theoretical interpretation of this essential phenomenon of social life. In most works dealing with leadership we usually find that texts are centred on the leader. However, the process possesses another member of even greater importance embodied in the social group that forms around him or her. Thus, social actors need to reach a higher degree of sociability and to express, amongst other things, needs and goals, and they look for them openly in a chosen representative. And <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she,</b> in turn, <b>must</b> fulfil the expectations of the group. In other words, the asymmetry of said relationship is inverted. Moreover, at the leader's end, we must discern between the person and the "character". This is how the particular game of leadership unfolds. The resulting construct accounts {{for the construction of a}} significant social feat. Facultad de Psicologí...|$|R
40|$|Any {{book written}} by Iulia Motoc is an {{intellectual}} challenge and, after careful consideration, any reader {{may have the}} feeling of an extraordinary sense of accomplishment. This is because the author has a double specialization, in law and political philosophy, while demonstrating a prestigious academic carrier {{in the field of}} political science as well as a solid set of knowledge derived from universal literature. This whole set of preoccupations makes the topics selected by Iulia Motoc to be premeditatedly and systematically situated at the borders of multiple disciplines, so that the jurist may have the chance of observing that the norms which he is obliged to apply have a higher rationality than that of the simple will of the lawmaker, and the expert in political science that the object that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is analyzing <b>must</b> not only be put into connection with the behavior of political actors. Iulia Motoc’s most recent book, “On Democracy within the United Europe” places itself within the same class of interdisciplinary frontiers that open in front of the reader and that show themselves as being filled with meanings yet to be discovered...|$|R
