The application of the induced haploidy is an excellent possibility for enrichment of the sugar beet gene fund and allows accelerated creation of highly homozygous and genetically stable lines. Ten years field tests were conducted on the experimental fields of Agricultural Institute – Shumen to study the practical value of <b>dihaploid</b> monogerm and multigerm lines for the hybrid breeding of sugar beet. All the tested <b>dihaploid</b> lines formed higher root yields than their initial lines, maintained by classical methods.

The pollinator effect was confirmed. Five or more loci were involved and the within-locus interaction was intermediate. High numbers of hybrids had a negative but small effect on numbers of dihaploids. The seed parent effect was also confirmed. The frequency of dihaploids was determined by the sporophyte rather than by the gametophyte of the seed parent.

Androgenesis using amphidiploid cultivars of Festuca pratensis Lolium multiflorum as parents, overcame earlier problems {{that gave rise to}} widespread plant sterility amongst androgenic Festulolium populations. Two Festuca pratensis Lolium multiflorum (2 n= 4 x= 28) cultivars, Sulino and Felopa, were highly amenable to androgenesis and 10 % of plants, including some novel androgenic genotypes, had sufficient fertility to produce progeny and further generations. The genomes of amphidiploid cultivars, which represent the F 8 generation, were the result of considerable intergeneric chromosome recombination. Moreover, during cultivar development, natural and breeders' selection pressures had led to the assembly of gene combinations that conferred good growth characters and fertility with the removal of putative deleterious gene combinations. Over 80 % of the androgenic plants derived from the amphidiploid F. pratensis L. multiflorum (2 n= 4 x= 28) had 14 chromosomes and were likely to be <b>dihaploids</b> with a single genome of Lolium and of Festuca.

Research has provided significant results {{in the field of}} in vitro cultures of cells and tissues, in the search for molecular markers (important research tools in supporting conventional breeding) and enzymes facilitating the extraction yields and degradation of primary and secondary products in many plant species, including the olive tree. In olive, the classical methods of genetic improvement have given rather scarce results up to now. At the same time, the need of new cultivars suitable for intensive cultivation demands for innovative strategies through the support of molecular and biotechnological techniques to speed up hybridisation methods by using "gene pools" method. This requires wide germplasm collections of both, cultivated and wild olive genotypes, and the knowledge of the olive genetic background. The present paper summarizes the state of art of the unconventional techniques (in vitro pollination, embryo rescue, <b>dihaploids</b> constitution, spontaneous and under selective pressure somaclonal variation, somatic hybridisation, germplasm conservation and genetic transformation). These techniques have provided good results in olive although they should be further encouraged with the aim to combine them with those derived from the classic genetics, genomics, biochemistry, cell biology, molecular and systems biology, to develop suitable strategies. All the aforementioned strategies can also be supported by the research on gene isolation and molecular markers used to characterize germplasm variability in order to improve the plasticity of cultivar behaviour and the quality of production.

40|$|Somatic hybrid {{plants of}} various ploidy levels {{obtained}} after chemical fusion between two <b>dihaploid</b> clones of potato Solanum tuberosum L. have been analysed by cytological, morphological and molecular methods. The hybrid nature of tetraploid and hexaploid {{plants and the}} genome dosage in hexaploid hybrids were confirmed by Giemsa C-banding. Tetraploid and hexaploid hybrids showed numerical as well as structural chromosome mutations. The latter occurred mainly in the nuclear organizing chromosome. The tetraploid hybrids were more vigorous than the <b>dihaploid</b> parents as demonstrated {{by an increase in}} height, enlargement of leaves, {{increase in the number of}} internodes, restored potential for flowering and increased tuber yield. The grouping of tetraploid somatic hybrids into various classes on the basis of leaf morphology revealed that plants with a full chromosome complement were more uniform than aneuploids. Many hexaploid somatic hybrids were also more vigorous than the <b>dihaploid</b> parents and could be grouped into two different classes on the basis of floral colour and tuber characteristics, the differences being due to their different dosage of parental genomes. Most of the tetraploid somatic hybrids showed pollen development halted at the tetrad stage as one of the parental clones contained a S. stoloniferum cytoplasm. However, one tetraploid plant produced pollen grains with high viability. The chloroplast genome in the hybrid plants was determined by RFLP analysis. All of the hybrids had a cpDNA pattern identical to one parent, which contained either S. tuberosum or S. stoloniferum cpDNA. A slight preference for S. tuberosum plastids were observed in hybrid plants. No correlation between pollen development and plastid type could be detected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of gamete based <b>dihaploid</b> {{technology}} greatly {{enhances the}} production of complete homozygous wheat lines in a single generation and increases the precision and efficacy of selection process in crop breeding. It is a useful tool to reduce the time in attaining homozygosity not only for wheat breeding, but also for various aspects of its genetical studies. Anther culture and wide hybridization are most commonly used method for wheat polyhaploid induction. However, {{in the recent years}} it has commonly been experienced that wheat x maize system of crosses following chromosome elimination is an effective and handy tool among available methods for haploid induction in wheat. Its superiority over other techniques includes higher efficacy (2 - 3 times more efficient for green plant production than the anther culture), simple, less genotype dependent response, less gametoclonal variation and less time consuming. In this paper we try to elucidate several aspects of this system to be used for {{the production of}} <b>dihaploid</b> lines in wheat improvement programme.

40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{a part of}} the continuing breeding program for resistance to true loose smut in barley in Bulgaria. It is also a continuation of the paper presented on the 8 th European Symposium on organic farming in Kassel 2005. Research on seed-borne diseases started in Bulgaria on barley in the 1960 ´s at the Institute for barley Re-search in Karnobat. Breeding research especially for a later use in organic farming in Bulgaria started 1998 with the present international project managed by Dr. Todorova. 56 <b>dihaploid</b> lines were derived from F 1 -hybrids of two barley crosses between resis-tant and susceptible Bulgarian and foreign cultivars bearing the resistant genes Run 12 and Run 13. The DH progenies were tested in 5 generations for loose smut resistance on the field and in the lab with the embryotest. 10 resistant DH-progenies with gene Run 12 and 16 resistant DH-progenies with Run 13 were selected. In the last years agronomically characterisation of the future cultivars is going on. 7 <b>dihaploid</b> lines with appropriate agronomic traits are selected for future cultivar developing with true loose smut resistance for organic farming...|$|E
40|$|The backcrosses of <b>dihaploid</b> Solanum tuberosum {{with wild}} species hybrids {{generating}} tetraploids progenies require {{the formation of}} non-reduced pollen. In this work, the mechanisms responsible {{for the formation of}} 2 n pollen in 28 <b>dihaploid</b> Solanum tuberosum x Solanum chacoense hybrids were studied. Four mechanisms were found: parallelspindles (ps), fused spindles (fs), premature cytokinesis- 1 (pc- 1) and premature cytokinesis- 2 (pc- 2). The ps mechanism was the most frequent, being found in 23 of the 28 assessed clones. The ps and fs mechanisms {{led to the formation of}} dyads by first division restitution (FDR), transferring about 80 % of the heterozygosity to the progenies. The pc- 1 and pc- 2 mechanisms also led to the formation of dyads, but they were genetically equivalent to second division restitution (SDR), transferring only 40 % of the heterozygosity to the progenies. Occurrence of FDR and SDR were shown to be associated in 12 clones, indicating that the clones can produce non-reduced microspores by more than one mechanism. However, only one mechanism is functional in a single pollen-grain mother-cell. Clones 9 - 2, 9 - 3, 9 - 6 and 15 - 15 are recommended for use in 4 x x 2 x matings. 199...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Karyotypes {{can provide}} {{information}} about taxonomic relationships, genetic aberrations, and the evolutionary origins of species. However, differentiation of the tiny chromosomes of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and creation of a standard karyotype for this bioenergy crop has not been accomplished {{due to lack of}} distinguishing features and polyploidy. Results A cytogenetic study was conducted on a <b>dihaploid</b> individual (2 n [*]=[*] 2 X [*]=[*] 18) of switchgrass to establish a chromosome karyotype. Size differences, condensation patterns, and arm-length ratios were used as identifying features and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) assigned 5 S and 45 S rDNA loci to chromosomes 7 and 2 respectively. Both a maize CentC and a native switchgrass centromeric repeat (PviCentC) that shared 73 % sequence identity demonstrated a strong signal on chromosome 3. However, only the PviCentC probe labeled the centromeres of all chromosomes. Unexpected PviCentC and 5 S rDNA hybidization patterns were consistent with severe reduction or total deletion of these repeats in one subgenome. These patterns were maintained in tetraploid and octoploid individuals. The 45 S rDNA repeat produced the expected number of loci in <b>dihaploid,</b> tetraploid and octoploid individuals. Differences observed at the 5 S rDNA loci between the upland and lowland ecotypes of switchgrass provided a basis for distinguishing these subpopulations. Conclusion Collectively, these results provide a quantitative karyotype of switchgrass chromosomes. FISH analyses indicate genetic divergence between subgenomes and allow for the classification of switchgrass plants belonging to divergent genetic pools. Furthermore, the karyotype structure and cytogenetic analysis of switchgrass provides a framework for future genetic and genomic studies. </p...|$|E
