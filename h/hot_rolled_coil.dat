As the demand for wider ranges of steel products increases at the same time, the intermixing of dissimilar grades is becoming a problem of growing concern. When high grade dissimilar grade steel intermixed, huge amount of metal is lost from down gradation.

40|$|CO 2 {{capture and}} storage (CCS) is {{considered}} an important option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Large scale centralized power plants have been the main research focus of CCS, but the potential of CCS in the industry and petroleum refineries is also significant. Moreover, a large transition from centralized power generation to distributed generation (DG) {{may be seen in}} the future. If stringent CO 2 emissions reduction is needed, DG systems will have to consider options that enable large CO 2 emissions reduction, such as CCS. In this context, this thesis investigates the technical and economic performance of CO 2 capture in industries and distributed energy systems for the short-mid term future (ST/MT) and the long term future (LT). The techno-economic assessment and comparison of CO 2 capture technologies was performed for iron and steel, cement, and refineries and petrochemical sectors. The assessment is based on an extensive literature review, covering studies from both industries and academia. Key parameters, e. g. capacity factor, energy prices, interest rate, economic plant lifetime, CO 2 compression pressure, and grid electricity CO 2 intensity, were standardized to enable a fairer comparison of technologies. In the iron and steel sector, the results indicate that a cost of 40 - 65 €/tCO 2 avoided at a CO 2 avoidance rate of 0. 7 - 0. 8 tCO 2 /t <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>coil</b> (40 - 45 % of the total carbon input to the plant) are possible in the ST/MT. In the LT, advanced add-on capture technologies may not offer significant economic advantages over conventional ones. Instead, advanced steelmaking technologies will incorporate CO 2 capture as part of production efficiency improvement while achieving significantly lower steel production costs compared to existing technologies. In the cement sector, 65 - 70 €/tCO 2 avoided at a CO 2 avoidance rate of 0. 6 tCO 2 /t clinker (60 % of onsite emissions) are possible in the ST/MT. In the LT, the costs may be reduced to 25 - 55 €/tCO 2 avoided, but the CO 2 avoidance rate may be somewhat lower. For petroleum refineries and petrochemical sectors, 50 - 60 €/tCO 2 avoided at CO 2 avoidance rate of about 80 % can be achieved in the ST/MT. In the LT, advanced oxyfuel CO 2 capture with an integrated power plant may enable 30 €/tCO 2 avoided or lower. Regarding CO 2 capture in distributed energy systems, the energy efficiency reduction due to CO 2 capture (energy penalty) in the ST/MT vary significantly by fuel type, energy system type and its application, ranging from 11 % to 33 %. CO 2 avoidance costs are around 40 - 140 €/tonne for systems larger than 100 MWLHV (fuel input) and 50 - 160 €/tonne for 10 - 100 MWLHV. In the LT, the CO 2 capture energy penalty may be reduced to around 4 - 9 %. CO 2 avoidance costs are around 10 - 90 €/tonne for systems larger than 100 MWLHV, 25 - 100 €/tonne for 10 - 100 MWLHV and 35 - 150 €/tonne for 10 MWLHV or smaller. CO 2 compression and distributed transport costs may become a bottleneck mainly at smaller scales (more than 50 €/tCO 2 transported for systems with 1 MWLHV natural gas input or smaller). The results indicate that any industrial and distributed CO 2 emission sources should be included for the consideration of CCS both in the short and the long term, but the technical and economic feasibility is more case-dependent than in the centralized power sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} was motivated {{to establish a}} scientific basis for the required number of steel tie bands used in wrapping and fastening <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>coils</b> produced in steel manufacture lines for safe delivery and storage. Strain gages were installed on the tie bands and stress was recorded during the banding and delivery procedure of rolls in the field. The stress developing in the bands due to fastening of the roll and that due to springback of the coil were clearly distinguishable from the strain gage signals. Twelve <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>coils</b> having different yield strength, thickness, width, and weight were tested in the recoiling field. The results showed the average tensile stress developing in the bands due to the fastening of the roll to be 151. 7 ± 53. 8 MPa, which corresponded to one fourth of the failure strength of the steel band in the buckle region. In addition to the stress caused by fastening, average tensile stress caused by springback of the <b>rolled</b> <b>coils</b> {{was estimated to be}} 33 MPa. It increased to 79 MPa when one of the tie bands was removed from the roll. Comparing the measured stress due to springback with the theoretical stress formula yielded a proportional constant value of 0. 219, and a correlation coefficient of 0. 914, which demonstrate the formula to be useful in predicting springback stress. The average safety factor of the tie band was found to be 3. 26 and it decreased to 2. 60 when one of the bands was removed from the roll. The safety factor of the band was found to decrease with increased coil thickness because the current factory standard on the number of bands does not significantly take into account of increase in the springback force with increased coil thickness...|$|R
