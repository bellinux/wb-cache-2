40|$|Guinea {{consists}} of a coastal plain, a mountain range along the coast and the Guinea Highlands in the interior. The climate is generally tropical with high rainfall {{in the south and}} along the coast (up to 4, 000 mm precipitation per year) while the northern parts of Guinea receive about 1, 200 mm annually. Guinea’s economy is largely founded on agricultural production and the export of bauxite. Additional mineral exports are diamonds and gold, much of which is extracted by the approximately 40, 000 artisanal miners (International Labour Organization 1999). In 1999, the agricultural sector of Guinea accounted for 24 % of the GDP. Approximately 80 % of the population is involved in agricultural production, mainly at a subsistence level. Main crops are cassava, rice, plantain, citrus and bananas. Export crops include oil palm products, pineapple, cotton and coffee. <b>Geological</b> <b>outline</b> The geology of the country is dominated by the Archean Man Craton and the Paleoproterozoic Birimian domain (Wright et al. 1985).

40|$|Many of the {{mountain}} belts displaying a curved shape are "oroclines", i. e. are produced after progressive bending of an originally straight fold and thrust belt. The bending process was previously explained {{as a consequence of}} several possible events taking place in the crustal orogenic wedge, such as occurrence of obstacles, non-coaxial deformation, and mouvements on wrench faults. Recent paleomagnetic results from the northern Apenninic Arc document that this belt is properly an orocline and results from Late Messinian-Early Pliocene bending of a Messinian straight belt-foredeep system. Tomographic images in turn show the presence of a high-velocity body, interpreted as subducted slab, in the upper mantle beneath the northern Apennines, between 35 and 670 km depth. Down to 100 km, this body displays an arcuate shape which closely mirrors the <b>geological</b> <b>outlines,</b> while it appears to be straight (and parallel to the Messinian pre-rotated belt) at depth. We explore here the possibility that the arcuate shape of the northern Apennines is a consequence, closely following in time, on much deeper processes than previously suggested, i. e. the lateral bending of the subducting Adriatic plate...|$|R
40|$|The {{islands of}} Cape Verde, located some 500 km {{west of the}} Senegalese coast in the Atlantic Ocean, consist of 12 islands, 9 of which are inhabited. The climate is arid. Only about 15 % of the land base of these mountainous islands is {{suitable}} for farming. Cape Verde is an important trade and transportation centre. The agricultural sector contributes about 13 % to the GDP and employs approximately 25 % of the population. Primary food crops are maize, bananas and coconuts. Bananas are the main agricultural export product. The ‘mining industry ’ in this island state is minimal. Apart from quarrying of pozzolana (some of which was exported to Portugal in the past) and dimension stone and the winning of solar salt, no substantial mineral development activities take place. A small lime operation exists {{on the island of}} Boa Vista (Meyer 1981).

40|$|Malawi is a {{landlocked}} country in southeastern Africa. The country {{consists of three}} major geographical zones: • The rift valley floor area along Lake Malawi {{in the north and}} centre of the country, and continuing into the Shire valley in the south, • The plateau region at altitudes between 750 and 1, 400 m, with gentle slopes and broad valleys, • The predominantly mountainous areas, mainly in the north of the country. Agriculture is the dominant sector of Malawi’s economy. In 1999, agriculture accounted for 38 % of the GDP. More than 80 % of the population is living in rural areas and is engaged in agriculture. Smallholder agriculture (average farm size less than 2 hectares) provides most of the food crops maize, sorghum, millet, pulses, rice, root crops and fruit. Estate agriculture provides more than 90 % of the total value of exports, especially tobacco, tea, sugar, coffee and groundnuts. So far, the mining sector has played only a minor role in the economy of Malawi. In recent years, the contribution of the mining sector to the GDP rose from 1 % in 1994 to 3 % in 1996. This is largely due to increased production of coal, cement, lime and gemstones (Malunga 1997). <b>Geological</b> <b>outline</b> The ‘Basement Complex, ’ composed of Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks, underlies most o...|$|E
40|$|Gabon {{consists}} of a plateau landscape that rises from a narrow coastal strip. Several mountain peaks reach 1, 500 m. Tropical rainforest covers {{more than half of}} the country. The climate is hot and humid. The economy of Gabon is largely based on the export of crude oil, which made up almost 50 % of the GDP in 1999. Gabon is the third-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa (after Nigeria and Angola) with 331, 000 barrels per day produced in the year 2000. Gabon’s proven oil reserves are 2. 5 trillion barrels. The natural gas reserves of Gabon are 1. 2 trillion cubic feet. The main mineral resources of Gabon are manganese and uranium. Agriculture accounted for only 8 % of the GDP in 1999 although almost half of the population engage in agricultural production, mostly on a subsistence basis. The main food crops are cassava, maize and plantains. Gabon exports rubber, palm oil, cocoa beans and valuable timber. The 1998 Gross Domestic Product per capita in Gabon was US $ 6, 353, making Gabon one of the richest countries in sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Geological</b> <b>outline</b> Geologically, the country lies in the northwest part of the Congo Craton and more than two-thirds of the country is underlain by Precambrian rocks.

60|$|Now, if I {{were giving}} {{a lecture on}} geology, and were searching for some means of giving the most {{faithful}} idea possible of the external appearance caused by this structure of the primary hills, I should throw my <b>geological</b> <b>outlines</b> aside, and take up Turner's vignette of the Alps at Daybreak. After what has been said, a single glance at it will be enough. Observe the exquisite decision with which {{the edge of the}} uppermost plank of the great peak is indicated by its clear dark side and sharp shadow; then the rise of the second low ridge on its side, only to descend again precisely in the same line; the two fissures of this peak, one pointing to its summit, the other rigidly parallel to the great slope which descends towards the sun; then the sharp white aiguille on the right, with the great fissure from its summit, rigidly and severely square, as marked below, where another edge of rock is laid upon it. But this is not all; the black rock in the foreground is equally a member of the mass, its chief slope parallel with that of the mountain, and all its fissures and lines inclined in the same direction; and, to complete the mass of evidence more forcibly still, we have the dark mass on the left articulated with absolute right lines, as parallel {{as if they had been}} drawn with a ruler, indicating the tops of two of these huge plates or planks, pointing, with the universal tendency, to the great ridge, and intersected by fissures parallel to it. Throughout the extent of mountain, not one horizontal line, nor an approach to it, is discernible. This cannot be chance--it cannot be composition--it may not be beautiful--perhaps nature is very wrong to be so parallel, and very disagreeable in being so straight;--but this is nature, whether we admire it or not.|$|R

A multitemporal comparison of historical aerial photos of the studied coastline concerning the last 100 years was executed. A geomorphological survey was carried out along 36 topographic profiles (each up to 200 -m long); these were coupled with bathymetric profiles, reaching a depth of 213 m. Both topographic and bathymetric profiles were measured on three occasions (July, October, December 2010). Textural and compositional analyses of sediments were also performed.

40|$|The {{landlocked}} {{country of the}} Central African Republic lies close to the equator, north of the Congo Basin. The countryside consists of a rolling plateau with average altitudes around 600 - 700 m. Most rivers drain into the Congo Basin. There are three distinct agro-ecological zones: tropical in the south, Sudan-Guinea type vegetation and climate in {{the centre of the}} country, and Sahelian in the north. The economy of the Central African Republic is based on agricultural exports of coffee, cotton and tobacco, and of minerals, especially diamonds. Most of the farmers grow food crops like cassava, yams, bananas, rice and groundnuts on a subsistence basis. In 1999, the agricultural sector contributed about 55 % of the GDP. Approximately 80 % of the labour force is employed in the agricultural sector. The mining sector of the Central African Republic contributes 4 % of the country’s GDP. The main economic mineral deposits are alluvial diamond deposits. Up to 40, 000 artisanal miners are involved in riverbed mining of diamonds (Mobbs 1995). The country has considerable potential for development in the gold mineralizations in greenstone belts and alluvial/eluvial deposits. <b>Geological</b> <b>outline</b> Precambrian rocks underlie approximately 60 % of the country.

40|$|Lesotho is a small, densely {{populated}} country in southern Africa, completely {{surrounded by the}} Republic of South Africa. About 75 % of Lesotho is mountainous, with altitudes reaching over 3, 000 m. The majority of the population, however, lives in the ‘lowlands ’ at around 1, 500 m. The economy of Lesotho is largely based on agriculture, income from migrant labourers, tourism and natural resource utilization (water, diamonds). In 1999, agriculture contributed about 18 % of the GDP. Some 85 % of Lesotho’s population lives in rural areas and farming is mainly at the subsistence level. The main food crops are maize, sorghum, wheat and beans. The performance of the agricultural sector in Lesotho continues to decline, largely because of reduction {{in the area that}} is suitable for cultivation. Climatic variations, soil degradation and soil erosion are other causes for this decline. The deterioration of soil quality and quantity is one of the primary concerns along with water resource management issues. The mineral sector of Lesotho is very small. The main mineral commodity extracted in Lesotho is diamonds, mainly from alluvial sources. The source rocks for diamonds in Lesotho, kimberlites, are currently being re-investigated on their resource potential. Small but uneconomic uranium occurrences are also reported from Lesotho. Sand and clays, as well as flagstones, are utilized for the local building industry. <b>Geological</b> <b>outline</b> The rocks exposed in Lesotho are almost entirely of Triassic and Jurassic age, belonging to the Karoo Supergroup (Schmitz and Rooyani 1987).

30|$|Regarding the on-land geology, Ujiié (1994) {{suggested}} that the initial appearance of the Okinawa Trough and the Ryukyu Arc occurred after the deposition of the Shimajiri Group (which corresponds to seismic unit B) and before that of the Ryukyu Group (which corresponds to seismic units C and D) during the early Pleistocene age. In addition, Gungor et al. (2012) hypothesized, based on the seismic profiles, that rifting and extension of the northern Okinawa Trough has continued since the late Miocene. Based on the growth strata developments, we contend that rifting of the Okinawa Trough initiated during the deposition of the seismic unit B (late Miocene to early Pleistocene) that accompanies the arc parallel extensional deformation at the forearc slope. However, we could not estimate the deformation activity resulting from unconformity between seismic units B and C from our data, because extensional tectonics had ceased during the deposition of seismic unit C {{and a series of}} movements had become prominent during its deposition of seismic unit D. Among our differences with the on-land <b>geological</b> history <b>outlined</b> by Ujiié (1994) is the timing of the initiation of the Okinawa Trough, which will require further examination.|$|R

40|$|Geographically and climatically, the Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) {{consists}} {{of at least}} three major zones. Low-lying land and lagoons with an equatorial tropical climate are found in the southern zone adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical forest zone lies north of the lagoonal zone, and a wooded savanna zone with sparse vegetation and dry climate exists in the north of the country. The economy of Côte d’Ivoire is largely export-driven. The main exports are agrarian and forestry products, specifically cocoa, coffee, rubber-based latex, and timber. Agriculture accounts for approximately 26 % of Côte d’Ivoire’s GDP and an estimated 70 % of the country’s export earnings. Roughly 70 % of the labour force is involved in the agricultural sector. The main food crops are yams, cassava, plantains, rice and maize. Other crops include sugar cane, and export commodities such as cocoa beans, cocoa paste, coffee, cotton and pineapple. So far, the mining industry plays only a minor {{role in the development of}} the Côte d’Ivoire.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. A <b>geological</b> <b>outline</b> of the Para Fault Block {{from a little}} south of Modbury to the Little Para River. The author wishes to acknowledge the help and encouragement given by Professor Sir Douglas Mawson {{and other members of}} the staff of the Geology Department. The area investigated is situated a few miles northeast of Adelaide. Its eastern and western limits are marked by two well defined fault scarps which are sub parallel. The western fault is known as the Para and the eastern as the Eden Fault. The southern boundary has been taken as the Grand Junction Road owing to absence of outcrops south of this line. The northern boundary has been fixed at the Little Para River owing to pressure of time. There is some suggestion that the geology north of this boundary is essentially similar to the area under discussion. Some investigation was carried out east of the Eden Fault. This was made as an attempt to determine the position of the Block in the generally accepted sequence known as the Adelaide System. No very detailed mapping was carried out. Little more than a log of beds above the schists of the Barrossian Complex was prepared. These investigations proved of little benefit as faulting has greatly disturbed the sequence. As yet no displacement can be measured as location of marker beds is not definite. Owing to relatively flat topography of the Block there is little removal of eroded material and hence rock exposures are poor except adjacent to the creeks. Investigation has been confined to field mapping. Air photos proved useful only as a means of location. The photos showed no geology except for some trend lines adjacent to the Little Para River.

40|$|Swaziland {{is a small}} {{landlocked}} mountainous {{country in}} southern Africa, surrounded by the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique. Swaziland consists of well-defined north-south striking landscape regions, (the rugged and mountainous ‘high-veld ’ at altitudes between 1, 200 - 1, 800 m in the west, the plateaux of the ‘middle-veld ’ at altitudes between 600 and 1, 000 m, and the ‘low-veld ’ at approximately 300 - 600 m). The Lebombo Mountain range at ‘middle-veld ’ altitudes forms the border with Mozambique. Most farming activities are concentrated in the ‘middle-veld ’ area. The economic bases of Swaziland are manufacturing, tourism, agriculture and the pulp and paper in-dustries. The agricultural sector accounts for 10 % of the GDP and employs approximately 18 % of the people. Most farmers cultivate only 2 - 3 acres for maize, sorghum and vegetables on a subsistence basis and some crops (e. g. cotton) for sale. Swaziland {{has one of the}} highest cattle-to-land ratios in Africa, which results in serious erosion problems. Swaziland is the second-largest sugar exporter in Africa but other export crops and products include canned pineapple, cotton lint and cotton seed. The mining sector accounts for only 2 % of the GDP. It is in transition after the exhaustion of high-grade iron deposits and the decline of the asbestos industry. Swaziland holds a substantial resource base of coal. <b>Geological</b> <b>outline</b> Geologically, Swaziland can be divided into two distinct units, Archean in the western part of the country and the Permo-Triassic and younger Karoo sediments and volcanics in the eastern part of the country.

The initial contract duration was three years, but this was extended by five months to account for acquisition of gravity data by another project. Some parts of Ghana have been airborne surveyed as part of the Mining Sector Development and Environmental Project, co-funded by the World Bank and the Nordic Development Fund, but no work was carried out on the Volta River and Keta basins, which together form a major portion of the Ghanaian territory. The approximate areas covered by the surveys are estimated at 98, 000 km² for the satellite imagery and the airborne geophysics, except for the Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) survey which was limited to 60, 000 km². The main beneficiary of this project is the Geological Survey Department, GSD. The work enhanced its geological infrastructure and its personnel received hands-on training on modern geological mapping technology. Indirect beneficiaries were the mining and exploration companies that can follow up the reconnaissance work with detailed exploration work.

The information subsequently obtained oan be used to place constraints on postulated theories of genesis of these deposits. In Chaper 1 a short introduction to the study of fluid inclusions in minerals is given. The suitability for inclusion study of minerals from the Askrigg area is discussed in Chapter 2. A method for the preparation of polished samples is also described together with criteria for the recognition of inclusion types. The importance of the recognition of post-formational changes in inclusions such as leakage and necking-down is also stressed. Chapter 3 contains a detailed <b>geological</b> <b>outline</b> of the ore deposits and a brief review of ideas regarding their genesis. Detailed homogenization studios have been performed on fluorite from numerous localities. The data obtained is then used to determine the minimum temperature of formation of the fluorites. The statistical evaluation of the significance of these results is also described together with details of the positive pressure correction applied to the results. The distribution of temperature in the orefield is described. A detailed account of a freezing stage is presented in Chapter 4. The behaviour of fluid inclusions in fluorite on freezing is outlined together with detailed salinity measurements from various samples. The results obtained are then discussed in the light of other inclusion studies from similar deposits. Chapter 5 contains a detailed appraisal of the analytical methods used to study the chemistry of fluid inclusions. The methods used to analyze leached portions of this inclusion fluid for sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and sulphur are described. The chemistry of the ore-forming fluid in the light of these results plus other electronmicroprobe and atomic absorption studies is then discussed. The theories regarding the mode of transport of metals in the inclusion are reviewed in the light of fluid inclusion evidence. The genesis of the ore deposits of the Mississippi Valley type in the light of fluid inclusion studies is discussed in Chapter 6.

40|$|Book ReviewThe {{book on the}} “Geology and Tectonics of India: An Overview” by Dr. Balasubrahmanyan {{represents}} a comprehensive and comprehensible geological and tectonic description of the Indian subcontinent. I am very impressed by the author's ability to encompass {{various aspects of the}} geology and tectonics of India in a book of 204 pages, and I congratulate the author on such an excellent, impressive piece of work. Numerous studies have been conducted on the geology and tectonics of the Indian subcontinent in the last three decades, and several synthesis books have also been published. However, none of the published books have given such a broad and comprehensive overview on the geology and tectonics of India like this one. Dr. Balasubrahmanyan has extensively surveyed the relevant literature, successfully digested the published works and admirably produced an excellent synthesis of existing knowledge about the geology of India. Undoubtedly, the publication of this book is a great contribution to the international geology community for better understanding the geology and tectonics of India. The book starts with a brief <b>geological</b> <b>outline</b> of the major tectonic divisions of India, including Peninsular India, southern India, eastern India, central India, western India, Purana Basins, Rajmahal Volcanic Province, Deccan Trap, Himalaya, Ganga Foredeep, etc. This general <b>geological</b> <b>outline</b> is followed by a short but succinct geophysical summary, especially on magnetic, deep seismic sounding, seismic and thermal aspects of these tectonic divisions. These two chapters provide the background for the next nine chapters that give more detailed descriptions of the geology of the major tectonic divisions in India, starting from the oldest but well-known Dhawar Craton, through Granulite Province, eastern Indian Shield, central Indian Cratons, western India, Purana Basins and Gondwana Basins, to the youngest and famous Deccan Trap and Himalaya. In a chapter on the Dhawar Craton, the author not only presents a timely summary of major basement gneisses (e. g. Peninsular Gneisses I and II) and greenstone belts (Sargur- and Dhawar-type) that constitute the craton, but also gives an overview of gold and sulphide mineralization in this craton. In the next chapter titled The Granulite Province, the author gives a coherent account of the Southern Granulite Terrane (SGT) and the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB), both of which are hot-spots in reconstruction of Rodinia and a Pre-Rodinia supercontinent (Columbia or Nuna), though the author does not directly manifest their significance in these aspects. As summarized by the author, recent publications show that the SGT and EGMB can be further subdivided into a number of small blocks or massifs with different geological features, which demonstrates the complex histories related to the accretion and collision of these terranes. In the next two chapters entitled The Eastern Indian Shield and The Central India Craton, the author mainly focuses on the Singhbhum and Bastar Cratons and their associated mobile belts. Compared with the Dhawar Craton, Southern Granulite Terrane (SGT) and Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, the Singhbhum and Bastar Cratons are less known to geologists from outside India. I believe that after reading these chapters the reader can be more familiar with the immensely complicated geology and tectonics of these two cratonic blocks and surrounding mobile belts. The fold belts of Aravalli and Delhi flanked by the Trans-Aravalli Basin to the west and the Vindhyan Basin to the east are described in a chapter titled Western India. The author focuses on the stratigraphy and Paleo-Mesoproterozoic tectonic evolution of these fold belts. Chapters 8 and 9 discuss a number of Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic Purana Basins and late-Paleozoic to Mesozoic Gondwana Basins, with emphases on their stratigraphy, structure, age, tectonics and mineral resources. In discussing the Purana Basins, Dr. Balasubrahmanyan suggests that sediments north of the Son-Narmada-Tapti Lineament may have formed within a broad basin (Vindhyan Basin), whereas those to the south may have been deposited in different basins. As for the Gondwana Basins, Dr. Balasubrahmanyan divides the sediments into the Lower and Upper Gondwana Basins, which show different stratigraphical sequences, structures, tectonics and ages. In chapter 10, the author presents arguments for and against the model that the Deccan basalts were derived from the head of a mantle plume whose tail is now at Reunion Island. Since the 1970 s, Indian, Chinese and many western geologists have carried out extensive investigations on the geology and tectonics of the Himalaya and produced numerous data and interpretations. In chapter 11, Dr. Balasubrahmanyan incorporates a vast amount of up-to-date information and synthesizes the general geology and tectonics of the Himalaya. Especially, the author stresses that the stratigraphy of the Himalaya is a key to understanding the metasedimentary rocks that constitute the mountain range. The final two chapters of this book discuss the Cenozoic formations and Quaternary geology of India and their potential for oil and gas reserves. The book contains {{a very large number of}} diagrams and geological maps which will certainly help researchers in understanding the geology of India, but it is a pity that few geological maps are with latitudes and longitudes, and the quality of many diagrams and maps is very poor. Although the overall English exposition is adequate, there are a number of English errors and typos. Also, few references in the bibliography were published in this century. All these need to be rectified if the author plans for a second edition. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, I reiterate that this book deserves to be read by all who are interested in the geology and tectonics of India...|$|E
30|$|One porosity-depth {{trend is}} {{observed}} for the Bunter Sandstone formation {{and another for}} the Gassum formation (Figs.  4, 5), {{despite the fact that}} local deviations from the general trends are observed. These deviations are presumably related to <b>geological</b> factors as <b>outlined</b> above. An empirical porosity-depth relationship by Gluyas and Cade (1997) is also plotted to compare the current porosity-depth trends with a suggested normal compaction curve. The Gluyas and Cade curve presumes no uplift and reflects mechanical compaction in uncemented sandstones from hydrocarbon fields with high porosity and no overpressure. These general porosity-depth trends (cf. Figs.  4, 5) are suggested for predicting the average porosity of potential reservoir sandstones in undrilled areas. A complete match between depth and porosity has not been fully achieved although maximum burial depths are applied, since the porosity also depends on factors other than depth, e.g. gain size (Table  1). However, for modelling purposes the use of a porosity-depth relation is considered satisfactory for porosity prediction and assessment. Consequently, modelled porosities are associated with uncertainty, even if the reservoir depth is well-known prior to drilling. In specific areas where the porosity distribution is well-known from local well and core data (e.g. at Tønder; Fig.  1), a local porosity-depth trend should be used.|$|R
40|$|Predictive {{deconvolution}} {{is widely}} {{treated as a}} universally applicable tool for multiple removal and wavelet compression. The fundamental assumption of random reflectivity is seriously compromised in geological situations where the reflection sequence comprises {{a small number of}} dominant horizons. This situation is not uncommon in coal environments. Where the primary seismic objective is high quality imaging of particular target horizons, an improved result can be achieved if the deconvolution is designed according to assumptions more relevant to the <b>geological</b> situation. We <b>outline</b> a simple example of this approach, aimed at imaging a production coal seam, of thickness 5 - 10 m, at a mine in the Bowen Basin, Australia. Using horizon time picks from a preliminary volume, the full reflection package associated with the seam is extracted and deterministically filtered to obtain an estimate of the intrinsic wavelet. A Wiener spiking filter, designed on the extracted wavelet, is then used to deconvolve the seam package. In comparison to the predictive deconvolution approach, this model-based procedure provides improved resolution of the top and base coal interfaces. In addition, derived amplitude and frequency attributes are more robust in terms of known geology. Variants of this simple model-based procedure should have relevance in a range of dominant-horizon situations where predictive deconvolution is invalid...|$|R

40|$|The {{landslide}} of Salo {{originated from}} the slump {{of the southern}} slope of Mt. S. Bartolomeo (568 m), after the deglaciation of Lake Garda, before 7100 ± 150 uncal yr BP (Beta- 34291). The main scarp and the crawn are well developed {{on the western side}} and dissected on the eastern. A talus slope develops {{at the foot of the}} main scarp. Two different portions of the landslide can be distinguished: the first from about 80 m to 230 m a. s. l., the second below 80 m a. s. l. (the mean level of Lake Garda lies at about 65 m a. s. l.). The latter is completely urbanized while the former is characterized by a network of artificial terraces (reworked for farming purposes). These terraces on the landslide show a different and more irregular pattern respect to the neighbouring areas. This is due to the irregular surface of the slumped area. A narrow belt of artificial debris discarged in the coastal area separates the southern margin of the lanslide from Lake Garda. The geological structure of the area is the most important favouring cause of the slump, even though Pleistocene glacial erosion can be also taken into account. Neotectonic activity or an earthquake could have caused the down sloping of the southern slope of Mt. S. Bartolomeo. The "Scaglia" formation (marl and limestone; Eocene-Cenomanian) overthrusted during the Late Miocene on Oligocene marls (Late Oligocene Middle Oligocene) occurring at the bottom of the southern slope of Mt. S. Bartolomeo. An angular unconformity separates the strongly folded "Scaglia" and the basal conglomerate (Early Pliocene? - Late Miocene ?) of the formation of Mt. S. Bartolomeo (Late Pliocene-Late Miocene ?). The rocks that outcrop along the southern slope of Mt. S. Bartolomeo ("Scaglia" and conglomerate) slumped on the plastic Oligocene marls, carrying down also the surficial deposit of the area (till and stratified debris, dating to the Late Pleistocene and to the Holocene). In fact, Pleistocene and Early Holocene deposits are not present on the landslide of Salo. On the contrary, they are widespread in the neighbouring areas. Furthermore, the southeastern margin of the landslide borders on a lacustrine delta raised above the present lake level. The exact age of this delta is unknown but, according to other evidences of the Garda area (BARONI, 1986), it can be dated to the Early Late Glacial Holocene. The artificial debris discarged in the coastal area between the 11 th century AD and the present is more than 13 metres thick. Shells of Valvata piscinalis and Bithynia tentaculata collected at 14. 7 / 15. 4 m in a drill carried out in P. za Zanardelli (tav. 1) yielded an age of 7100 ± 150 uncal BP yr (Beta- 34291). The shells have been collected from a sandy silt layer at the top of a deltaic sequence. Since the lake level decreased during the Holocene, the deltaic sequence between 13. 7 and 16. 2 m demonstrates the subsidence of the area. This series has been interpreted as a deltaic sequence resting on the southern portion of the landslide. The date supplies a minimum limiting age for the down sloping. Thus, also taking into account the "reservoir effect" of the lacustrine water that produces older dates for the carbonates of the freshwater molluscs, the direct superimposition of medieval layers on the dated deltaic sequence shows a stratigraphic gap of some millennia. This attests a remobilization of the southern margin of the landlslide between 7100 ± 150 uncal BP yr (Beta 34291) and 880 ± 70 uncal BP yr (GX- 14685). If this is the case, one can suggest that settlements existing in the area fell into the lake. The central portion of the coastal area (on which the historical centre of Salo was built) was interested by subsidence between 16 th and 20 th century. It slipped toward the lake on the occasion of at least two earthquakes (5. 1. 1892 and 30. 10. 1901). The latter (VII-VIII MCS) gave rise to the greatest damages of the history of Salo. The subsidence of the coastal area is testified by the annual mean lake levels registered by the hydrometers of Salo and Peschiera. A subsidence of some centimetres is documented between 1953 and 1985. Portions of the landslide were remobilized during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Some of them still seem to be in movement (Misse, Guasto and Rocchetta areas). Several Authors refer of a legend according to which the mythic city of Benacus fell in the lake after an earthquake in 243 (or 245) AD. Evidence of this city was never pointed out and many Authors do not trust the legend. Somebody thinks that the ruins of a roman villa at Toscolano are to be related to this city. The <b>geological</b> <b>outline</b> of the area suggest a down sloping of the coast at Salo before 880 ± 70 uncal BP yr, 0031 / 1225 cal AD; GX- 14685). This makes us suppose that the mythical city of Benacus, if really existed, could be hypothetically located on the landslide of Salo...|$|E
40|$|Government {{policy for}} the {{long-term}} management of the UK’s higher-activity radioactive waste is <b>geological</b> disposal as <b>outlined</b> in the 2008 Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) White Paper. The Government remains firmly committed to this policy and continues to hold {{the view that the}} best means of selecting a site for a geological disposal facility (GDF) is an approach based on voluntarism and partnership. Feedback {{from a wide range of}} stakeholders has indicated that a robust presentation of what is known, and what is not known, about the geology of any prospective area is needed at an early stage in the MRWS process. The existing BGS GB 3 D model provides the only nationally consistent representation of the bedrock geology of Great Britain to depths of at least 1 km. The links between this dataset and the underpinning geological evidence needed to be strengthened and rigorous peer review performed to enable an enhanced dataset to inform the MRWS process. So the objective of this study was to further develop the GB 3 D model in England and Wales by the incorporation of about 300 deep boreholes into the existing framework of cross-sections, reroute some sections to incorporate the borehole data and provide additional sections to densify the network in order to produce a robust, verifiable and defensible dataset...|$|R
