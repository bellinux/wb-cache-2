On 2 February 1907 she left Melbourne with scheduled stops at Cape Town, Tenerife, Plymouth, London and finally Liverpool, {{under the command of}} Thomas Jones.

5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar {{played a}} key role. The Ocean Convoy System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic convoy route between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport is}} also served {{full-time}} by MBTA bus routes 448, 449, and 459, which only stop at Terminal C. The airport was originally served full-time by the Crosstown 3 (CT3) bus via the Andrew Red Line station, {{but after the}} Silver Line segment to the airport was constructed, service was cut back to Andrew since it is faster to simply ride the Red Line two stops <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> South Station, and transfer to an airport-bound Silver Line bus. However, two CT3 buses per day do still continue to Logan as the 171, at 3:50 AM and 4:20 AM, making it the only MBTA bus to serve all Logan Terminals.|$|E

25|$|At 2000 {{hours on}} 9 December, four tanks and two PAVN {{infantry}} battalions struck GM 41 at Tha Theng. Striking from the north, they split in half to form two attacking columns. One of the tanks penetrated the Tha Theng perimeter, locked one tread, and spun {{on the other}} while firing in all directions, dispersing two of the Royalist guerrilla battalions. The two remaining RLG battalions clung to Tha Theng until reinforced. At 0430 on the 10th, the PAVN armor retreated. The Royalists had suffered 20 killed and 23 wounded, in return for unknown enemy losses. Raven FACs directed close air support sorties on the Communists {{for the remainder of}} the day. It also requested mining sorties along Route 23, to block or destroy PAVN tanks <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> Salavan.|$|E
25|$|In November 1975 {{an attempt}} was made to sink the ship. While she was being {{repaired}} at San Juan, two bombs were installed on board under the waterline. These were detonated later during the same month as the ship was approaching New York. The damage did not sink the ship however, and she was subsequently repaired at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Hoboken, New Jersey, United States. An incident of a different nature took place while the ship was <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> New York on 18 September 1980, when the port authorities declined the ship's right to make port due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan at the time. Instead of entering port Maxim Gorky was forced to lay at anchor outside Staten Island, while port ferries were used to bring her passengers to the city.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Ed Koch too {{explored}} {{possibilities for}} {{a ban on}} private cars in 1979, only permitting mass transit, delivery, and emergency vehicles. The city's transportation commissioner said that limited bans on two streets in midtown Manhattan had been successful. The next year, Koch's office sought to ban single-occupancy cars from the East River bridges during weekday morning rush hour, but the State Supreme Court ruled that the City did not have that authority. Other actions, such as bicycle and bus lanes, reduction in parking spaces, and automobile inspections, were left in place. In 1981, the national administration deemed New York City {{in compliance with the}} federal air pollution regulations after a decade of noncompliance. Carbon monoxide levels decreased over the decade with improvements in car emissions. The number of cars <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> Manhattan continued to rise and vehicle exhaust remained the top source of pollution in New York City.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not known}} whether the PAVN and/or the ARVN would try to disrupt the {{evacuation}} and so the planners had to take all possible contingencies into account {{to ensure the safety}} and success of the evacuation. The staff of 9th MAB prescribed altitudes, routes, and checkpoints for flight safety for the operation. To avert mid-air collisions, the planners chose altitudes which would provide separation of traffic and also a capability to see and avoid the enemy's AAA, SA-2 and SA-7 missile threat ( [...] for flights <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> Saigon and [...] for those outbound from Saigon to the Navy ships). These altitudes were also high enough to avoid small arms and artillery fire.|$|E
500|$|AOC 11 Group Keith Park was livid {{with the}} claim returns. As {{far as he}} was concerned, {{claiming}} 200 on one day was nonsense. He placed particular blame on Leigh-Mallory's Big Wing which had claimed one third, around 60, of the 185 'victories' (total claims were 81 in the morning and 104 in the afternoon). More damage should have been done to German bombers <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> the target rather than destroying stragglers that were no military threat {{as they made their way}} to the coast. He complained that there were too many inexperienced leaders and interceptions were being missed. Things needed [...] "tightening up", that was Park's lesson for 15 September. Park was aware the ratio of losses was 2:1 in the British favour. It had been a decent performance, but not Fighter Command's best.|$|E
500|$|Denver International Airport's access highway Peña Boulevard {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-70 in Aurora as a northern continuation of Airport Boulevard.

Travelers <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> the airport from I-70 East {{do not have access}} to the first interchange. [...] Continuing north, the highway leaves Aurora and passes into the Denver Gateway area, Aurora's Gateway Park development is adjacent.

500|$|El Sol resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, {{where she had}} eight years of uneventful operation. On 11 March 1927, however, El Sol was <b>inbound</b> <b>to</b> New York with a $1,000,000 cargo of pig iron, copper, and bales of cotton. When a heavy fog settled over New York Harbor, Captain Charles H. Knowles ordered his ship to anchor until the fog cleared. As El Sol was being maneuvered into {{position}} at about 07:45, the American Diamond Line ship Sac City hit a glancing blow to El Sol, bounced off and then struck El Sol a second time, ripping through El Sols plating. Sac Citys bow had some slight damage, but El Sol sank quickly in about [...] of water about a half-mile (800 m) south of the Statue of Liberty. Out of El Sols crew of 45 men, 44 were rescued; the ship's carpenter, who could not swim, was last seen clutching the ship's rail as it went below the surface.|$|E
