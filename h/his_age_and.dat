5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Maxwell made several attempts to enlist, but was unsuccessful due to <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> deteriorating health. He eventually travelled to Queensland, where he enlisted under the alias of Joseph Wells on 27 June 1940. However, his identity was soon discovered and he was given a training position; dissatisfied, he took his discharge on 9 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, Davis met Varina Banks Howell, then 17 years old, whom {{his brother}} Joseph had invited for the Christmas season at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell; her mother's family {{was from the}} South and {{included}} successful Scots-Irish planters. Within a month of their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents' initial concerns about <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> politics. They were married on February 26, 1845.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dunstan became {{president}} of the State Labor Party. The year also saw the death of Opposition Leader Mick O'Halloran and his replacement by Frank Walsh. Dunstan attempted to win both the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical of <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.|$|E

5|$|In June 1864, Brandon was {{promoted}} to brigadier general and sent to Mississippi where, on 23 July, he was given command of the Reserve Corps of Mississippi. He was later placed {{in charge of the}} Confederate Bureau of Conscription on 8 October 1864, where he worked to recruit men for the Confederate army. After the war, Brandon returned to his Arcole Plantation in Wilkinson County, where despite <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> physical disability, he worked until his death on October 8, 1890. Brandon was buried at his plantation.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{his family}} {{appear to have been}} thieves. While young, his brother, Richard, was small for <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> {{is said to have been}} carried around in a basket on a friend's back; in a crowd, Richard would snatch the hats and wigs of passers-by. Richard later took to other forms of {{criminal}} activity and ended up hanged at Tyburn in 1707 for the burglary of a house in Stepney.|$|E
5|$|The name of Paulucci {{came back}} to the {{attention}} of the public in March 1848, along with that of General Latour, for the command of the Sardinian Army on the field, those being the only two generals of the entire force that had led troops in battle before. Both <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> bad health induced him to make a public refusal of the position, still never offered to him officially.|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Howard {{succeeded in}} raising his person {{to witness the}} ceremony, and had {{answered}} to each prayer with a fervent [...] "Amen."

50|$|In 1955, Rodia quit {{claimed his}} {{property}} {{to a neighbor}} and left, reportedly tired of battling with the City of Los Angeles for permits, and because he understood the possible consequences of <b>his</b> <b>aging</b> <b>and</b> being alone. He moved to Martinez, California {{to be with his}} sister and never returned. He died ten years later.|$|R
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war in 1861, Johnston was fifteen years old and {{attending}} Highland Military College in Newburg, New York. He remained in school through 1862, but then left to raise a company for a regiment being organized in New York. De Peyster's father paid ten-dollar bounties to the men who signed the muster roll of his company. He was not able to assume command because of <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> his family also felt he was too young for service. However, in the winter of 1863, he threatened to travel to Washington, D.C. and stand for examination for an officership with a colored regiment.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise transports the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson (Clayton Rohner) to deal with a hostage negotiation on the planet Mordan IV. Jameson took a drug to reverse <b>his</b> <b>aging,</b> <b>and</b> must defuse the situation with a former adversary.|$|R

5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be the deciding factor in his destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} in Bowling Green on August 26. Because of <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> ill health, {{he made no}} more than one speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E

5|$|During World War II Nash {{rejected}} {{offers of}} a home posting and instead served as a trooper in New Guinea, stating that he wished to be treated no differently from any other soldier. Following {{the end of the}} war, Nash returned to South Melbourne and won the team goal kicking award, although <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> injuries inhibited any return of his previous successes. Nash retired from VFL football {{at the end of the}} 1945 season to play and coach in the country before returning to coach South Melbourne in 1953. After retiring, Nash wrote columns for newspapers, was a panellist on football television shows and was a publican before his death in Melbourne, aged 76.|$|E
5|$|He had {{a liberal}} {{education}} {{by the standards}} of <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> learned French, German and Latin. He showed a special interest in history and astrology. A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the basic principles of Christian faith. However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on his shoulders. His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E

5000|$|Although a man [...] "marked out for {{a career}} of promotion", {{according}} to Tacitus, he was tried before the Senate in the year 62. The Senate found him guilty for conspiring with Vincius Rufinus, Antonius Primus, and others, to impose on <b>his</b> <b>aged</b> <b>and</b> wealthy relative, Domitius Balbus, a forged will. Fabianus {{was removed from the}} senatorian order by the Lex Cornelia Testamentaria or De Falsis.|$|R

5|$|Johnson entered {{politics}} in 1804, {{when he was}} elected to represent Scott County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was twenty-three years old. Although the Kentucky Constitution imposed an age requirement of twenty-four for members of the House of Representatives, Johnson was so popular that no one raised questions about <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> he was allowed to take his seat. He was placed on the Committee on Courts of Justice. During his tenure, he supported legislation to protect settlers from land speculators. On January 26, 1807, he delivered an address condemning the Burr conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Lessons {{depicts a}} mother {{teaching}} her son. Presumably, {{many of the}} events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with <b>his</b> <b>age</b> <b>and</b> growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for Children of two to three (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part I (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part II (1778); and Lessons for Children of three to four (1779). After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.|$|E
5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010.

On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E
