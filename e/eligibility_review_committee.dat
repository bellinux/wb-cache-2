40|$|Objective. To examine factors {{contributing}} {{to the loss of}} potential minority participants in a study of medication adherence among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Methods. Chi-square statistics were used to test for differences in refusal/ineligibility by race and site at 4 screening points (initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>review,</b> initial patient contact, adherence screening, and informed consent). Differences in criteria-specific risks for exclusion at initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>review</b> were examined across 4 sites by race.
