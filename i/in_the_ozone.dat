25|$|The {{aerosols}} {{have a role}} in {{the destruction}} of ozone due to surface chemistry effects. Destruction of ozone has in recent years created large holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer, initially over the Antarctic and then the Arctic.

25|$|Ozone is {{produced}} by ultraviolet light from the Sun hitting the Earth's atmosphere (especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer), lightning, certain high-voltage electric devices (such as air ionizers), and as a by-product {{of other types of}} pollution.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, public {{consciousness}} about environmental threats grew rapidly. Large scale environmental disasters {{such as the}} Chernobyl catastrophe focused attention {{on the need for}} higher levels of environmental protection. Issues such as the holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer over the poles and global warming prompted an acceleration in European environmental policy-making and institution-building.|$|E
25|$|When the Antarctic {{ozone hole}} breaks up each year, the ozone-depleted air drifts out into nearby regions. Decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> level {{of up to}} 10 percent have been {{reported}} in New Zealand in the month following the breakup of the Antarctic ozone hole, with ultraviolet-B radiation intensities increasing by more than 15 percent since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Since 1981 the United Nations Environment Programme, {{under the}} auspices of the World Meteorological Organization, has {{sponsored}} a series of technical reports on the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, based on satellite measurements. The 2007 report showed that the hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer was recovering and the smallest it had been for about a decade.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{destruction}} occurs principally in polar regions, but <b>the</b> {{formation of}} <b>ozone</b> occurs principally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropics. <b>Ozone</b> is distributed {{around the planet}} by the Brewer-Dobson circulation.

50|$|Although the {{phase-out}} of CFCs took {{almost two}} decades, {{the policy is}} generally seen as a success.

50|$|About 90 {{percent of}} <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{atmosphere}} is contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stratosphere. <b>Ozone</b> concentrations are greatest between about 20 and 40 km, where {{they range from}} about 2 to 8 parts per million.

25|$|The shorter {{bands of}} UVC, {{as well as}} even more-energetic UV {{radiation}} produced by the Sun, are absorbed by oxygen and generate the ozone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer when single oxygen atoms produced by UV photolysis of dioxygen react with more dioxygen. The ozone layer is especially important in blocking most UVB and the remaining part of UVC not already blocked by ordinary oxygen in air.|$|E
25|$|Rockets as a {{class are}} not {{inherently}} grossly polluting. However, some rockets use toxic propellants, and most vehicles use propellants that are not carbon neutral. Many solid rockets have chlorine {{in the form of}} perchlorate or other chemicals, and this can cause temporary local holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer. Re-entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer. Most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction.|$|E
25|$|The main {{public concern}} {{regarding}} the ozone hole {{has been the}} effects of increased surface UV radiation on human health. So far, ozone depletion in most locations has been typically a few percent and, as noted above, no direct evidence of health damage is available in most latitudes. If {{the high levels of}} depletion seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> hole were to be common across the globe, the effects could be substantially more dramatic. As the ozone hole over Antarctica has in some instances grown so large as to affect parts of Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa, environmentalists have been concerned that the increase in surface UV could be significant.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Earth's <b>ozone</b> layer over <b>the</b> South Pole has {{affected}} atmospheric circulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere {{all the way}} to <b>the</b> equator. <b>The</b> <b>ozone</b> hole has influenced atmospheric circulation {{all the way to}} the tropics and increased rainfall at low, subtropical latitudes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere.|$|R
30|$|When only {{atmospheric}} chemistry is considered, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of Segura et al. (2005), <b>the</b> total <b>ozone</b> column of an Earth-like planet {{is determined by}} the UV radiation of the stellar spectrum used. The use of a flaring M star spectrum, whose UV radiation output <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 200 nm region is comparable to <b>the</b> Sun’s, results <b>in</b> no decrease and even an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total <b>ozone</b> column. <b>The</b> use of a quiescent M star spectrum, on the other hand, whose UV output <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 200 nm region is more than three order of magnitude lower than <b>the</b> Sun’s, results <b>in</b> a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> total <b>ozone</b> column by 40  %.|$|R

25|$|Ozone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ozone</b> layer filters out {{sunlight}} wavelengths {{from about}} 200nbsp&nm UV rays to 315nbsp&nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250nbsp&nm. This ozone UV absorption {{is important to}} life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths < 200nbsp&nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280nbsp&nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315nbsp&nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290nbsp&nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful {{at the top of}} the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of vitamin D in humans.|$|E
