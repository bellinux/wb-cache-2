However, clinical trials <b>of</b> near-infrared laser <b>light</b> for treatment <b>of</b> stroke were abandoned after failing interim futility analyses. Lack of efficacy has been attributed to sub-optimal treatment parameters and low penetrance <b>of</b> <b>light</b> to affected brain regions. Here, we assess penetrance of wavelengths from 450 - 880 nm in human post-mortem samples, and demonstrate that human skin, skull bone and brain transmits therapeutically relevant quantities <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from external sources at wavelengths above 600 nm. Transmission through post-mortem skull bone was dependent upon thickness, and ranged from 5 - 12 % at peak wavelengths of 700 - 850 nm.

However, siRNA gene silencing occurs during transfection, limiting its use is in kinetic studies, deciphering toxic and off-target effects and phenotypic assays requiring temporal, and/or spatial regulation.

A single photo removable group is coupled during oligonucleotide synthesis to the 5 ′ end of the antisense strand of the siRNA, which blocks the siRNA's activity. A low <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> activates the siRNA, independent of transfection resulting in knock down of specific target mRNAs and proteins (GAPDH, p 53, survivin, hNuf 2) without stimulating non-specific effects such as regulated protein kinase PKR and induction of the interferon response. We demonstrate survivin and hNuf 2 csiRNAs temporally knockdown their mRNAs causing multinucleation and cell death by mitotic arrest, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate a dose-dependent light regulation of hNuf 2 csiRNA activity and resulting phenotype. The light controllable siRNAs are introduced into cells using commercially available reagents including the MPG peptide based delivery system. The csiRNAs are comparable to standard siRNAs in their transfection efficiency and potency of gene silencing. This technology should be of interest for phenotypic assays such as cell survival, cell cycle regulation, and cell development...|$|E

The inflammatory response of the ear exhibits a linear relationship to the <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> delivered. We observed that doses of shortwave ultraviolet light which are noninflammatory when repeated at daily intervals induce moderate to severe inflammation. Small doses of psoralen and prolonged exposure to UVA (PUVA) were more inflammatory than larger amounts of psoralen and short exposure to light. Doses of shortwave ultraviolet light and PUVA which produce only a minimal {{inflammation of the skin}} stimulate the proliferation of epidermal melanocytes. In contrast, PUVA in doses sufficiently large to cause a marked inflammatory reaction in the skin seems injurious to pigment cells and kills them or causes only a minimal proliferative response. The inflammatory reaction itself does not seem to stimulate or inhibit the proliferation of melanocytes. Prostaglandins A, E, and F 2 α have no effect on the proliferation of epidermal pigment cells. In contrast, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and allergic contact dermatitis increase the numerical density of pigment cells. Steroids may block the function of the enzyme tyrosinase.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that light- and oxygen-induced proteolysis in chloroplasts is mediated by ac-tive oxygen species was examined. In {{order to determine}} whether or not H 2 O 2 and/or 'OH radi-cals are involved in these degradative processes we compared the degradation of proteins in isolated oat chloroplasts exposed to white light at 80 W m~ 2 with that in chloroplasts incubated in darkness in the absence or presence of H 2 O 2 or a "OH-generating system composed by ascorbic acid, FeCl 3 and H 2 O 2 (Asc-Fe-H 2 O 2). Light enhanced the rate of degradation of at least 18 poly-peptides, while proteolysis was almost negligible in darkness in the abscence of additives. H 2 O 2 had a very small effect. However, Asc-Fe-H 2 O 2 -treated chloroplasts in darkness showed a pattern of protein degradation almost identical to that observed in the light. A thylakoid-bound endopep-tidase (EP), the activity of which increased under photooxidative environmental conditions and treatment with an *OH-generating system, was partially purified and characterized as a serine-type protease. Treatments with inhibitors of serine-type protease prevented both light- and Asc-Fe-H 2 O 2 -induced proteolysis.

40|$|PURPOSE: This thesis {{explores the}} idea that light energy, {{especially}} ultraviolet light, contributes to the unequal distribution of cataract {{around the world and}} to the development of cortical opacities. METHODS: In the first section, the thesis reviews historical concepts of the function of the lens and the nature of cataract, epidemiologic data on the global distribution of cataract, and clinical observations of the predominant location of cortical opacification. Second, computer ray tracings and geometric optics demonstrate the passage of light of varying angle of incidence within the lens. Third, two models of the human eye are used to study the refraction of light by the cornea and lens and illustrate the concentration of energy at the equatorial plane of the lens. RESULTS: Cataract prevalence increases with proximity to the earth's equator, and cortical cataract is most common in the inferior and inferonasal lens. Theoretical studies and the eye models both demonstrate that the concentration of light within the lens increases with angle of incidence, and the eye models suggest that the inferior and inferonasal lens receives significantly more energy than other sections of the lens. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cataract and exposure to ultraviolet energy both increase with decreasing latitude. The most common location of cortical cataract in the inferonasal lens is consistent with the greater <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> energy received by this portion of the lens. These studies suggest that the global distribution of cataract and the development of cortical cataract are at least in part dependent on the dose of ultraviolet light received by the lens...|$|E

In present study authors examined whether photodynamic therapy with 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) induces NUCKS expression in breast cancer cell line, MCF- 7. Methods: In the experiment concentration of 5 -ALA was 6. 5 mM. Excitation wavelength was 630 +/- 20 nm, total light <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> 5 or 10 J/cm(2) and irradiance 60 mW/cm(2) was used. Cells were collected at established time points and Western blot and immunocytochemical studies were performed using antibody against NUCKS. Results: Studies proved strong cytotoxic effects in cells following PDT with 6. 5 mM of precursor and 10 J/cm(2). Western blot analysis revealed the strongest expression of NUCKS at 7 h after PDT. At next time points, 18 and 24 h, expression of NUCKS decreased and became {{similar to that of}} control group. Further immunocytochemical studies showed very strong expression of NUCKS following PDT with 5 -ALA and light irradiation of 5 J/cm 2. Early, at Oh, that expression was predominantly seen in nuclei, while at 7 h expression of NUCKS was observed in disseminated manner within entire cells in both nuclei and cytoplasm, with prevalence of cytoplasmic staining. Conclusions: Authors suggest that NUCKS is involved in cellular responses following PDT, and since parallel induction of NUCKS and proapoptotic marker Bax and inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl- 2 was observed, this protein might also be involved in induction of apoptosis following PDT.

40|$|Introduction: Cutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} (CL) is {{a widespread}} disease that is epidemic in Iran, too. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an attractive modality to treat cancer and hyper proliferative diseases based {{on the use of}} a photosensitizer in the presence of oxygen and proper wavelength of light. In consideration of lesion location, lack of systemic involvement and inefficiency of current treatments, nowadays this modality is purposed for treating Leishmaniasis. In this paper, efficacy of PDT using a natural dye (chlorophyll a) on Leishmania major promastigotes is reported. Material and Methods: The experiments was done on Leishmania major parasites (MRHO/IR/ 75 /ER) in the presence of Chlorophyll a /Hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin(chl a/CD) complex as a photosensitizer. At first, dye uptake by promastigotes was evaluated via fluorimetric assessments after different incubation periods. Then dye cytotoxicity was evaluated at different concentration after 24 h incubation. Finally PDT experiments were designed with two doses of light and 10 µM of photosensitizer. Considering all possible controls, the percentage of the parasite survival at 24 hours post treatment was assessed by MTS method. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Results: On the basis of the dye uptake data, 24 h was considered for incubating of photosensitizer with promastigotes. IC 50 of chl a/CD complex was about 42. 6 µM. After parasites irradiation by light at 248 j/cm 2, more than 50 % of cell death was recorded that is significant in comparing with similar groups without dye, without light, and lower <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> In these conditions, ED 50 of PDT on promastigotes is determined nearly 246 J/cm 2. Discussion and Conclusion: Considering low cytotoxicity in darkness and adequate phototoxicity of chl a/CD complex in comparison with other photosensitizers such as AlPhtalocyanine chloride, it can be introduced as a promising candidate for futher use in PDT experiments on amastigotes and Leishmaniasis animal models...|$|E

The epilated half {{of the back of}} each animal was irradiated with various <b>doses</b> <b>of</b> ultraviolet <b>light,</b> and the other half served as the nonirradiated control. The amount of intraperitoneally injected [Me- 3 H]-thymidine incorporated into the DNA was determined by the isolation of DNA at various time intervals and the measurement of its radioactivity. Significant inhibition of the biosynthesis of DNA (64 % of the control) immediately after ultraviolet irradiation was observed. The duration of this inhibition is related to the total <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> ultraviolet <b>light</b> delivered and to the degree of the erythema reaction (i. e., the degree of cellular damage) and can persist from 2. 24 hr. With a moderate <b>dose,</b> the biosynthesis <b>of</b> new DNA occurs 2 hr after irradiation...|$|R
