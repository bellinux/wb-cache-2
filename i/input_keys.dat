25|$|He {{observes that}} using one round of simple {{tabulation}} hashing {{to expand the}} <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> to six times their original length, and then {{a second round of}} simple tabulation hashing on the expanded keys, results in a hashing scheme whose independence number is exponential in the parameter r, the number of bits per block in the partition of the keys into blocks.|$|E
25|$|Many, but not all, {{computer}} keyboards have a numeric keypad {{to the right}} of the alphabetic keyboard, often separated from the other groups of keys such as the function keys and system command keys, which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few function keys. On Japanese/Korean keyboards, there may be Language <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> for changing the language to use. Some keyboards have power management keys(e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or E-mail; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls; or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified application or a command like minimizing all windows.|$|E
50|$|Each of the 24 rows {{corresponds}} to a single bit in the 3-byte <b>input</b> <b>key,</b> {{and each of the}} 32 columns {{corresponds to}} a bit in the output hash. Colors are chosen by how well the <b>input</b> <b>key</b> bit affects the given output hash bit: a green square indicates good mixing behavior, a yellow square weak mixing behavior, and red would indicate no mixing. Only a few bits in the last byte of the <b>input</b> <b>key</b> are weakly mixed to a minority of bits in the output hash.|$|R

500|$|The {{team also}} faced several {{technical}} issues, such as {{dealing with a}} fixed font size, and having to type in additional symbols using language <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> so the code would function. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. To complicate matters, the Japanese text used obscure kanji symbols carried over from Chinese writing. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee Richard Honeywood as the [...] "old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement". The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. [...] For the PC port, Square did its best to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions, but {{did not have the}} time and budget to retranslate all the text. According to Honeywood, the success of Final Fantasy VII in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.|$|E

5000|$|For layouts {{containing}} {{more than}} one group, several mechanisms for group selection are specified. A dedicated Group selection key (marked by [...] according to ISO/IEC 9995-7), if present, shall be positioned adjacent to a “Level 3 select” (AltGr) key. For layouts containing a “Group 2” as specified in ISO/IEC 9995-3, this key shall work as a “latch” (i. e., when it is pressed and then released, the actuation of the next character <b>input</b> <b>key</b> causes {{the selection of a}} character of Group 2. After this, the status is reverted, thus subsequent character <b>input</b> <b>key</b> actuations refer to the basic group unless the “group selection” key is actuated again). If no dedicated “Group selection” key is present, its function is obtained by pressing the “Level 2 select” and “Level 3 select” (i. e. “Shift” and “AltGr”) key simultaneously and releasing them before actuating the selected character <b>input</b> <b>key.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature in}} the associative memory is that traces of data from many different occurrences are superimposed on the same memory elements. So, cross-talk will inevitably occur when the output recollection {{in relation to the}} <b>input</b> <b>key</b> will be performed. Therefore, this paper deals with the associative memory subjected to the higher-order correlation matrix formalism, and derives some explicit descriptions in a form which enables direct discernment {{of the quality of the}} recollection. In general, it might be true that more exact recollection is expected as the correlation order is increased as well as the missing portions of the <b>input</b> <b>key</b> are decreased. But, theoretically, it is shown that the latter case is not in true case. An approach to improve this situation is presented, and its availability is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tornado {{is a novel}} 256 -bit {{block cipher}} that accepts a variablelength key up to 256 bits. The {{proposed}} cipher was built on an idea which gives it a dynamic nature. This nature means that the cipher execution flow varies according to the user’s <b>input</b> <b>key.</b> The confusion and diffusion processes are performed based on 10 round functions named “Storm-functions”. A selection and reordering operations are performed on those functions, using a fast hashing function based on the <b>input</b> <b>key.</b> The proposed cipher has a carefully designed key scheduling algorithm. The Software implementation of the proposed cipher gives high throughput. Performance study demonstrated that, Tornado is faster than the AES by a speed-up percentage of 253 %. Yet, we believe that Tornado is more secure than AES...|$|R

It then generates similarly cryptographically strong output key material (OKM) of any desired length by repeatedly generating PRK-keyed hash-blocks and then appending {{them into the}} output key material, finally truncating to the desired length.|$|R
5000|$|The {{arrangement}} of the character <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> and the Shift keys contained in this layout is specified in the U.S. American national standard ANSI-INCITS 154-1988 (R1999) (formerly ANSI X3.154-1988 (R1999)), where this layout is called [...] "ASCII keyboard". The complete US keyboard layout, as it is usually found, also contains the usual function keys {{in accordance with the}} international standard ISO/IEC 9995-2, although this is not explicitly required by the US American national standard.|$|E
50|$|To {{select the}} Level 2 (commonly called “shifted”, see the {{subsection}} “Levels and Groups” {{of the section}} “ISO/IEC 9995-1” above), two keys shall be present in row B (commonly called Shift keys). The left one shall occupy position B99, while the right one shall be located right of the character <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> of that row. It is to {{be noted that the}} exact function of these keys (commonly pressing them together with the affected character input key) is not specified in the standard. Thus, solutions where the shift key is pressed, then released before the character input key is pressed, are compliant with the standard.|$|E
50|$|Inputting complex {{characters}} can be cumbersome {{on electronic}} devices {{due to a}} practical limitation {{in the number of}} <b>input</b> <b>keys.</b> There exist various input methods for entering logograms, either by breaking them up into their constituent parts such as with the Cangjie or Wubi method of typing Chinese, or using phonetic systems such as Bopomofo or Pinyin where the word is entered as pronounced and then selected from a list of logograms matching it. While the former method is (linearly) faster, it is more difficult to learn. With the Chinese alphabet system however, the strokes forming the logogram are typed as they are normally written, and the corresponding logogram is then entered.|$|E

5000|$|The {{limitation}} {{of the amount of}} buttons compared to a PC keyboard or a custom arcade cabinet means that controller buttons will commonly perform multiple, different actions {{to make up for the}} lack of extra buttons. For example, The Witcher 3 Xbox One controls will use the [...] "A" [...] button to interact with the world when pressed but to make the character sprint when held, whereas the PC control scheme can separate these functions into separate buttons. The {{limitation of}} <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> can allow a developer to create a more refined and succinct control scheme that can be learned by the player more easily and different games in the same genre tend to create control schemes similar to each other allowing players to easily adapt to new games.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{tabulation}} hashing {{as described}} above ("simple tabulation hashing") is only 3-independent, variations of this method {{can be used to}} obtain hash functions with much higher degrees of independence. [...] uses the same idea of using exclusive or operations to combine random values from a table, with a more complicated algorithm based on expander graphs for transforming the key bits into table indices, to define hashing schemes that are k-independent for any constant or even logarithmic value of k. However, the number of table lookups needed to compute each hash value using Siegel's variation of tabulation hashing, while constant, is still too large to be practical, and the use of expanders in Siegel's technique also makes it not fully constructive. provides a scheme based on tabulation hashing that reaches high degrees of independence more quickly, in a more constructive way.He observes that using one round of simple tabulation hashing to expand the <b>input</b> <b>keys</b> to six times their original length, and then a second round of simple tabulation hashing on the expanded keys, results in a hashing scheme whose independence number is exponential in the parameter r, the number of bits per block in the partition of the keys into blocks.|$|E
