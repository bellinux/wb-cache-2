The game's demand eventually exceeded its supply. While Tecmo anticipated that the game would be a hit, they did not realize at the time its impact it would have in the video game industry, according to Kohler, [...] "with its groundbreaking use of cinematics".

French magazine Tilt appreciated the game's graphics and sound, but thought its animation did not fare as well. On the other hand, German magazine Aktueller Software Markt highly commended Slalom animations (particularly its use of scrolling and perspective) and thought its sounds were mediocre. The magazine found the game fun, though unrealistic. [...] and [...] similarly praised the animations. Though Gen 4 found the game unrealistic, they appreciated its depiction of speed and the gradual difficulty progression. Power Play liked the level and obstacle graphics. Gen 4 considered the graphics average for Nintendo, and disagreed internally as to whether the game was sufficiently fantastical. Power Play thought the game needed more variety and quickly became monotonous.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century until the mid-20th century, many wealthy {{individuals}} had pipe organs installed in their homes. Prior to the advent of recorded music, the organ was the only instrument able to provide a real approximation of orchestral music {{under the control of}} one performer, with sufficient volume to entertain a group of people. In Great Britain and Europe, and especially in America, a wealthy person's home was not considered complete without a pipe organ. The AEolian Organ Company in particular catered almost exclusively to this clientele. Many <b>house</b> <b>organs</b> were of modest size, with two manuals and 10 to 20 stops; however, the homes of the richest had organs that rivaled a cathedral organ in size. While many home organs began to have automatic player mechanisms (operating {{in a manner similar to}} the player piano roll system) from the 1890s, the highest artistic standard was, of course, a live performer. Members of the upper-class families, such as the Vanderbilts, Carnegies, Mellons, and Schwab had house concerts regularly for their friends to hear a performance by a noted artist on their pipe organ. Dependent on the taste of the host, these house concerts generally included very little [...] "legitimate" [...] organ music, and consisted mainly of arrangements of popular tunes, operatic overtures, and transcriptions of orchestral works. Several prominent organists such as Archer Gibson worked almost exclusively playing house parties. The <b>house</b> parties for <b>organ</b> music (and the organs installed for them) had a decline concurrent with the rise in availability of recorded music, there now being very few examples of <b>house</b> <b>organs</b> or <b>house</b> concerts with live organ music.|$|R

For Mr. Ross actually did work now and then, though his chief duty was to make an impression on old Mr. Pemberton, his sons, and the other big chiefs. Still, he did condescend to [...] "put his O. K." [...] on pictures, on copy and proof for magazine advertisements, car cards, window-display [...] "cut-outs," [...] and he dictated highly ethical reading matter for the <b>house</b> <b>organ,</b> which was distributed to ten thousand drug-stores, and which spoke well of honesty, feminine beauty, gardening, and Pemberton's. Occasionally he had a really useful idea, like the celebrated slogan, [...] "Pemberton's Means PURE," [...] which you see in every street-car, on every fourth or fifth bill-board. It is frequent as the [...] "In God We Trust" [...] on our coins, and at least as accurate.
