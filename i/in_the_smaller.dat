5|$|By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had {{discontinued}} Miss Moppet in its panorama format, and republished {{the story}} in a book format that year. Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a title page vignette of a mouse on all fours facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes be published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> Miss Moppet format.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> painting, Mary averts {{her eyes}} and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E
5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> number b.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> {{importance}} of <b>small</b> group activity {{has recently been}} emphasized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gifted education <b>in</b> science because of the increased needs to foster the human resources that could explore through the communication and collaboration. In this study, we investigated {{the characteristics of the}} verbal interaction according to the learning styles of <b>the</b> gifted-students <b>in</b> science <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group activity and examined how learning style affected the interaction within a group in order to seek an effective grouping strategy. The competition, cooperative, and dependent students with learning style <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 1 and the cooperative, cooperative, dependent students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 2 were assigned by the 6 science high school stu-dents. The analyses of the results revealed that <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 1 showed the asymmetric interaction of the low level, whereas <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 2 showed the symmetric interaction of <b>the</b> high level. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> frequencies of in-depth interaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 2 were higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 1, and also students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> group 2 were equally involve...|$|R

5|$|In Canada, {{the film}} {{released}} in 10 screens in 3 major cities along with special screenings for the Tamil diaspora <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> cities. In United Kingdom, the film debuted on the box-office list at No.9 with earnings of about £14,000 per screen {{and was the}} first Tamil film to enter UK Top 10. In United States, Sivaji was released in 24 screens with subsequent additions of 19 and 21 screens for the Tamil version and Telugu version respectively. The producers of the film claimed that the film was going to be dubbed in Chinese and Japanese by Ayngaran International, the holder of international rights of the film. The response in Cape Town was disappointing, while the box-office collections in Johannesburg and Durban allowed it to become the first Tamil film to feature in the South African box-office top 10. Singapore Airlines bought a 3-month exclusive in-flight screening rights to the film, a first for the airline for any Tamil film.|$|E
5|$|Metropolitan Norway {{is divided}} into 27 police {{district}}s. Each district is further subdivided into local police stations and rural police districts, the latter led by a sheriff. Each police district is headquartered at a main police station and is led by a chief of police. Police districts hold a common pool of resources and personnel and have a common administration and budget. Each also has a joint operations center which also acts as an emergency call center for 112. Many of the larger districts have their own execution and enforcement authority, while this in integrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> districts. The size of the police districts varies, from Oslo with 2,500 employees and covering a population of 570,000 to Eastern Finnmark which has 160 employees and 30,000 residents.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>small</b> {{intestine}} {{is where}} most chemical digestion takes place. Many of the digestive enzymes that act <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine are secreted by the pancreas and liver and enter <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine via <b>the</b> pancreatic duct. Pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder enter <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> hormone cholecystokinin, which is produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> presence of nutrients. Secretin, another hormone produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine, causes additional {{effects on the}} pancreas, where it promotes the release of bicarbonate into <b>the</b> duodenum <b>in</b> order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach.|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{obesity is}} a known {{risk factor for}} {{metabolic}} syndrome. However, {{little is known about}} pathological changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine associated with chronic obesity. This study investigated cellular and subcellular level changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice. In this study, a mouse model of obesity was established by early postnatal administration of monosodium glutamate. Changes in body weight were monitored, and pathological changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining and light and electron microscopy. Consequently, obese mice were significantly heavier compared with controls from 9 weeks of age. Villi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice were elongated and thinned. There was reduced hematoxylin staining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> epithelium of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice. Electron microscopy revealed a significant decrease in and shortening of rough endoplasmic reticulum in epithelial cells of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine of obese mice compared with normal mice. <b>The</b> decrease <b>in</b> rough endoplasmic reticulum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine epithelial cells of obese mice indicates that obesity starting in childhood influences various functions of <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine, such as protein synthesis, and could impair both the defense mechanism against invasion of pathogenic microbes and nutritional absorption...|$|R
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} Fiji, {{where it is}} found on the four largest islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Kadavu) and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> western islands of the Mamanuca and the Yasawa groups. It is {{uncommon}} but widespread, found in both forested and open habitats, from sea level to at least 1,200m (3,900ft) on Viti Levu. It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands. It has adapted well to man-made habitats, and is seen in grasslands, pasture, rice paddies, parks and gardens. Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds, but American ornithologist Jared Diamond has suggested that in the central Pacific, {{where there are no}} seed-eating munias occupying the open habitats, species such as Vanuatu's blue-faced parrotfinch and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{crews of}} the American {{merchant}} vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, Experiment, {{was a much}} more powerful vessel. Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton Experiment was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven barges crewed by 40 to 50 men each <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels. These barges were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel. The Haitian craft were each equipped {{with a mix of}} swivel guns and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms. In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more barges and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 barges and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did not know this during the attack. Individually the Haitian barges presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking en masse they could easily overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.|$|E

5|$|The final part of {{the supply}} chain for {{domestic}} and smaller commercial customers involved the delivery of ice, typically using an ice wagon. In the U.S., ice was cut into 25-, 50- and 100-pound blocks (11, 23 and 45kg) then distributed by horse-drawn ice wagons. An iceman, driving the cart, would then deliver the ice to the household, using ice tongs to hold the cubes. Deliveries could occur either daily or twice daily. By the 1870s, various specialist distributors existed in the major cities, with local fuel dealers or other businesses selling and delivering ice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> communities. In Britain, ice was rarely sold to domestic customers via specialist dealers during the 19th century, instead usually being sold through fishmongers, butchers and chemists, who kept ice on their premises for their own commercial use.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive power that is lacking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller,</b> cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{dramatic}} {{thrust of}} the early series is Lister's desire to return home to Earth, although the crew's ownership of an unlimited time-space travel drive in series seven was to partly negate this intention. As their journey begins, the not-so-intrepid crew encounters such phenomena as time distortions, faster-than-light travel, mutant diseases and strange lifeforms that had developed in the intervening millions of years. During the second series, the group encounter the service mechanoid Kryten, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appeared in one episode of series two, but {{by the beginning of}} series three he had become a regular character. At the end of series five, Red Dwarf itself is stolen by persons unknown, forcing the crew to travel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> Starbug craft for two series, with the side-effect that they lose contact with Holly. In series seven, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a long-standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension. Shortly afterwards, the crew encounters a parallel version of themselves from a universe in which Kristine Kochanski, Lister's long-term love interest, had been put into stasis {{at the time of the}} leak and so became the last remaining human. A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in the series' main universe, where she is forced to join the crew. At the end of series seven, we learn that Kryten's service nanobots, which had abandoned him years earlier, were behind the theft of the Red Dwarf at the end of series five.|$|E

Most food substances are absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine. However, even though alcohol can be absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach, it is mostly absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine because <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption. Once alcohol is absorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine, it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into <b>the</b> <b>small</b> intestine.
