5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a <b>generalisation</b> to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E

25|$|PDEs {{can be used}} to {{describe}} a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or quantum mechanics. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems, partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems. PDEs find their <b>generalisation</b> in stochastic partial differential equations.|$|E
25|$|Alternations between plain velars and palatals {{are common}} {{in a number of}} roots across {{different}} satem languages, but the same root appears with a palatal in some languages but a plain velar in others (most commonly Baltic or Slavic, occasionally Armenian but rarely or never the Indo-Iranian languages). That is consistent with the analogical <b>generalisation</b> of one or another consonant in an originally-alternating paradigm but difficult to explain otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Many issues {{damage the}} {{relationship}} of science {{to the media and}} the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians. As a very broad <b>generalisation,</b> many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in the United Kingdom include the controversy over the MMR inoculation, and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, Edwina Currie, for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with Salmonella.|$|E

25|$|Most Unionists in Northern Ireland are Protestants {{and most}} Nationalists are Catholics, but this <b>generalisation</b> (which {{is evident in}} the work of some commentators) is subject to {{significant}} qualifications. The Ulster Unionist Party, for example, has some Catholic members and supporters, such as Sir John Gorman, a respected former MLA.

25|$|Updike is {{a master}} of {{effortless}} motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide <b>generalisation,</b> from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style of narration, an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.|$|E
25|$|The {{conformal}} latitude {{defines a}} transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius {{such that the}} angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid {{is the same as}} the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of small elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the Transverse Mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a <b>generalisation</b> of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).|$|E

25|$|Le Sage {{was born}} in Geneva, his father was Georges-Louis Le Sage from Conques in Burgundy and his mother Anne Marie Gamp, a {{descendant}} of Théodore Agrippa d'Aubigné. His father, who {{was the author of}} many papers on various subjects, occupied his son of his own studies early, including the works of the Roman poet Lucretius at the age of 13. According to Pierre Prévost and some notices of Le Sage, the education by his parents in his early years was very strict, and Le Sage reacted to this by isolating himself and with meditation on various subjects. Contrary to his father, who allegedly only accepted facts and had little interest in <b>generalisation,</b> Le Sage was primarily interested in general and abstract principles.|$|E
25|$|French law prohibits {{publishing}} {{the results of}} opinion polls related to the election during {{the day of the}} election and the preceding day, so as to prevent undue influencing of the vote. No estimate can be given before Sunday 8pm, when the last voting office closes and official counts begin to be released. However, media from neighbouring countries, which are not bound by these regulations, have long broadcast estimates (Télévision Suisse Romande in particular). In 2007, the issue took a particular importance because of the <b>generalisation</b> of blogs and Internet pages. Journalist Jean-Marc Morandini stirred turmoil when he announced his intention of publishing results on his blog as soon as 18:00. Another problem was that the results from the voting offices in the Americas (consulates and French overseas possessions) were counted on Saturday night, and some began circulating rumours as to these results.|$|E
25|$|The second {{objective}} of the Synthetic Philosophy was to show that these same laws led inexorably to progress. In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge {{in the form of}} the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution. In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was in reality a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that Laplace's nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances (in Lewes' phrase) of 'one magnificent <b>generalisation</b> of progressive development.' Chambers was associated with Chapman's salon and his work served as the unacknowledged template for the Synthetic Philosophy.|$|E
