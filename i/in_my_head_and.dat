500|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Jocelyn Russell of Reckless carrying ammunition {{shells and}} other combat equipment was unveiled on July 26, 2013, in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, {{one day before}} the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There is a lock of her tail hair {{in the base of}} the statue. The statue's plaque includes a quote from Sergeant Harold Wadley, who served in battle alongside Sergeant Reckless: [...] "The spirit of her loneliness and her loyalty, in spite of the danger, was something else to behold. Hurting. Determined. And alone. That's the image I have imprinted <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> heart forever." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Middle," [...] {{the second}} single from the album, {{includes}} a guitar solo that, according to Adkins, [...] "is {{a tribute to}} Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices". Its lyrics speak about [...] "fitting in" [...] and self-acceptance of oneself. In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> I was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. I almost didn’t bring it to the band because I was thinking to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing. I can’t just use all these sort of alyrical whoahs for this much of a song.’" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Skipper Dan", a style {{parody of}} Weezer, was {{released}} on July 14, 2009. The song describes {{a man who has}} a fine arts degree and dreamed of pursuing an acting career, but is forced to work as a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland. Yankovic later explained in an interview with The A.V. Club that the song was [...] "a bit more poignant [...] bittersweet [...] than what I usually write." [...] He was inspired to write the song after going on a ride on the Disneyland Jungle Cruise with his family. During the cruise, one of the tour guides referred to his failed acting career. Yankovic then noted that [...] "the bells went off <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I thought, [...] "Well, here's a song right here."" ...|$|E

500|$|Mars {{started writing}} the song {{while he was}} on The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, [...] "I was just writing to write. I had my guitar with me on tour when I was in the States. I never {{finished}} it", he explained. Afterwards he got a call to provide something to the soundtrack, the singer saw some scenes of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] and thought to himself [...] "that song I started might be perfect for this". He admitted to have the tune halfway done before visualizing an early cut of the film and, inspired by its characters, put together the finishing touches. In an interview with Billboard, he went on detail [...] "I just had this melody <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> basically laid it down after I saw the film." [...] He had to watch [...] "most of the movie" [...] to feel [...] "the vibe", as well as its direction.|$|E
500|$|The film {{rights for}} The Time Traveler's Wife were optioned by Brad Pitt's {{production}} company Plan B Entertainment, {{in association with}} New Line Cinema, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked {{about the prospect of}} her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, [...] "I've got my little movie that runs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me." [...] In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. [...] For example, The New York Times wrote that the film was an [...] "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".|$|E
500|$|Wan {{pitched the}} idea to Whannell of two men chained to {{opposite}} sides of a bathroom with a dead body {{in the middle of}} the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. [...] "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," [...] Whannell said.|$|E

500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E

2500|$|Zimmer {{was born}} in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany. As a young child, he lived in Königstein-Falkenstein, where he played the piano at home but had piano lessons only briefly as he disliked the {{discipline}} of formal lessons. In one of his Reddit AMAs, he said [...] "My formal training was 2 week(s) of piano lessons. I {{was thrown out of}} 8 schools. But I joined a band. I am self-taught. But I've always heard music <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> I'm a child of the 20th century; computers came in very handy." [...] He moved to London as a teenager, where he attended Hurtwood House school.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I {{think we have a}} very clear idea where that would head. It's certainly not in the same template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. The most I could say about it, what's <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea. As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open." [...] Also during May, Craig Mazin, who co-wrote The Hangover Part II, entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E

2500|$|Goulding {{explained}} that the album [...] "is made up of songs that all started on a guitar {{over a period of}} about two years. A number of the songs vent romantic victories and failures." [...] She revealed that the first song she ever wrote, [...] "Wish I Stayed", is featured on the album. She met chief producer Starsmith after moving to Bromley, London from her home in Hereford. In an interview, she explained, [...] "Meeting Starsmith was a godsend. We're like brother and sister. We fight a lot but you can't get anywhere without creative tension." [...] Goulding worked with producers Starsmith, Frankmusik, Fraser T Smith, Richard Stannard and Ash Howes. The majority of the album was recorded in Starsmith's bedroom in Bromley, London. She told the Daily Star, [...] "Though I write on guitar, I hear the entire sound of songs <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> Fin [...] is someone who understands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
