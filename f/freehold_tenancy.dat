In France, serfdom had been in decline {{for at least three}} centuries by the start of the Revolution, replaced by various forms of <b>freehold</b> <b>tenancy.</b> The last vestiges of serfdom were officially ended on August 4, 1789 with a decree abolishing the feudal rights of the nobility.|$|E

The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R
