5|$|In {{the spring}} of 498BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, {{accompanied}} by five from Eretria, set sail for Ionia. They <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with the main Ionian force near Ephesus. Declining to personally lead the force, Aristagoras appointed his brother Charopinus and another Milesian, Hermophantus, as generals.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the minefield. Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E

The previous day, they attempted to play a surprise set at a free anti-RNC concert at the Minnesota Capitol in St. Paul, but were prevented from doing so by the police. Instead, de la Rocha and Morello rapped and sang through a megaphone. Later that evening, Morello and Boots Reilly <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with Billy Bragg and Jim Walsh for a three-hour jam session at Pepitos Parkway theater in south Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December, in {{response}} to reports that the Turks had evacuated El Arish, the regiment started moving overnight towards the village. Advance patrols discovered that the Turks had withdrawn along the Wadi el Arish to Magdhaba. By dawn 23 December the regiment reached the wadi and <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> {{with the rest of}} the division, now heading towards Magdhaba.|$|E
5|$|On Russell's Top the Auckland Mounted Rifles {{were in a}} {{precarious}} position; their trenches were still far from being fully constructed, and three saps heading towards The Nek {{had yet to be}} <b>joined</b> <b>up.</b> The 19th Division, using hand grenades, attacked the New Zealanders' position in three waves. The Wellington Mounted Rifles to the north were able to bring their machine-guns to bear on the attackers. The flanking fire caused devastation amongst the Turkish ranks. At the same time the Aucklands charged them in a counter-attack, forcing the survivors to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with the Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, {{but some of}} their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|About 19:00 on 7 April, German {{units in}} regimental {{strength}} {{with a few}} tanks began to cross the Drava near Barcs in the divisional sector. They quickly overcame {{the resistance of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment, which was influenced by Ustaše propaganda. The border guards abandoned their positions and weapons and retreated to Virovitica. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the division had mobilised in Bjelovar and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. That night, Croat members of the regiment revolted, arresting the Serb officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar, where it <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April.|$|E

5|$|After being {{tracked by}} both Manchester United and Manchester City, {{he began his}} {{professional}} career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract {{at the age of}} 17. Following the departure of manager Steve Bruce, Burge was released by Birmingham in March 2008. He went on trial at League Two club Hereford United and League One side Cheltenham Town. He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his time there was disrupted by appendicitis, which ruled him out for four weeks. The club released him in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the Spartans, but the cities of Athens and Eretria agreed to support the rebellion. In the spring of 498BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, {{for a total of}} twenty-five triremes set sail for Ionia. They <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.|$|E

5|$|By February 1794 {{the still}} decommissioned, Marseillois had been renamed Vengeur du Peuple, {{probably}} {{a response to}} the participation of the city of Marseille in the Federalist revolts of 1793. She was recommissioned in Rochefort, and on 24 March 1794, Captain Jean François Renaudin took command. On 1 April 1794, she sailed to Île-d'Aix, where she <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with Pelletier, and on 11 April, the squadron sailed on again, reaching Brest on 18 April, having been joined en route by Jemmapes. Upon their arrival the ships were assigned to the squadron under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009–10 English winter, Buttler toured {{with the}} England Under-19 team. He <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with the squad in Bangladesh {{following}} Somerset's elimination from the Champions League Twenty20 for the seven-match youth ODI series. As with his previous appearance for the Under-19s, Buttler played as a specialist batsman, {{but failed to}} make a significant impact until the final match when he scored 42 runs, though Bangladesh still won the match to claim the series 5–2. He remained with the team for the Under-19 World Cup, where he played {{all but one of}} England's six matches, keeping wicket in three of them. He scored 91 runs in three innings, with a top-score of 78 against India in the fifth-place play-off semi-final. His batting average of 30.33 ranked him fifth on the England team.|$|E
5|$|Guest <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901. He {{was given}} the rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success. He was {{recommended}} for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, whose Colonel decided that Guest {{was too young to}} lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older than him. Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served {{until the end of the}} war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer farm buildings and crops, and detaining women and children in concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|In 1695 {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} decided to act upon {{a plan to}} connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors from Santa Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle, and <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and {{the other}} Salonul Independenților {{initiators}} <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with author Ioan Bacalbașa and architect Ștefan Ciocâlteu. This diverse group established Societatea Ileana, an association dedicated to supporting innovative artists. Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, {{as well as by}} the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people. Despite such consolidation, various Ileana affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with Stănescu's official section.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{in early}} 348 BC, the Olynthians appealed for help again. The Athenians sent Charidemos, a former general of Kersebleptes {{who had been}} adopted as an Athenian citizen, with 4000 peltasts, 150 cavalry and 18 triremes; of the triremes, 10 were {{probably}} already in his service, and the other 8 may have been those sent to Chares in 349 BC. Charidemus <b>joined</b> <b>up</b> with the Olynthians, and together they attacked the former territory of Olynthos in western Chalkidike. Finally, just before the final siege of Olynthos started, the Olynthians appealed a last time for aid. The Athenians prepared to send a force of citizen hoplites, but they were delayed by the weather, {{probably due to the}} Etesian winds, and arrive too late to achieve anything.|$|E
