40|$|Glyceric acid (GA), an {{unfamiliar}} biotechnological product, is currently produced {{as a small}} by-product of dihydroxyacetone production from glycerol by Gluconobacter oxydans. We developed a method for the efficient biotechnological production of GA as a target compound for new surplus glycerol applications in the biodiesel and oleochemical industries. We investigated the ability of 162 acetic acid bacterial strains to produce GA from glycerol {{and found that the}} patterns of productivity and enantiomeric GA compositions obtained from several strains differed significantly. The growth parameters of two different strain types, Gluconobacter frateurii NBRC 103465 and Acetobacter tropicalis NBRC 16470, were optimized using a jar fermentor. G. frateurii accumulated 136. 5 g/liter of GA with a 72 % d-GA enantiomeric excess (ee) in the culture broth, whereas A. tropicalis produced 101. 8 g/liter of d-GA with a 99 % ee.

The four major sample preparation steps for 2 -DE: (a) cell disruption: i. e. sonication and homogenization with glass beads; (b) protein extraction: i. e. sequential and independent extraction procedures; (c) pre-electrophoretic treatment: these included (i) treatment with RNAase/DNAase or benzonase; (ii) ultracentrifugation to sediment large macromolecules such as DNA; (iii) <b>desalting</b> and concentration <b>by</b> ultrafiltration through a Microcon centrifugal filter device (MWCO: 3000 daltons); and (iv) <b>desalting</b> <b>by</b> a micro BioSpin chromatography column (MWCO: 6000 daltons); and (d) rehydration buffers, reducing agents and sample application in the first dimension isoelectric focussing were studied. Our results showed that sonication is easy to perform and resulted in a higher protein yield. Among the four extraction buffers, the urea containing buffers resulted in the extraction of the highest amount of protein while tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane buffers and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) /acetone precipitation allowed detection of a higher number of protein species (i. e. protein spots). <b>Desalting</b> <b>by</b> BioSpin and ultrafiltration have improved the 2 -DE resolution of the water soluble fraction but have less effect on urea containing fractions. TCA/acetone precipitation was able to desalt all protein fractions independent of the extraction media, however extended exposure to this low pH medium has caused protein modification. Introduction of either DNase/RNase or benzonase treatment did not improve the discriminatory power of the 2 -DE but this treatment did yield 2 -DE with the clearest background. Proteolytic digestion was inhibited by addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail. Taken overall, a combination of sequential extraction and <b>desalting</b> <b>by</b> BioSpin chromatography for sample treatment before first dimension of 2 -DE gave best results based on its simplicity and minimal protein loss.

40|$|The water {{recovery}} of nanofiltration {{in drinking water}} production is limited to 80 - 85 %. When the {{water recovery}} is increased, {{there is a risk}} of scaling of sparingly soluble salts, such as CaSO 4 or CaCO 3, onto the membrane surface. There is a need for robust technologies that handle the problem of mineral scaling in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, allowing operation at higher recoveries, i. e., with a higher production of potable water. In this study, the retentate stream of a nanofiltration unit was therefore desalinated <b>by</b> <b>electrodialysis.</b> Two different ion exchange membrane pairs, namely AMX-CMX (Neosepta, Japan) and FTAM-FTCM (Fumasep, Germany) were used for this purpose.

The economic feasibility of retentate treatment <b>by</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> is discussed as well. The FTAM anion exchange membranes of Fumasep were able to remove sulphate ions faster, relative to chloride or nitrate ions. This is unexpected, because sulphate ions have a high hydrated ionic radius and steric hindrance typically obstructs their transport through anion exchange membranes, as is the case with the AMX membranes. This feature makes the FTAM membranes appropriate for the desalination of retentate streams of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, in water recycling applications.
