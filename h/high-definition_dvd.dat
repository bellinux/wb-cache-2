2500|$|At {{the end of}} June 2005, Sun Microsystems, the {{developer}} of Java, announced that the Blu-ray Association had chosen the Java-based BD-J interactivity layer instead of Microsoft's HDi. At the same time, Microsoft and Toshiba jointly announced that they would cooperate in developing <b>high-definition</b> <b>DVD</b> players. In a top-level meeting in July, Microsoft's Bill Gates argued that the Blu-ray standard had to change to [...] "work more smoothly with personal computers". [...] The Blu-ray Disc's representatives defended the technology.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, Neumark began {{studying}} the optical properties of wide bandgap semiconductors and developed diodes capable {{of using the}} upper range of the spectrum and serving as a superior light source. The new short-wavelength LEDs,emitting blue, green, violet and ultraviolet light, {{turned out to be}} much more energy efficient, reliable and long-lived while the short-wavelength-emitting laser diodes could store vastly more information more compactly.This new technology lent itself {{to a wide variety of}} applications, from billboards and traffic lights to hand-held mobile devices and <b>high-definition</b> <b>DVD</b> players. Her research led to remarkable advances in the field of electronics, including establishing blue, green, and ultraviolet LEDs as common components in electronics.|$|E
40|$|With the {{incandescent}} bulb {{beaten in}} terms of efficiency, and fluorescent lighting in its sights, wide bandgap semiconductors are looking for new territories to conquer. One direction to go is higher power and coherence, and blue-violet nitride-based laser diodes are now coming into commission in <b>high-definition</b> <b>DVD</b> (HD-DVD) and Blu-ray optical storage systems offering up to 25 gigabytes on a single layer. Another course is that towards shorter wavelengths â€“ into the ultraviolet (UV) ...|$|E
