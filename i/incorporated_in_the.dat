5|$|Other {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} in fleet actions, only broadsides were effective, thus maximizing {{the number of}} centerline guns was the most efficient approach. While neither approach was <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi class, the centerline maximum broadside concept was followed in all subsequent U.S. battleship designs.|$|E
5|$|The archipelago's remote {{location}} and oceanic climate are matched in the UK {{only by a}} few smaller outlying islands such as the Flannan Isles, North Rona, Sula Sgeir, and the Bishop's Isles at {{the southern edge of}} the Outer Hebrides. Administratively, St Kilda was part of the parish of Harris in the traditional county of Inverness-shire.

5|$|While {{designing}} Oblivions {{landscape and}} architecture, developers worked from personal travel photographs, nature books, texture images, and reference photographs. Procedural content generation tools used in production {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind. Erosion algorithms <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> landscape generation tools allowed {{for the creation of}} craggy terrain quickly and easily, replacing Morrowinds artificially smoothed-over terrain.|$|E
5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig {{was one of}} the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and {{was given}} {{authority}} over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one of the rebels from joining the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised in a work on his life that was later <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2000 census other Christian {{minority}} communities included Neo-Pietism (0.44%), Pentecostalism (0.28%, mostly <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Schweizer Pfingstmission), Methodism (0.13%), the New Apostolic Church (0.45%), Jehovah's Witnesses (0.28%), other Protestant denominations (0.20%), the Old Catholic Church (0.18%), other Christian denominations (0.20%). Non-Christian religions are Hinduism (0.38%), Buddhism (0.29%), Judaism (0.25%) and others (0.11%); 4.3% {{did not make}} a statement. 21.4% in 2012 declared themselves as unchurched i.e. not affiliated with any church or other religious body (Agnostic, Atheist, or just not related to any official religion).|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E

5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it is <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in {{roughly the same}} proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Important {{features}} <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line include four loops (spirals) {{and four}} 'Z' reverses (zigzags). The introduction of bogie carriages {{allowed for the}} replacement of the basic four wheel carriages formerly used for support and stability. In 1897, a major earthquake damaged the railway requiring rebuilding of the route, including extensive improvements to the track and stations. Further modernization occurred as part of the Northeast Frontier Railway Zone. Most trains on the route are still powered by steam engines, although a modern diesel engine is used for the Darjeeling Mail train. The railway is notable for its signage located at key vantage points, marking locations with titles such as Agony Point and Sensation Corner. Spirals located on steep hills are a feature of the railway that provide scenic views of the valleys below.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is {{a suite of}} noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have been designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a basic}} L-shaped tower {{built from}} tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was {{extended}} in a southerly direction {{by the addition of}} a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century. A staircase was inside the new tower and further structures were added to the south and north sides of the courtyard {{at this stage of the}} development. Replacement entrances were installed and the original first-floor doorway was closed off. Access on the west side was gained through a narrow round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south elevation.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes were {{building}} three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of Sveaborg {{when it was}} surrendered to the Russians in 1808, and all three were <b>incorporated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Russian Navy. Shortly afterward, the Russian Navy built its own 32-gun versions, with the final vessel launched as late as 1823. Two more were built in Sweden in 1809, Birger Jarl and Erik Segersäll. Birger Jarl sank in an accident in 1813 and Erik Segersäll was planned for conversion as a paddlewheel steam battery for coastal defense, though the idea was eventually abandoned and the ship scrapped in 1826.|$|E

40|$|Software {{clustering}} algorithms presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature rarely <b>incorporate</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clustering process dynamic information, such as {{the number}} of function invocations during runtime. Moreover, the structure of a software system is often multi-layered, while existing clustering algorithms often create flat system decompositions. This paper presents a software clustering algorithm called MULICsoft that <b>incorporates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clustering process both static and dynamic information. MULICsoft produces layered clusters with the core elements of each cluster assigned to the top layer. We present experimental results of applying MULICsoft to a large open-source system. Comparison with existing software clustering algorithms indicates that MULICsoft is able to produce decompositions that are close to those created by system experts. 1...|$|R
