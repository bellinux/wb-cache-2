Blumenthal whisks egg yolks with sugar until the sugar {{interacts with the}} proteins in the yolk, creating a network of proteins. The entire substance turns white, at which point flavouring can be added and cooked in. While stirring the mixture, Blumenthal cools it as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> using liquid nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Babb, {{who gained}} notoriety for his various {{marketing}} gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film. Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation {{twice a week}} in the same town; David F. Friedman, who would later use the film in his own double-billings, attributed the distribution plan to a film that was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Haganah {{forces in}} the area {{consisted}} of several units from the Barak (2nd) Battalion of the Golani Brigade, {{as well as the}} indigenous villagers, including a reduced Guard Corps (HIM) company at the Samakh (Tzemah) police station. This force was headed by the battalion commander's deputy, who was killed in action in the battle. On May 13, the battalion commander {{declared a state of emergency}} in the area from May 15 until further notice. He authorized his men to seize all necessary arms from the settlements and urged them to dig in and build fortifications as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> and to mobilize all the necessary work force to do so.|$|E

5|$|Three years later, a Macedonian {{fleet of}} 38 vessels was sent across by Philip V, while the larger {{warships}} sailed around Cape Malea. After his victory at Actium in 31BC, Octavian advanced as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> against Marc Antony by ordering {{part of his}} 260 Liburnians to be carried over the Isthmus. In 868AD, the Byzantine admiral Niketas Oryphas had his whole fleet of one hundred dromons dragged across the Isthmus in a quickly executed operation, but this took place most likely on a different route.|$|E
5|$|While Kline was {{concerned}} with lighting, print quality, and color, Bonnie Prendergast, the script supervisor, took notes that would be written up after the company had finished for the day. Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down. Assistant director Danny McCauley was responsible for collaborating with unit production manager Phil Rawlins to finalize shooting orders and assigning extras. Rawlins, McCauley, production manager Lindsley Parsons Jr., and Katzenberg were all tasked with keeping things moving as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> and keeping the budget under control; every hour on stage cost the production $4000.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the war two days earlier, the US forces were attempting to evacuate US civilians and diplomats from the city of Seoul, where a battle was ongoing between North and South Korean forces. Transport aircraft and ships, escorted by US fighter planes, were attempting to bring civilians out of the country as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> During these missions on June 27, US forces were attacked by North Korean aircraft in two separate incidents in the Seoul area. Despite being outnumbered, the better-built American aircraft outmaneuvered the North Koreans, quickly shooting down half of the attacking force.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts {{while she was}} working on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept trying to move development as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day that Observateur arrived off Basse-Terre, the frigate HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts had recaptured the {{merchant}} brig Ariel near La Désirade, taken by Roquebert's squadron two weeks earlier. Roberts also discovered two other ships in the distance to the north and had closed to investigate, discovering the French convoy. Darkness fell soon afterwards and Castor separated from the French ships, as Roberts sailed westwards as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to notify Ballard of his sighting, arriving at 04:00 on 17 December. In the aftermath of the destruction of Junon and the encounter with Castor, Roquebert decided to separate from the convoy and return to France, turning north with Clorinde and leaving the supply ships to make the journey to Guadeloupe independently. As a result, Loire and Seine were sailing unprotected straight towards Ballard's squadron.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Nhu {{began work}} on the ambitious Strategic Hamlet Program, an attempt to build {{fortified}} villages that would be secure zones for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Vietcong out {{so that they could}} not operate among the villagers. Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts that they were forced to build, he advised Nhu and Tuyến that it was imperative to build as many hamlets as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> This pleased the Vietcong, who felt that Thảo's efforts were turning the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo specifically had villages built in areas that he knew had a strong Vietcong presence. This increased the number of communist sympathisers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Vietcong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.|$|E
5|$|On 26March {{the brigade}} {{advanced}} further into Germany, with the 1st RUR and the 12th Devons leading. The only opposition was German rearguard actions, and they reached Rhade by that evening and Limbeck the following day. They crossed the Dortmund–Ems Canal at dawn on 2April, unopposed except for artillery fire. Later that day {{there was more}} resistance when they reached Lengerich. By 4April the brigade was moving forward as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> supported by the 4th (Armoured) Battalion, Grenadier Guards, part of the 6th Guards Tank Brigade. Steinhuder Meer was reached on 10April, then in the following days Ulzen and Lüneburg were captured. By 2May they had reached the River Elbe. Expecting it to be defended in force, the division attacked at once, trying to catch the defenders unaware. The attack was successful and the river was crossed over a pontoon bridge left intact by the retreating Germans. That afternoon the leading troops of the 3rd Parachute Brigade reached Mecklenburg and made contact with the leading men from the Russian Army advancing from the east. Later that day the brigade reached Wismar on the Baltic Sea, and remained there until 7May when news was received of the German surrender.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{was only}} in the Third XI of St. George at the time, but by December, he was in the First XI along with future Invincibles {{teammate}} Arthur Morris. The senior team was captained by Bill O'Reilly, a leg spin bowler who represented Australia in Tests and was regarded as the best bowler in the world. O'Reilly was a firm man and came to be a father figure for Lindwall. Lindwall came into the team seeing himself as an into-the-wind swing bowler. O'Reilly felt that pace bowlers were only useful for a few overs with new ball, so he instructed Lindwall to lengthen his run-up and bowl as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> O’Reilly also decided that the team needed more bowlers. He placed Lindwall low in the batting order, where he often did not get an opportunity to bat. Lindwall did not bother protesting, realising that dissent against the autocratic O’Reilly would be futile. O'Reilly also reversed Morris from a bowler into a batsman. Both Morris and Lindwall became world-leading players in the fields that O’Reilly chose for them. By the end of the 1938–39 season, Lindwall had not yet established himself as a cricketer. Former Test batsman Charlie Macartney lamented what he perceived as a lack of talent and substance at St. George. Lindwall returned to school, attempting to obtain his Leaving Certificate while also playing third-grade rugby. In July, Lindwall's father died, leaving him and his four siblings orphaned.|$|E

5|$|At 00:30 on 11 February the {{explosives}} were detonated {{and the western}} pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, {{the remainder of the}} Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed two miles from the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, {{with the exception of the}} Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to the rendezvous point.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this project}} a fault {{tolerant}} solution for a Network-On-Chip (NOC) is proposed. The faults included {{here are the}} transient fault and permanent fault.

Communication is possible only after the path is established between the required nodes/routers with no errors and reduced time. The aim of detecting faults is to establish a defined path <b>as</b> <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Single error can be corrected easily but when double error occurs one may need to take decision to establish a defined path. The double error is considered as permanent fault. The fault detection, hardware requirements and power consumptions are considered.
