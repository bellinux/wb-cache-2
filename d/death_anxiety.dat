25|$|Doughty's main {{inspiration}} for her advocacy work was the frequent {{absence of the}} decedents' families in the process, which she attributed to the Western <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> and death phobia. She wanted to encourage death acceptance, {{and a return to}} such practices as memento mori, reminders of one's own mortality, resulting in healthier grieving, mourning, and closure after the inevitable deaths of people around us, as well as starting a movement to broaden the funeral industry to offer more funeral options, such as natural burial, sky burial, alkaline hydrolysis (liquid cremation), or promession. Embalming began to dominate in the US after the Civil War. A century later, in the 1960s, Americans began to turn away from embalming and burial, as cremation became increasingly popular, so that today it is used in almost half of deaths in urban areas. Cremation is seen {{as a threat to the}} traditional funeral industry, but has a reputation as the more environmentally friendly option. This change can be traced to the lifting of the ban on cremation by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and to the publication in the same year of The American Way of Death by Jessica Mitford, documenting abuses in the funeral industry and criticizing the excessive cost of funerals. Mitford's book, and the movement it started, was one of Doughty's inspirations, but Doughty feels that while Mitford had the right target, the profit-driven funeral industry, Mitford erred in sharing the industry's, and the public's, unhealthy desire to push out of sight and avoid thinking about the corpse itself. Doughty seeks to build on Mitford's reforms but in a direction that embraces the reality of death and returns to funeral and mourning practices that include spending time with and having contact with the dead body itself.|$|E
500|$|After the {{departure}} of Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin auditioned fifteen drummers, of whom Chad Szeliga stood out for his ability as a stage performer {{and the fact that}} he had [...] "serious problem-solving skills", according to Burnley. The group's next album, Phobia, was again produced by Bendeth and was the first to be recorded with Szeliga. The concept of the album is dedicated to Burnley's various phobias. The cover of the album depicts a winged man suspended over a runway, which represents the singer's fear of flying. Burnley also suffers from <b>death</b> <b>anxiety,</b> a fear of the dark, driving anxiety, and hypochondriasis. Burnley cites his fear of flying as for why he did not perform overseas, saying, [...] "I'll go as far as a boat will take me", though at the time the band's record label had not facilitated travel by boat. Phobias [...] "Intro" [...] and [...] "Outro" [...] tracks feature sound effects of an airport intercom, airplane turbulance, car doors, and crowd panic.|$|E

50|$|As a whole, {{the third}} and fourth phases of Langs' work have not been met with the {{interest}} or enthusiasm of his first two phases. Langs acknowledged this state of affairs, but also suggested {{that at least some of}} the lukewarm reception of his work might have been due to the unpleasantness of the message, namely, that the roots of psychic conflict are in death-related trauma and anxiety, requiring therefore of both patient and therapist that they face their own <b>death</b> <b>anxieties</b> head-on.|$|R
50|$|Cases {{in which}} rage is {{exhibited}} {{as a direct}} response to an individual's deeply held religious beliefs, may directly be related to cognitive dissonance in relation to an individual's ability to manage the terror associated with death and dying. Many researchers have questioned whether Buddhist concepts, such as reincarnation and nibbâna, help ease <b>death</b> <b>anxieties.</b> Coleman and Ka-Ying Hui (2012) stated that “according to the Terror Management Theory, a religious concept of an afterlife helps people manage their personal death anxiety” (949). This suggests that rage, in relation to religious ideas, may stem from an inability to manage feelings of terror.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a psychoanalytic perspective on The Simpsons' satirical representations of apocalyptic mythologies. I argue that The Simpsons' representation of eschata reveals the function {{and maintenance of}} an apocalyptic archetype. The function of the archetype relates to the cultural management of <b>death</b> <b>anxieties</b> and the realisation of life. The maintenance of the archetype involves an adaptive cycle of mythologisation, demythologisation, and remythologisation in dynamic cultural contexts. The animated satire offers {{a window into the}} fragile complementarity between 'mythos and logos' in popular western visions of the apocalypse. Throughout the chapter, I locate the function and maintenance of the apocalyptic archetype in the millennial American milieu...|$|R
2500|$|Robert Langs: More recently, {{adaptive}} psychotherapist and psychoanalyst Robert Langs {{has used}} archetypal theory {{as a way}} of understanding the functioning of what he calls the [...] "deep unconscious system". Langs' use of archetypes particularly pertains to issues associated with <b>death</b> <b>anxiety,</b> which Langs takes to be the root of psychic conflict. Like Jung, Langs thinks of archetypes as species-wide, deep unconscious factors.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community and philosophy of science communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the science of happiness to <b>death</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various [...] aspects of life and reality, such as the Big Bang, the origin of life, and evolution, and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologists {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear and empirical research on this topic has been equivocal. Religiosity {{can be related to}} fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. [...] "Intrinsic religiosity", as opposed to mere [...] "formal religious involvement" [...] {{has been found to be}} negatively correlated with <b>death</b> <b>anxiety.</b> In a 1976 study people of various Christian denominations those most firm in their faith, attending religious services weekly were the least afraid of dying. The survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and [...] "religious concern".|$|E
40|$|Rooted in the {{writings}} of existentialists, terror management theory states that the awareness of death has the potential to create debilitating anxiety and compromise psychological well-being and that psychological buffers (e. g., self-worth) protect against these aversive effects. Hundreds of studies have supported the theory. However, until recently, little work has focused on the central assertion that the awareness of <b>death</b> causes <b>anxiety</b> and undermines well-being. We review a recent program of research that fills this critical void in the literature. This work has demonstrated that experimentally heightening the awareness of <b>death</b> increases <b>anxiety</b> and decreases well-being for individuals who lack appropriate psychological buffers. <br/...|$|R

2500|$|Anxiety is {{an emotion}} {{characterized}} by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent <b>death.</b> <b>Anxiety</b> {{is not the same}} as fear, which is a response to a [...] real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat. Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration. Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Pit and the Pendulum" [...] is a {{study of}} the effect terror has on the narrator, {{starting}} with the opening line, which suggests that he is already suffering from <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> ("I was sick — sick unto death with that long agony"). However, there is an implicit irony in the reference to the black-robed judges having lips [...] "whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words," [...] which shows that he has survived and is writing the story after the events. Unlike much of Poe's work, the story has no supernatural elements. The [...] "realism" [...] of the story is enhanced through Poe's focus on reporting : the dungeon is airless and unlit, the narrator is subject to thirst and starvation, he is swarmed by rats, the razor-sharp pendulum threatens to slice into him and the closing walls are red-hot. The narrator experiences the blade mostly through sound as it [...] "hissed" [...] while swinging. Poe emphasizes this element of sound with such words as [...] "surcingle," [...] "cessation," [...] "crescent," [...] and [...] "scimitar", and various forms of literary consonance.|$|E
2500|$|Second is a {{rejection}} of the modernist [...] "Utopian gesture", evident in Van Gogh, of the transformation through art of misery into beauty whereas in the postmodernism movement the object world has undergone a [...] "fundamental mutation" [...] so that it has [...] "now become a set of texts or simulacra" [...] (Jameson 1993:38). Whereas modernist art sought to redeem and sacralize the world, to give life to world (we might say, following Graff, to give the world back the enchantment that science and the decline of religion had taken away from it), postmodernist art bestows upon the world a [...] "deathly quality… whose glacéd X-ray elegance mortifies the reified eye of the viewer {{in a way that would}} seem to have nothing to do with death or the death obsession or the <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> on the level of content" [...] (ibid.). Graff sees the origins of this transformative mission of art in an attempted substitution of art for religion in giving meaning to the world that the rise of science and Enlightenment rationality had removed – but in the postmodern period this is seen as futile.|$|E
40|$|Death {{drives the}} {{contemporary}} American novel and its {{market in the}} late- 20 th and early 21 st-century. To help illustrate this, we consider Don DeLillo’s White Noise from 1985 and Cormac McCarthy’s The Road from 2006 for something that Walter Benjamin [...] famously quoted as saying “Death is the sanction of everything the story-teller can tell" [...] may have failed to appreciate: while the location and visibility of Death may change in society, the American mania over mortality cannot be so easily displaced or dispatched, especially in literature. Death no longer lies {{at the center of}} a narrative but has been internalized, as it were, by the fictional characters that mimic real-life mortality for readers themselves to emulate. The characters of a novel engage in thanatomimesis, in protagonist hero-modeling, so that readers have a system by which to manage their own <b>death</b> <b>anxieties...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{third phase}} in Langs' work, {{stretching}} roughly from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, {{was motivated by}} {{a new set of}} clinical puzzles. The immediate clinical issue for Langs was that, on the one hand, patients in secured-frame therapy settings—i.e. unconsciously validated therapy with an ideal set of ground rules—tended to encode images validating both the therapy and the frame. On the other hand, these same patients appeared to flee from secured-frame therapy and the boundaries it requires, often ending therapy abruptly and without warning. According to him, when the anxieties these patients unconsciously communicated were decoded, it appeared that existential <b>death</b> <b>anxieties</b> were {{at the root of the}} patients' reactions. These factors entailed a set of puzzles requiring some level of resolution, including why the mind would react against what it knows unconsciously to be healing? And why indeed is there such a discrepancy between consciousness and the unconscious, such that consciously one is fleeing therapy which unconsciously is perceived to be healing? Indeed, why is there any differentiation between conscious and unconscious at all? ...|$|R
50|$|Predation or {{predator}} <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{is a form}} of <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{that arises}} from an individual physically and/or mentally harming another.

This guilt, in turn, motivates and encourages a variety of self made decisions and actions by the perpetrator of harm to others.|$|E
50|$|The {{connection}} between <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> and one's sex {{appears to be}} strong. Studies show that females {{tend to have more}} <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> than males. Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60. The <b>Death</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men. Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> scales than men.|$|E

50|$|It is {{apparent}} that Hossain's description of <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential <b>death</b> <b>anxiety,</b> which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> strongly correlates behavioral changes, pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance {{between life and death}} peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> evolved in the society through time based on his analysis {{of the history of the}} West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{studies have}} found {{a strong sense of}} {{religion}} in a person’s life can be related to a lower sense of anxiety towards the death. Although there has been no association discovered between religiosity and <b>death</b> <b>anxiety,</b> it has also been shown that <b>death</b> <b>anxiety</b> tends to be lower in individuals who regularly attend religious meetings or gatherings. On a recent study, one hundred and sixty-five church participants have been asked to fill out the [...] "Intrinsic Religious Motivation Scale, the Revised <b>Death</b> <b>Anxiety</b> Scale" [...] and the results were analyzed using factor analyses, Pearson correlation, and linear and quadratic regression. All found an inverse relationship between intrinsic religious motivation and <b>death</b> <b>anxiety.</b> In short, the more religious you are, the less anxious you are about death because you may associate death with another beginning that is promised through many religions.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} to {{reconstruct}} a clinical {{case in the}} context of a medical institution taking care of hemato-oncology patients. This reconstruction is shaped by a psychoanalytical and differential approach based on a structural and subjective logic. More specifically, in the case of Mr V, we explore the self-other relationship in paranoia and its implications on the position of the clinician and the caregiving team in the transference process so that the subject may be best supported during the great physical and psychical suffering experienced at the end of life. We show how a differential approach is required from the very onset of the sessions to enable the clinician to be a bearable conversant, even during the radicalization of the paranoiac's approach to the other. We further indicate how a contingent configuration - the worsening of the patient's somatic state - and the appropriate medical response it elicits, constitutes triggers that promote the radicalization of the subject's paranoia. We emphasize both the ethical and operational implications of a differential approach to the subjective logics of oncological patients for whom violent bodily insults as well as <b>death</b> <b>anxieties</b> are daily occurrences. Our discussion highlights how the exploration of such clinical cases enables connecting their constituents with the psychoanalytical concepts developed by Freud and Lacan in the field of psychosis and paranoia and demonstrates both their richness and effectiveness in clinical practice. © 2012 Springer Verlag.
