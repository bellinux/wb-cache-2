This was shown in illustrations in his book. The significant Franklin theory introduced to Collinson in a letter dated April 29, 1747, was the concept of the [...] "dissectible condenser." [...] Today we call this <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> in a device, a capacitor. He observed that a charge was built up on both sides between a piece of nonconducting material. In the case of the Leyden jar this was glass (nonconducting matter) and on each side of it was a metal material (conducting matter). These opposite metal layers had the exact opposite electric charges (positive and negative). He observed that when the wire {{on the inside of the}} jar was electrised positively by a certain amount, that the outer conductor simultaneously became electrised negatively in the same proportion.|$|E
