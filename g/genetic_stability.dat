Therefore, if there was an organism that used uracil in DNA, the deamination of cytosine (which undergoes base pairing with guanine) would lead to formation of uracil (which would base pair with adenine) during DNA synthesis.|$|E

To investigate membrane fusion as {{a requirement}} for virus growth, we introduced 27 unique mutations into the fusion peptide of an infectious cDNA clone of dengue 2 virus and recovered seven stable mutant viruses. The fusion efficiency of the mutants was impaired, demonstrating {{for the first time}} the requirement for specific FP AAs in optimal fusion. Mutant viruses exhibited different growth kinetics and/or <b>genetic</b> <b>stabilities</b> in different cell types and adult mosquitoes. Virus particles could be recovered following RNA transfection of cells with four lethal mutants; however, recovered viruses could not re-infect cells.

Mutations of the FP also resulted in reduced virus reactivity with flavivirus group-reactive antibodies, confirming earlier reports using virus-like particles...|$|R

All vectors were stably maintained in the lacF strain NZ 3000 when grown on lactose, and only the high-level expression vectors showed some instability when their host was grown on glucose-containing medium. The application potentials of the expression vectors carrying the lacF marker were determined by cloning of the promoterless Escherichia coli gusA reporter gene under control of the lacA promoter followed by analysis of its expression.

Vaccination against all serotypes is necessary to protect susceptible animals and to prevent onward spread of the virus by insect vectors. In our previous studies, we generated replication-deficient (DISC) virus strains for a number of serotypes and reported preliminary data on their protective efficacy in animals. In this report, to advance the DISC vaccines to the marketplace, we investigated different parameters of these DISC vaccines. First, we demonstrated the <b>genetic</b> <b>stabilities</b> of these vaccine strains and also the complementing cell line. Subsequently, the optimal storage conditions of vaccines, including additives, temperature and desiccation were determined and their protective efficacies in animals confirmed. Further, to test if mixtures of different vaccine strains could be tolerated, we tested cocktails of DISC vaccines in combinations of three or six different serotypes in sheep and cattle, the two natural hosts of BTV. Groups of sheep vaccinated with a cocktail of six different vaccines were completely protected from challenge with individual virulent serotypes, both in early challenge or after five months' challenge without any clinical disease. There was no interference in protection between the different vaccines. Protection was also achieved in cattle with a mixture of three vaccine strains, albeit at a lesser level than sheep.

40|$|Replicative fitness of {{poliovirus}} can be modulated systematically by {{replacement of}} preferred capsid region codons with synonymous unpreferred codons. To determine the key genetic contributors to fitness reduction, we introduced {{different sets of}} synonymous codons into the capsid coding region of an infectious clone derived from the type 2 prototype strain MEF- 1. Replicative fitness in HeLa cells, measured by plaque areas and virus yields in single-step growth experiments, decreased sharply with increased frequencies of the dinucleotides CpG (suppressed in higher eukaryotes and most RNA viruses) and UpA (suppressed nearly universally). Replacement of MEF- 1 capsid codons with the corresponding codons from another type 2 prototype strain (Lansing), a randomization of MEF- 1 synonymous codons, increased the %G+C without increasing CpG, and reductions in the effective number of codons used had much smaller individual effects on fitness. Poliovirus fitness was reduced to the threshold of viability when CpG and UpA dinucleotides were saturated within and across synonymous codons of a capsid region interval representing only ∼ 9 % of the total genome. Codon replacements were associated with moderate decreases in total virion production but large decreases in the specific infectivities of intact poliovirions and viral RNAs. Replication of codon replacement viruses, but not MEF- 1, was temperature sensitive at 39. 5 °C. Synthesis and processing of viral intracellular proteins were largely unaltered in most codon replacement constructs. Replacement of natural codons with synonymous codons with increased frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides may offer a general approach {{to the development of}} attenuated vaccines with well-defined antigenicities and very high <b>genetic</b> <b>stabilities...</b>|$|R

The longitudinal stability and change of deviant peer affiliation were explained by genetic and nonshared environmental factors. The results also revealed that the genetic variance for deviant peer affiliation is higher in the families with harsher parenting. This amplified genetic risk underscores the role of harsh parenting in the selection and socialization process of deviant peer relationships...|$|R
