40|$|Abstract Human {{resources}} for health (HRH) {{will have to}} be strengthened if universal health coverage (UHC) is to be achieved. Existing health workforce benchmarks focus exclusively on the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians,</b> nurses and midwives and were developed with the objective of attaining relatively high coverage of skilled birth attendance and other essential health services of relevance to the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, the attainment of UHC will depend not only on the availability of adequate numbers of health workers, but also on the distribution, quality and performance of the available health workforce. In addition, as noncommunicable diseases grow in relative importance, the inputs required from health workers are changing. New, broader health-workforce benchmarks – and a corresponding monitoring framework – therefore need to be developed and included in the agenda for UHC to catalyse attention and investment in this critical area of health systems. The new benchmarks need to reflect the more diverse composition of the health workforce and the participation of community health workers and mid-level health workers, and they must capture the multifaceted nature and complexities of HRH development, including equity in accessibility, sex composition and quality...|$|E

40|$|Objective In India, {{heterogeneous}} {{healthcare providers}} {{in the public}} and dominant private sectors serve a diverse population, including those from vulnerable groups, the scheduled castes and tribes. We explored relationships between the distribution of different categories of healthcare providers (public and private); and contextual socioeconomic and demographic variables. Access to healthcare providers for scheduled castes and tribes was specifically studied. Method Set in Madhya Pradesh province (60. 4 million), India. Dependent variables included district-wise <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> and paramedics (public and private separately); and unqualified providers (private). Contextual variables included infrastructure, urbanization, economy, female literacy and proportion of scheduled castes and tribes. Results Urbanization was strongly correlated with private physician density; and negatively with paramedical density (public and private). Private paramedical density variation was partially explained by economy. Public physician and paramedical density were positively correlated to district proportions of scheduled tribes. All provider densities (public and private) were negatively related to proportions of scheduled castes. Conclusions Overall <b>density</b> <b>of</b> qualified providers was low.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate whether healthcare infrastructure impacts delay in diagnosis, and to determine whether healthcare infrastructure and delay in diagnosis impacts survival in gastric cancer. MethodsAdministrative data from 2175 gastric cancer patients was analyzed using two Cox proportional hazard models with (i) delay in diagnosis and (ii) survival as dependent variables. Density of general practitioners, density of gastroenterologists, characteristics of specialty treatment centers, demographic information, and comorbidities were included in the models. Differentiation was made between urban and rural areas. ResultsThe likelihood of being diagnosed increased with an increase in general practitioners (p< 0. 0001) and gastroenterologists (p< 0. 0001) in rural areas. In urban areas a higher density of general practitioners reduced delay in diagnosis (p= 0. 0262), while a higher density of gastroenterologists did not (p= 0. 2480). The number of gastric cancer cases performed in hospital had a positive impact on survival (p< 0. 0001), while outpatient infrastructure did not. ConclusionDelay in diagnosis can be reduced by higher availability of general practitioners and gastroenterologists in rural areas. Given the already very high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> in urban areas there is no effect of additional gastroenterologists.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} relationship of violence/aggression and other societal variables to traffic accidents. In {{the first of two}} studies, multiple regression was applied to 1977 data from each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Traffic fatalities per registered vehicle was the dependent variable. The independent variables were homicide rate, suicide rate, fatality rate from other causes, unemployment rate, personal income, <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians,</b> alcohol consumption, motor vehicles per capita, road mileage per vehicle, sex and age distribution of drivers, and attained education. The main finding was that the homicide rate (but not the suicide rate) predicted the traffic fatality rate; additional significant predictors were the proportion of young drivers and the fatality rate from non-motor-vehicle accidents. The two primary predictors (homicides and young drivers) accounted for 64 % of the variance of traffic fatalities. In the second study, validation was performed by using the 1977 regression coefficients to estimate 1978 traffic fatalities. The results indicate that when the 1977 regression coefficients were applied to the 1978 values for homicides and young drivers, they accounted for 49 % of the variance of the 1978 traffic fatalities. The findings are discussed in terms of how society's violence/aggression may contribute to traffic accidents...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{dearth of}} health workers in rural {{settings}} in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) and {{other developing countries}} limits healthcare access and outcomes. In evaluating non-wage financial incentive packages as a potential policy option to attract health workers to rural settings, understanding the expected costs and effects of the various programs ex antecan assist policy-makers in selecting the optimal incentive package. Methods We use discrete choice experiments (DCEs), costing analyses and recent empirical results linking health worker density and health outcomes to estimate the future location decisions of physicians and determine the costeffectiveness of 15 voluntary incentives packages for new physicians in Lao PDR. Our data sources include a DCE survey completed by medical students (n = 329) in May 2011 and secondary cost, economic and health data. Mixed logit regressions {{provide the basis for}} estimating how each incentive package influences rural versus urban location choice over time. We estimate the expected rural <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> and the cost-effectiveness of 15 separate incentive packages from a societal perspective. In order to generate the cost-effectiveness ratios we relied on the rural uptake probabilities inferred from the DCEs, the costing data and prior World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that relate health outcomes to health worker density.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the rates of outpatient cataract surgery (ROCS) in ten European countries and to find country-specific health indicators explaining the differences. METHODS: Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), 251 eligible respondents were identified for which cataract surgery was the last surgical procedure. The ROCS of ten countries were compared using logistic regression. The influence of the public expenditure on health as per cent of the total expenditure on health, of the number of acute care beds per 1, 000 population, and of the number <b>of</b> practicing <b>physicians</b> per 1, 000 population, was studied by multiple logistic regression. Additional information was obtained from country-specific opinion leaders in the field of cataract surgery. RESULTS: The ROCS differed significantly between the ten analysed European countries where Denmark had the highest (100 %) and Austria the lowest (0 %) rate of day care surgery. A decrease in the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> acute care beds (p < 0. 0000001) and in the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> practicing <b>physicians</b> (p < 0. 05) and an increase in the public expenditure on health as per cent of the total health expenditure (p < 0. 01) lead to an increase in the ROCS. According to the opinion leaders, regulations and financial incentives also have a strong influence on the ROCS. CONCLUSIONS: The outpatient rate of cataract surgery in the ten European countries was mainly influenced by the acute-care beds density, but also by the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> practicing <b>physicians,</b> and by the public expenditure on health...|$|R

In Chile, the Ministry of Health has undertaken several studies in order to improve knowledge about the medical workforce both in public and private sectors. The aim {{of this paper is to}} update and systematize the existing data on physicians and specialists availability in Chile. Several information sources were crossed to obtain new and more precise figures about this topic.

40|$|Background: Fiscal Decentralization (FD) in {{many cases}} is {{encouraged}} as a strong means of improving the efficiency and equity {{in the provision of}} public goods, such as healthcare services. This issue has urged the researchers to experimentally examine the relationship between fiscal decentralization indicators and health outcomes. In this study we examine the effect of Fiscal Decentralization in Medical Universities (FDMU) and Fiscal Decentralization in Provincial Revenues (FDPR) on Under-Five Mortality Rate (U 5 M) in provinces of Iran over the period between 2007 and 2010. Methods: We employed panel data methods in this article. The results of the Pesaran CD test demonstrated that most of the variables used in the analysis were cross-sectionally dependent. The Hausman test results suggested that fixed-effects were more appropriate to estimate our model. We estimated the fixed-effect model by using Driscoll-Kraay standard errors as a remedy for cross-sectional dependency. Results: According to the findings of this research, fiscal decentralization in the health sector had a negative impact on U 5 M. On the other hand, fiscal decentralization in provincial revenues had a positive impact on U 5 M. In addition, U 5 M had a negative association with the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians,</b> hospital beds, and provincial GDP per capita, but a positive relationship with Gini coefficient and unemployment. Conclusion: The findings of our study indicated that fiscal decentralization should be emphasized in the health sector.

40|$|The {{effects of}} cost sharing on {{the demand for}} {{ambulatory}} care in experimental circumstances are well understood since the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE). However, in a non-experimental real-world context, supplier-induced demand of doctors might erode some of the significant negative out-of-pocket price elasticity identified in the HIE. Belgium is an interesting test case for this hypothesis because it has relatively high rates of patient cost sharing in its public health insurance system and a very high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians,</b> all remunerated fee-for-service. We have exploited the price variation generated by {{a substantial increase in}} patient co-payment rates in 1994 to estimate out-of-pocket price elasticities for three groups of users, and for three types of services using a fixed-effects model in levels and in differences. We obtain significant out-of-pocket price elasticities for the general population in the range from - 0. 39 to - 0. 28 for GP home visits, - 0. 16 to - 0. 12 for GP office visits and - 0. 10 for specialist visits. The estimates were generally lower and less significant for the groups of elderly and disabled. The differences we find in price responsiveness appear to be fairly robust and consistent with the HIE predictions. These results suggest that-at least in the short run-non-experimental utilization effects of cost sharing are very similar to the experimental evidence, even in a situation of favourable conditions for supplier-induced demand.

40|$|Population health (measured {{in terms}} of life {{expectancy}} and under-five mor-tality rate) has improved under {{the era of the}} Millennium Development Goals. The aim of the thesis was to examine the association between population health and health care resources in poor countries, to better understand the situation and how to improve it. I have done an ecological analysis of aggregate data. The sample consisted of 91 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Changes in life expectancy and in under-five mortality rate from 1995 to 2009 were used as dependent variables.

Objective: To explore factors that led International Medical Graduate (IMG) physicians to leave their home countries and migrate to Canada. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire {{with a mix of}} open- and close-ended questions was sent to 500 randomly selected IMG physicians practicing in Ontario, Canada. Results were analyzed using a mixed-method design utilizing both descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis approach. Results: 39 physicians met inclusion criteria and completed the survey. The majority were 50 years or older, and over 60 % were male. The most common reason for emigration from their home country was the socioeconomic and/or political situation, and the most common reason for selecting Canada was family issues. Suggestions for how brain drain could be stemmed fell into three broad categories: 1) more accurate information about lack of opportunities in Canada, 2) more continuing medical education opportunities in home countries, and 3) address issues such as safety and quality of life in home countries. Conclusions: This survey provides insights into the reasons for emigration and immigration for international medical graduates.

40|$|Abstract Background Questions {{about the}} {{existence}} of supplier-induced demand emerge repeatedly in discussions about governing Swiss health care. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the interrelationship between structural factors of supply and the volume of services that are provided by primary care physicians in Switzerland. Methods The study was designed as a cross-sectional investigation, based on the complete claims data from all Swiss health care insurers for the year 2004, which covered information from 6087 primary care physicians and 4. 7 million patients. Utilization-based health service areas were constructed and used as spatial units to analyze effects <b>of</b> <b>density</b> <b>of</b> supply. Hierarchical linear models were applied to analyze the data. Results The data showed that, within a service area, a higher <b>density</b> <b>of</b> primary care <b>physicians</b> was associated with higher mortality rates and specialist density but not with treatment intensity in primary care. Higher specialist density was weakly associated with higher mortality rates and with higher treatment intensity <b>density</b> <b>of</b> primary care <b>physicians.</b> Annual physician-level data indicate a disproportionate increase of supplied services irrespective {{of the size of the}} number of patients treated during the same year and, even in high volume practices, no rationing but a paradoxical inducement of consultations occurred. The results provide empirical evidence that higher <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> primary care <b>physicians,</b> specialists and the availability of out-patient hospital clinics in a given area are associated with higher volume of supplied services per patient in primary care practices. Analyses stratified by language regions showed differences that emphasize the effect of the cantonal based (fragmented) governance of Swiss health care. Conclusion The study shows high volumes in Swiss primary care and provides evidence that the volume of supply is not driven by medical needs alone. Effects related to the competition for patients between primary care physicians, specialists and out-patient hospital clinics and an association with the system of reimbursing services on a fee-for-service basis can not be excluded. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{pluralism}} (MP) can {{be defined}} as the employment of more than one medical system or the use of both conventional and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for health and illness. A population-based survey and linkage with medical records was conducted to investigate MP amongst the Taiwanese population. Previous research suggests an increasing use of CAM worldwide. Methods We collected demographic data, socioeconomic information, and details about lifestyle and health behaviours from the 2001 Taiwan National Health Interview Survey. The medical records of interviewees were obtained from National Health Insurance claims data with informed consent. In this study, MP was defined as using both Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) services in 2001. The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were estimated for factors associated with adopting MP in univariate and multiple logistic regression. Results Among 12, 604 eligible participants, 32. 5 % adopted MP. Being female (OR = 1. 44, 95 % CI = 1. 30 - 1. 61) and young (OR = 1. 38, 95 % CI = 1. 15 - 1. 66) were factors associated with adopting MP in the multiple logistic regression. People with healthy lifestyles (OR = 1. 35, 95 % CI = 1. 19 - 1. 53) were more likely to adopt MP than those with unhealthy lifestyles. Compared with people who had not used folk therapy within the past month, people who used folk therapy were more likely to adopt MP. The OR of adopting MP was higher in people who lived in highly urbanised areas as compared with those living in areas with a low degree of urbanisation. Living in an area with a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> TCM <b>physicians</b> (OR = 2. 19, 95 % CI = 1. 69 - 2. 84) was the strongest predictor for adopting MP. Conclusion MP is common in Taiwan. Sociodemographic factors, unhealthy lifestyle, use of folk therapy, and living in areas with a high <b>density</b> <b>of</b> TCM <b>physicians</b> are all associated with MP. People who had factors associated with the adoption of MP may be at risk for adverse health effects from interactions between TCM herbal medicine and WM pharmaceuticals. </p...|$|R

The results of this research showed that these variables were not always integrated with the same order although they showed great variation across countries. We could confirm HCE varies significantly over time and across countries although there exist a number of non-income determinants which could explain this variation...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY There is {{a growing}} deficit of phy-sician services, {{primarily}} related to increased demands and changing patterns of prac-tice rather than to decreased numbers, {{and there is a}} serious maldistribution of physician man-power. However, in some areas in which increased numbers of physicians have been produced, mal-distribution problems remain unsolved. The over-load of primary physicians is also decreasing the entry of new candidates into the field. Creation of new schools is not likely to meet the deficit; ex-pansion of existing schools is less expensive and more rapid but still inadequate. Increased individual physician productivity must be a major part of any solution. The use of as-sistants is an achievable and practical goal, as evidenced by early experience with the Duke Physician Assistant Program. The success of tech-nical devices such as computers depends on pro-duction of skilled assistants capable of operating them. Part of the advantage of group practice and other organization modifications lies in their mak-ing possible more efficient use of assistants. THE PRECEDING PRESENTATION h a s p o i n t e d out the fact of a growing shortage of physician services and has given us a glimpse of its severity. This group needs no further persuasion since most have felt it personally. There are certain points, however, that deserve emphasis since they relate directly to possible solutions to this national dilemma. INCREASED DEMANDS First, the overall <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> in this country has not decreased and in some areas has significantly increased. There has been a striking change in the demand for physician services and in patterns of prac-tice. New areas of medical knowledge have matured into full-fledged medical disci-plines, each demanding its share of the manpower pool. High volume generalists have been replaced by lower volume spe-cialists and subspecialists, who are gen-erally less available to the patient. Ad-ministrative, clerical, and quality control activities demand larger segments of physi-cian time, and better informed patients demand that the best care be provided, even for illnesses and injuries that might have been handled without medical aid two or three decades ago...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study aims to {{evaluate}} {{the length of time}} elapsed between reports of the same incidents related to avian flu and H 1 N 1 outbreaks published by the WHO and ProMED-mail, the two major global health surveillance systems, before and after the amendment of the International Health Regulations in 2005 (IHR 2005) and to explore the association between country transparency and this timeliness gap. METHODS: We recorded the initial release dates of each report related to avian flu or H 1 N 1 listed on the WHO Disease Outbreak News site and the matching outbreak report from ProMED-mail, a non-governmental program for monitoring emerging diseases, from 2003 to the end of June 2009. The timeliness gap was calculated as the difference in days between the report release dates of the matching outbreaks in the WHO and ProMED-mail systems. Civil liberties scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index and data indicating the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> and nurses were collected to reflect countries 2 ̆ 7 development and health workforce statuses. Then, logistic regression was performed to determine the correlation between the timeliness gap and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status, controlling for year. RESULTS: The reporting timeliness gap for avian flu and H 1 N 1 outbreaks significantly decreased after 2003. On average, reports were posted 4. 09 (SD[*]=[*] 7. 99) days earlier by ProMED-mail than by the WHO. Countries with partly free (OR[*]=[*] 5. 77) and free civil liberties scores (OR[*]=[*] 10. 57) had significantly higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps than non-free countries. Similarly, countries with very high human development status had significantly higher likelihoods of longer timeliness gaps than countries with middle or low human development status (OR[*]=[*] 5. 30). However, no association between the timeliness gap and health workforce density was found. CONCLUSION: The study found that the adoption of IHR 2005, which contributed to countries 2 ̆ 7 awareness of the importance of timely reporting, had a significant impact in improving the reporting timeliness gap. In addition, the greater the civil liberties in a country (e. g., importance of freedom of the media), the longer the timeliness gap...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Few {{studies have}} tried to assess the {{combined}} cross-sectional and temporal contributions of a more comprehensive set of amenable factors to population health outcomes for wealthy countries during the last 30 years of the 20 th century. We assessed the overall ecological associations between mortality and factors amenable to public health. These amenable factors included addictive and nutritional lifestyle, air quality, public health spending, healthcare coverage, and immunizations. Methods We used a pooled cross-sectional, time series analysis with corrected fixed effects regression models in an ecological design involving eighteen member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development during the period 1970 to 1999. Results Alcohol, tobacco, and fat consumption, and sometimes, air pollution {{were significantly associated with}} higher all-cause mortality and premature death. Immunizations, health care coverage, fruit/vegetable and protein consumption, and collective health expenditure had negative effects on mortality and premature death, even after controlling for the elderly, <b>density</b> <b>of</b> practicing <b>physicians,</b> doctor visits and per capita GDP. However, tobacco, air pollution, and fruit/vegetable intake were sometimes sensitive to adjustments. Conclusion Mortality and premature deaths could be improved by focusing on factors that are amenable to public health policies. Tackling these issues should be reflected in the ongoing assessments of health system performance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{achievement}} of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) depends on sufficient supply of health workforce in each country. Although country-level data support this contention, it {{has been difficult to}} evaluate health workforce supply and MDG outcomes at the country level. The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the association between the health workforce, particularly the nursing workforce, and the {{achievement of}} the MDGs, taking into account other factors known to influence health status, such as socioeconomic indicators. Methods A merged data set that includes country-level MDG outcomes, workforce statistics, and general socioeconomic indicators was utilized for the present study. Data were obtained from the Global Human Resources for Health Atlas 2004, the WHO Statistical Information System (WHOSIS) 2000, UN Fund for Development and Population Assistance (UNFDPA) 2000, the International Council of Nurses "Nursing in the World", and the WHO/UNAIDS database. Results The main factors in understanding HIV/AIDS prevalence rates are physician density followed by female literacy rates and nursing density in the country. Using general linear model approaches, increased physician and nurse <b>density</b> (number <b>of</b> <b>physicians</b> or nurses per population) was associated with lower adult HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, even when controlling for socioeconomic indicators. Conclusion Increased nurse and physician density are associated with improved health outcomes, suggesting that countries aiming to attain the MDGs related to HIV/AIDS would do well to invest in their health workforce. Implications for international and country level policy are discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{few studies}} that have {{analyzed}} the context of health care utilization, particularly in Latin America. This study examines the context of utilization of health services in Ecuador; focusing {{on the relationship between}} provision of services and use of both preventive and curative services. Methods This study is cross-sectional and analyzes data from the 2004 National Demographic and Maternal & Child Health dataset. Provider variables come from the Ecuadorian System of Social Indicators (SIISE). Global Moran's I statistic is used to assess spatial autocorrelation of the provider variables. Multilevel modeling is used for the simultaneous analysis of provision of services at the province-level with use of services at the individual level. Results Spatial analysis indicates no significant differences in the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> health care providers among Ecuadorian provinces. After adjusting for various predisposing, enabling, need factors and interaction terms, <b>density</b> <b>of</b> public practice health personnel was positively associated with use of preventive care, particularly among rural households. On the other hand, <b>density</b> <b>of</b> private practice <b>physicians</b> was positively associated with use of curative care, particularly among urban households. Conclusions There are significant public/private, urban/rural gaps in provision of services in Ecuador; which in turn affect people's use of services. It is necessary to strengthen the public health care delivery system (which includes addressing distribution of health workers) and national health information systems. These efforts could improve access to health care, and inform the civil society and policymakers on the advances of health care reform. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Multiple {{reports have}} {{demonstrated}} pancreatic cancer patients undergoing surgery have superior outcomes at high-volume hospitals. This study noted trends in access to high-volume centers for pancreatic resection and identified gaps in improving access. Study Design We performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS 2000 to 2005) linked to the Area Resource File (ARF). Inclusion criteria were patients with primary diagnosis of pancreatic cancer who received pancreatic resection. The primary outcomes variable was treatment at high-volume hospitals (average annual case volume greater than 20). Independent variables included age, gender, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, insurance status, calendar year, and region, obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample; community poverty level and <b>density</b> <b>of</b> all <b>physicians,</b> gastroenterologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists were data obtained from the Area Resource File. Results A total of 8, 370 patients were identified. A minority (38. 51 %) were referred to high-volume hospitals. A significant increase in overall referral and odds of referral to a high-volume center was observed over time (22. 2 % in 2000 to 44. 4 % in 2005). Patients referred to high-volume centers were younger (61. 9 versus 63. 2 years, p < 0. 001) {{and more likely to}} be Caucasian (81. 7 % versus 73. 6 %, p < 0. 001). Patients greater than 85 years old, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians {{were less likely to be}} referred, relative to their younger, Caucasian counterparts (p < 0. 01). The overall trend toward improved referral over time was driven by improved referral among Caucasians. In multivariate analysis, access to high-volume centers was associated with calendar year, patient age, and race. In addition, increase in <b>density</b> <b>of</b> gastroenterologists or radiation oncologists in the population was also associated with higher likelihood of referral. Conclusions This study demonstrated that less than half of pancreatic cancer patients are being referred to high-volume centers. Unlike referral in Caucasians, improvement in referral for minorities has not occurred...|$|R
40|$|Socially {{disadvantaged}} {{people have}} an increased need for medical care due to a higher burden of health problems and chronic diseases. In Germany, outpatient care is chiefly provided by office-based general practitioners and specialists in private practice. People are free to choose the physician they prefer. In this study, national data were used to examine differences {{in the use of}} outpatient medical care by socioeconomic status (SES). The analyses were based on data from 6, 754 participants in the Robert Koch Institute's German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS 1) aged between 18 and 69 years. The number <b>of</b> outpatient <b>physician</b> visits during the past twelve months was assessed for several medical specializations. SES was determined based on education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and physician visits were analysed using logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression for count data. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health indicators, outpatients with low SES had more contacts with general practitioners than outpatients with high SES (men: incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1. 25; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 08 - 1. 46; women: IRR = 1. 20; 95 % CI = 1. 07 - 1. 34). The use of specialists was lower in people with low SES than in those with high SES when sociodemographic factors and health indicators were adjusted for (men: odds ratio [OR] = 0. 68; 95 % CI = 0. 51 - 0. 91; women: OR = 0. 56; 95 % CI = 0. 41 - 0. 77). This applied particularly to specialists in internal medicine, dermatology, and gynaecology. The associations remained after additional adjustment for the type of health insurance and the regional <b>density</b> <b>of</b> office-based <b>physicians.</b> The findings suggest that socially disadvantaged people are seen by general practitioners more often than the socially better-off, who are more likely to visit a medical specialist. These differences may be due to differences in patient preferences, physician factors, physician-patient interaction, and potential barriers to accessing specialist care...|$|R
