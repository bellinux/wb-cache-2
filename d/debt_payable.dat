5000|$|Cook {{suggests}} existing U.S. (GDP) {{could support}} such a system. GDP of $12.98-trillion minus $9.21-trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals {{a difference of}} $3.77-trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a [...] "National Dividend" [...] of approximately $12,600 could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to [...] "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely [...] "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account {{could also be used}} for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. Rather than Federal Reserve Notes, circulated only through <b>debt</b> <b>payable</b> to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be [...] "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, [...] "it's important to realize that Social Credit is not a socialist system. Rather it is 'democratic capitalism,' in contrast to the 'finance capitalism' that has become so damaging".

5000|$|Rennert's {{strategy}} for building Renco was to acquire all {{the shares of}} struggling companies and to finance the acquisition by issuing junk bonds. Along the way, Rennert paid substantial dividends {{out of the business}} to himself. In a series of junk bond issues since 1995, Renco’s subsidiaries have borrowed an estimated $1.1 billion and transferred $322 million (29 percent) to Renco Group, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). [...] Backed by blue-chip mutual funds and hedge funds such as John Hancock Funds LLC and Putnam Investment Management LLC, Rennert now didn’t have to invest much of his own money. His purchase of AM General in 1992 was bought with a down payment of just $10 million. In 1994, Fluor Corp. of Los Angeles sold the Doe Run Company to Renco, with the latter paying $52 million in cash, and approximately $60 million in <b>debt</b> <b>payable</b> over an eight-year period. In 1997, Doe Run went on to pay $247 million for a similarly environmentally troubled lead smelting complex from the Peruvian government, as well as borrowing more money to service its Fluor Corporation debt. And in 1998, Doe Run sold $305 million in junk bonds for financing its Peruvian acquisition as well as more lead mines in Missouri (according to Doe Run filings with the SEC). Since 1998 most Renco financings have been bank debt.|$|E
50|$|The Humber Bridge (Debts) Act 1996 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The {{purpose of}} the Act was to give power to the Secretary of State for Transport to write off <b>debts</b> <b>payable</b> to the British Government by the Humber Bridge Board, {{operators}} of the Humber Bridge. The Act was necessary as the Board had accumulated debts of £439 million by 1997. The Act allowed the Secretary of State to reorganise the Board's debts, and write off sufficient amount of debt to allow the Board to continue to maintain the Humber Bridge, a vital transport link for Humberside. This reduced the amount of debt to £333 million soon afterwards and resulted in calls for all tolls across the bridge to be abolished.|$|R

40|$|An {{enterprise}} with <b>debt</b> <b>payable</b> in {{a foreign}} currency will experience fluctuations in the reporting currency value of the debt due {{to a change in}} exchange rates. In some instances, an enterprise enters into a currency swap contract wherein it creates a foreign currency receivable and a reporting currency payable. If the terms of the contract require settlement only for the net change in the contract value, the enterprise computes and records this amount at each balance sheet date. From a business standpoint, these two transactions replace the foreign currency debt with reporting currency debt. The issue is how the effect of a change in exchange rates on a foreign currency swap contract should be displayed in the balance sheet.

25|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended twice during World War I, once fully {{and then for}} foreign exchange.

With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the {{gold standard}} was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange value of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.|$|R

25|$|The {{oppression of}} Jews {{following}} their exclusion from the guarantees of Magna Carta peaked with Edward expelling them from England. Christians were forbidden by canon law from providing loans with interest, so the Jews {{played a key}} economic role in the country by providing this service. In turn the Plantagenets {{took advantage of the}} Jews' status as direct subjects, heavily taxing them at will without the necessity to summon Parliament. Edward's first major step towards Jewish expulsion was the Statute of Jewry, which outlawed all usury and gave Jews fifteen years to buy agricultural land. However, popular prejudice made Jewish movement into mercantile or agricultural pursuits impossible. Edward attempted to clear his debts with the expulsion of Jews from Gascony, seizing their property and transferred all outstanding <b>debts</b> <b>payable</b> to himself. He made his continued tax demands more palatable to his subjects by offering to expel all Jews in exchange. The heavy tax was passed and the Edict of Expulsion was issued.

40|$|We study what {{features}} an economic environment might possess, {{such that it}} would be Pareto efficient for the exchange of goods in that environment to be conducted on spot markets where those goods trade for money. We prove a conjecture that is essentially due to Bewley [1980, 1983]. Monetary spot trading is nearly efficient when there is only a single perishable good (or a composite commodity) at each date and state of the world; random shocks are idiosyncratic, privately observed, and temporary; markets are competitive; and the agents are very patient. This result is a fairly close analogue, for trade using outside, fiat money, of a recent characterization by Levine and Zame [2002] of environments in which spot trade using inside money, in the form of one-period <b>debt</b> <b>payable</b> in a commodity, is nearly Pareto efficient. We also study a example where expansionary monetary mechanism Pareto dominates laissez-faire or contractionary monetary mechanism in an environment with impatient agents.

Regarding debt levels, we ﬁnd that more levered companies are larger, less proﬁtable, more tangible and have fewer growth opportunities.

The first major step towards expulsion took place in 1275, with the Statute of the Jewry. The statute outlawed all lending at interest and gave Jews fifteen years to readjust.

All their property was seized by the crown and all outstanding <b>debts</b> <b>payable</b> to Jews were transferred to the King’s name.

To make the tax more palatable, Edward, in exchange, essentially offered to expel all Jews. [...] The heavy tax was passed, and three days later, on 18 July, the Edict of Expulsion was issued.
