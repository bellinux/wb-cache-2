5|$|Returning World War II {{veterans}} {{created a}} postwar <b>economic</b> <b>boom,</b> {{which led to}} the development of huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans, the largest being Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant Town, which opened in 1947. In 1952, the United Nations relocated from its first headquarters near Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, {{had begun}} by 1801 {{to the east}} of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was {{completed}} in time to exploit the <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> in the cotton trade that followed the brief peace in the war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced a more powerful 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model to investigate how resource-driven <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> shape the equilibrium political institutions of resource-rich societies and influence {{the likelihood of}} experiencing civil war. In our model a strong government apparatus favors property rights protection but also makes the state more powerful and hence may induce predatory autocratic regimes over democracy. We characterize the parameter space of each political outcome {{in terms of the}} type of the available natural resources. <b>Economic</b> <b>booms</b> based on resources that are privately exploited empower the citizens and tend to ease democratic transitions. In contrast, booms based on resources exploited by the state tend to favor more dictatorial regimes. Finally, <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> based on resources that can be exploited either by the state or by private citizens incite preemptive actions by both parties that may result in civil war. We discuss the predictions of the model using historical and contemporary examples...|$|R
50|$|The city's {{history is}} a {{continuous}} alternation between <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> and recessions. For {{long periods of time}} its most important industries have been shipping, shipbuilding, the fish canning industry and associated subcontractors.|$|R
5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{to the start of the}} Second World War, there were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness to some of the Luftwaffe's raids on the Manchester area, it emerged from the war {{relatively}} unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an <b>economic</b> <b>boom.</b> This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40per cent.|$|E
5|$|The February Revolution {{halted the}} Finnish <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> {{caused by the}} Russian war-economy. The {{collapse}} in business led to unemployment and high inflation, but the workers who had a job gained an opportunity to resolve long-term problems of their laborious working life. The commoners call for eight-hour-per-day working limits, better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> in China and India {{has caused}} a massive {{increase}} in the demand for steel in recent years. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6%. Since 2000, several Indian and Chinese steel firms have risen to prominence, such as Tata Steel (which bought Corus Group in 2007), Baosteel Group and Shagang Group. ArcelorMittal is however the world's largest steel producer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>booms</b> and busts followed. Its {{most notable}} boom {{occurred}} during World War I, when Trona {{was the only}} reliable American source of potash, an important element used {{in the production of}} gunpowder.|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand Wool Boom of 1951 {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> in the history of New Zealand, and the direct result of United States policy in the 1950 - 53 Korean War.|$|R
50|$|Improved communication, as {{the result}} of the Mail and Railway projects, had brought an <b>economic</b> <b>booming</b> for the city in the 1870s. There were hospital, churches, hotels, and large houses built along the new main roads; Bojongscheweg, Pontjolscheweg, and Mataram street, causing denser {{population}} in the ethnic settlements and creating the urban kampong.|$|R
5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a {{drawn-out}} bidding process, {{went to an}} American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile's orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's relations with Argentina were warming and the country's <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|An <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> in {{the south}} {{following}} the end of World War I greatly increased Southern's revenues. Harrison {{spent a good deal of}} time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E

30|$|IBR {{is one of}} {{the factors}} which are {{considered}} by central banks to formulate their monetary policy. Higher IBR indicates shortage of liquidity in interbank market and vice versa. So, in order to control for the effect of monetary policy on bank liquidity creation, we use a 90 -day interbank market rate as a proxy for monetary policy. Following Berger and Bouwman (2009 a) and Lei and Song (2013), we also use LN_POP as a control variable. Bank liquidity creation also depends on <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> and busts. Generally, the banks create more liquidity during <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> and reduce their lending during economic slowdown. So, following Berger and Bouwman (2009 a) and Distinguin et al. (2013), we use GDP, over the previous year as a proxy for economic growth to control for the effect of changes in the business cycle on liquidity creation.|$|R
40|$|The current {{decade has}} {{seen one of}} the most {{impressive}} <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> in the developing world, fueled by a mix of three conditions prevailing in global markets: exceptional financing, high commodity prices and, for an important group of countries, large flows of remittances.

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Dutch {{colonisation}} of the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia), many people of Chinese descent were contracted as skilled artisans in the construction of Batavia on the northwestern coast of Java; they also served as traders, sugar mill workers, and shopkeepers. The <b>economic</b> <b>boom,</b> precipitated by trade between the East Indies and China via the port of Batavia, increased Chinese immigration to Java. The number of ethnic Chinese in Batavia grew rapidly, reaching a total of 10,000 by 1740. Thousands more lived outside the city walls. The Dutch colonials required them to carry registration papers, and deported those who did not comply to China.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. He felt that the colonies were missing out on the post-war <b>economic</b> <b>boom.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, which is why the company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets.|$|E
50|$|The 20th century saw a {{proliferation}} of laws allowing {{for the creation of}} corporations by registration across the world, which helped to drive <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> in many countries before and after World War I. Another major post World War I shift was toward the development of conglomerates, in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base.|$|R
50|$|Mahdia {{is a small}} {{community}} in the Potaro-Siparuni region of Guyana, located near {{the centre of the}} country at an altitude of 415 m. Commerce is centred on the area's gold and diamond mining operations. As such it responds to and is affected by the <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> and busts and attracts immigrants both local and foreign to obtain wealth through mining.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has lead to heated debates on {{the pros and}} cons of fair value accounting from the perspectives of illiquidity and procyclicality. Previous research investigates the relationship between fair value accounting and procyclicality and finds mixed evidence of this relationship during economic recessions. However, few studies examined the relationship between fair value accounting and the {{financial crisis}} during <b>economic</b> <b>booms.</b> The purpose of this study is to examine whether fair value accounting promotes procyclicality by focusing on securitization transactions during <b>economic</b> <b>booms.</b> We examine the relationship between securitization accounting and procyclicality by using a parsimonious model. The findings are as follows. When a gain on sale is recognized under certain conditions, sale accounting decreases the leverage ratio compared with that before the securitization transaction. Banks increase assets to maintain the target leverage ratio. Furthermore, if banks conduct securitization transactions and adopt sale accounting, the leverage ratio decreases; therefore, bank...|$|R
5|$|In 1935, {{work began}} on the Central Valley Project (CVP), a federal water project that would develop the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems for {{irrigation}} of the highly fertile Central Valley. However, {{after the end of}} World War II in 1945, the state experienced an <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> that led to rapid urban and commercial growth in the central and southern portions of the state, and it became clear that California's economy could not depend solely on a state water system geared primarily towards agriculture. A new study of California's water supplies by the Division of Water Resources (now California Department of Water Resources, DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{initially}} emphasised racial {{reconciliation and}} he was keen to build {{a good relationship with}} white Zimbabweans. He hoped to avoid a white exodus and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property. He appointed two white ministers—David Smith and Denis Norman—to his government, met with white leaders in agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, and impressed senior figures in the outgoing administration like Smith and Ken Flower with his apparent sincerity. With the end of the war, petrol rationing, and economic sanctions, life for white Zimbabweans improved {{during the early years of}} Mugabe's regime. In the <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.|$|E
30|$|In {{times of}} great <b>economic</b> <b>booms,</b> in fact, {{it is easy}} to upset value {{standards}} that society uses to regulate needs, fixing the prospects of rewards for each social function for the greater common good. The growth of opportunities, in fact, excites desires, and dulls the conscience which distinguishes what claims and rights/privileges are really legitimate, or on the contrary, what claims are excessive and arbitrary.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{circumstances}} beyond Japan's {{direct control}} contributed to its success. International conflicts tended {{to stimulate the}} Japanese economy until the devastation {{at the end of}} World War II. The Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), World War I (1914–18), the Korean War (1950–53), and the Second Indochina War (1954–75) brought <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> to Japan. In addition, benign treatment from the United States after World War II facilitated the nation's reconstruction and growth.|$|R
50|$|After the Civil War and Reconstruction, Florence {{underwent}} {{a series of}} <b>economic</b> <b>booms</b> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that {{do not meet the}} current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E
5|$|Ohio River ports {{had been}} stifled by an embargo on the Confederate South and never fully {{recovered}} their economic prominence, leading the south into an economic decline. By contrast, northern Indiana experienced an <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> when natural gas {{was discovered in}} the 1880s, which directly contributed to {{the rapid growth of}} cities such as Gas City, Hartford City, and Muncie where a glass industry developed to utilize the cheap fuel. The Indiana gas field was then the largest known in the world. The boom lasted until the early 20th century, when the gas supplies ran low. This began northern Indiana's industrialization.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1999, Abdullah II {{ascended the}} throne upon {{the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah {{embarked}} on aggressive economic liberalisation when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an <b>economic</b> <b>boom</b> which continued until 2008. Abdullah II has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five other special economic zones. During the following years Jordan's economy experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the Great Recession and spillover from the Arab Spring, including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighbouring countries.|$|E
