40|$|International audienceThe oceans {{are a major}} sink for {{anthropogenic}} atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the uptake causes {{changes to}} the marine carbonate system and has wide ranging effects on flora and fauna. It is crucial to develop analytical systems {{that allow us to}} follow the increase in oceanic pCO 2 and corresponding reduction in pH. Miniaturised sensor systems using immobilised fluorescence indicator spots are attractive for this purpose because of their simple design and low power requirements. The technology is increasingly used for oceanic dissolved oxygen measurements. We present a detailed method on the use of immobilised fluorescence indicator spots to determine pH in ocean waters across the pH range 7. 6 – 8. 2. We characterised temperature (− 0. 046 pH/°C from 5 to 25 °C) and salinity dependences (− 0. 01 pH/psu over 5 – 35), and performed a preliminary investigation into the influence of chlorophyll on the pH measurement. The apparent pKa of the sensor spots was 6. 93 at 20 °C. A drift of 0. 00014 R (ca. 0. 0004 pH, at 25 °C, salinity 35) was observed over a 3 day period in a laboratory based drift experiment. We achieved a precision of 0. 0074 pH units, and observed a drift of 0. 06 pH units during a test deployment of 5 week duration in the Southern Ocean as an underway surface ocean sensor, which was corrected for using certified reference materials. The temperature and salinity dependences were accounted for with the algorithm, R= 0. 00034 − 0. 17 ·pH+ 0. 15 ·S 2 + 0. 0067 ·T− 0. 0084 ·S· 1. 075 R= 0. 00034 − 0. 17 ·pH+ 0. 15 ·S 2 + 0. 0067 ·T− 0. 0084 ·S· 1. 075. This study provides a first step towards a pH optode system suitable for autonomous deployment. The use of a short duration low power illumination (LED current 0. 2 mA, 5 μs illumination time) improved the lifetime and precision of the spot. Further improvements to the pH <b>indicator</b> <b>spot</b> operations include regular application of certified reference materials for drift correction and cross-calibration against a spectrophotometric pH system. Desirable future developments should involve novel fluorescence spots with improved response time and apparent pKa values closer to the pH of surface ocean waters...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{olfaction}} {{suggests that}} numerous replicas of small sensors can achieve large sensitivity. This concept of sensor redundancy can be exploited {{by use of}} optical chemical sensors whose use of image sensors enables the simultaneous measurement of several spatially distributed indicators. Digital image sensors split the framed scene into {{hundreds of thousands of}} pixels each corresponding to a portion of the sensing layer. The signal from each pixel can be regarded as an independent sensor, which leads to a highly redundant sensor array. Such redundancy can eventually be exploited to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper we report an algorithm for reduction of the noise of pixel signals. For this purpose, the algorithm processes the output of groups of pixels whose signals share the same time behavior, as is the case for signals related to the same indicator. To define these groups of pixels, unsupervised clustering, based on classification of the indicator colors, is proposed here. This approach to signal processing is tested in experiments on the chemical sensitivity of replicas of eight <b>indicators</b> <b>spotted</b> on to a plastic substrate. Results show that the groups of pixels can be defined independently of the geometrical arrangement of the sensing spots, and substantial improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio is obtained, enabling the detection of volatile compounds at any location on the distributed sensing layer...|$|R

40|$|Tests for {{causality}} and rationality in {{the coffee}} futures market were carried out {{using data from the}} New York Market. Tests of causality indicated that futures prices strongly influence variations in spot price eight weeks or more to maturity. However, beginning seven weeks to maturity {{there seems to be a}} strong causal relationship going from futures to spot and from spot to futures. Risk constancy or neutrality, equality of risk premium and spot price, and efficiency were rejected for the period 18, 51, and 33 weeks or more to maturity. However, simultaneity of risk neutrality and efficiency was accepted for contracts with 55 - 77 weeks to maturity. The general conclusion from this study is that coffee futures market can be used as an <b>indicator</b> of <b>spot</b> market prices for contracts with 55 - 77 weeks to maturity. While benefits can be obtained through short term adjustment of available stock and making use of quality storage facilities, planning longer term planting and marketing decisions (e. g., ≥ 77 weeks) on the basis of futures market price can result in misallocation of resources and welfare loss. ...|$|R

Forty-eight isolates inhibited at least one <b>indicator</b> in <b>spot</b> agar assays. Of these, 20 isolates corresponding to 15 different strains were shown to produce bacteriocin-like substances in liquid cultures. PCR analysis revealed the genes coding for enterocins (enterococcal bacteriocins) A, B, P or X, or their combinations, in all but one of these 15 strains. In addition, the gene coding for enterocin 31 was detected in two strains. No amplification was obtained in one strain when using specific primers for all 13 bacteriocin genes sought. Three different enterocin genes were identified in most strains and four in one strain. Although the concomitant production of bacteriocins is still to be verified, producers of multiple enterocins could be of great technological potential as protective cultures in the cheese industry. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

The {{objective is to}} establish the geometry, reservoir distribution, delineate hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs from surface seismic sections and well logs. In this process, a 3 -D structural interpretation and estimation {{of the volume of}} hydrocarbon in place of the reservoirs was carried out. Well-to-seismic tie revealed that hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs were associated with direct hydrocarbon <b>indicators</b> (bright <b>spots</b> and dim spots) on the seismic sections. Two horizons were studied (HD 2 and HD 2 _version 2) and several faults mapped for the purpose of carrying out 3 -D subsurface structural interpretation. This was used in generating the time structure maps. From the maps, it was observed that the principal structure responsible for hydrocarbon entrapment in the field was the anticlinal structure {{at the center of the}} field which tied to the crest of the rollover structure seen on the seismic sections. Check shots from the control well were used to create a velocity model from which the time to depth conversion was made. Horizon slice taken shows the reservoir spans a thickness of 400  ft. Direct hydrocarbon indicators were used to map the reservoir boundary. They were seen on the reflection amplitude maps as high amplitude zones (bright spots) and low amplitude zones (dim spots). Reservoir area extent estimated by square grid template method revealed that reservoir HD 2000 had an area estimate of 5.29  km 2. The results show the effectiveness of the estimation techniques in the lateral prediction of reservoir properties, discriminating litho-fluid and determining the porosity, saturation, net-to-gross ratio, and moreover the reserve volume. Hydrocarbon saturation varied between 0.64 and 0.65, while effective porosity varied between 0.31 and 0.32. Estimation of the volume of hydrocarbon in place revealed that the delineated reservoir HD 2000 contained an estimate of 776, 545, 418.22 barrels (123, 460, 855.4  cm 3) of hydrocarbon which shows great potential of considerable size.|$|R

Also occupational mobility in engineers is investigated {{as a source of}} additional supply of engineers. In the last two decades there have been significant changes in the interpretation of patent-law in the U. S. Most important for this study, software became a 'patentable subject matter' by 1995. Since 1995 the number of software patents has increased annually at an approximate rate of 15 %. In the first essay I examine the impact of this treatment of property rights in patents, {{with the help of a}} self-compiled data set that matches firms' patent-portfolios with their financial variables, for the period 1986 [...] 2001. The last two essays examine the labor markets and the development of human capital in the engineering profession. I first model the annual production of engineers at the three degree levels (B. S., M. S., and Ph. D.) and four engineering sub-fields over the time period of 1970 [...] 1998. Unlike previous models, I disaggregate R&D by the two main performing groups: industry and university. Industry performed R&D is treated as a demand-side variable, while university performed R&D is treated as a supply side variable, through its impact on funding for higher education in engineering. Distributed lags of R&D spending are used as indicators of the extent of long-run opportunities in engineering. Starting salaries are interpreted as <b>indicators</b> of <b>spot</b> labor market conditions for newly minted degrees. A system of equations, models the number of engineering degrees at one degree-level as a potential applicant pool for the next higher degree-level. The availability of foreign students in the applicant pool is also accounted for. One of the major worries in engineering training is the extent to which the number of engineers in subfields in engineering will be mismatched with the demand for engineers in these subfields. Parts of the second and the entire third essay further examine mobility of engineers across engineering sub-fields. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDespite recent {{progress}} {{in reducing the}} number of victims, landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) cause more than 3000 causalities every year, particularly affecting the most vulnerable. Current mine action programmes, however, do not consider prevailing vulnerabilities of affected communities in their priority-setting systems. We emphasise the need to consider social vulnerability in the workflow of mine action, and apply a spatially explicit approach for its assessment at a sub-national scale in Cambodia, one of the world's most heavily affected countries. Drawing on available literature and focus group discussions with domain experts, 16 socioeconomic, demographic and distance-related vulnerability indicators were identified. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used to obtain indicator weights, revealing that using firewood for cooking, distance to hospitals and health centres, occupation in the primary sector, poverty, conflict density, illiteracy and living in a rural area are key factors shaping social vulnerability in the context of landmines and ERW. Results were visualised using both 2 × 2 km 2 grids and sub-district administrative units, a resolution often used by the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority (CMAA). The results show that social vulnerability is very heterogeneous across the study area (Battambang province) with varying contributions of the underlying <b>indicators.</b> Significant hot <b>spots</b> were identified in the central, north-western, north-eastern, and southern parts of the province.

Three hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs were delineated within the study interval, namely: ROJ A, ROJ C and ROJ D. Well to seismic tie revealed that these reservoirs tied direct hydrocarbon <b>indicators</b> (bright <b>spots)</b> on the vertical sections. The structure maps produced revealed a series of NW-SE and E-W trending growth faults and fault echelons, most of which dip to the south. Fault assisted closures were revealed at the southern part of the field, which correspond to the crest of roll over structures and possibly served as the trapping mechanism for the reservoirs. The reflection amplitude of the studied horizons shows a fine network of anomalies that can be correlated to the prediction of the lateral distribution of the hydrocarbon sand. The conclusion of the study was that the western part of horizon ROJ A is a highly prospective area as bright spots were observed in the region. Also in the adjacent southern direction of this horizon, hydrocarbon accumulations have been confirmed from wells. These gas sands are possibly trapped in anticlinal closures located in the same area. On the other hand, the results from the study of horizon ROJ C suggest development opportunities in the southern area. High amplitude gas sands are seen to spread to the south and stratigraphy was assumed to play a major role in hydrocarbon migration. The study over horizon ROJ D reveal likely geologic features like regional sand pinch outs and channels in the southern part of the field. Spectral decomposition interpretation was suggested to be used further in improving the delineation of the thin reservoir sand bodies and for better outlining of their geometries but was not available on the workstation used The study has shown the feasibility of integrating structural interpretation and instantaneous amplitude in prospect identification and reservoir prediction...|$|R
40|$|This article it’s {{presenting}} results {{regarding the}} main reproduction <b>indicators</b> for German <b>Spotted</b> and Frizz Holstein. In stand {{to achieve this}} goal we fallow 3 main reproduction indicators to the cows with normal uterine involution and to the cows with puerperal infections: uterine repose (UR), Insemination index (Ig) and gestation rate (G). Regarding the uterine repose we notice that there were no significantly differences between the two breeds for the cows with normal uterine involution, 114. 00 ± 8. 80 days for German Spotted and 126. 79 ± 12. 86 days for Frizz Holstein. For the cows with puerperal infections we notice very significant differences, 128. 58 ± 10. 16 days for German Spotted and 184. 27 ± 12. 68 days for Frizz Holstein. Regarding the number of insemination/gestation {{there were no significant differences}} between the cows with normal calving. In this way, the index/gestation was 1. 45 ± 0. 11 for German Spotted and 1. 57 ± 0. 17 for Frizz Holstein. For the cows with puerperal infections was a distinguished significant difference regarding the index/gestation, so we have 1. 59 ± 0. 16 for German Spotted and 2. 32 ± 0. 20 for Frizz Holstein. The pregnancy rate for the cows with normal uterine involution was 66 % for German Spotted and 64 % for Frizz Holstein. The gestation rate for Frizz Holstein was smaller for both categories (64 % at the cows with normal uterine involution and 42 % at the cows with puerperal infection). After that research we can conclude that, generally, the cows with post calving infections registered middle values for different reproduction indicators comparative with the healthy cows...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale farming of {{agriculture}} crops requires real-time detection of disease for field pest management. Hyperspectral remote sensing data generally have high spectral resolution, {{which could be}} very useful for detecting disease stress in green vegetation at the leaf and canopy levels. In this study, hyperspectral reflectances of rice in the laboratory and field were measured to characterize the spectral regions and wavebands, which were the most sensitive to rice brown spot infected by Bipolaris oryzae (Helminthosporium oryzae Breda. de Hann). Leaf reflectance increased at the ranges of 450 to 500 nm and 630 to 680 nm with the increasing percentage of infected leaf surface, and decreased at the ranges of 520 to 580 nm, 760 to 790 nm, 1550 to 1750 nm, and 2080 to 2350 nm with the increasing percentage of infected leaf surface respectively. The sensitivity analysis and derivative technique were used to select the sensitive wavebands {{for the detection of}} rice brown spot infected by B. oryzae. Ratios of rice leaf reflectance were evaluated as <b>indicators</b> of brown <b>spot.</b> R 669 /R 746 (the reflectance at 669 nm divided by the reflectance at 746 nm, the following ratios may be deduced by analogy), R 702 /R 718, R 692 /R 530, R 692 /R 732, R 535 /R 746, R 521 /R 718, and R 569 /R 718 increased significantly as the incidence of rice brown spot increased regardless of whether it's at the leaf or canopy level. R 702 /R 718, R 692 /R 530, R 692 /R 732 were the best three ratios for estimating the disease severity of rice brown spot at the leaf and canopy levels. This result not only confirms the capability of hyperspectral remote sensing data in characterizing crop disease for precision pest management in the real world, but also testifies that the ratios of crop reflectance is a useful method to estimate crop disease severity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Few {{studies have}} {{explored}} associations of long-term air pollution exposure with the prevalence and incidence of hypertension, or the joint relationships of neighborhood walkability, individual walking behavior, and social disadvantage. Methods: Air pollution, hypertension, walkability, walking, and covariate data were assessed for > 6, 000 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) between 2000 and 2007. These participants resided in six {{communities in the}} U. S and were aged 45 to 84 and without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. Particulate and gaseous air pollution levels (PM 2. 5, PM 10 - 2. 5, NOx) from MESA-generated spatio-temporal models and walkability from the Walk Score Research Services were estimated at participant homes {{as well as on}} the census block group level. Census block groups in the six communities having low air pollution and high walk score levels, and the reverse, were classified as “sweet spot” and “sour spot”, respectively. Population characteristics, including percent racial minority, low education level, and below poverty line at the census block group scale were collected from the American Community Survey. Logistic and Cox regressions were used to assess associations between air pollution and prevalent and incident of hypertension. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate associations between 1) population characteristics with the sweet/sour <b>spot</b> <b>indicators,</b> and 2) individual walking activity, neighborhood air pollution and walk score. Results: Long-term exposure to ambient PM 2. 5, NOx, PM 10 - 2. 5, and its composite chemicals were not associated with hypertension onset or prevalence at baseline. Geographical distributions of sweet- and sour-spot neighborhoods differed among the six communities. Socially deprived neighborhoods with lower education level populations were less likely to be sweet-spots. Finally, lower ambient PM 2. 5 levels were associated with more walking for leisure whereas higher walk scores were associated with more walking for transport. Conclusions: Long-term exposures to PM 2. 5, PM 10 - 2. 5 or NOx were not a main contributor to hypertension development in the MESA population, but in some communities, air pollution levels and walkability were associated with personal walking behavior. Socio-economic disadvantage in some communities was linked to higher likelihood of living in a more polluted and less walkable area, potentially contributing to health disparities...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the present work {{within the context of}} the EBONE {{objectives}} is to investigate if leaf phenology indicators as derived from SPOT and MODIS NDVI time series can provide useful information for the detection and mapping of forest habitats, with specific reference to the General Habitat Category scheme. The report is divided into three main parts. The first part focuses on a description of the Phenolo model. This includes the pre-processing and processing steps applied to extract leaf phenology <b>indicators</b> from <b>SPOT</b> and MODIS data, and a short analysis of the spatial distribution of a selection of phenometrics in test areas. The second part introduces two pilot habitat classification tests using the Random Forests™ approach and SPOT NDVI data. The last part focuses on investigating the intercalibration of GHCs with MODIS-derived phenometrics. Random Forests classifications were tested in a variety of configurations and accuracy checked using the JRC Forest Map 2006. A set of 31 leaf phenology indicators (phenometrics) was extracted using JRC Phenolo model from a time series of NDVI ten day Maximum Value composites of six years (MODIS) and eleven years (SPOT). The Phenolo model considers an annual cycle of vegetation leaf phenology as represented by one permanent component, or ‘background’ and a variable component, function of seasonal dynamics. Pre-processing involved substitution of no data, outlier analysis and filtering. NDVI time series processing involved the extraction of date and productivity phenometrics. The model, coded in IDL, provided fast calculations in a stable environment. The performance of the Random Forests classifications and the contribution of individual phenometrics were tested through the calculation of the Mean Decrease Accuracy parameter (MDA). Overall, the results suggest date phenometrics to be more important for forest habitat classification than productivity phenometrics, especially indicators defined around the Peak of Season point and the NDVI curve minima. Apart from areas with spatially and spectrally homogeneous forest habitat classes (Coniferous forests in Austria), the overall classification accuracy achieved with the Random Forests approach using MODIS-based phenology indicators is generally not satisfactory. We identified three main factors influencing these result: the spatial/spectral heterogeneity present in the GHC forest polygons and subsequently in the training pixels associated to these classes: the low number of training pixels available and the use of an independent dataset to calculate accuracy which was built uniquely on spectral information. The introduction of artificial data gaps within the MODIS NDVI time series did not influence significantly classification accuracy. On the basis of the investigation results, the following remarks were made: 1) the spatial scale of current EObased phenology data (250 m) is at the edge of an adequate resolution for effective habitat classification with respect to GHC categories and field data; 2) It is recommended to build a large dataset of GHC training pixels in order to take into account the high spectral variability present within single GHC classes and 3) Adequate classification accuracy assessment should be based on a reference dataset which takes into account as much as possible the elements of heterogeneity typical of the GHCs. The structural (height) characteristics of the life forms types considered in the General Habitat Category scheme are very valuable information which should be taken into account when using EO-derived information. For this reason, for the purpose of GHCs classification a strategy that integrates EO-based phenology indicators with EO derived information on vegetation structure, from e. g. LiDAR or high resolution radar, could potentially be more effective than only a phenology-based approach. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{economic}} development, {{regional authorities}} {{have to address}} issues that relate to climate change, efficient information flow in the market place, and health care. This dissertation presents three essays on current issues of concern to economic development in Africa. Climate change is examined {{in terms of its}} effects on the Egyptian agricultural sector; transmission of world price to small scale growers is examined in Uganda; and the benefits of insecticide-treated bed nets use is examined in Africa. In essay I, to address the impact of climate change on the Egyptian agricultural sector under alternative population growth rates, water use and crop yield assumption; the Egyptian Agricultural Sector Model (EASM) is updated and expanded to improve hydrological modeling and used to portray agricultural activity and hydrological flow. The results indicate that climate change will cause damages (costs) to the Egyptian agricultural sector and these will increase over time. Egypt may reduce these future damages by controlling its population growth rate and using water conservation strategies. In essay II, I use vector autoregressive analysis to examine the transmissions of price information to Uganda coffee growers; using monthly coffee price data on retail, futures, farmgate and world prices from 1994 to 2010. Improved transmission of world prices to farmers may increase their decision making to obtain a better market price. Directed acyclic graphs reveal that there is a causal flow of information from the indicator price to the London futures price to the Uganda grower?s price in contemporaneous time. Forecast error variance decomposition indicates that at moving ahead 12 months, the uncertainty in Uganda grower price is attributable to the <b>indicator</b> price (world <b>spot</b> price), own price (farmgate), London future and Spain retail price in rank order. In essay III, the cost of malaria in children under five years and the use of insecticide treated bed nets is examined in the context of 18 countries in Africa. I examine the direct and indirect cost of malaria in children under five years and the benefit of investing in insecticide treated mosquito nets as a preventative strategy in 18 African countries. The results indicate that the use of mosquito treated nets reduces the number of malaria cases in children; and this can induce 0. 5 % reduction in outpatient treatment costs, 11 % reduction in inpatient treatment costs, 11 % reduction in productivity loss, and 15 % reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALY) annually...|$|R
