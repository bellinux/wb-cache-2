5|$|As <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted {{to modify the}} look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that he was leaving the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Sarah (Hana Hayes) is Joel's twelve-year-old daughter, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> {{he was in}} {{his late}} teens, and the game's first playable character. The posters and photos on her wall suggest that she was a keen soccer player. At the start of the game, she gives her father a new watch for his birthday. In {{the early hours of the}} next day, she is awoken by a commotion and the sound of Tommy phoning Joel. Later, Joel bursts into his office, pulls a {{revolver}} out of his desk drawer and shoots their neighbor. Sarah leaves with Tommy and Joel, but her leg is hurt in a crash, forcing Joel to carry her. On the outskirts of their hometown, they come across a soldier, who follows his orders and shoots at them. Sarah is fatally wounded by bullets and dies in Joel's arms.|$|E

25|$|As a leader, 'Umar {{was known}} for his simple, austere lifestyle. Rather than adopt the pomp and display {{affected}} by the rulers of the time, he continued to live much as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> Muslims were poor and persecuted. In 638, his fourth year as caliph and the seventeenth year 17 since the Hijra, he decreed that the Islamic calendar should be counted from the year of the Hijra of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina.|$|E
25|$|While {{thinking}} of {{an approach that}} would appeal to an audience outside of rock music, and wondering {{about the nature of}} pop music, Yamaguchi thought of the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach as something that transcended time and genre. Yamaguchi wrote the song as a documentary of the specific feelings that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> listening to Bach at night time. He wrote the song as a love song, inspired by everyday things. The imagery in the song was inspired by music interacting with the brain of someone falling asleep, creating mixed-up dreams.|$|E

25|$|Season three follows Clark's {{constant}} {{fight against}} the destiny that his biological father, Jor-El, has in-store for him, and his guilt over the price Jonathan paid {{to bring him back}} to Smallville. Lex deals with the psychological breakdown <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> stranded on a deserted island, while the conflict between him and his father comes to a final blow. Clark's secret begins to weigh heavily on Pete, and the relationship between Clark and Lana hits a dead end.

25|$|Leosthenes (Greek: Λεωσθένης; died 323 BC) was an Athenian who was {{commander}} of the combined Greek army in the Lamian War. Leosthenes is usually identified {{as the son of}} that Leosthenes who had suffered exile in 362/1 BC and who had fled to the court of Philip II. It is unknown by what means he had obtained the high reputation <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he first makes his appearance in history. It has been generally inferred, from a passage in Strabo, that he had first served under Alexander the Great in Asia; but it now seems certain that this is a mistake, and rather the reference should have been to Leonnatus.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

[...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was penned by Yankovic after he remembered the enjoyment <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he combined a classic rock track with a recent movie topic with his 1985 song [...] "Yoda". Yankovic decided to combine the plot of the recent movie Jurassic Park—a film about a park on a fictional island where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs.|$|E
500|$|St. Leger, who was brevetted a {{brigadier general}} for the expedition, {{assembled}} a diverse force consisting of British regulars from the 8th and 34th Regiments, {{a number of}} artillerymen, 80 jäger from Hesse-Hanau, 350 Loyalists from the King's Royal Regiment of New York, a company of Butler's Rangers, and about 100 Canadien laborers. [...] His artillery consisted of two six-pound pieces, two 3-pounders, and four small mortars. He expected these to be adequate for the taking of a dilapidated fort with about 60 defenders, which was the latest intelligence <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> the expedition left Lachine, near Montreal, on June 23.|$|E

There's a painful part of the scene where his father just unloads on him and tells him every hateful thing he ever thought about him and Sam can't defend himself. We found that fascinating – Sam has killed a man, he's killed a White Walker, he's emerged as such a great hero, but he still can't stand up to his dad." ...|$|E

Beyoncé said that not being prom queen in the video reminded her of how she never wore the coveted tiara at her own high school dance.

500|$|Jerome {{otherwise}} had a {{dim view of}} the Arabs. His prejudices {{were those}} of a native Roman. Born in Strido (in modern Croatia or Slovenia), near Aquileia, and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, and the city of Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: [...] "Ciceronianus es, non Christianus", [...] "you are a Ciceronian, not a Christian". In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of Chalcis, he tells of the joy <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. All he had to hear during the day were the [...] "barbarous" [...] languages of the natives (that is, Syriac and Arabic). From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.|$|E
500|$|Hammerstein, meanwhile, was in Los Angeles at {{the filming}} of South Pacific. [...] While at the commissary, he met {{longtime}} friend, Joe Fields, who mentioned that he was negotiating {{for the rights to}} The Flower Drum Song. [...] Intrigued by the title, Hammerstein asked for a copy of the novel, and decided that it had potential as a musical – the lyricist described it as [...] "sort of a Chinese Life with Father". [...] Hammerstein consulted with Rodgers, and they agreed to make it their next work, to be written and produced in association with Fields. [...] Hammerstein began work in mid-1958. [...] In July, however, he fell ill and was hospitalized for a month. [...] This forced him to hurry his writing, as the production team had hoped to have the show in rehearsal by the start of September; this was postponed by two weeks. [...] In interviews, however, Hammerstein pointed out that <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> <b>when</b> necessary, written songs for previous shows while in rehearsals for them.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} [...] "Cold as Ice" [...] {{is based on}} a {{relationship}} Cox had with a girl named Alice. Having fallen in love with her in the fifth grade, he proposed to marry her on the school's playground. Alice rejected Cox, calling the ring he had given her [...] "a cheap piece of crap." [...] Years later, Cox worked with Alice at a Subway restaurant. Occasionally, [...] "for no reason", she would ask him to watch her change into her uniform in the restaurant's refrigerator, which he described as having been as [...] "cold as ice". Cox suspects that [...] "she was trying to torture me or something." [...] The song [...] "Bite Marks" [...] is about [...] "sadomasochism and boy prostitution." [...] In the song, Cox references an experience <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he was kissing a man who bit him [...] "really, really hard" [...] on his shoulder, leaving bite marks [...] "for like two weeks." [...] This experience, along with other abuses he received as a child, formed the lyrical basis of the song.|$|E

He's the slump-breaking type, a guy who can throw a shutout once in a while". After a poor season without Houtteman in 1951, Rolfe predicted, [...] "We'll be back in the first division this season because Art Houtteman is back. Houtteman makes us at least a dozen games better than [...] ". Houtteman worked out in Detroit with pitcher Ted Gray over the winter before the 1952 season. Before the season started, Houtteman said, [...] "It all depends on how I get off. I'm anxious to get into the season. My arm doesn't feel any different than it did in '50. I hope I can do even better than my last year". Houtteman also took number21 on his uniform, the number <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>when</b> he first arrived with the Tigers, because he felt that it had given both him and teammate George Kell, who won a batting title with the number, good luck.|$|E
