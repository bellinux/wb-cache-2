This article {{adopts a}} 2 -UPSþUP (U, P, and <b>S</b> are <b>universal</b> <b>joint,</b> the {{prismatic}} joint, and sphere joint, respectively) parallel mechanism as the leg {{mechanism of the}} quadruped walking robot based on the bionic concept and the motion capacity of the leg mechanism. The article investigates the kinematics (including the leg mechanism and the whole mechanism), gait planning, control, and experiment in detail. The following tasks are conducted: (1) designing the whole mechanism and developing the kinematics equations for both the leg mechanism and the whole mechanism; (2) planning the trotting gait and designing the foot trajectory based on the robot characteristics and conducting the kinematics analysis; (3) building the control system of the robot using self-developed controllers and drivers and studying the compound position control strategy; and (4) conducting the experiments for validating the controller, the compound position control strategy, the trotting pace, carrying capacity, and human-carrying walking. The results confirm that the proposed human-carrying walking robot has good performance {{and it is also}} verified that the controller and the compound position control strategy are suitable...|$|R
40|$|<b>Universal</b> <b>joint</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} which has been widely used in industrial field. Study of the workspace of <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> is very important since {{the size of their}} workspace can directly affect workspace of the mechanisms using them. To explore the workspace of <b>universal</b> <b>joints,</b> a mathematical model was developed, by which the workspace of <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> can be exactly and conveniently calculated based on their geometric parameters. The relationship between the workspace and geometric parameters of <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> was explored. In the mathematical model, several parameters such as the wing height, the wing width, the cone angle of the workspace and the maximum operating angle of <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> are defined to depict their workspace profile, the desired workspace of <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> can be obtained through changing these parameters. A design example is provided to illustrate the design procedures of a <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> based on the proposed model.

50|$|The term <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> {{was used}} in the 18th century and was in common use in the 19th century. Edmund Morewood's 1844 patent for a metal coating machine called for a <b>universal</b> <b>joint,</b> by that name, to {{accommodate}} small alignment errors between the engine and rolling mill shafts. Ephriam Shay's locomotive patent of 1881, for example, used double <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> in the locomotive's drive shaft. Charles Amidon used a much smaller <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> in his bit-brace patented 1884.

50|$|The main {{concept of}} the <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> {{is based on the}} design of gimbals, which have been in use since antiquity. One {{anticipation}} of the <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> was its use by the ancient Greeks on ballistae. In Europe the <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> is often called the Cardano joint or Cardan shaft, after the Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano; however, in his writings, he mentioned only gimbal mountings, not <b>universal</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gear {{couplings}} and <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> {{are used}} in similar applications. Gear couplings have higher torque densities than <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> designed to fit a given space while <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> induce lower vibrations. The limit on torque density in <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> {{is due to the}} limited cross sections of the cross and yoke. The gear teeth in a gear coupling have high backlash to allow for angular misalignment. The excess backlash can contribute to vibration.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{kinematic}} analyses of four translational parallel manipulators (3 RPC, SPS + 2 RPC, RPPR + 2 RPC and RPPR + 2 PPP) articulated with linear actuators. They are based on serially connected chains which are connected with cylindrical (C), prismatic (P), revolute (R), spherical (<b>S)</b> and <b>universal</b> (U) <b>joints.</b> Of these manipulators, the one which is a fully decoupled, fully isotropic and singularity-free translational parallel manipulator (RPPR+ 2 PPP) offers a one-to-one correspondence between its input and output displacement. This makes its forward and inverse position analyses simpler {{with a set of}} linear equations to be solved. Although the other manipulators have coupled kinematics, they still have simpler forward kinematic equations over other well-known translational parallel manipulators reported in the literature. We also employ screw theory to undertake the velocity and acceleration analyses. The primary contribution of this manuscript is to show how the 3 -RPC translational parallel manipulator can be gradually modified in order to obtain a fully isotropic, fully decoupled and singularity-free translational parallel manipulator...|$|R

If the presented research were used along with maintenance measures recommended in the paper and with proper use, the level of reliability of the shafts would be 2. 1 times higher. The presented results of the research showed that needle bearings, i. e. bearing assemblies of the joints, are the most critical elements on <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> shafts and are possible causes of their lower reliability.

40|$|A {{series of}} torque tests were {{performed}} on four flight-type hex ball <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> in order to characterize and determine the actual load-carrying capability of this device.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three {{methods to}} solve the inverse position kinematics position problem of the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> attached to a manipulator: (1) an analytical solution for two specific cases; (2) an approximate closed form solution based on ignoring the wrist offset; and (3) an iterative method which repeats closed form position and orientation calculations until the solution is achieved. Several manipulators are used to demonstrate the solution methods: cartesian, cylindrical, spherical, and an anthropomorphic articulated arm, based on the Flight Telerobotic Servicer (FTS) arm. A singularity analysis is presented for the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist attached to the above manipulator arms. While the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist standing alone is singularity-free in orientation, the singularity analysis indicates the presence of coupled position/orientation singularities of the spherical and articulated manipulators with the wrist. The cartesian and cylindrical manipulators with the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist {{were found to be}} singularity-free. The methods of this paper can be implemented in a real-time controller for manipulators with the double <b>universal</b> <b>joint</b> wrist.

40|$|Lecturepg. 27 A major {{chemical}} company has implemented a cost reduction and performance enhancement via <b>universal</b> <b>joints</b> on a melt pump application.
