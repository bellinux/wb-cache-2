500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds <b>deep,</b> <b>deep,</b> <b>deep,</b> <b>deep,</b> deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E

She described it as sad to shoot, as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline, and explained: [...] "What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri. You see the fear." [...] Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant: [...] "I think people have been asking 'How slow is this guy?!'. But [...] Will finally reflects {{that he is a}} fully evolved human being and puts two and two together." [...] She noted that while Will and Emma [...] "are adorable together", she still believes in Terri and Will as a couple: [...] "I think that she really loves him. People do crazy things out of <b>deep,</b> <b>deep</b> insecurity. She's obviously flawed, but I think she has love in her heart."

2500|$|... {{so much is}} made of the <b>deep,</b> <b>deep</b> exculpatory {{shame of}} illiteracy– {{despite the fact that}} burning 300 people to death doesn't require reading skills– that some worshipful {{accounts}} of the novel (by those who buy into its ludicrous premise, perhaps because it's been declared [...] "classic" [...] and [...] "profound") actually seem to affirm that illiteracy is something more to be ashamed of than participating in mass murder... Lack of reading skills is more disgraceful than listening in bovine silence to the screams of 300 people as they are burned to death behind the locked doors of a church you're guarding to prevent them from escaping the flames. Which is what Hanna did, although, of course, it's not shown in the film.|$|E
2500|$|German {{chancellor}} Angela Merkel {{has repeatedly}} opposed full membership of Turkey to the EU on German-Turkish summits, advocating instead a privileged partnership. Some Christian Democrats back fuller support for Turkey, risking the chancellor becoming more isolated in advocating for a [...] "privileged partnership". In September 2011, {{on the occasion}} of the visit of the Turkish president Gül, Merkel said: [...] "We don't want the full membership of Turkey. But we don't want to lose Turkey as an important country", referring to her idea of a strategic partnership. In 2006, Chancellor Merkel said [...] "Turkey could be in <b>deep,</b> <b>deep</b> trouble when it comes to its aspirations to join the European Union" [...] regarding its refusal to open up its ports to European Union member Cyprus. Again in 2014, when Erdogan urged Merkel to strongly support his country's bid, there was no sign the chancellor had relinquished her skepticism. She revealed after the two had talked: [...] "I personally said that we are in a negotiation process that has certain outcome and no fixed time frame. It is no secret and nothing has changed in my view that I am sceptical about full membership for Turkey." [...] In a TV debate in September 2017, German chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger Martin Schulz both said that they would seek an end to Turkey’s membership talks with the European Union.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{weeks after}} the Eclipse, Golden Horn was the only three-year-old {{scheduled}} to contest the 55th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles at Ascot Racecourse. On the eve of the race, Gosden indicated that colt had made further progress, saying [...] "Golden Horn's been fine since the Eclipse and even progressed physically - he's filled out. We always thought that he was a good, proper horse, but he just seems that much more streetwise - harder and tougher now." [...] Heavy rain on the day before the race softened the ground and led to the withdrawal of the only French challenger Flintshire. After walking the course {{on the morning of the}} race, Gosden withdrew Golden Horn, saying [...] "It is very frustrating... The ground in the straight would be no problem - it's just the old track. It rides <b>deep,</b> <b>deep</b> down there and holding. If it was all on the new track I wouldn't hesitate on running, but it is not. Once I got down to Swinley Bottom the stick went in 12 inches and made a pop sound as it came out... He can go on good to soft no problem. He can probably go on genuine soft, but I don't want to involve him in a sticky, holding ground". In Golden Horn's absence the race was won by Postponed.|$|E
