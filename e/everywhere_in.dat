5|$|English {{language}} {{learning and teaching}} is an important economic activity, and includes language schooling, tourism spending, and publishing. There is no legislation mandating an official language for England, but English is the only language used for official business. Despite the country's relatively small size, there are many distinct regional accents, and individuals with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the country.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> Shakespeare. As elsewhere, he crosses the boundaries of plays and enumerates subtle differences between even the fairy characters, in this case in an extensive comparison of Puck in this play and Ariel in The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, koalas are {{unevenly}} distributed and uncommon {{except in}} the southeast, where they are numerous. In New South Wales, they are abundant only in Pilliga, while in Victoria they are common nearly <b>everywhere.</b> <b>In</b> South Australia, koalas were extirpated by 1920 and subsequently reintroduced. Koalas {{can be found in}} habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool temperate. In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.|$|E

5|$|Isidore {{was widely}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle Ages, feeding directly into word lists and encyclopaedias by Papias, Huguccio, Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Vincent of Beauvais, {{as well as}} being used <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the form of small snippets. He was cited by Dante Alighieri, quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, and his name was mentioned by the poets Bocaccio, Petrarch and John Gower among others. Dante {{went so far as to}} place Isidore in Paradise in the final part of his Divine Comedy, Paradiso (10.130–131).|$|E
5|$|Most {{recreation}} {{takes place}} around Lake Inari, although {{a limited number}} of visitors hike into the fells. The reserve is a demanding hiking area and inexperienced hikers are recommended to avoid traversing the wilderness. The freedom to roam grants everyone the right to hike, ski and short-term camping <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the area. The park can be accessed from National Road 971 and 969; public transport is available to Nellim.|$|E

Rockefeller also provided financial support to such established eastern institutions as Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley and Vassar.|$|E

5|$|The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of owl {{and one of the}} most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.|$|E
5|$|The great {{significance}} {{of religion in}} the culture of Roman Switzerland is illustrated by the imposing size and central location of the Roman temples in the cities, {{as well as by the}} great number of religious artifacts found by archaeologists. As <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the Empire, the Imperial cult was practiced in Switzerland; it had a particularly prominent temple in the center of the forum of Nyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} in November 1918 led in Württemberg, like <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> Germany, {{to the end}} of the monarchy. King William II left Stuttgart on 9November, shortly after a revolutionary crowd had stormed his residence, the Wilhelm Palais and flown a red flag above the building. On the very same day the demonstrators were also able to seize some of Stuttgart's barracks, where parts of the garrisons openly joined them. Rau took active part in the events in Stuttgart's streets on this and the following day.|$|E

5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, {{one can see the}} solidified lava (igneous rock) most <b>everywhere.</b> <b>In</b> the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, and <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared Chirp, while {{attempting}} to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order {{to talk to his}} girlfriend, Gracie. Iris, however, refused because Gracie was in bed. Later that night, Iris is bitten when her staple remover turns into a snake; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the bathroom.|$|E
5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is <b>everywhere</b> <b>in</b> the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
