5|$|Besides {{having the}} world's largest {{collection}} of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part <b>in</b> <b>research</b> and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured patterns on the beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used <b>in</b> <b>research</b> in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in {{contrast to the}} typical 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
