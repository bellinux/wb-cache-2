Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} go out on the town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> were to learn that he no longer lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denialâ€” within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

Testifying against the various segregationist plans were members of the NAACP and several Northern Virginia legislators. As the hearings ended, Delegates Lucas Phillipps and Frank Moncure introduced a bill to bar the Virginia State Board of Education from denying accreditation to any private school because its building did not meet state standards. (Many legislators believed that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> schools closed, [...] "white academies" [...] would spring up to offer segregated private education.

In Jackson's first interview since 1993 and Presley's first ever, Diane Sawyer quizzed the pair on their private life with, according to Jet, a series of [...] "insensitive" [...] questions. Presley boasted that she and Jackson had regular sex, following Sawyer's questioning their sex life. When asked if the marriage was a sham, Presley asserted that such rumors were [...] "crap"; {{she said she would}} never marry someone for any other reason than being in love with him, and concluded that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> thought differently, they could [...] "eat it". The following day, Presley reflected that the interview had been a disaster; she had hoped the couple would be perceived as being serious, yet Jackson fooled around during the show, at one point holding two fingers behind his wife's head to make bunny ears. Presley's friend Monica Pastelle revealed that it was at this point that Presley began to wonder whether she had made a mistake in choosing Jackson as a long-term partner.|$|E
