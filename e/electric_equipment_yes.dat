40|$|Abstract. To {{decrease}} the cost {{brought by the}} electric energy waste, a three-phase equilibrium distribution soft-switching system is proposed. The system guarantees three-phase equilibrium. Firstly, the inverter tracks the original access phase to be synchronous, then switch the <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> to the inverter. Secondly, the inverter tracks the alternative access phase to be synchronous, then switch the <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> to the alternative access phase to accomplish the soft-switching. Experiment is used to carry out verification for this system. The result shows {{that there is no}} impulse current when the <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> switches. The system achieves “soft-switching”...|$|R

40|$|This study compares data envelopment {{analysis}}-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA) with Altman's financial {{ratio analysis}} {{to identify the}} position of DEA-DA in financial performance analysis. Then, this study applies DEA-DA to examine whether Research and Development (R&D) expenditure influences the financial performance of Japanese machinery industry and <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> industry. The investigation of DEA-DA identifies that the R&D expenditure makes {{a positive impact on}} the financial performance of Japanese machinery industry, but it yields a negative impact on Japanese <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> industry. The result implies that the influence of R&D expenditure on financial performance (including the avoidance of bankruptcy) depends upon the type of a manufacturing industry. A rationale regarding why such a discrepancy has occurred between the two Japanese manufacturing industries is because the life cycle of <b>electric</b> <b>equipments</b> is shorter than that of the machinery products. Furthermore, the <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> industry faces more fierce competition than the machinery industry. This study suggests that the Japanese <b>electric</b> <b>equipment</b> industry needs R&D expenditure for competition in its global market. However, it is a high risk and high return investment. In contrast, the Japanese machinery is a technologically mature industry where the R&D expenditure influences positively its financial performance. In this sense, the R&D expenditure is a low risk and necessary investment. DEA Discriminant analysis R&D Japanese manufacturing Bankruptcy...|$|R
