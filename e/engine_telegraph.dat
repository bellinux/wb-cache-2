40|$|The {{concept of}} the General Purpose Technology (GPT) of the late 1990 s is a {{culmination}} of many evolutionairy views in innovation-thinking. By definition the GPT considers the technical, social, and economic effects of meta-technologies like steam-technology and electric technology. This paper uses Schumpeter’s concept of ’cluster on innovations’ to create insight {{in the nature of}} the GPT- Electricity. Complementing the earlier presented invention of the Steam Engine, Electromotive Engine and Electric Light (Kooij, 2015 a), three additional case studies are presented about the Content of the invention of the Communication <b>Engines</b> <b>Telegraph,</b> Telephone and Wireless. In addition, the Context for these inventions is presented. We found that these inventions— better ’clusters of innovations’— were the core elements in the technical contributions to the Second Industrial Revolution. These General Purpose Engines (GPE) that used electricity as carrier of information in stead of power, fuelled the Communication Revolution and made ’electricity’ contribute so considerably to the Second Industrial Revolution.

In 2001, an American couple – David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller – caused controversy {{when they were}} married aboard a submersible that had set down on the bow of Titanic, in a deliberate echo of a famous scene from James Cameron's 1997 film. The wedding was essentially a publicity stunt, sponsored by a British company called SubSea Explorer which had offered a free dive to Titanic that Leibowitz had won. He asked whether his fiancée could come too {{and was told that}} she could– but only if she agreed to get married during the trip. The same company also brought along Philip Littlejohn, the grandson of one of Titanics surviving crew members, who became the first relative of a Titanic passenger or crew member to visit the wreck. Cameron himself also returned to Titanic in 2001 to carry out filming for Walt Disney Pictures' Ghosts of the Abyss, filmed in 3D.|$|R
