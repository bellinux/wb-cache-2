5|$|Midstate Television {{was bought}} out by media magnate Paul Ramsay's Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> merged with Ramcorp's other stations, RVN/AMV and NEN/ECN. In 1988, Midstate Television was renamed Prime Television {{and began to}} show {{increased}} Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation.|$|E
5|$|An RAF {{technician}} {{with the}} force dismantled the Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces, after which the force withdrew to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had initially failed to do so, but the German force guarding <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> eliminated {{with the help of}} the main force. The raiding troops were picked up by landing craft, then transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which returned them to Britain.|$|E
50|$|The next scene {{involves}} the Parade of Wooden Soldiers. The narrator compliments the uniform marching but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> revealed {{that they are}} walking rather sloppily and are all wobbly.|$|R
60|$|B. This terrace {{higher up}} the valley expands considerably; seaward <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> lost, its {{escarpment}} being united with that of C: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not developed {{at all on the}} south side of the valley.|$|R

5|$|As {{a sophomore}} at Georgia Southern in 1990, Hamilton had an 18–4 record with a 3.07 ERA. He was one of nine finalists for the Golden Spikes Award, and he earned Second Team All-American honors from The Sporting News and Baseball America. However, at the {{beginning}} of his junior season he went 13 with a 7.43 ERA after starting five games. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> discovered that Hamilton was suffering from an elbow injury, which forced him to have surgery in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially {{designed for the}} geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|Digidesign {{was working}} on {{expanding}} ProTools from a single track to multitracking and {{it was hoped that}} as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Apple Quadra 400/500 models and with a great effort by all, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> evident that magnetic tape would have to be used.|$|E
50|$|Roseanna Dunne {{returns home}} {{only to learn}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> to <b>be</b> seized if further {{payments}} cannot be made. Jessie informs her that she has {{heard on the radio}} that Jim Telligrew has killed Jim Shaloo.|$|R
50|$|Spock soon becomes {{involved}} in a mission to retrieve the 'Vulcan's Glory', a priceless gem long thought lost in a spaceship crash. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> discovered there <b>is</b> far more to this mission then readily apparent.|$|R

5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to have understood the limits of the stop lines and never expected them to hold out indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|On the east, {{the road}} over Independence Pass was paved in 1967. The Rio Grande {{discontinued}} passenger train service to Aspen in 1969. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> replaced the next year, when {{the completion of}} Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon connected the western terminus of Highway 82 to the larger Interstate Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with the money to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
5000|$|... 1948: WHAM-O founded - For {{about a year}} in the fifties, {{the company}} tries to brand their {{sporting}} goods under the name WAMO. The sporting goods buyers don't care for the switch, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> dropped.|$|R

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> {{noted that}} Sparx seems more {{comfortable}} in her Sparx persona than as D.C. Force. She develops romantic feelings for Superboy, then later, the hero known as Hero. She is rocked when she finds Hero is gay.|$|R
5|$|The Oak Room at the Algonquin {{was long}} one of New York City's premier cabaret nightclubs. Opened in 1939 (as the Oak Room Supper Club), <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> closed {{on account of}} World War II, reopened as a regular venue in 1980, and closed for good in 2012. (Before 1939, it had been called the Pergola Room {{and was the first}} meeting place of what became the Algonquin Round Table).|$|E
5|$|The Phantom entered {{service with}} both the Fleet Air Arm and the RAF in 1969. In the Royal Navy it had a {{secondary}} strike role {{in addition to its}} primary use for fleet air defence, while in the RAF <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> replaced in the strike role by other aircraft designed specifically for strike and close air support. By the mid-1970s it had become the UK's principal interceptor, a role in which it continued until the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid (<b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> used for poison gas instead).|$|E

25|$|Lamp/Drake: A {{sinister}} {{politician who}} seeks the total destruction of all robots. Initially portrayed as wholly evil, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> {{found that his}} profound hatred of robots stems from something more personal; he is the polar opposite of Duke Red.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} cruisers does not respond to the awakening signal. The other cruiser, however, is refloated and re-activated, with heavy damage to vital ship components. A course is plotted for a nearby, disused wet-dock.|$|R
5|$|The showrunner for {{the tenth}} season was Mike Scully. Before {{production}} began, a salary {{dispute between the}} main cast members of The Simpsons and Fox arose. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> settled and the actors' salaries were raised to $125,000 per episode. In addition to the large Simpsons cast, many guest stars appeared in season ten, including Phil Hartman in his last appearance before his death.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E
25|$|Urine is {{a liquid}} {{by-product}} of metabolism in {{the bodies of}} many animals, including humans. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> expelled from the kidneys and flows through the ureters to the urinary bladder, from which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> excreted from the body through the urethra during urination.|$|R

I {{leave all}} to you, only let <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>soon,</b> else some gay young lover will appear, {{and take you}} from me," [...] said Sir John, playfully, anxious to chase away the dark {{expression}} which had stolen over Jean's face.|$|R
50|$|Roscoe,a {{champion}} pinball player, {{is found}} dead. He {{appears to have}} multiple relationships, and a fierce rivalry with the security guard, Horace. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>soon</b> revealed that his girlfriends beat him not quite to death, but another suspect named Gerald finished Roscoe off.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{disagreements}} {{in management}} and poor communication, construction began on both routes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> {{obvious that the}} southern route was unfeasible given the remote area, technology {{available at the time}} and the rough terrain of the San Rafael Swell. The D spent $217,470 (1883, equivalent to $4.6million in 2007) on the project before declaring it a failure. One of the accounts in the book Utah Ghost Rails states the railroad fired the lead surveyor, even though the workers had graded a path past the San Rafael Reef. This route today is a jeep trail. According to a sign placed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), had the southern route succeeded {{it would have been the}} shortest transcontinental railroad in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, {{both the}} piano version and the orchestral version were published. The first edition was a piano version by the Brandis & Dufour {{who made it}} {{available}} {{on the day of}} the premiere, based on Rossini's piano version but reduced to only one piano, also cutting passages. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> followed by editions from Chappell in London, Ricordi in Milan, and Oliver Ditson in Boston, somewhat later by B. Schotts Söhne. These four prints have in common that they were settings for harmonium and only one piano. Ricordi published a piano reduction of the orchestral score rather than following Rossini's original piano version. Some versions failed to mention that Rossini intended the work to be accompanied by two pianos.|$|E
