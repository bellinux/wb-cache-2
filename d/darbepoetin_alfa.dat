50|$|In {{terms of}} its structure, Mircera {{is similar to the}} {{previous}} synthetic EPO drugs, except that it is connected to a chemical called polyethylene glycol (PEG), which makes it last longer in the body.

CERAs thus promise both lower dosing—significant owing to the high inherent cost of manufacturing recombinant protein drugs—and less frequent injections for patients. ESAs are administered via subcutaneous injections, often in doctor's offices for patients who lack the skill or dexterity to inject themselves, so the once- or twice-monthly dosing regimen for CERAs promises fewer costly, inconvenient office visits for patients requiring constant hemoglobin level maintenance for chronic kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|Aim: <b>Darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa,</b> an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein, has {{a longer}} serum {{half-life}} than recombinant human erythropoietin, allowing less-frequent administration. This study aimed {{to demonstrate that}} once-monthly (QM) <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> administration would maintain haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis who had previously been administered <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> every 2 weeks (Q 2 W). Methods: This was a multicentre study in which subjects with CKD receiving stable Q 2 W <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> doses and with stable Hb (100 – 130 g/L) were started on QM <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> dosing. The initial QM <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> dose was equivalent to the cumulative <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> dose administered during the month preceding enrolment. <b>Darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> doses were titrated to maintain Hb concentrations between 100 and 130 g/L. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects maintaining mean Hb 0 e; 100 g/L during the evaluation period (weeks 21 – 33). Results: Sixty-six subjects {{were enrolled in the}} study and all received at least one dose of darbepoetin alfa; 55 (83 %) had mean Hb 0 e; 100 g/L during evaluation. Mean (SD) Hb concentrations at baseline and during the evaluation period were 119 (8. 7) g/L and 114 (9. 8) g/L, respectively. The median QM <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> dose at baseline and during the evaluation period was 80 μg. <b>Darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> was considered to be well-tolerated. Conclusion: Patients with CKD not receiving dialysis who are receiving <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> Q 2 W can be safely and effectively extended to <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> QM.

The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 576 of 1136 patients (50. 7 %) in the <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> group and 565 of 1142 patients (49. 5 %) {{in the placebo group}} (hazard ratio in the <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> group, 1. 01; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 90 to 1. 13; P = 0. 87). There was no significant between-group difference in any of the secondary outcomes. The neutral effect of <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> was consistent across all prespecified subgroups. Fatal or nonfatal stroke occurred in 42 patients (3. 7 %) in the <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> group and 31 patients (2. 7 %) in the placebo group (P = 0. 23).

Objective:The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy andtolerability of long-term (24 -week) <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> treatment in maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in the target range of 10 to 13 g/dL in patients undergoing dialysis; the patients were switched from rHuEPO to a less-frequent dosing regimen of <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> without an increase in dose. Methods:In this Phase IIlb, open-label, multicenter study, patients withend-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing dialysis who were receiving rHuEPO BIW or TIW at baseline were switched to <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> QW; patients receiving rHuEPO QW were switched to <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> Q 2 W Administration of <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> was by the same route as previous rHuEPO administration (IV or SC). Patients received <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> for 24 weeks, including a 20 -week drug titration period followed by a 4 -week, stable-dose evaluation period. The mode, dose, and frequency of administration of <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> were compared with those of baseline rHuEPO. Tolerability assessment was based on spontaneous reporting and laboratory tests (hematology, vital sign measurement, iron status, and biochemistry). Results:The study comprised 173 patients who were divided into 2 groups by route of administration (IV group, n = 146; SC group, n = 27). Mean (SE) adjusted increases in Hb concentration from baseline to the evaluation period for patients receiving <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> QW were 0. 94 (0. 32) g/dL and 0. 38 (0. 30) g/dL for the IV or SC routes, respectively (P = 0. 004 and NS, respectively). For patients receiving <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> Q 2 W the mean (SE) adjusted increases in Hb concentration were 0. 08 (0. 53) g/dL and 0. 48 (0. 35) g/dL for the IV and SC routes, respectively (both, P = NS). No significant differences in IV/SC dose ratio were observed between the 2 routes of administration. In addition, no increases in <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> dose were observed. The most commonly reported adverse events were hypertension (8 patients [5 %]) and vascular access thrombosis (4 [2 %]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 6 (3 %). Conclusions:Darbepoetin alfa effectively maintained Hb concentrations within the target range without an increase in dose, even at a reduced dosing frequency. Overall, <b>darbepoetin</b> <b>alfa</b> was well tolerated...|$|E
