In November 1873 the Monmouthshire Railway approached the Sirhowy with an offer to buy their concern for £295,000. Negotiations continued in 1874, and then it appeared certain that the Great Western Railway would conclude a deal. The GWR promoted a Parliamentary Bill in the 1875 session for a new line connecting Nine Mile Point and Caerleon, so by-passing Newport, which was heavily congested at the time. In fact it was the LNWR which started working trains over the Sirhowy line from 1 July 1875, and on 21 August 1875 a working agreement was concluded; this was enabled by a <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> on the Sirhowy Company’s Act of 1865. Sirhowy Company debentures to the extent of £56,633 were taken on by the LNWR, and Sirhowy ordinary and preference stock was exchanged for an equivalent amount of LNWR interest bearing stock. All this was ratified by the London and North Western Railway (Sirhowy Railway Vesting) Act of 13 July 1876.|$|E

40|$|NÁZOV PRÁCE V ANGLICKOM JAZYKU <b>General</b> <b>Clause</b> of Unfair Competition in Czech-Slovak Comparative View ABSTRACT The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to analyse {{and to deal with}} the Section 44 (1) Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll, Commercial Code, as amended. This {{provision}} stipulates the <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> of unfair competition, which consists of three conditions. These have to be fulfilled cumulatively to classify some conduct as unfair. Simultaneously, analyzing the conditions of <b>general</b> <b>clause,</b> we want to point out at the differences between legal regulation according to the czech Commercial Code and the Commercial Code of the Slovak Republic and compare them reciprocally. Thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter One deals with development of the unfair competition law in Europe, but particularly also on the territory of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. In this chapter we deal also with the Act against the unfair competition of the first Czechoslovak Republic. Second chapter offers the general information on the <b>general</b> <b>clause,</b> its function and its relation to the special subject matters of unfair competition. A component part of this chapter is an analysis of the relation of the prohibition of unfair competition to the special subject matters from the view of theory of law and the legislative technique.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} some {{questions}} of general character {{raised by the}} Law. First, the author comes {{to the conclusion that}} the Law cannot be principally considered as "lex generalis" in relation to trademark or copyight law. The "lex generalis - lex specialis" relation may only be established with regard to particular norms contained in the respective regulations. The second point is the relation between the <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> of unfair competition (Art. 3) and its specific torts. The author indicates that the <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> may be used to cover cases not provided for by specific provisions, or to correct such provisions if drawn too broadly, or to exclude claims based on the specific provisions, but not justified under the <b>general</b> <b>clause.</b> Finally, the author considers that there is no reason to construct an exclusive subjective right to enterprise as a theoretical basis for unfair competition claims.

40|$|The paper {{reveals the}} birth and {{evolution}} of the British precedent Rylands v. Fletcher that, once adopted {{on the other side}} of the Ocean (in United States), gave rise to a <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> of liability for abnormally dangerous activities recognized by the § 20 of the American Restatements of the Law Third, Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm. The main goal of the paper was to analyze the development of the legal doctrine and of the case law posterior to the precedent together with the intent of the British judicature to leapfrog from the traditional rule contained in Rylands v. Fletcher to a <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> similar to that introduced in the United States and recently also on the European level. As it is well known, within the scope of tort law two different initiatives compete with the aim of harmonizing the European laws: European Group on Tort Law with its Principles of European Tort Law (hereinafter PETL) in which article 5 : 101 sets forth a <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> for strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities and Study Group on European Civil Code with its Common Frame of Reference (CFR) which promotes rather ad hoc model of listing out determined cases of strict liability. Very narrow application scope of the art. 5 : 101 PETL, restricted only to abnormally dangerous activities, stays in opposition to very broad spectrum of strict liability cases governed by the CFR. The former is a perfect example of a <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> that offers a minimum and basic standard, possibly acceptable also in those countries in which, like in the United Kingdom, this regime of liability is completely marginalized...|$|E

40|$|Under Swedish tax law; the <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> in the Tax Avoidance Act is {{a method}} to prevent tax evasion. The purpose of the <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> is to prevent any tax {{avoidance}} procedures that the legislator {{has not been able}} to foresee. For the <b>general</b> <b>clause</b> to be applicable, four prerequisites need to be met. This thesis analyses the fourth prerequisite based on the principle of legality. The prerequisite concludes that a determination of the tax base, based on the procedure in question, is in conflict with the purpose of the legislation. The prerequisite has been criticized for being difficult to apply. As tax laws are applied beyond the scope of the legislation, it has also been considered that taxation is made without statutory basis, which is conflicting with the principle of legality. The principle of legality requires the application of law to be predictable and without arbitrary. Therefore, in order to collect taxes there is a requirement of legal authority. Of this requirement, it has been deduced a prohibition on application by analogy of tax laws. Of relevance to the relation between the fourth prerequisite and the principle of legality is what legal value the principle is considered to have. It has been discussed whether the principle of legality can be codified in the constitution. It has been found that the principle of legality is expressed in the Instrument of Government. It is not considered to be any controversies between the fourth prerequisite and the principle of legality, as there is a legal authority for the taxation that occurs under the <b>general</b> <b>clause.</b> It is also not considered to be any illicit delegations, as the courts only rule on whether the practice is in contrast to tax legislation purposes, and not legislate. The taxpayer therefore has to take the purpose of the legislation into consideration when measures are taken for tax avoidance purposes...|$|E
