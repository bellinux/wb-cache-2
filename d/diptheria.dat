The study {{was aimed at}} determining the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility against nasal infecting microorganisms. 50 clinical samples were taken from OPD of GMC Hospital, Bhopal (MP), India. Of the samples analyzed, 47 bacterial strains were isolated out of which 29 strains were of Gram positive bacteria (8 strains were of Staphylococcus aureus, 6 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 7 of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 8 of Corynebacterium <b>diptheriae)</b> and 18 strains were of Gram negative bacteria (8 of Escherichia coli, 6 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 of Neisseria meningitidis). Antimicrobial susceptibility assay was performed by disc diffusion method according to the reference criteria of clinical and laboratory standard institute guidelines. In the present study antibiotic susceptibility pattern results showed maximum level of resistance in gram positive strains S. aureus 8 (100 %), S. epidermidis 6 (100 %) and C. <b>diptheriae</b> (8 (100 %) against penicillin, S. aureus 8 (100 %), S. epidermidis 6 (100 %) and S. pneumoniae 7 (100 %) were resistant to Cefuroxime, S. aureus 7 (87. 5 %), S. epidermidis 6 (100 %), S. pneumoniae 7 (100 %) and C. <b>diptheriae</b> (8 (100 %) were resistant to erythromycin and azithromycin whereas, rest of gram positive strains showed satisfactory antibiotic susceptibility against chloramphenical, cefazolin, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and tetracyclin. Similarly for gram negative strains multi-drug resistance was observed in 8 (100 %) isolates of E. coli against aztreonam, cefdinir, cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin, P. aeruginosa 6 (100 %) were resistant to aztreonam, cefdinir, cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin, N. meningitidis 4 (100 %) were resistant to aztreonam, cefdinir, cefixime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin whereas rest of gram negative strains showed moderate susceptible against amikacin, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Vaccine shortages {{began to appear in}} November 2000, when supplies of the tetanus and <b>diptheria</b> booster fell short. By October 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported shortages of five vaccines that protect against eight childhood diseases. In addition to <b>diptheria</b> and tetanus vaccines, vaccines to protect against pertussis, invasive pneumococcal disease, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were in short supply. In July 2002, updated CDC data indicated supplies were returning to normal for most vaccines. However, the shortage of vaccine to protect against invasive pneumococcal disease was expected to continue through at least late 2002. Shortages have prompted federal authorities to recommend deferring some vaccinations and have caused most states to reduce or suspend immunization requirements for school and day care programs so that children who have not received all mandatory immunizations can enroll. States are concerned that failure to be vaccinated at a later date may reduce the share of the population protected and increase the potential for disease to spread; however, data are not currently available to measure these effects. Many factors, including production problems and unanticipated demand for new vaccines, contributed to recent shortages. Although problems leading to the shortages have largely been resolved, the potential exists for shortages to recur. Federal agencies and advisory committees are exploring ways to help stabilize the nation's vaccine supply, but few long-term solutions have emerged.

50|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of corynebacterial genomes {{has led to}} the identification of several conserved signature indels which are unique to the genus. Two examples of these conserved signature indels are a two-amino-acid insertion in a conserved region of the enzyme phosphoribose diphosphate:decaprenyl-phosphate phosphoribosyltransferase and a three-amino-acid insertion in acetate kinase, both of which are found only in Corynebacterium species. Both of these indels serve as molecular markers for species of the genus Corynebacterium. Additionally, 16 conserved signature proteins, which are uniquely found in Corynebacterium species, have been identified. Three of the conserved signature proteins have homologs found in the Dietzia genus, which {{is believed to be the}} closest related genus to Corynebacterium.

This thesis investigates ethnobotanical information of seven medicinal plants used by the Dharawal people of Botany Bay that were provided by the Dharawal elders group and community members of the La Perouse Aboriginal community who engaged in continual cultural practice. Endophytic microorganism communities that reside within the plant tissue of each medicinal plant were organised phylogenetically based on 16 S rRNA and 18 S rRNA genes. The culturable endophytes that were identifiable were phylogenetically grouped within ten orders of fungi and three classes of bacteria. These endophytes were also further investigated for biosynthetic potential of natural products via genetic screening targeting enzyme encoding genes, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS). Endophytes that possessed NRPS or PKS encoding genes were subjected to preliminary bioassay tests against a range of bacterial and fungal test organisms. All but one showed activity against at least one test organism. Three endophytes were selected for further compound isolation. Isolation and structure elucidated of bioactive compounds from an endophytic Aspergillus sp. revealed known compounds such as triacylglycerides (SDI- 63), bisabolane sesquiterpenoids (SDI- 66) and a novel bioactive polyketide (SDI- 69) via 1 H, 13 C, and 2 D NMR experiments. Compound SDI- 69 possessed anti-bacterial properties against S. aureus, P. aeroginosa, E. coli, C. <b>diptheriae</b> and B. subtilis at concentrations of 10 μg/mL or 100 μg/mL.

Firstly a vaccine {{is available on the}} market at a constant price through time. Secondly, the vaccine is publicly provided. The vaccine works either by giving partial or full immunity to the disease. We analyse market provision for vaccines providing partial immunity and public provision of both types of vaccine. Infectious diseases have been and are economically and socially costly. In the UK in the 19 th century 30 % of deaths were caused by typhoid, tuberculosis (TB) and typhus [13]. The World Health Organisation [18] estimates that TB causes about three million deaths and eight million new infections per annum. Vaccination against such diseases can either work to give full immunity immediately following vaccination or can work to reduce the chance of infection. For example, vaccines against polio, tetanus and <b>diptheria</b> appear to give certai...|$|E

There is little {{information regarding the}} role of proteolysis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and no studies on the potential involvement of these enzymes in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. The present study initially focused on the characterization {{of a family of}} membrane anchored, cell wall associated, subtilisin-like serine proteases (mycosins- 1 to 5) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These proteases were shown to be constitutively expressed in M. tuberculosis, to be located in the cell wall of the organism and to be potentially shed (either actively or passively) from the wall. Relatively high levels of gamma interferon secretion by T-cells in response to these proteases were observed in Mantoux positive individuals. The absence of any detectable protease activity lead to a protein sequence analysis which indicated that the mycosins are probable mycobacterial-specific proprotein processing proteases. To identify possible substrates for these proteases, the genome sequence regions surrounding the mycosin genes were analyzed. This revealed that the mycosin genes are in fact part of a cluster of 6 to 12 genes which have been duplicated multiple times in the genome of M. tuberculosis. Due to the presence of members of the previously described ESAT- 6 T-cell antigen family within this duplicated region, the five gene cluster regions were named the ESAT- 6 loci. In silico analysis of finished and unfinished genome sequencing data revealed the presence of orthologues of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv ESAT- 6 loci in the genomes of other mycobacteria, e. g. M. tuberculosis CDC 1551, M. tuberculosis 210, M. bovis, M. leprae, M. avium, and the avirulent strain M. smegmatis. Phylogenetic analyses done on the resulting sequences have established the duplication order of the gene clusters and demonstrated that gene cluster region 4 (Rv 3444 c- 3450 c) is ancestral. Region 4 is also the only region for which an orthologue could be found in the genomes of Corynebacterium <b>diptheriae</b> and Streptomyces coelicoior. Thus, the comparative genomic analyses revealed that the presence of the ESAT- 6 gene cluster seems to be a unique characteristic shared by members of the high G+C gram-positive bacteria and that multiple duplications of this cluster have occurred and have been maintained only within the genomes of members of the genus Mycobacterium. The ESAT- 6 gene cluster regions were shown to consist {{of the members of the}} ESAT- 6 gene family (encoding secreted T-cell antigens that lack detectable secretion signals), the mycosins (secreted, cell wall-associated subtilisin-like serine proteases) as well as genes encoding putative ABC transporters, ATP-binding proteins, and other membrane-associated proteins. Thus, from the observation that members of the ESAT- 6 family are secreted without the normal sec-dependent secretion signals, it was hypothesized that the membrane-associated and energy-providing proteins function together to form a transport system for the secretion of the members of the ESAT- 6 protein family. Supporting this hypothesis, one of the ESAT- 6 gene clusters was shown to be expressed as a single polycistronic RNA, forming an operon structure. The promoter for this operon, P e s r e g 3. was also identified and its activity characterized. Subsequent secretion analyses results have shown that secretion of members of the ESAT- 6 protein family is dependent on the presence of the proteins encoded by the ESAT- 6 gene cluster regions, confirming the putative transport-associated functions of the ESAT- 6 gene cluster-encoded proteins. The mycobacterial ESAT- 6 gene clusters contain a number of features of quorum sensing and lantibiotic operons, and an extensive review of the literature have led to the hypothesis that the members of the ESAT- 6 family may be secreted as signaling molecules and may be involved in the regulation of expression of genes during intracellular residence of the bacterium. In the final part of this study, the evolutionary history of the PE and PPE gene families (members of which is found situated in the ESAT- 6 gene clusters) were investigated. This investigation revealed that the expansion of these families are linked to the duplications of the ESAT- 6 gene clusters, which is supported by the absence of the multiple copies of the PE and PPE families in the genome of the fast-growing mycobacterium M. smegmatis. Furthermore, dot blot analyses showed that the PPE gene present in ESAT- 6 gene cluster region 5 is able to distinguish between mycobacteria belonging to the slow-growing or fast-growing species, indicating a function for the genes of these two families and/or the ESAT- 6 gene clusters in the phenotypical differences distinguishing these two groups of mycobacteria. In conclusion, this study has highlighted numerous important aspects of mycobacterial genomics and has greatly contributed to the current body of knowledge concerning the role of proteases, gene duplication and mechanisms of antigen expression and secretion in M. tuberculosis.

40|$|Antibodies {{have been}} used for over a century in the {{prevention}} and treatment of infectious disease. They are used most commonly for the prevention of measles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus, varicella, rabies, and vaccinia. Although their use in the treatment of bacterial infection has largely been supplanted by antibiotics, antibodies remain a critical component of the treatment of <b>diptheria,</b> tetanus, and botulism. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin can be used to treat certain viral infections in immunocompromised patients (e. g., cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B 19, and enterovirus infections). Antibodies may also be of value in toxic shock syndrome, Ebola virus, and refractory staphylococcal infections. Palivizumab, the first monoclonal antibody licensed (in 1998) for an infectious disease, can prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection in high-risk infants. The development and use of additional monoclonal antibodies to key epitopes of microbial pathogens may further define protective humoral responses and lead to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diptheria</b> toxin of high purity was {{prepared}} in batch cultures of 1 to 40 liters by procedures capable of processing 200 -liter batches without modification. The procedure incorporates preliminary purification {{of the growth}} medium and, after deep fermentation or surface culture of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, both concentration and partial purification of the toxin by membrane ultrafiltration. Final purification is achieved by Sephadex G- 100 gel filtration. Purities of 2, 000 to 2, 500 flocculation units per mg of protein nitrogen (260 to 410 flocculation units per unit of absorbance at 280 nm) were routinely obtained with only a 10 % loss of toxin. The toxin appeared pure on immunoelectrophoresis and ultracentrifugation, and only minor amounts of lower-molecular-weight impurities were revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate.
