5|$|A. b. swaynei (Sclater, 1892) : Known as Swayne's hartebeest. Restricted to the {{southern}} Rift Valley in Ethiopia. It formerly occurred throughout the Rift Valley, and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia. It <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from Somalia by 1930. Its populations are very low and on the decline.|$|E

5|$|Also defined herewith: tarsometatarsus. The {{third and}} most {{conspicuous}} {{portion of the}} bird's leg, from which the toes spring; the foot. In birds, the true tarsus <b>has</b> <b>disappeared,</b> with the proximal tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|E

5|$|C. b. banksii {{is found}} in Queensland and, rarely, in far {{northern}} New South Wales; {{it is the largest}} subspecies by overall body size and has a moderate-sized bill. It merges with subspecies macrorhynchus around the Gulf of Carpentaria. It <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from much of its former range in northern New South Wales and southeast Queensland.|$|E
5|$|First, Second and Third Creeks {{have been}} {{particularly}} heavily modified. Some sections have been converted to concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the creeks, particularly those closest to the city. Introduced species including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E
5|$|Heather and Mike awaken {{the next}} morning to find that Josh <b>has</b> <b>disappeared.</b> After trying in vain to find him, they slowly move on. That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams in the {{darkness}} but are unable to locate him. Mike and Heather theorize that Josh's screams are a fabrication by the witch in order to draw them out of their tent.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the cheetah ranged across vast {{stretches}} of Asia: from the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula {{in the west}} to the Indian subcontinent in the east, and as far north as the Caspian and Aral Seas.

5|$|On 22 January 2010, {{the last}} album, L'OuvreTemps (The Time Opener), was published. With this album the authors {{concluded}} the entire comic {{series with the}} intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu (Valérian and Laureline: Lininil <b>Has</b> <b>Disappeared),</b> and indicated that Valérian and Laureline will continue to live on in a yet unspecified form.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{disagree}} on the house's initial construction date, and no records survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century; William Robinson's History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham (1840) suggests a date of about 1514, although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. Nikolaus Pevsner speculates the front may have formed part of a courtyard house of which the remainder <b>has</b> <b>disappeared.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bell frog's current {{distribution}} now ranges from Byron Bay, in northern New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria; populations mostly occur along the coast. In New South Wales, it has declined severely in range and abundance since the 1960s, although no similar declines {{have been reported}} in Victoria. In New South Wales, it <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from highland areas above , except for a population in Captains Flat. A study of populations along coastal New South Wales indicated many populations were very small, usually of fewer than 20 adults. According to a 1996 study, six populations of more than 300 frogs are known: two in the Sydney metropolitan area, two in the Shoalhaven, and two in the New South Wales mid-north coast. There are now approximately only 40 sites in total where it is found, most of which are in the Sydney area. The green and golden bell frog <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from an estimated 90% of its former range. Some specimens were apparently found in Armidale, {{but it turned out to}} be a misidentification of L. castanea. The declines in Victoria have been more modest and mostly in at inland areas where habitats have disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} the splendid fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub, {{generally}} with ample vegetation for shelter. Unlike the eastern superb fairywren, {{it has not}} adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from some urbanised areas. The splendid fairywren mainly eats insects and supplements its diet with seeds.|$|E
5|$|The missing depth is not {{the only}} factor that the critics deplore. An {{important}} feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted buon fresco. Wherever they have not been painted buon fresco but added a secco, they have been removed by the restorers.|$|E

5|$|A {{photograph}} from Leon's {{apartment and}} the snake scale lead Deckard to {{a strip club}} where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him to also retire Rachael, who <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks Deckard's pistol from his hand and then begins to kill Deckard, but Rachael uses Deckard's pistol to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment, and, during an intimate discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.|$|E
5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, <b>has</b> <b>disappeared.</b> Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it <b>has</b> <b>disappeared</b> from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E

50|$|Thousands {{of people}} <b>have</b> <b>disappeared</b> in Sri Lanka since the 1980s.

A few years earlier the Sri Lankan government had estimated that 17,000 people <b>had</b> <b>disappeared.</b> In 2003 the Red Cross stated that it had received 20,000 complaints of disappearances during the Sri Lankan Civil War of which 9,000 had been resolved but the remaining 11,000 were still being investigated.|$|R

In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions. Appalled with the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it <b>has</b> <b>disappeared.</b> The mob soon converges on the Simpson household and Lisa is arrested and put on trial for destroying the skeleton.|$|E

Walter is unable to deny Peter's accusations. The next day, Walter is devastated to learn that Peter has discharged himself and <b>has</b> <b>disappeared.</b>|$|E
