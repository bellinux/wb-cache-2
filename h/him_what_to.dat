5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E

500|$|This episode marked Chris Carter's {{directing}} debut. Being {{the first}} he had ever directed, David Nutter from the directing staff helped, tipped, and showed <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. With Nutter's help, Carter learned how to block entire scenes. When commenting on his experience, Carter told that he sometimes followed Nutter's advice down to [...] "the letter". When directing the episode, Carter {{wanted to create a}} different feel for the episode, by focusing more on the performances given by the actors, than the mechanical set designs. Carter declared that directing he learned about [...] "things you take for granted as a writer and producer", that lead to [...] "compromises" [...] for things Carter could not do on-screen, and compared the episode to a stage play as most is set in a single place, the travel agency.|$|E

500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
2500|$|Given Rickover's single-minded {{focus on}} naval nuclear propulsion, design, and operations, {{it came as}} a {{surprise}} to many in 1982, {{near the end of his}} career, when he testified before the U.S. Congress that, were it up to <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with nuclear powered ships, he [...] "would sink them all." [...] At a congressional hearing Rickover testified that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Realizing {{that the}} matter was of highly {{political}} significance for {{the relation between the}} SS and the Army, I called immediately on my military superior ..., Dr. Dornberger. He informed me that the SS had for a long time been trying to get their [...] "finger in the pie" [...] of the rocket work. I asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. He replied on the spot that if I wanted to continue our mutual work, I had no alternative but to join.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} and {{subsequent}} interviews, Patric emphasized his opinion {{that the most important}} point in the book was that a person should seek to reduce [...] "by whatever peaceful means his ingenuity may devise, the power of government – any government – to tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] In accordance with this doctrine, Patric supported his deliberately modest lifestyle by directly selling his reprinted and personally-inscribed copies of the book from person-to-person, and town to town throughout most of his later life: ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexander, who was {{described}} by some who knew him closely to have a [...] "short fuse", and to be at times [...] "combative", was charged with beating Clifford Berg, 75, an elderly neighbor, after an argument in 1996. One person who owned a printing shop near the linguisa factory, Richard Miller, 38, said during the murder trial before the grand jury, that Alexander [...] "didn't {{like the idea of}} people telling <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do", with his business, and that he was [...] "very anti-authority", at least from what he knew about the sausage maker.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant Frederic H. White ordered Miller to {{help him}} and Ensign Victor Delano load the {{unmanned}} #1 and #2 Browning [...]50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns aft of the conning tower. Miller was {{not familiar with the}} machine gun, but White and Delano told <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Miller had served both men as a room steward and knew them well. Delano expected Miller to feed ammunition to one gun, but his attention was diverted, and when he looked again, Miller was firing one of the guns. White had loaded ammunition into both guns and assigned Miller the starboard gun.|$|E

2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do". He {{said that the}} Rhodes Scholarship was established for {{young men and women}} who want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Balak took Balaam {{to the summit}} of Pisgah, once offered a bull and a ram on each of seven altars, and once again Balaam asked Balak to wait while Balaam went off alone to seek a manifestation, and once again God told <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say. Balaam {{returned}} and told Balak: [...] "My message was to bless: When He blesses, I cannot reverse it. [...] No harm is in sight for Jacob, no woe in view for Israel. [...] The Lord their God is with them." [...] Then Balak told Balaam {{at least not to}} bless them, but Balaam replied that he had to do whatever God directed.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day do you work, {{and what do you}} write on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, at a certain point in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E

2500|$|Sheridan jumped {{his horse}} over the berm and landed among Confederates who had thrown down {{their weapons and}} were waiting to surrender. When they asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, Sheridan pointed to the rear and said: [...] "Go over there. Get right along, now. Drop your guns; youll never need them any more. You'll be safe over there. Are there any more of you? We want every one of your fellows." [...] Ayres had taken {{the key to the}} entire Confederate line, over 1,000 prisoners and eight battle flags but among the Union {{casualties}} was Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Frederick Winthrop who was mortally wounded and Colonel Richard N. Bowerman who was severely wounded. Colonel James Grindley assumed command of Winthrop's brigade while Colonel David L. Stanton took charge of Bowerman's brigade.|$|E
2500|$|Mix {{reportedly}} did {{not have}} to train Tony, but simply show <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do for each feat. Mix could convey any sort of message to the pony by touches of the hand or fingers on Tony's neck. [...] Although there is speculation that whips, strong bits, and spurs were used. Such stunts included untying Mix’s hands, opening gates,jumping over high fences, getting tangled in ropes, loosening his reins, rescuing Mix from fire, jumping from one cliff to another, and running after trains. In the 1926 film The Great K & A Train Robbery (Fox Film Corporation), Mix jumps Tony through a glass window into a building and rides him alongside a speeding train. In the film Trailin (Fox Film Corporation, 1921) Mix and Tony have a bridge slashed from under them, and uncut footage shows the pair tipping over to the river below.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Balaam and Balak went {{together}} to Kiriath-huzoth, where Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and they ate. In the morning, Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-Baal, overlooking the Israelites. Balaam had Balak build seven altars, and they offered up a bull and a ram on each altar. Then Balaam asked Balak to wait while Balaam went off alone {{to see if}} God would grant him a manifestation. God appeared to Balaam and told <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say. Balaam returned and said: [...] "How can I damn whom God has not damned, how doom when the Lord has not doomed? [...] [...] [...] [...] Who can count the dust of Jacob, number the dust-cloud of Israel? [...] May I die {{the death of the}} upright, may my fate be like theirs!" [...] Balak complained that he had brought Balaam to damn the Israelites, but instead Balaam blessed them. Balaam replied that he could only repeat what God put in his mouth.|$|E

Then Bill Black picked up his bass and began acting the fool too, and I started playing with them. Sam had {{the door to the}} control room open, and stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'We don't know'. He said, 'Well, back up. Try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again'. So we kinda talked it over and figured out a little bit what we were doin'. We ran it again, and of course Sam is listenin'. 'Bout the third or fourth time through, we just cut it. It was basically a rhythm record. It wasn't any great thing. It wasn't Sam tellin' <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.

2500|$|In February 1988, Randi {{tested the}} gullibility {{of the media}} by perpetrating a hoax of his own.

Deyvi Peña, whom Randi described as a [...] "friend". Randi would tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say through sophisticated radio equipment. According to the 60 Minutes program on the Carlos hoax, [...] "it was claimed that Alvarez {{would not have had}} the audience he did at the Opera House (and the potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)", though an analysis by The Skeptics Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, [...] "it [...] at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical". The hoax was exposed on 60 Minutes Australia; [...] "Carlos" [...] and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.|$|E

[...] Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: [...] "Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory." [...] Copland recalled that [...] "she had but one all-embracing principle...the creation of what she called la grande ligne - the long line in music." [...] She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: [...] "When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious." [...] She said, [...] "You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself. It's always necessary to be yourself – that is a mark of genius in itself." ...|$|E
