5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has an {{interior}} which presents a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, {{it has been suggested}} that this character trait is an anapomorphy—that is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E

The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, it is being held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.|$|E
5|$|Thanjavur has a {{total of}} four Universities, namely the Tamil University, SASTRA University, PRIST University and Periyar Maniammai University. The Tamil University is a state run institute, started during 1981 and {{obtained}} its statutory recognition from the University Grants Commission in 1983. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its kind for the Tamil language doing higher research in Tamilology and advanced study in various allied branches like linguistics, translation, lexicography, music, drama and manuscriptology.|$|E

5|$|Building {{on what is}} now Mayfair {{began in}} the 1660s, {{initially}} {{on the corner of}} Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of that street. Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> this era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Dead Money: The first add-on pack was {{released}} for the Xbox 360 on December 21, 2010 and for PlayStation 3 and PC (via Steam) on February 22, 2011. In Dead Money, the Courier is captured by an insane ex-Brotherhood of Steel leader known as Father Elijah and must work alongside three other captives {{to find the}} fabled treasure of the Sierra Madre Casino, concealed from the world by a deadly toxic cloud. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, new weapons, perks, terrain, enemies and decisions for the player, as well as raising the level cap by five. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four story add-ons that cannot be revisited {{after the completion of}} its main questline.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E
30|$|The {{definition}} of riming pairs in poetry {{depends on the}} notion of the syllable rime, which does not include the pre-nuclear glide G. Of the four proposals, <b>the</b> CV analysis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that has no segmentation boundary between G and the nuclear vowel, and so it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> that cannot properly define the syllable rime.|$|R

5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cucurbita are {{susceptible}} to some types of mosaic virus including: Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Papaya ringspot virus-cucurbit strain (PRSV), Squash mosaic virus (SqMV), Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). PRSV <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits. SqMV and CMV {{are the most common}} viruses among cucurbits. Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity, which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one is affecting plants.|$|E
5|$|William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist {{considered}} {{in his day}} the equal of Dickens, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his 40 novels never to {{have been out of}} print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.|$|E

5|$|After his {{experiment}} with coaching, Hayden went {{returned to the}} insurance business and also worked as a banker, accountant, a hospital administrator, school teacher, and Kentucky state bank inspector. He also worked as the treasurer of a Methodist church until his mid-70s. He was a lifetime member of Rotary International and the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. He was married to Mary Hardin for 67 years until her death; he would remarry to Edna Lytle. At {{the time of his}} death on January 9, 2003, at the age of 103, his jersey was one of 41 retired jerseys hanging in Rupp Arena, (with his name only, as the jerseys did not have numbers during his era), and he was the oldest living former University of Kentucky athlete. As of 2009, he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 49 University of Kentucky basketball All-Americans to have been born in the 19th century, as well as probably being the shortest. He is a member of the Paris High School Greyhound Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Catholic priests {{had come}} to Rosendale as early as 1840, and the first mass in the village was held in a cooper's shop. The {{original}} Church of St. Peter was completed {{in the summer of}} 1850, and the first mass in that building was held on August15. The church was not officially incorporated until April29, 1865. A newer, larger building was constructed in 1876, on the same road as the village's rail depot. The new building followed an English Gothic architecture style. It was made of bricks, created near the North River, and was ornamented with yellow bricks from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and sandstone from Amherst, New York. The first mass in the new church occurred on December25, 1876; the building's total construction cost was $31,000. The Church of St. Peter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the village's churches that still functions as a church.|$|E
5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played {{until there is a}} winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals {{that he did not know}} a tie was a possible result.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, {{the author of the}} Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, {{does not appear to be}} aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} of Yellowstone National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances {{to the park}} are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (Wyoming Highway 296) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, {{all four of them}} have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Padres joined Major League Baseball as an {{expansion}} team in 1969. Preston Gómez managed {{the team from}} the inaugural season until 1972. In total, the franchise has had 16 managers. Bud Black was employed in the position since being hired prior to the 2007 season, and he was fired on June 15, 2015. He was replaced by Dave Roberts for 1 game. Then Pat Murphy took over. Bruce Bochy is the manager with the longest tenure, leading the team for 12 seasons from 1995 through 2006. Bochy is also the only Padres skipper to win the Manager of the Year Award, and leads the team in regular-season wins (951) and losses (975), as well as playoff wins (8) and losses (16). The franchise leader in winning percentage among managers who have led the team for a full season or more is Jack McKeon (.541 over three seasons). Besides Bochy, Dick Williams is the only Padres manager to lead the team to a National League pennant; Williams won 337 games in his four seasons with the club and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> San Diego's sixteen managers to be elected to the Hall of Fame. On October 29, 2015, Andy Green was named manager of the San Diego Padres.|$|E
