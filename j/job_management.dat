500|$|The term [...] "architectural management" [...] {{was coined}} by the architects Brunton, Baden Hellard and Boobyer in 1964 where they {{highlighted}} {{the tension and}} synergy between the management of individual projects (<b>job</b> <b>management)</b> and {{the management of the}} business (office management). Although they did not use the term [...] "design management", they stressed identical issues; while the design community discussed methodologies for design. Christopher Alexander's work {{played an important role in}} the development of the design methodology, where he devoted his attention to the problems of form and context; and focused on disassembling complex design challenges into constituent parts to approach a solution. His intention was to bring more rationalism and structure into the solving of design problems.|$|E
