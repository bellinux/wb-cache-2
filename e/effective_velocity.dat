40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} errors in the migration-velocity model of PS-converted waves on the traveltime calculated in prestack Kirchhoff time migration in weak anisotropic media. The prestack-Kirchhoff-time-migration operator contains four parameters: the PS-converted-wave velocity, the vertical velocity ratio, the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> ratio, and the anisotropic parameter. We derived four error factors that correspond to those parameters. Theoretical and numerical analyses of the error factors show them all to be inversely proportional to the velocity and to traveltime. Traveltime errors for shallow events usually are larger than for deep events. Error in PS-converted-wave velocity causes the largest traveltime error, and error in the vertical velocity ratio causes the smallest traveltime error. For a small horizontal-distance/depth ratio, the error in the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> ratio affects traveltime more than does the anisotropic-parameter error. However, the anisotropic-parameter error affects traveltime more when the horizontal-distance/depth ratio is larger. Traveltime errors caused by errors in <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> ratio and the anisotropic parameter mainly stem from the converted-S-wave raypath of the PS-converted waves. To save processing time and cost, PS-wave velocity can be estimated accurately without an accurate vertical velocity ratio, <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> ratio, and anisotropic parameter. These findings are useful for understanding PS-wave behavior and for PS-wave imaging in anisotropic media...|$|E

40|$|Turbulent thermal {{diffusion}} is a combined {{effect of the}} temperature stratified turbulence and inertia of small particles. It causes {{the appearance of a}} non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles {{in the direction of the}} turbulent heat flux. This non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles is proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> of inertial particles. The theory of this effect has been previously developed only for small temperature gradients and small Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 224, 1996). In this study a generalized theory of turbulent {{thermal diffusion}} for arbitrary temperature gradients and Stokes numbers has been developed. The laboratory experiments in the oscillating grid turbulence and in the multi-fan produced turbulence have been performed to validate the theory of turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly stratified turbulent flows. It has been shown that the ratio of the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> of inertial particles to the characteristic vertical turbulent velocity for large Reynolds numbers is less than 1. The <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> of inertial particles as well as the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with Stokes numbers reaching the maximum at small Stokes numbers and decreases for larger Stokes numbers. The effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion also decreases with the mean temperature gradient. It has been demonstrated that the developed theory is in a good agreement with the results of the laboratory experiments. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, REVTEX 4 -...|$|E

In addition to providing a clear stochastic picture of Taylor dispersion, our method leads to closed-form expressions for all the moments of the convective displacement of the dispersing particles in terms of the transverse diffusion eigenmodes. We also find that the cumulants grow asymptotically linearly with time, ensuring a Gaussian distribution in the long-time limit. As a demonstration of the technique, the first two longitudinal cumulants (yielding respectively the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> and the Taylor diffusion constant) as well as the skewness (a measure of the deviation from normality) are calculated for fluid flow in the parallel plate geometry.

40|$|Wavefield {{extrapolation}} in orthorhombic anisotropic media incorporates complicated but realistic {{models to}} reproduce wave propagation phenomena in the Earth's subsurface. Compared with the representations used for simpler symmetries, such as transversely isotropic or isotropic, orthorhombic models require an extended and more elaborated formulation that also involves more expensive computational processes. The acoustic assumption yields more efficient {{description of the}} orthorhombic wave equation that also provides a simplified representation for the orthorhombic dispersion relation. However, such representation is hampered by the sixth-order nature of the acoustic wave equation, as it also encompasses the contribution of shear waves. To reduce the computational cost of wavefield extrapolation in such media, we generate effective isotropic inhomogeneous models {{that are capable of}} reproducing the firstarrival kinematic aspects of the orthorhombic wavefield. First, in order to compute traveltimes in vertical orthorhombic media, we develop a stable, efficient and accurate algorithm based on the fast marching method. The derived orthorhombic acoustic dispersion relation, unlike the isotropic or transversely isotropic ones, is represented by a sixth order polynomial equation with the fastest solution corresponding to outgoing P waves in acoustic media. The <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> models are then computed by evaluating the traveltime gradients of the orthorhombic traveltime solution, and using them to explicitly evaluate the corresponding inhomogeneous isotropic velocity field. The inverted <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> fields are source dependent and produce equivalent first-arrival kinematic descriptions of wave propagation in orthorhombic media. We extrapolate wavefields in these isotropic <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> models using the more efficient isotropic operator, and the results compare well, especially kinematically, with those obtained from the more expensive anisotropic extrapolator...|$|E
40|$|Evaluations of {{apparent}} slip and surface effects characterizing polymer adsorption are reported for laminar capillary flow of dilute aqueous solutions of three homologous compounds of Polyox, denoted by WSR 301, Coagulant and FRA. Measurements {{were carried out}} using very dilute solutions in the polymer concentration range 5 to 200 ppm and very fine glass capillary tubes with diameters varying from 0. 0054 to 0. 047 cm. Results were obtained for glass capillary tubes coated with a silane compound (dimethyldiethoxysilane) {{as well as for}} the untreated glass tubes to provide a comparison between wall effects observed with a hydrophilic surface and a chemically modified surface. The results indicate that flow enhancement characterized by a positive <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> at the wall is dominant at the very low polymer concentrations and flow retardation characterized by a negative <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> at the wall is dominant at the higher concentrations comprising the polymer concentration range investigated. In general, it was found that the magnitude of the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> at the wall increases with increasing wall shear stress and the contribution to the total flow rate becomes more significant in the tubes of smaller diameter. A transition from a positive to a negative <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> at the wall was observed with increasing polymer concentration. The critical concentration marking the transition was found to be higher for the silane-treated tubes than for the untreated tubes. The effective hydrodynamic thickness of the adsorbed polymer layer corresponding to zero shear was evaluated directly from the capillary flow data. The thickness in the plateau region at higher polymer concentrations was found to be greater than two times the root mean square radius of gyration of the polymer molecule for solutions of the three polymers in the untreated tubes while lower value was obtained for the same solutions in the treated tubes. A new analysis was applied to separate the contributions of polymer adsorption and slip in the evaluation of the <b>effective</b> <b>velocity</b> at the wall. In the analysis, the flow was modeled by postulating an adsorption isotherm for representation of the variation of the adsorbed layer thickness at zero shear with polymer concentration and assuming a linear dependence of the effective slip velocity on the wall shear stress. Effective hydrodynamic thicknesses of the adsorbed layers are presented as a function of the polymer concentration and wall shear stress for the three Polyox homologues investigated in the chemically treated and untreated glass tubes. The variation of the slip coefficients with polymer concentration of the solutions was also evaluated.
