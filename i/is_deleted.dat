5|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2011 that Square Enix will be releasing Dragon Quest III in Japan, as both the Famicom and Super Famicom ports {{as part of the}} September released of Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Commemoration Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III for the Wii. A quick save feature was added to this version of the game, allowing for pauses at any time, but the save file <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> upon resuming.|$|E
25|$|If {{a stress}} stem-final vowel <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> when the {{following}} morpheme lacks lexical stress, the stress {{is transferred to}} the preceding vowel mora of the deleted vowel.|$|E
25|$|In this approach, {{according}} to the following rule, the intransitive/anticausative form {{is derived from the}} transitive/causative form by deleting the cause predicate from the LCS. In example (8) below, the LCS is “Katherine broke the stick” and the cause predicate “Katherine” <b>is</b> <b>deleted.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Do {{a single}} pass down the tree, but before {{entering}} (visiting) a node, restructure the tree so {{that once the}} key to <b>be</b> <b>deleted</b> <b>is</b> encountered, it can <b>be</b> <b>deleted</b> without triggering the need for any further restructuring ...|$|R
25|$|Permalinks {{frequently}} {{consist of}} a string of characters that represent the date and time of posting, and an identifier that denotes the author who initially authored the item or its subject. Crucially, if an item is changed, renamed, or moved within the internal database, its permalink remains unaltered, as it functions as a magic cookie that references an internal database identifier. If an item <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> altogether, its permalink can frequently not be reused.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} LFN entries, required to represent a file name, firstly comes the last LFN entry (the {{last part of the}} filename). The sequence number also has bit 6 (0x40) set (this means the last LFN entry, however it's the first entry seen when reading the directory file). The last LFN entry has the largest sequence number which decreases in following entries. The first LFN entry has sequence number 1. A value of 0xE5 is used to indicate that the entry <b>is</b> <b>deleted.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} adapted from the {{remaining}} material in the radio series—covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of Fit the Sixth, with Ford and Arthur being stranded on pre-historic Earth, end the book, and their rescue in Fit the Seventh <b>is</b> <b>deleted),</b> {{and most of the}} Brontitall incident was omitted, instead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Loyd, the Disaster Area stunt ship was substituted—this having first been introduced in the LP version. Adams himself considered Restaurant to be his best novel of the five.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Deletionpedia collected about 63,000 articles, which <b>were</b> <b>deleted</b> from Wikipedia between February and September 2008. Nearly 2000 {{pages were}} over 1000 days old before they <b>were</b> <b>deleted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1 {{point has}} <b>been</b> <b>deleted</b> {{because of the}} {{incidents}} happened by the Efes Pilsen Game. [...] (**) 1 point has <b>been</b> <b>deleted</b> because of the incidents happened by the Erdemirspor Game.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, final consonants may <b>be</b> <b>deleted</b> (although there <b>is</b> a {{great deal}} of {{variation}} between speakers in this regard). Most often, [...] and [...] <b>are</b> <b>deleted.</b> As with other dialects of English, final [...] and [...] may reduce to a glottal stop. Nasal consonants may be lost while nasalization of the vowel is retained (e.g., find may be pronounced [...] ). More rarely, [...] and [...] may also <b>be</b> <b>deleted.</b>|$|R
25|$|All {{downloadable}} contents {{were removed}} from sale on April 30, 2014. However, as of September 2014, they're become available again, at least in Europe. The Paint Pack and Racing Gear Pack wouldn't be re-downloadable if the savegame <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> after the date, however a patch was eventually released to address that issue. The online servers were shut down on May 30, 2014. On April 29, 2014 Sony announced the final online event for Gran Turismo 5, which started on April 30, 2014 and ended with the shutdown of the online servers. Players were awarded with five cars in Gran Turismo 6 for participating in the event.|$|E
25|$|If the {{sequence}} of the nucleotides in a gene changes, {{the sequence}} of the amino acids in the protein it produces may also change—if part of a gene <b>is</b> <b>deleted,</b> the protein produced is shorter and may not work any more. This {{is the reason why}} different alleles of a gene can have different effects in an organism. As an example, hair color depends on how much of a dark substance called melanin is put into the hair as it grows. If a person has a normal set of the genes involved in making melanin, they make all the proteins needed and they grow dark hair. However, if the alleles for a particular protein have different sequences and produce proteins that can't do their jobs, no melanin is produced and the person has white skin and hair (albinism).|$|E
25|$|Mutations in Oa1 {{have been}} well {{characterized}} and studied using various techniques like southern blot analyses, single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Most of these mutations {{have been reported to}} be occurring in the N-terminus and few in the trans-membrane regions but very rarely in the much conserved cytoplasmic C-terminus. Populations belonging to different ethnic groups have been extensively analyzed and a database has been created recording the details of mutations related to OA1. A total of 25 missense, 2 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splicing mutations have been reported till date. In addition to these mutations, there also occur several deletions in one or many of the exons of Oa1 gene, especially exon 2. These deletions are presumed to be because of unequal crossing-over due to the presence of flanking Alu regions. In some cases, the entire Oa1 gene <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> along with other contiguous genes. Many different polymorphisms have also been detected, mainly in intron 1.|$|E
25|$|In {{a binary}} tree, a node with two {{children}} cannot <b>be</b> <b>deleted</b> unambiguously. However, in certain binary trees (including binary search trees) these nodes can <b>be</b> <b>deleted,</b> though with a rearrangement of the tree structure.|$|R
50|$|Outside security, Registry keys cannot <b>be</b> <b>deleted</b> or edited due {{to other}} causes. Registry keys {{containing}} NUL characters cannot <b>be</b> <b>deleted</b> with standard registry editors and require a special utility for deletion, such as RegDelNull.|$|R

25|$|Internally {{eliminated}} sequences (IES) are noncoding {{regions of}} the germ-line genome found in Ciliates. They are defined as sections of DNA removed from the diploid micronuclear genome during which {{a copy of the}} micronuclear genome is converted to the macronuclear genome even though errors occur in which an IES sequence may not be deleted. There is little conservation of motifs between Ciliate species; however, C. uncinata, like other ciliate species, show a conserved IES sequence motif within a species. It is unknown if IES sequences have a function in the genome, but in the ciliate Paramecium, an IES sequence is used to determine the mating type of an individual. When a specific IES sequence is not deleted from the developing somatic nucleus, then it is type O mating type. However, if that IES <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> from the developing macronucleus, it is type E mating type. Paramecium can only mate with individual of opposite mating type.|$|E
25|$|Germ cell {{tumors of the}} ovary develop {{from the}} ovarian germ cells. Germ cell tumor {{accounts}} for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, {{when one of the}} germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma. Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group. Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> and replaced with a duplicate of the other. Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They {{are more likely to be}} stage I at diagnosis. Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: choriocarcinomas are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with alpha-fetoprotein.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} method of testing, as HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with LNS. Individuals who display the full Lesch–Nyhan phenotype all have mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Sequence analysis of mRNA is available clinically and can be utilized in order to detect HPRT1 mutations in males affected with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Techniques such as RT-PCR, multiplex genomic PCR, and sequence analysis (cDNA and genomic DNA), used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, are performed on a research basis. If RT-PCR tests result in cDNA showing the absence of an entire exon or exons, then multiplex genomic PCR testing is performed. Multiplex genomic PCR testing amplifies the nine exons of the HPRT1 gene as eight PCR products. If the exon in question <b>is</b> <b>deleted,</b> the corresponding band will be missing from the multiplex PCR. However, if the exon is present, the exon is sequenced to identify the mutation, therefore causing exclusion of the exon from cDNA. If no cDNA is created by RT-PCR, then multiplex PCR is performed on the notion that most or all of the gene is obliterated.|$|E
50|$|The {{cities of}} Hastings and Lincoln also had City U.S. Highway 6. These are former routes for US 6 in those cities. City US 6 in Hastings <b>was</b> <b>deleted</b> in 1970 and in Lincoln, it <b>was</b> <b>deleted</b> in 1983.|$|R

500|$|Roguelikes {{traditionally}} implement permadeath. Once {{a character}} dies, the player must {{begin a new}} game, which will regenerate the game's levels anew due to procedural generation. A [...] "save game" [...] feature will only provide suspension of gameplay and not a limitlessly recoverable state; the stored session <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> upon resumption or character death. Players can circumvent this by backing up stored game data ("save scumming"), an act that is usually considered cheating; the developers of Rogue introduced the permadeath feature after introducing a save function, finding that players were repeatedly loading saved games to achieve the best results. According to Rogues Michael Toy, they saw their approach to permadeath not {{as a means to}} make the game painful or difficult but to put weight on every decision the player made as to create a more immersive experience.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Warrior and Dragon WarriorII were re-released {{as part of}} {{a similar}} {{compilation}} for the GBC, titled Dragon WarriorI&II. It was developed by Tose and released by Enix on September 23, 1999 in Japan and September27, 2000, in North America. It uses an entirely new translation, discards the pseudo-Elizabethan English style and uses names closer to those in the Japanese version. In this remake, [...] "Dragonlord" [...] is changed to [...] "DracoLord", and [...] "Erdrick" [...] is changed to [...] "Loto". Several additional features were added. For example, players can quicksave their game anytime outside a battle; the quicksave <b>is</b> <b>deleted</b> after it or a standard saved game is loaded. Players can store some of their gold for future use in a bank in case they die. The menu was streamlined and monsters yield more experience and gold {{to reduce the amount of}} time needed to increase levels and to make saving up for in-game purchases faster.|$|E
