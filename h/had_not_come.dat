5|$|A Tom Swift media project {{finally came}} to {{fruition}} in 1983 when Willie Aames appeared as Tom Swift along with Lori Loughlin as Linda Craig in a television special, The Tom Swift and Linda Craig Mystery Hour, which was broadcast on July 3. It was a ratings failure. In 2007, digital studio Worldwide Biggies acquired movie rights to Tom Swift. and announced plans to release a feature film and video game, followed by a television series. As of 2015, these plans <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons {{had the advantage of}} height, they were effectively trapped against the precipice of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, as a result of travelling light; they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E

5|$|In 1836, the Reverend Richard Hill {{had a fit}} of {{apoplexy}} in the vestry and died. Soon {{after this}} dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's {{plans for a new}} cathedral on George Street <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to fruition, Broughton acted as if St James' were a pro-cathedral. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio {{discussed}} the possibility of merging their three nations into a single East African Federation, agreeing {{that this would be}} accomplished {{by the end of the}} year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the Newfoundland was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to this conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, the study did not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad summoned Ali, {{and asked}} him to {{proclaim}} the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at Mina.

When the community offered him a pay raise instead, he agreed, on condition that all the other rabbis in Vilnius would receive one, too.|$|E

The Court denounced any efforts to draw this distinction, whether based on the historical record or on historical grounds, as arbitrary and likely to be suffused with the prejudices of an unelected branch of government as to which governmental functions are proper and traditional and which ones are not.|$|E
