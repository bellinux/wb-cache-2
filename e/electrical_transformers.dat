5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers,</b> which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers,</b> which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E

25|$|The only {{power plant}} in Gaza is not {{operational}} {{due to the lack}} of industrial fuel and spare parts. As of 1 January, power outages last 16 hours per day. Due to localised damage following the airstrikes, some electrical lines have been cut, causing some areas to suffer from power cuts lasting 24 hours. In addition, due to the damage caused by the air strikes to 15 <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers,</b> as many as 250,000 people in central and northern Gaza have no electricity supply during the entire day and night. On 1 January, a 5MW line from Egypt to Rafah was damaged, extending the power cuts to Rafah, which usually has a continuous supply. Fuel for heating and cooking are no longer available and most of the 240 gas stations in Gaza City have been closed.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors use an optical fiber cable, {{normally}} a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is {{their ability to}} reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors {{can be used in}} the same way to measure the internal temperature of <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers,</b> where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A bond graph {{model of}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> {{including}} the nonlinear saturation is presented. A nonlinear observer for the transformer based on multivariable circle criterion {{in the physical}} domain is proposed. In order to show the saturation and hysteresis effects on the <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer,</b> simulation results are obtained. Finally, the paper describes that convergence of the estimates to the true states is achieved...|$|R

2500|$|In June 2012, {{one of the}} {{two main}} <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers</b> {{involved}} in the ship's propulsion system failed, after an earlier engineers report highlighted [...] "overheating of the propulsion motors and transformers". Inspection found that insulation failure had short-circuited the transformer, while other transformers aboard showed premature wear. Unable to find an available spare, a new unit had to be ordered from the manufacturer. In June, it was predicted that Choules would be out of service for four to five months, but by October, claims were made that the ship would be inoperable until at least January 2013, and if all of the wear-showing transformers were replaced, she would not return to service until April 2013. By December, the faulty transformer had been replaced, and the RAN had decided that although the other transformers (propulsion and others) had been shown to have acceptable levels of wear, all would be replaced before Choules was reactivated. These repairs were completed in early 2013, and the ship was assessed as ready to re-enter service on 12 April.|$|E

40|$|Repetitive {{enrichment}} of soils {{samples from}} an agricultural land and newly marked dumpsite on <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> fluid yielded six bacterial species {{that have the}} capacity to utilize <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> fluids (askarel) as carbon and energy source. Bacterial species namely: Micrococcus, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas spp, Norcadia and Corynebacterium were identified using morphological and biochemical characteristics. The abilities of these bacterial species to utilize the <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> fluids as carbon source in minimal salt medium (MSM); sub cultured in concentrations of 5, 10, 15 and 20 μL of <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> fluids were investigated for twenty‐one days period. Physiological changes in terms of biomass increase were monitored by measuring the pH and optical density of the culture medium. From the results obtained, there was observed a general decrease in the pH and increase in Optical density (O. D). The mean pH and O. D readings ranged between (4. 34 ‐ 6. 13 and 0. 073 ‐ 0. 386) respectively. The decreased pH could justify for the acidic metabolites produced in the course of utilization of askarel as growth substrates. This study suggested that, the tropical ecosystems can provide exotic bacterial species that are capable of degrading or mineralizing polychlorinated biphenyls and their derivatives from dumpsites and agricultural soils...|$|R
