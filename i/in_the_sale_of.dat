5|$|John was {{the eldest}} child of Victor Hervey, 6th Marquess of Bristol. He was distant from his father, who treated him harshly, {{and did not}} get on well with him, though {{he was close to}} his first stepmother, Lady Juliet. After {{spending}} time in London, Monte Carlo, Paris and New York in the 1970s, he settled in part of the family seat, Ickworth House in Suffolk, becoming the 7th Marquess in 1985. Despite inheriting a large fortune of up to £35 million, the Marquess spent most of it during his lifetime. He struggled with addiction to cocaine and other drugs, serving several jail sentences for possession, and was known for his flamboyant lifestyle and homosexuality. His brief marriage in the mid-1980s did not last because of this, and he became increasingly depressed as he lost money and faced bankruptcy, culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the remainder of Ickworth House to the National Trust. He died in early 1999 of complications resulting from his drug addiction, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Pei's ancestry traces {{back to the}} Ming Dynasty, {{when his}} family moved from Anhui {{province}} to Suzhou, but most importantly his family were directors of the Bank of China which later on funded the construction of important projects including the Kips Bay project in New York.

Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee Pei and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, his brothers, and his sisters to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.|$|E
5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.|$|E

5|$|Matteo Sereni and Finidi George arrived {{before the}} 2001–02 season {{to boost the}} squad for its foray into Europe. The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1–0 {{at home in the}} third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4–1 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight {{fixtures}} appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed {{on the final day of}} the season with a 5–0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The loss of income due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E
