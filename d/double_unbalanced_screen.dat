It {{has been found}} that the interference visibilities are influenced deeply by the disturbance of transmission fiber.

40|$|We have {{combined}} Piezoresponse Force Microscopy and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) to study screening charge dynamics in written domains on PbZr 0. 2 Ti 0. 8 O 3 (PZT) thin film surfaces under a controlled environment and at variable temperature. The screening dynamics decayed exponentially on a timescale {{of tens of}} minutes, consistently with what we expected for water-mediated surface diffusion of ionic species. Variable-temperature KPFM measurements showed variations in surface potential due to temporary <b>unbalanced</b> surface <b>screening</b> charges. Low humidity experiments revealed gradual incorporation of positive charges onto the surface, even in a non-reactive environment (N 2), as well as deceleration of the screening dynamics upon reversal of the temperature variation.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{fractional}} and integer quantum Hall (QH) effects in a high-mobility double-layer two-dimensional electron system. We have compared the "stability" of the QH state in balanced and <b>unbalanced</b> <b>double</b> quantum wells. The behavior of the n= 1 QH state {{is found to be}} strikingly different from all others. It is anomalously stable, though all other states decay, as the electron density is made unbalanced between the two quantum wells.

40|$|Synaptic loss is {{an early}} {{pathological}} finding in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and correlates with memory impairment. Changes in macroscopic brain activity measured with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG) in AD indicate synaptic changes and may therefore serve as markers of intervention effects in clinical trials. EEG peak frequency and functional networks have shown, in addition to improved memory performance, {{to be sensitive to}} detect an intervention effect in mild AD patients of the medical food Souvenaid containing the specific nutrient combination Fortasyn® Connect, which is designed to enhance synapse formation and function. Here, we explore the value of MEG, with higher spatial resolution than EEG, in identifying intervention effects of the nutrient combination by comparing MEG spectral measures, functional connectivity and – networks between an intervention and a control group. Quantitative markers describing spectral properties, functional connectivity and graph theoretical aspects of MEG from the exploratory 24 -week, double blind, randomized controlled Souvenir II MEG sub-study (NTR 1975, [URL] in drug-naïve patients with mild AD were compared between a test group (n= 27), receiving Souvenaid, and a control group (n= 28), receiving an isocaloric control product. The groups were <b>unbalanced</b> at <b>screening</b> with respect to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Peak frequencies of MEG were compared to EEG peak frequencies, recorded in the same patients at similar time points, were compared with respect to sensitivity to intervention effects. No consistent statistically significant intervention effects were detected. In addition, we found no difference in sensitivity between MEG and EEG peak frequency. This exploratory study could not unequivocally establish the value of MEG in detecting interventional effects on brain activity, possibly due to small sample size and unbalanced study groups. We found no indication that the difference could be attributed to a lack of sensitivity of MEG compared to EEG. MEG in randomized controlled trials is feasible but its value to disclose intervention effects of Souvenaid in mild AD patients needs to be studied further...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{manufacturing}} of multi-material products, a {{joining method}} that {{is able to}} cost-effectively assemble components made of dissimilar and similar material, with irregular geometries, is optimal. As an alternative, adhesive bonding is in-creasingly adapted by the industry, which is also used in manufacturing of multi-phase materials. In practice, adhesives are constrained to thin layers. An adhesive as a constrained layer behaves differently compared to the adhesive as a bulk material. In general, adhesive layers are loaded in peel (mode I), or in shear (mode II or III), or in a combination of peel and shear (mixed mode). This thesis deals with mixed mode loaded adhesive layers, from measurement of ma-terial data to analysis of structural behaviour. For studying of structural behaviour of adhesive joints, an integrated approach is developed. Arbitrarily end-loaded single-layer adhesive joints with arbitrary ad-herends of arbitrary length are analysed with the Beam/Adhesive layer (B/A) model. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the adhesive layer {{as well as for}} the adherends. For joints with a semi-infinite symmetric geometry, i. e. relative long joints with identical adherends loaded at one end, basic loading cases are obtained. Solutions to these basic loading cases are easy to use in designing of joints with this type of geometry. For nonlinear or general adhesive layers, a mode-dependent cohesive law is de-veloped. The normalized formulation is easy to implement in numerical simula-tions, yet, it captures the characteristics of adhesive layers. For experimental studies, this cohesive law is used to obtain the constitutive behaviour of an adhe-sive layer. The results confirm the ability and suitability of this cohesive law in modelling of adhesive layers. To obtain material data of adhesive layers, experimental methods are developed based on the J-integral. Two specimens, the Mixed mode double Cantilever Beams (MCB) specimen and the <b>Unbalanced</b> <b>Double</b> Cantilever Beams (UDCB) specimen, are designed to allow adhesive layers to be loaded in mixed mode. The MCB-specimen is implemented experimentally and the constitutive behav-iour of the tested adhesive layer is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) {{has been}} used as rescue therapy in children since the 1980 s for persistent pulmonary hypertension (PHT) of the newborn or in congenital heart disease (CHD) either before or after cardiac surgery. We report here our overall experience. Methods: Retrospective study with chart review of all patients necessitating ECMO support after congenital cardiac surgery between April 1999 and December 2004. Results: 17 children needed ECMO support after congenital heart surgery. Their mean age was 1. 8 ± 3. 3 years (2 days- 10 years). The mean weight was 8. 4 kg (2. 7 - 30 kg). 4 patients (24 %) presented a transposition of the great arteries; 4 patients an <b>unbalanced</b> <b>double</b> outlet right ventricle with or without aortic malposition; 4 patients a ventricular septal defect or aorto-pulmonary window or a complete atrio-ventricular septal defect with secondary pulmonary hypertension; 3 patients a tetralogy of Fallot; 1 patient a critical aortic stenosis and 1 patient a cardiac transplantation. Surgery was in 12 patients (70 %) a corrective procedure and in the 5 others patients (30 %) a palliation. ECMO was initiated in the OR after failure of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in 11 children (65 %). In 6 children (35 %), it was started in the ICU within 24 hours for low cardiac output or cardiac arrest. The ECMO pump consisted of a Biomedicus membrane oxygenator. In the first 5 patients regular cardiopulmonary bypass canulas were used, thereafter ECMO canulas were used with a completely heparinised circuit and activated clotting time ideally at 190 - 210. Mean time on ECMO was 98 hours (20 - 249 hours). In 4 patients the intensive care was stopped because of multiple organ failure or severe cerebral lesions, in 3 patients a technical problem of the ECMO (massive haemorrhage, canulas dislocation or massive thrombosis) lead to death of the patient. 10 patients could be weaned from the ECMO. The immediate survival rate of the ECMO was 59 % and the overall survival rate at 30 days post surgery was 41 %. Conclusions: Cardiac support with ECMO after congenital heart surgery permits a longterm survival in about 40 % of patients in critical condition who would otherwise die. These results correspond to the results published in big series. It should be available to centres performing congenital heart surgery as a rescue therapy in selected cases...|$|R
40|$|Na agricultura moderna, o custo operacional {{continua}} sendo decisivo no momento da seleção de máquinas e, ou, do sistema motomecanizado. Nessa atividade, o grande desafio continua sendo produzir com alta qualidade, dependência mínima de mão de obra e custo reduzido. O sistema de plantio direto está sendo cada vez mais utilizado, e a tendência é aumentar ainda mais. Nesse contexto, quantificar a energia demandada pelos diferentes tipos e modelos de semeadora-adubadora disponíveis no mercado é de suma importância para fabricantes, agricultores e demais interessados, que podem, além de aperfeiçoar o produto, selecionar aquele que proporcionará o melhor rendimento energético e, consequentemente, dará maior contribuição para reduzir os custos da produção agrícola. Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a demanda energética de um conjunto trator-semeadora-adubadora em diferentes velocidades de deslocamento e configurações de montagem de linha de plantio, bem como aplicar e avaliar o modelo matemático para predição de esforço tratório proposto pela American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE), na Norma ASAE D 497. 7 MAR 2011, por meio de comparação de resultados obtidos experimentalmente com os simulados. O experimento foi realizado no delineamento em blocos ao acaso com três repetições. Foram aplicados 10 tratamentos pela associação de cinco velocidades de deslocamento do conjunto mecanizado com duas configurações de montagem da linha de plantio, totalizando 30 unidades experimentais. As variações na configuração de montagem da linha de plantio foram decorrentes da utilização de dois tipos de mecanismo sulcador no sistema de deposição de adubo da semeadora-adubadora: disco duplo defasado e facão. Foram avaliadas as seguintes variáveis: velocidade de deslocamento; força e potência requeridas para tração da semeadora-adubadora; consumo horário e específico de combustível; volume médio e específico de solo mobilizado; consumo específico de combustível por volume de solo mobilizado; e energia requerida por volume de solo mobilizado. Concluiu-se que, para velocidades de deslocamento idênticas, a semeadora-adubadora equipada com o mecanismo sulcador tipo facão no sistema de deposição de adubo (configuração B) apresentou menor demanda energética que a semeadora-adubadora equipada com o disco duplo defasado (configuração A) para realizar o mesmo trabalho. Concluiu-se, também, que o modelo proposto pela norma ASABE (2011 b) para predição de força requerida na tração de implementos agrícolas mostrou-se eficiente para a semeadora- adubadora montada na configuração A, o que não ocorreu na configuração B. Operational costs {{has been}} being decisive for selecting machines and or mechanized {{systems in the}} modern agriculture. High quality production, minimum dependence on labor and reduced costs are the greatest challenges in this activity. The non-tillage system is being increasingly used, and the trend is to increase more and more. In this context, quantifying the energy required by different types and models of seeder available in the market {{is of paramount importance}} to manufacturers, farmers and other interested ones who may, besides improving the product, select one that will provide the best energy efficiency and give greater contribution to reducing the costs of agricultural production, as a consequence. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the energy demand of a seeder-tractor at different speeds and planting row mounting configurations, as well as to implement and to evaluate the mathematical model for predicting tractor effort proposed by ASAE D 497. 7 MAR 2011 Guidelines through comparison of experimental with the simulated results. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design with three replicates. It was used five displacement speeds obtained in function of the gear variations, changes in rotation of the axis of the tractor and two configurations of planting row mountings, totaling 10 treatments and 30 experimental units. Variations in configurations of the planting row mountings were caused by the use of two types of plow mechanism in the fertilizer deposition system of the seeder: <b>unbalanced</b> <b>double</b> discs and knife. The following variables were evaluated: displacement speed, force and power required to pull the seeder; time and specific fuel consumption; specific and total volume of displaced soil; specific fuel consumption per volume of displaced soil, and tractor driving wheel slip and energy required per volume of displaced soil. Based on the results, it was concluded that the seeder equipped with knife-type furrower system showed the best energy performance and the model for prediction of force required to pull agricultural implements proposed by ASABE (2011 b) was able to provide information for predicting the behavior of this variable when the planter was equipped with the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>double</b> discs furrower mechanism. It was concluded that, for identical displacement speeds the seeder-fertilizer equipped with the knife-type furrower mechanism in the fertilizer deposition system ("B" configuration) presented lower energy demand than the seeder- fertilizer equipped with the lagged double disc ("A" configuration) to accomplish the same task. It is also concluded that the model proposed by ASABE (2011 b) to prediction of power required in traction of agricultural implements showed to be able to offer to the seeder-fertilizer mounted in the A configuration the information for prediction of behavior of this variable. However, in the "B" configuration, the model did not showed to be able to supply such information...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} {{type 2 diabetes}} poses a major public health challenge. Population-based screening and early treatment for type 2 diabetes could reduce this growing burden. However, uncertainty persists around the benefits of screening for type 2 diabetes. We assessed {{the effect of a}} population-based stepwise screening programme on mortality. MethodsIn a pragmatic parallel group, cluster-randomised trial, 33 general practices in eastern England were randomly assigned by the method of minimisation in an <b>unbalanced</b> design to: <b>screening</b> followed by intensive multifactorial treatment for people diagnosed with diabetes (n= 15); screening plus routine care of diabetes according to national guidelines (n= 13); and a no-screening control group (n= 5). The study population consisted of 20   184 individuals aged 40 – 69 years (mean 58 years), at high risk of prevalent undiagnosed diabetes, {{on the basis of a}} previously validated risk score. In screening practices, individuals were invited to a stepwise programme including random capillary blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) tests, a fasting capillary blood glucose test, and a confirmatory oral glucose tolerance test. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. All participants were flagged for mortality surveillance by the England and Wales Office of National Statistics. Analysis was by intention-to-screen and compared all-cause mortality rates between screening and control groups. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 86769081. FindingsOf 16   047 high-risk individuals in screening practices, 15   089 (94 %) were invited for screening during 2001 – 06, 11   737 (73 %) attended, and 466 (3 %) were diagnosed with diabetes. 4137 control individuals were followed up. During 184   057 person-years of follow up (median duration 9 · 6 years [IQR 8 · 9 – 9 · 9]), there were 1532 deaths in the screening practices and 377 in control practices (mortality hazard ratio [HR] 1 · 06, 95 % CI 0 · 90 – 1 · 25). We noted no significant reduction in cardiovascular (HR 1 · 02, 95 % CI 0 · 75 – 1 · 38), cancer (1 · 08, 0 · 90 – 1 · 30), or diabetes-related mortality (1 · 26, 0 · 75 – 2 · 10) associated with invitation to screening. InterpretationIn this large UK sample, screening for type 2 diabetes in patients at increased risk was not associated with a reduction in all-cause, cardiovascular, or diabetes-related mortality within 10 years. The benefits of screening might be smaller than expected and restricted to individuals with detectable disease.
