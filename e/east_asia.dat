Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the century, and remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service.

She remained with the <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron for only a few days, as Müller convinced Spee to detach Emden as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the two ships, accompanied by three light cruisers and several colliers, sailed across the Pacific Ocean—in the process evading the various Allied naval forces sent to intercept them—before arriving off the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, Gneisenau {{and the rest of the}} <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel.
