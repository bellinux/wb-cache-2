However, the identification of efficacious <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> remains a non-trivial and challenging task due to the huge number of possible combinations among the candidate drugs. As an important factor, the molecular context in which drugs exert their functions can provide crucial insights into the mechanism underlying <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> Results In this work, we present a network biology approach to investigate <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> and their target proteins {{in the context of}} genetic interaction networks and the related human pathways, in order to better understand the underlying rules of effective <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> Our results indicate that combinatorial drugs tend to have a smaller effect radius in the genetic interaction networks, which is an important parameter to describe the therapeutic effect of a <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> from the network perspective.

However, the emergence of virus-drug resistance and both short- and long-term drug-related side effects are among {{the main reasons for}} continuing the development of new classes of effective anti-HIV drugs that target the replicative cycle at different sites. In recent years, tremendous {{progress has been made in}} understanding HIV- 1 entry, a multistep process that comprises viral attachment, coreceptor interactions and fusion. The mechanistic insight gained from these studies has enabled the design of specific agents that can inhibit each step in the HIV entry process. The successful results from clinical trials with enfuvirtide (T- 20), the first approved entry inhibitor, indicate that targeting of HIV entry will soon be an important component of antiretroviral therapy and further encourage the development of effective entry inhibitors.

40|$|Experience in {{clinical}} practice {{and research in}} systems pharmacology suggested the limita-tions of the current one-drug-one-target paradigm in new drug discovery. Single-target drugs may not always produce desired physiological effects on the entire biological sys-tem, {{even if they have}} successfully regulated the activities of their designated targets. On the other hand, multicomponent therapy, in which two or more agents simultaneously interact with multiple targets, has attracted growing attention. Many <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> consisting of multiple agents have already entered clinical practice, especially in treating complex and refractory diseases. <b>Drug</b> <b>combination</b> database (DCDB), launched in 2010, is the first available database that collects and organizes information on <b>drug</b> <b>combinations,</b> with an aim to facilitate systems-oriented new drug discovery.

40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>combinations</b> may exhibit {{synergistic}} or antagonistic effects. Rational {{design of}} synergistic <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> remains a challenge despite active experimental and computational efforts.

We therefore modeled the effects of <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> along with their targets interacting in a network, trying to elucidate {{the relationships between the}} network topology involving drug targets and <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> effects. We used three-node enzymatic networks with various topologies and parameters to study two-drug combinations.

As a result, {{this study was designed to}} elucidate the ability of Leishmania donovani to develop experimental resistance to anti-leishmanial <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> The induction of resistance to amphotericin B/miltefosine, amphotericin B/paromomycin, amphotericin B/Sb(III), miltefosine/paromomycin, and Sb(III) /paromomycin was determined using a step-wise adaptation process to increasing drug concentrations. Intracellular amastigotes resistant to these <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> were obtained from resistant L. donovani promastigote forms, and the thiol and ATP levels and the mitochondrial membrane potential of the resistant lines were analysed. Resistance to <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> was obtained after 10 weeks and remained in the intracellular amastigotes. Additionally, this resistance proved to be unstable. More importantly, we observed that promastigotes/amastigotes resistant to one <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> showed a marked cross-resistant profile to other anti-leishmanial drugs. Additionally, the thiol levels increased in resistant lines that remained protected against the drug-induced loss of ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential.

Resistance to the combinations miltefosine/paromomycin and Sb(III) /paromomycin is easily obtained experimentally.

This indicated that there was an increase in toxicity by the <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> in PC- 3 cells; however, the increased toxicity was not sustainable. PC- 3 cell line was still resistant to docetaxel. These results demonstrated that the RTCA can be used to identify <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> that can effectively be used to treat prostate cancer.|$|R
