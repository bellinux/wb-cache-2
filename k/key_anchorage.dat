5000|$|Fort Gilkicker is a {{historic}} Palmerston fort built at {{the eastern end of}} Stokes Bay, Gosport, Hampshire to dominate the <b>key</b> <b>anchorage</b> of Spithead. It was erected between 1863 and 1871 as a semi-circular arc with 22 casemates, to be armed with 5 12" [...] guns, 17 10" [...] guns and 5 9" [...] guns. The actual installed armament rather differed from this. In 1902 the RML guns were replaced by 2 9.2" [...] and 2 6" [...] BL guns, and before the First World War the walls were further strengthened with substantial earthwork embankments.|$|E

40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood monocytes secrete a soluble factor that enhances {{the ability of}} human epithelial tumor cell lines to clone in soft agar. Monocytes increased colony growth in a concentration-dependent manner, although inhi-bition of cell growth was observed {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of monocytes. Addition of indomethacin to monocytes did not abrogate this inhi-bition. Exposure of monocytes to endotoxin increased their ability to secrete stimulatory factors. Nonadherent lymphocytes were unable to support colony growth. Conditioned media from unstimulated monocytes also increased col-ony growth. Growth-promoting activity was detected in the media within the first 24 hr of culture, reaching a peak at 72 hr. Activity was not observed in monocyte lysates. Monocytes released this activity when cultured in the pres-ence of both serum-free and serum-containing media. The activity was nondi-alyzable, relatively heat stable, and failed to adhere to CM-Sephadex. The demonstration of a monocyte-derived factor that enhances growth of epithelial tumor colonies supports findings indicating that inflammatory products may enhance tumor cell growth in vitro. <b>Key</b> words: <b>anchorage</b> independence, inflammatory produc...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAnillins and Mid 1 are {{scaffold}} {{proteins that}} play <b>key</b> roles in <b>anchorage</b> of the contractile ring at the cell equator during cytokinesis in animals and fungi, respectively. Here, we report crystal structures and functional analysis of human anillin and S.  pombe Mid 1. The combined data show anillin contains a cryptic C 2 domain and a Rho-binding domain. Together with the tethering PH domain, three membrane-associating elements synergistically bind to RhoA and phospholipids to anchor anillin at the cleavage furrow. Surprisingly, Mid 1 also binds to the membrane through a cryptic C 2 domain. Dimerization of Mid 1 leads to high affinity and preference for PI(4, 5) P 2, which stably anchors Mid 1 at the division plane, bypassing {{the requirement for}} Rho GTPase. These findings uncover the unexpected general machinery and the divergent regulatory logics for the anchorage of the contractile ring through the anillin/Mid 1 family proteins from yeast to humans...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} amount of {{anchorage}} loss of the maxillary posterior teeth and amount of retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth between en masse retraction and two-step retraction of the anterior teeth. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 30 female adult patients with Class I maloc-clusion and lip protrusion who needed maximum posterior anchorage. The sample was subdivided into group 1 (n 15, mean age 21. 4 years, en masse retraction) and group 2 (n 15, mean age 24. 6 years, two-step retraction). Lateral cephalograms were taken before (T 1) and after treatment (T 2). Nine skeletal and 10 anchorage variables were measured, and independent t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Although {{the amount of}} horizontal retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth was not different between the two groups, there was mild labial movement of the root apices of the upper incisors in group 2 at T 2. There {{were no significant differences}} in the degree of anchorage loss of the maxillary posterior teeth between the two groups. Bodily and mesial movements of the upper molars occurred in both groups. Approximately 4 mm of the retraction of the upper incisal edges resulted from 1 mm of anchorage loss in the upper molars in both groups. Conclusion: No significant differences existed in the degree of anchorage loss of the upper posterior teeth and the amount of retraction of the upper anterior teeth associated with en masse retraction and two-step retraction of the anterior teeth. <b>KEY</b> WORDS: <b>Anchorage</b> loss; Lip protrusion; En masse retraction; Two-step retractio...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if the distribution of lateral root strength is related to the shape of the system and the forces withstood, wood samples were taken from roots of various mature tree species and the strength tested. Root strength decreased along the root at different rates, {{depending on the type of}} root system present. Slightly tapered lateral roots in plate root systems were relatively stronger further away from the stem than the highly tapered laterals in heart and tap root systems. Wood strength in Norway spruce (plate system) was found to increase along the lateral roots before decreasing again. The increase in strength may coincide with the point of maximum bending of the root as the tree sways backwards and forwards in the wind. Strength was also found to increase on the underside of lateral roots in the plate systems of poplar. The undersides of these roots will experience high compressive stresses due to the weight of the tree pushing the root on to the hard bearing surface of the soil. External loading forces in plate root systems will be transmitted into the soil further away from the stem due to the lack of branches, therefore a high strength along the root will help resist mechanical stress. The high rate of branching near the stem, or large, rigid, main tap root, found in heart and tap root systems, respectively, allows a faster dissipation of forces nearer the stem, therefore a high investment in strength further along the root is not necessary. <b>Key</b> words: <b>Anchorage,</b> stability, wind, stress, forces...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation are {{presented in this article}} for improving the shear capacity and ductility of reinforced concrete beams by using CFRP strips. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain ductile flexural behavior for shear-deficient reinforced concrete beams. The experimental program consisted of 10 T cross-sectioned half scale simply supported beam specimens, seven of which were constructed with deficient shear reinforcement and the remaining three without any shear reinforcement. One beam was used as a reference and nine beams were strengthened using U-shaped CFRP strips with or without fan type anchorage. Three different CFRP strip spacing such as sf 125 mm, 150 mm, and 200 mm were used. The effect of anchorages that were used at the ends of the strips on shear strength and behavior of the strengthened specimens was investigated. CFRP strips without anchorages improved the shear strength, but no flexural behavior was observed. specimens failed with brittle shear failure due to peeling of CFRP strip from RC beam surfaces. specimens with deficient shear reinforcement that were strengthened with anchored CFRP strips showed improved shear strength and ductile flexural behavior was observed. Similar behaviors were observed for specimens even without any shear reinforcement. When the CFRP strip strains of the specimens with anchorages and without anchorages were compared, maximum strains at anchored strips were approximately 56 % larger than that of without <b>anchorages.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: RC beam, shear strengthening, CFRP strips, anchorages...|$|R
40|$|PMA 06 : The Second International Symposium on Plant Growth Modeling Simulation, Visualization and ApplicationsInternational audienceBackground and Aims: The Finite Element Method (FEM) {{has been}} used in recent years to {{simulate}} overturning processes in trees. This study aimed at using FEM to determine the role of individual roots in tree anchorage with regard to different rooting patterns, and to estimate stress distribution in the soil and roots during overturning. Methods: The FEM was used to carry out 2 -D simulations of tree uprooting in saturated soft clay and loamy sand-like soil. The anchorage model consisted of a root system embedded in a soil block. Two root patterns were used and individual roots removed to determine their contribution to <b>anchorage.</b> <b>Key</b> Results: In clay-like soil the size of the root–soil plate formed during overturning was defined by the longest roots. Consequently, all other roots localized within this plate had no influence on anchorage strength. In sand-like soil, removing individual root elements altered anchorage resistance. This result was due to a modification of the shape and size of the root–soil plate, as well as the location of the rotation axis. The tap root and deeper roots had more influence on overturning resistance in sand-like soil compared with clay-like soil. Mechanical stresses were higher in the most superficial roots and also in leeward roots in sand-like soil. The relative difference in stresses between the upper and lower sides of lateral roots was sensitive to root insertion angle. Assuming that root eccentricity is a response to mechanical stresses, these results explain why eccentricity differs depending on root architecture. Conclusions: A simple 2 -D Finite Element model was developed to better understand the mechanisms involved during tree overturning. It has been shown how root system morphology and soil mechanical properties can modify the shape of the root plate slip surface as well as the position of the rotation axis, which are major components of tree anchorage...|$|R
