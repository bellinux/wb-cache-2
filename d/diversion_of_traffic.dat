500|$|In 1965, the Chamber pressed Taylor {{for further}} {{upgrades}} to the highway, including safety improvements to intersections {{and the construction}} of adequate shoulders. [...] Taylor stated that the province was doing its best to improve the road, but funds were being spread among other important highway projects in the province. [...] "Meanwhile, you must not forget you have a completely black topped road here, one that is equal to the best roads in some of the other provinces and the United States," [...] Taylor said. [...] Nevertheless, the Chamber was still concerned about the condition of the road, particularly in the Crowsnest Pass region where mountainous terrain and steep grades were making upgrades difficult. [...] There was also concern about the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from Highway3 to the Trans-Canada Highway, which would {{have a negative effect on}} the economies of southern Alberta municipalities.|$|E
500|$|Before the four-lane bypass {{south of}} Monarch across the Oldman River was constructed, Highway3 passed through Monarch {{and crossed the}} river {{southwest}} of the town on a bridge built in 1957. [...] This stretch is now designated as Highway3A. [...] The interchange at Highway3A (then Highway3) and Highway23 near Monarch was completed in 1984. [...] Highway23 had been shifted slightly west to eliminate two 90° bends in the route near Nobleford. [...] The new interchange was initially criticized for being confusing, causing many drivers to make wrong turns. [...] Counter-intuitively, traffic continuing westbound through the interchange on Highway3 exited to the right, passing underneath Highway23. [...] Southbound traffic on Highway23 turning west onto Highway 3 had to turn left across the westbound lanes to access the aforementioned single lane ramp. Macleod MLA LeRoy Fjordbotten promised improved signage and lighting for the interchange in early 1984. [...] Fort Macleod Mayor Wes Olmstead was concerned that the interchange, along with upgrades of Highways519 and 520, encouraged northbound traffic to use Highway23 instead of continuing west to his community and using Highway2. [...] The towns of Pincher Creek and Nanton had similar concerns about the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> caused by the new interchange. [...] Transport Minister Henry Kroeger disagreed and thought the concerns were unwarranted; of Fort Macleod, he stated, [...] "the town won't disappear {{as a result of}} the interchange." [...] Alberta had long-term plans for Highway23 to be twinned, and for the Monarch interchange to be expanded to a partial cloverleaf. [...] The possibility of a southern Monarch bypass had already been identified by the mid-1980s.|$|E

Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) {{is the most}} {{frequent}} anemia found in hospitalized patients, often occurring in subjects suffering from chronic inflammatory disorders. The underlying <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> iron <b>traffic</b> leads to a withdrawal of the metal from the sites of erythropoiesis and the circulation to the storage compartment in the reticuloendothelial system, thus resulting, at the same time, in hypoferremia and hyperferritinemia.

The role of these factors, {{as well as the}} pathophysiological reasons for the development of ACD, is discussed in this review...|$|R
25|$|Dumfries is a {{relatively}} prosperous community but the town centre has {{been exposed to the}} centrifugal forces that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town's urban fringe.

The immediate effect of this was as intended the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> transiting <b>traffic</b> away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.|$|R

In 1867 an Act was obtained to make a harbour at Barry. Both of these proposals foundered, chiefly because the Taff Vale Railway practically monopolised the transport of coal from the Taff and Rhondda Valleys to Cardiff, and was hostile to <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> that <b>traffic</b> from its new harbour at Penarth.

Our results show that Arctic shipping in 2050 will contribute less than 1 % to the total BC deposition north of 60 °N due to the much greater relative contribution of BC transported from non-shipping sources at lower latitudes. We suggest that regulation of the Arctic shipping industry will be an insufficient control on high-latitude BC deposition...|$|R

Therefore, the issues <b>of</b> route <b>diversion</b> and value <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> information in route guidance control scheme become significant. In the present research, a systematic framework based on traffic assignment models is proposed to analyze the value <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> information in implementing route diversion strategies for on-line traffic management purposes, especially under the impacts <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> incidents.
