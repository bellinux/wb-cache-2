40|$|International audienceWhen immunocompetent {{people become}} {{infected}} with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the disease is generally asymptomatic. However, transplacental transmission of T. gondii may lead to severe congenital infection including in utero abortion, foetal death, or neurological or ocular damage of the foetus. France has had a national programme to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis since 1978. However, although estimated seroprevalence in pregnant women has fallen from 84 % in the 1960 s to 44 % in 2003, no reliable data have been available on the annual {{number of cases of}} congenital toxoplasmosis or the severity of infection. In 2006, the French National Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire) and the National Reference Centre for Toxoplasmosis recommended that a national laboratory-based surveillance system be used for the surveillance of the disease. In 2007, 31 laboratories reported at least one congenital case through the surveillance system, giving a total of 272 cases. A total of 11 terminations of pregnancy were reported (six abortions and five foetal deaths). Of the live-born cases, 206 were asymptomatic, 28 were symptomatic and seven had a severe form of the disease. As there were 818, 700 births in <b>France</b> and <b>French</b> <b>overseas</b> <b>departments</b> in 2007, the overall prevalence of congenital toxoplasmosis observed that year was 3. 3 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 9 to 3. 7) per 10, 000 live births and the incidence rate of the disease at birth was 2. 9 (95 % CI: 2. 5 to 3. 2) per 10, 000 live births; the estimated incidence rate of symptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis was 0. 34 (95 % CI: 0. 2 to 0. 5) cases per 10, 000 live births...|$|R

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of tourism in the Caribbean is rather limited despite the fact the {{industry}} is capital for the area. This industry is very important for the <b>French</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>Departments</b> and yet, the local corporate doing business in the sector are limited. Out of the 59 big <b>French</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>Department</b> corporate, only 14 (24 %) have tourism related activities. Tourism is the main activity for only one of them (7 %). For all the others (93 %), tourism is a fringe activity. Because the tourism sector is especially vulnerable to exogenous factors like political instability, economic crisis, natural disasters and the outbreak of diseases, the tourism industry can be considered as a high risk activity for entrepreneurs in <b>French</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>Departments.</b> The risk for corporate doing business only in the tourism sector in <b>French</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>Department</b> is therefore absolute. This risk is only speculative for corporate with tourism as a fringe activity and can become totally speculative for all corporate if the activities developed are non-exclusively tourism businesses. The findings of this research are calling for transformational entrepreneurs and transformational enterprises. The findings of this research are also calling for a better collaboration between stakeholders. Last but not least, it is extremely important for the entrepreneurs in the tourism industry in <b>French</b> <b>Overseas</b> <b>Departments</b> to provide high quality products and services as it is a differentiation tool...|$|R
