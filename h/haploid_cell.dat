25|$|Haploid {{cells are}} {{produced}} from pollen or egg cells or from other {{cells of the}} gametophyte, then by induced or spontaneous chromosome doubling, a doubled <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> is produced, which can be grown into a doubled haploid plant. If the original plant was diploid, the haploid cells are monoploid, and the term doubled monoploid {{may be used for}} the doubled haploids. Haploid organisms derived from tetraploids or hexaploids are sometimes called dihaploids (and the doubled dihaploids are, respectively, tetraploid or hexaploid).|$|E
25|$|A {{polar body}} biospy is the {{sampling}} of a polar body, {{which is a}} small <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally {{does not have the}} ability to be fertilized. Compared to a blastocyst biopsy, a polar body biopsy can potentially be of lower costs, less harmful side-effects, and more sensitive in detecting abnormalities. The main advantage of the use of polar bodies in PGD is that they are not necessary for successful fertilisation or normal embryonic development, thus ensuring no deleterious effect for the embryo. One of the disadvantages of PB biopsy is that it only provides information about the maternal contribution to the embryo, which is why cases of maternally inherited autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders that are exclusively maternally transmitted can be diagnosed, and autosomal recessive disorders can only partially be diagnosed. Another drawback is the increased risk of diagnostic error, for instance due to the degradation of the genetic material or events of recombination that lead to heterozygous first polar bodies.|$|E
2500|$|A {{spermatozoon}} (pronounced , alternate spelling spermatozoön; plural spermatozoa; from [...] "seed" [...] and [...] "living being") is a motile sperm cell, {{or moving}} {{form of the}} <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> that is the male gamete. A spermatozoon joins an ovum to form a zygote. (A zygote is a single cell, with {{a complete set of}} chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Haploid</b> <b>cells</b> {{are one of}} two mating types (a or α), {{and respond}} to the mating {{pheromone}} produced by <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> of the opposite mating type, and can mate with cells of the opposite mating type. <b>Haploid</b> <b>cells</b> cannot undergo meiosis. Diploid cells do not produce or respond to either mating pheromone and do not mate, but can undergo meiosis to produce four <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|In gametic meiosis, {{instead of}} {{immediately}} dividing meiotically to produce <b>haploid</b> <b>cells,</b> the zygote divides mitotically {{to produce a}} multicellular diploid individual {{or a group of}} more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> or gametes. <b>Haploid</b> <b>cells</b> may divide again (by mitosis) to form more <b>haploid</b> <b>cells,</b> as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.|$|R
50|$|A zygotic meiosis is a meiosis of a zygote {{immediately}} after karyogamy, {{which is the}} fusion of two cell nuclei. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b> These cells divide mitotically to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b> Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.|$|R
50|$|The alleles {{present at}} the MAT locus are {{sufficient}} to program the mating behaviour of the cell. For example, using genetic manipulations, a MATa allele {{can be added to}} a MATα <b>haploid</b> <b>cell.</b> Despite having a haploid complement of chromosomes, the cell now has both the MATa and MATα alleles, and will behave like a diploid cell: it will not produce or respond to mating pheromones, and when starved will attempt to undergo meiosis, with fatal results. Similarly, deletion of one copy of the MAT locus in a diploid cell, leaving only a single MATa or MATα allele, will cause a cell with a diploid complement of chromosomes to behave like a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{the role}} of NADK in {{increasing}} the NADPH pool appears to offer protection against apoptosis, there are also cases where NADK activity appears to potentiate cell death. Genetic studies done in human <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> lines indicate that knocking out NADK may protect from certain non-apoptotic stimuli.|$|E
50|$|Polar body biopsy is the {{sampling}} of a polar body of an oocyte. It was first applied clinically in humans in 1987 after extensive animal studies. A polar {{body is a}} small <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> that is formed concomitantly as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally {{does not have the}} ability to be fertilized.|$|E

50|$|In {{the whole}} cycle, gametes {{are usually the}} only <b>haploid</b> <b>cells,</b> and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{viruses that}} infect {{phytoplankton}} strongly influence the ecology {{and evolution of}} their hosts. Emiliania huxleyi {{is characterized by a}} biphasic life cycle composed of a diploid (2 N) and haploid (1 N) phase; diploid cells are susceptible to infection by specific coccolithoviruses, yet <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> are resistant. Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) play a role during infection, but their molecular distribution in <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> is unknown. We present mass spectrometric analyses of lipids from cultures of uninfected diploid, infected diploid, and uninfected haploid E. huxleyi. Known viral GSLs were present in the infected diploid cultures as expected, but surprisingly, trace amounts of viral GSLs were also detected in the uninfected <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b> Sialic-acid GSLs have been linked to viral susceptibility in diploid cells, but were found to be absent in the haploid cultures, suggesting a mechanism of haploid resistance to infection. Additional untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry data processed via multivariate analysis unveiled a number of novel biomarkers of infected, non-infected, and <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b> These data expand our understanding on the dynamics of lipid metabolism during E. huxleyi host/virus interactions and highlight potential novel biomarkers for infection, susceptibility, and ploidy...|$|R
5000|$|In the zygotic {{life cycle}} the {{organism}} is haploid instead, spawned by the proliferation and differentiation {{of a single}} <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> called the gamete. Two organisms of opposing sex contribute their haploid gametes to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis immediately, creating four haploid cells. These cells undergo mitosis to create the organism. Many fungi and many protozoa utilize the zygotic life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|A gamete (from Ancient Greek γαμετή gamete from gamein [...] "to marry") is a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> that fuses {{with another}} <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> during {{fertilization}} (conception) in organisms that sexually reproduce. In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, {{and in which}} each individual produces only one type, a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete—called an ovum (or egg)—and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type—called a sperm. This {{is an example of}} anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition in which females and males produce gametes of different sizes (this is the case in humans; the human ovum has approximately 100,000 times the volume of a single human sperm cell). In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators for mating type. The name gamete was introduced by the Austrian biologist Gregor Mendel. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one ploidy of each type, and are created through meiosis.|$|E
50|$|Haploid {{cells are}} {{produced}} from pollen or egg cells or from other {{cells of the}} gametophyte, then by induced or spontaneous chromosome doubling, a doubled <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> is produced, which can be grown into a doubled haploid plant. If the original plant was diploid, the haploid cells are monoploid, and the term doubled monoploid {{may be used for}} the doubled haploids. Haploid organisms derived from tetraploids or hexaploids are sometimes called dihaploids (and the doubled dihaploids are, respectively, tetraploid or hexaploid).|$|E
25|$|A {{doubled haploid}} (DH) is a {{genotype}} formed when <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> undergo chromosome doubling. Artificial production of doubled haploids {{is important in}} plant breeding.|$|R
50|$|Meiosis II is {{the second}} meiotic division, and usually {{involves}} equational segregation, or separation of sister chromatids. Mechanically, the process is similar to mitosis, though its genetic results are fundamentally different. The end result is production of four <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> (n chromosomes, 23 in humans) from the two <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> (with n chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids) produced in meiosis I. The four main steps of Meiosis II are: Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, and Telophase II.|$|R
25|$|Cell {{division}} {{involves a}} single cell (called a mother cell) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue) and to procreation (vegetative reproduction) in unicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells usually undergo {{a process of}} nuclear division, called mitosis, followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis. A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce <b>haploid</b> <b>cells,</b> usually four. <b>Haploid</b> <b>cells</b> serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.|$|R
50|$|Haploidisation is {{the process}} of halving the {{chromosomal}} content of a cell, creating a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell.</b> Within the normal reproductive cycle, haploidisation {{is one of the major}} functional consequences of meiosis, the other being a process of chromosomal crossover that mingles the genetic content of the parental chromosomes. Usually, haploidisation creates a monoploid cell from a diploid progenitor, or it can involve halving of a polyploid cell, for example to make a diploid potato plant from a tetraploid lineage of potato plants.|$|E
50|$|Fission yeast {{is easily}} accessible, easily grown and {{manipulated}} to make mutants, {{and able to}} be maintained at either a haploid or diploid state. S. pombe is normally a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> but, when put under stressful conditions, usually nitrogen deficiency, two cells will conjugate to form a diploid that later form four spores within a tetrad ascus. This process is easily visible and observable under any microscope and allows {{us to look at}} meiosis in a simpler model system to see how this phenomenon operates.|$|E
50|$|Although fungi are {{normally}} haploid, diploid cells can arise by two mechanisms. The {{first is a}} failure of the mitotic spindle during regular cell division, and does not involve karyogamy. The resulting cell can only be genetically homozygous since it is produced from one <b>haploid</b> <b>cell.</b> The second mechanism, involving karyogamy of somatic cells, can produce heterozygous diploids if the two nuclei differ in genetic information. The formation of somatic diploids is generally rare, and is thought to occur because of a mutation in the karyogamy repressor gene (KR).|$|E
50|$|<b>Haploid</b> algal <b>cells</b> (containing {{only one}} copy of their DNA) can fuse with other <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> to form diploid zygotes. When {{filamentous}} algae do this, they form bridges between cells, and leave empty cell walls behind {{that can be}} easily distinguished under the light microscope. This process is called conjugation and occurs for example in Spirogyra.|$|R
50|$|S. cerevisiae (yeast) can stably {{exist as}} either a diploid or a haploid. Both haploid and diploid yeast cells {{reproduce}} by mitosis, with daughter cells budding off of mother <b>cells.</b> <b>Haploid</b> <b>cells</b> are capable of mating with other <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> of the opposite mating type (an a cell can only mate with an α cell, and vice versa) to produce a stable diploid cell. Diploid cells, usually upon facing stressful conditions such as nutrient depletion, can undergo meiosis to produce four haploid spores: two a spores and two α spores.|$|R
50|$|Heterokaryons {{are found}} in the life cycle of yeasts, for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a genetic model organism. The {{heterokaryon}} stage is produced from the fusion of two <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b> This transient heterokaryon can produce further <b>haploid</b> buds, or <b>cell</b> nuclei can fuse and produce a diploid cell, which can then undergo mitosis.|$|R
50|$|A {{polar body}} is a small <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> that is formed {{concomitantly}} as an egg cell during oogenesis, but which generally {{does not have the}} ability to be fertilized. When certain diploid cells in animals undergo cytokinesis after meiosis to produce egg cells, they sometimes divide unevenly. Most of the cytoplasm is segregated into one daughter cell, which becomes the egg or ovum, while the smaller polar bodies only get a small amount of cytoplasm. They frequently die (apoptosis) and disappear, but in some cases they remain and can be important in the life cycle of the organism.|$|E
50|$|Polar bodies {{serve to}} {{eliminate}} {{one half of}} the diploid chromosome set produced by meiotic division in the egg, leaving behind a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell.</b> To produce the polar bodies, the cell must divide asymmetrically, which is fueled by furrowing (formation of a trench) near a particular point on the cell membrane. The presence of chromosomes induces the formation of an actomyosin cortical cap, a myosin II ring structure and a set of spindle fibers, the rotation of which promotes invagination {{at the edge of the}} cell membrane and splits the polar body away from the oocyte.|$|E
50|$|HAP1 {{cells have}} been used to create a new {{completely}} <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> line. Researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 system to delete the portion of Chromosome 15 that is present in HAP1 cells. They simultaneously cleaved both ends of the Chromosome 15 region by the endonuclease Cas9, which led to the elimination of the fragment. The Cas9 was programmed by short guide RNAs (gRNAs) to cleave any sequence complementary them. The sequence for the Chromosome 19/15 fusion is unknown, so the gRNAs were programed to cut within the Chromosome 15 region. With this technique, experimenters were able to cultivate the first fully haploid human cell line which they termed eHAP.|$|E
25|$|So, {{in normal}} diploid organisms, {{autosomal}} chromosomes {{are present in}} two copies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> have single copies.|$|R
50|$|Meiosis I segregates {{homologous}} chromosomes, {{which are}} joined as tetrads (2n, 4c), producing two <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> (n chromosomes, 23 in humans) which each contain chromatid pairs (1n, 2c). Because the ploidy is reduced from diploid to haploid, meiosis I {{is referred to}} as a reductional division. Meiosis II is an equational division analogous to mitosis, in which the sister chromatids are segregated, creating four <b>haploid</b> daughter <b>cells</b> (1n, 1c).|$|R
40|$|The growth {{inhibitory}} {{activity of}} p-fluorophenylalv ine (PFP) (concentration range 25 [...] 75 µg/ml) {{has been tested}} on callus initiation and early callus growth and on suspension cultures derived from one diploid and three haploid plants of Nicotiana syloestris. All the culture lines contained cells at more than one level of ploidy; the cultures of haploid origin contained {{a high level of}} <b>haploid</b> <b>cells.</b> Under conditions of partial growth inhibition by PFP there was, despite the reduced sensitivity of the cultures of haploid origin, no preferential growth of <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> in these cultures. Genotype not ploidy level determined sensitivity to growth inhibition by PFP...|$|R
50|$|These {{additional}} {{copies of}} the mating type information do {{not interfere with the}} function of whatever allele is present at the MAT locus because they are not expressed, so a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> with the MATa allele present at the active MAT locus is still an a cell, despite also having a (silenced) copy of the MATα allele present at HML. Only the allele present at the active MAT locus is transcribed, and thus only the allele present at MAT will influence cell behaviour. Hidden mating type loci are epigenetically silenced by SIR proteins, which form a heterochromatin scaffold that prevents transcription from the silent mating cassettes.|$|E
50|$|Homozygous {{plants with}} {{desirable}} traits {{can be produced}} from heterozygous starting plants, if a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> with the alleles for those traits can be produced, and then {{used to make a}} doubled haploid. The doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits. Furthermore, two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of F1 hybrid plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits. Thus, an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety (F1 hybrid) without the necessity of vegetative reproduction but {{as the result of the}} cross of two homozygous/doubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant.|$|E
5000|$|The myxoedemae of Polysphondylium pallidum {{were found}} to exist in two {{separate}} mating types in an early (1975) study on the species, [...] but a more recent morphological study left {{the question of the}} number of identifiable and separate mating types undecided.Under favourable damp conditions, a <b>haploid</b> <b>cell</b> with a single set of chromosomes will unite with another cell of opposite mating type to form a diploid cell, with a double complement of chromosomes. Other nearby amoeboid cells are absorbed into this diploid cell by phagocytosis to form a giant cell. This undergoes meiosis and becomes a large cyst in which spores are formed and later released to be dispersed by air movements.|$|E
5000|$|The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a {{single-celled}} haploid organism that reproduces asexually by mitosis and fission. However, {{exposure to}} the DNA damaging agent hydrogen peroxide induces pair-wise mating of <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> of opposite mating type to form transient diploid cells that then undergo meiosis to form asci, each with four ascospores. [...] The production of viable ascospores depends on successful recombinational repair during meiosis. [...] When this repair is defective a quality control mechanism prevents germination of damaged ascospores. These findings suggest that mating followed by meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA damage in the parental <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> {{in order to allow}} production of viable progeny ascospores.|$|R
40|$|Haploid {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells combine haploidy and pluripotency, enabling direct genetic analyses of recessive phenotypes in vertebrate <b>cells.</b> <b>Haploid</b> <b>cells</b> have been elusive for culture, {{due to their}} inferior growth and genomic instability. Here, we generated gynogenetic medaka embryos and obtained three <b>haploid</b> ES <b>cell</b> lines that retained pluripotency and competitive growth. Upon nuclear transfer into unfertilized oocytes, the <b>haploid</b> ES <b>cells,</b> even after genetic engineering, generated viable offspring capable of germline transmission. Hence, <b>haploid</b> medaka ES <b>cells</b> stably maintain normal growth, pluripotency, and genomic integrity. Mosaic oocytes created by combining a mitotic nucleus and a meiotic nucleus can generate fertile fish offspring. <b>Haploid</b> ES <b>cells</b> may offer a yeast-like system for analyzing recessive phenotypes in numerous cell lineages of vertebrates in vitro. Haploidy, {{the presence of a}} single genomeor chromosome set per cell, as in yeast(1), is a powerful system for genetic analy-ses of molecular events because any recessive mutations of essential genes will show a clear phenotype due to the absence of a second gene copy. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripoten...|$|R
50|$|In fungi, {{the sexual}} fusion of <b>haploid</b> <b>cells</b> is called karyogamy. The result of karyogamy is a diploid cell called a zygote or zygospore. This cell may then enter meiosis or mitosis {{depending}} on {{the life cycle of}} the species.|$|R
