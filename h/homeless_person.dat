25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a human being is justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a doctor or a <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> must die to save the lives of many others, the <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> face many {{barriers}} to health care, have few resources, and experience high death rates. They live lives of disenfranchisement and neglect.

25|$|In 2010 in New York City, {{where there}} were over 36,000 {{homeless}} people in 2009, there was a mobile video exhibit in the streets showing a <b>homeless</b> <b>person</b> on a screen and asking onlookers and passersby to text with their cellphones a message for him, and they also could donate money by cellphones to the organization Pathways to Housing. In September 2010, {{it was reported that}} the Housing First Initiative had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population in Boston, Massachusetts, although homeless families were still increasing in number. Some shelters were reducing the number of beds due to lowered numbers of homeless, and some emergency shelter facilities were closing, especially the emergency Boston Night Center.

40|$|From contact {{investigation}} to tuberculosis screening of drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Rotterdam Gerard de Vries and Rob A. van Hest Background: In early 2001 there were indications that tuberculosis (TB) was increasingly becoming a problem among drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Rotterdam, after a periodical screening was discontinued in 1997. A contact investigation around a homeless drug addicted man in Rotterdam with infectious pulmonary TB is described. Contact investigation: A total of 507 drug addicts, <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> and staff of facilities for these risk groups were examined with tuberculin skin testing (TST) and chest radiography. DNA fingerprinting of mycobacteriological cultures through Restricted Fragment Length Polymorphism methodology and molecular epidemiology investigation through cluster analysis were performed. Outcome: TST showed an infection prevalence of 29 %, especially among staff {{of services for}} drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons.</b> Six persons with active intrathoracic TB were identified. Cluster analysis demonstrated no relation with the initial case but showed intense transmission of TB among drug addicts and <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Rotterdam bymultiple sources.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{nutrition and}} related health problems among homeless Americans, summarizes recent information, and identifies needs for services and future research. The nature of homelessness today provides {{a context for}} the discussion. Many <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> eat fewer meals per day, lack food more often, {{and are more likely}} to have inadequate diets and poorer nutritional status than housed U. S. populations. Yet many homeless people eligible for food stamps do not receive them. While public and private agencies provide nutritious food and meals for <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> availability of the services to <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> is limited. Many homeless people lack appropriate health care, and certain nutrition-related health problems are prevalent among them. Compared with housed populations, alcoholism, anemia, and growth problems are more common among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> and pregnancy rates are higher. The risks vary among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> for malnutrition, nutrition-related health problems, drug and alcohol abuse, and mental illness. For example, among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> fewer heads of families than single adults are substance abusers, and mental illness varies in prevalence among single men, single women, and parents in <b>homeless</b> families. <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> need improved access to food, nutrition, and health services. More nutrition education needs to be available to them and to service providers. Use of representative samples and validation of self-reported nutrition and health data will help future investigators to clarify the relationships between the characteristics of the homeless and their nutritional status...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a {{major public}} health problem. The Airin {{district}} of Osaka City has a large population of <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers and {{is estimated to be}} the largest TB-endemic area in the intermediate-prevalence country, Japan. However, there have been few studies of <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers. The objective {{of this study is to}} detect active TB and to assess the prevalence and risk factors for latent TB infection among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study for screening TB infection (active and latent TB infections) using questionnaire, chest X-ray (CXR), newly available assay for latent TB infection (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube; QFT) and clinical evaluation by physicians at the Osaka Socio-Medical Center Hospital between July 2007 and March 2008. <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and caregivers, aged 30 - 74 years old, who had not received CXR examination within one year, were recruited. As for risk factors of latent TB infection, the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for QFT-positivity were calculated using logistic regression model. Results Complete responses were available from 436 individuals (263 <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and 173 caregivers). Four active TB cases (1. 5 %) among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> were found, while there were no cases among caregivers. Out of these four, three had positive QFT results. One hundred and thirty-three (50. 6 %) <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> and 42 (24. 3 %) caregivers had positive QFT results. In multivariate analysis, QFT-positivity was independently associated with a long time spent in the Airin district: ≥ 10 years versus Conclusions Although no active TB was found for caregivers, one-quarter of them had latent TB infection. In addition to <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> caregivers need examinations for latent TB infection as well as active TB and careful follow-up, especially when they have spent a long time in a TB-endemic area and/or have been exposed to TB patients. </p...|$|R

500|$|The term [...] "tramp dentist" [...] {{refers to}} an unskilled {{individual}} who practices dentistry.

40|$|Abstract Background Comorbid {{psychiatric}} illness can undermine outcomes among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> undergoing addiction treatment, and psychiatric specialty {{care is not}} always readily available. The prognosis for nonsubstance abuse psychiatric diagnoses among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> receiving behaviorally-based addiction treatment, however, is little studied. Results Data from an addiction treatment trial for 95 cocaine-dependent <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> (1996 – 1998) were used to profile psychiatric diagnoses at baseline and 6 months, including mood-related disorders (e. g. depression) and anxiety-related disorders (e. g. post-traumatic stress disorder). Treatment interventions, including systematic reinforcement for goal attainment, were behavioral in orientation. There was a 32 % reduction in the prevalence of comorbid non-addiction psychiatric disorder from baseline to 6 months, with similar reductions in the prevalence of mood (- 32 %) and anxiety-related disorders (- 20 %) (p = 0. 12). Conclusion Among cocaine-dependent <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> with psychiatric comorbidity undergoing behavioral addiction treatment, a reduction in comorbid psychiatric disorder prevalence was observed over 6 months. Not all participants improved, suggesting that even evidence-based addiction treatment will prove insufficient for a meaningful proportion of the dually diagnosed homeless population. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Montreal is Canada's second-largest city, where mean annual {{tuberculosis}} (TB) incidence from 1996 to 2007 was 8. 9 / 100, 000. The {{objectives of}} this study were to describe the epidemiology of TB among <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> in Montreal and assess patterns of transmission and sharing of key locations. Methods We reviewed demographic, clinical, and microbiologic data for all active TB cases reported in Montreal from 1996 to 2007 and identified <b>persons</b> who were <b>homeless</b> in the year prior to TB diagnosis. We genotyped all available Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates by IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS 6110 - RFLP) and spoligotyping, and used a geographic information system to identify potential locations for transmission between persons with matching isolates. Results There were 20 cases of TB in <b>homeless</b> <b>persons,</b> out of 1823 total reported from 1996 - 2007. 17 / 20 were Canadian-born, including 5 Aboriginals. <b>Homeless</b> <b>persons</b> were more likely than non-homeless persons to have pulmonary TB (20 / 20), smear-positive disease (17 / 20, odds ratio (OR) = 5. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 7 - 20), HIV co-infection (12 / 20, OR = 14, 95 %CI: 4. 8 - 40), and a history of substance use. The median duration from symptom onset to diagnosis was 61 days for <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> vs. 28 days for non-homeless persons (P = 0. 022). Eleven <b>homeless</b> <b>persons</b> with TB belonged to genotype-defined clusters (OR = 5. 4, 95 %CI: 2. 2 - 13), and ten potential locations for transmission were identified, including health care facilities, homeless shelters/drop-in centres, and an Aboriginal community centre.
