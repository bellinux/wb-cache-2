40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{protocol}} for reliable multicast in a multi-hop mobile radio network. The protocol is reliable, i. e., it guarantees message delivery to all multicast nodes even when the topology of the network changes during multicasting. The proposed protocol uses a core based shared tree. The multicast tree may get fragmented due to node movements. A notion of <b>forwarding</b> <b>region</b> is introduced which is used to glue together fragments of a multicast trees. The gluing process involves flooding of the <b>forwarding</b> <b>region</b> of the nodes which witness topology change due to node movements. Delivery of multicast messages to mobile nodes is expedited through i) pushing of the message by witness nodes in their <b>forwarding</b> <b>regions</b> and ii) pulling of messages by a mobile node during (re) joining process. Hence, the protocol conserves network bandwidth by using a combination of the push-pull approach and limiting network flooding to only minimal parts of the network that is affected by to [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the information given by ITS and TPC, more specialized detectors are needed: the TOF measures, with a precision better than {{a tenth of a}} billionth of a second, the time that each particle takes to travel from the vertex to reach it, so that one can measure its speed. The high momentum particle identification detector (HMPID) measures the faint light patterns generated by fast particles and the TRD measures the special radiation very fast particles emit when crossing different materials, thus allowing to identify electrons.

5000|$|As the {{surfaces}} (known as cohesive surfaces) separate, traction first increases until a maximum is reached, and then subsequently reduces to zero {{which results in}} complete separation. The variation in traction in relation to displacement is plotted on a curve and is called the traction-displacement curve. The area under this curve {{is equal to the}} energy needed for separation.CZM maintains continuity conditions mathematically; despite physical separation. It eliminates singularity of stress and limits it to the cohesive strength of the material. [...] The traction-displacement curve gives the constitutive behavior of the fracture. For each material system, guidelines are to be formed and modelling is done individually. This is how the CZM works. The amount of fracture energy dissipated in the work region depends on the shape of the model considered. Also, the ratio between maximum stress and the yield stress affects the length of fracture process zone. Smaller the ratio, longer is the process zone. The CZM allows the energy to flow into the fracture process zone, where a part of it is spent in the <b>forward</b> <b>region</b> and rest in the wake region.|$|E
50|$|Once {{concentrated}} in the brain, the highly fluid psychic pneuma travels along the network of the eye until it penetrates the <b>forward</b> <b>region.</b> The pneuma mixes with a preexisting aqueous humor, filling up the uvea and causing the stretches observed within the pupil. If one eye is closed and another is left open, the pneuma designated to the closed eye is instead redirected to the open one, causing {{the expansion of the}} pupil observed afterward. After collecting in the uvea, this pneuma then travels along the medium of air, causing a transformation that conforms to the shape around it, sending this signal back to the eye. An analogy to describe this phenomenon is offered by Hunayn: If a person is walking in the dark and holds a stick in his hand and stretches it out full length before him, and the stick encounters an object which prevents it from advancing further, he knows immediately by analogy that the object preventing the stick from advancing is a solid body which resists anything that comes up against it...it is the same with vision. In other words, the air acts as the stick that allows the pneuma to identify the object, and transmit that back to the eye to produce sight {{as long as there is}} light. Both light and pneuma act together to eradicate barriers and direct the immediate transition of sensation to the eye, thus attaining vision.|$|E
