Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale <b>for</b> <b>changing</b> their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding.

Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{companies}} want to retain creative {{control over their}} intellectual properties and are wary of fan-created works, like fan fiction.

Rooster Teeth initially tried to release Red vs. Blue unnoticed by Halos owners because they feared that any communication would force them to end the project. However, Microsoft, Bungie's parent company at the time, contacted the group shortly after episode 2, and allowed them to continue without paying licensing fees.|$|E

Kispiro made it to the 5000 metres final as the slowest qualifier and secured a fifteenth-place finish, and took a tenth-position result in the 10,000 metres despite falling onto the track's surface. Thomas Ayeko finished in sixteenth in the same event. Kiprotich won the men's marathon, securing Uganda's first gold medal since 1972.|$|E
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused him to lose his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010–11 campaign, he gained media attention <b>for</b> <b>changing</b> his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch him play.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} restart, Ragan was black flagged <b>for</b> <b>changing</b> lanes {{before the start}} / finish line just before the sixteenth caution came out after a three-car accident, {{involving}} Earnhardt, Jr.; Newman; and Truex, Jr. During the caution, Ragan drove to pit road, giving the lead to Trevor Bayne, with Labonte second. On the final lap of a second green-white-checker finish, Edwards and David Gilliland mounted a charge on the inside lane. Exiting turn four, Edwards drew alongside Labonte and closed in on Bayne, {{who moved to the}} bottom to block Edwards and maintained the lead to win his first race in his Sprint Cup Series career at the age of 20. Edwards finished second, ahead of Gilliland in third and Labonte in fourth. Kurt Busch clinched the fifth position; Montoya, Smith, Kyle Busch, Menard, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.|$|E

5|$|The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which {{split from}} the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, {{inherited}} the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier {{participated in the}} anti-Hindi imposition agitations during 1938–40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation <b>for</b> <b>changing</b> {{the name of a}} town – Dalmiapuram – to Kallakudi. They claimed that the town's name (after Ramkrishna Dalmia) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North. On 15 July 1953, M. Karunanidhi (later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and other DMK members erased the Hindi name in Dalmiapuram railway station's name board and lay down on the tracks. In the altercation with the Police that followed the protests, two DMK members lost their lives and several others including Karunanidhi and Kannadhasan were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Train Heartnet, once {{an assassin}} for Chronos, an {{organization}} bent on world peace that rules {{one third of}} the world's economy, is now an easygoing Sweeper (licensed bounty hunter) traveling with his partner Sven Vollfied. They meet and team up with professional thief Rinslet Walker in order to break into an arms dealer's home and obtain some data, but encounter a human bio-weapon named Eve that was created using nanotechnology. Sven and Train ultimately decide to free Eve from her owner and train her to be a Sweeper. Rinslet is kidnapped by Creed Diskenth, a former Chronos assassin that killed Train's friend Saya Minatsuki <b>for</b> <b>changing</b> Train's outlook on life and which contributed to him leaving Chronos, to persuade Train to join his group the Apostles of the Stars in order to overthrow Chronos and start a world revolution. The duel ends as a draw, with both Creed and Train injured.|$|E
5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops {{commenced}} after {{three hours and}} eight minutes with Tréluyer being {{the first of the}} leaders to stop with both Toyota cars following two minutes later. The safety car was deployed when Nakajima's right-front tyre failed on the Wellington straight following contact with a LMGTE car and debris from his Toyota was littered on the track. Nakajima pulled {{over to the side of}} the circuit at Brooklands corner and stopped. Marshals were required to remove the debris from the track. The safety car drove into the pit lane 12 minutes later and racing resumed with Tréluyer remaining in first and Lieb second. Nakajima's car was transported back into his garage for repairs. Dumas turned into Franchitti's Ford and half-spun into the grass at Club corner, losing more than ten seconds to Tréluyer. Dumas was forced wide into the Woodcote corner run-off area by Rao and Rees overtook Franchitti for fifth in LMGTE Pro. After serving an earlier three-minute stop-and-go penalty <b>for</b> <b>changing</b> the car's engine Calado was running in third place in LMGTE Pro while Buemi drove the No. 5 Toyota back onto the circuit after his car was repaired. Tréluyer made a pit stop for fuel and tyres with Fässler taking over the No. 7 car. Fässler was followed by Lieb making a pit stop from the lead and handed driving duties to Jani. Fässler thus retook the lead with a nine-second advantage.|$|E
