40|$|Treatment {{of female}} rats with <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> {{decreased}} both {{the activity of}} carnitine palmitoyltransferase and its Ki value for malonyl-CoA compared with pair-fed control rats. In starved rats, carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity and its Ki value for malonyl-CoA were both elevated as expected. Oestrogen treatment {{had no effect on}} carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity in the starved state, but the Ki value for malonyl-CoA was substantially decreased by oestrogen. Treatment with a more physiological concentration of <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> (15 micrograms/kg body wt. per day) also produced a decrease in the Ki value for malonyl-CoA. These data suggest that the oestrogen may produce its anti-ketogenic effect by increasing the affinity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase for its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA...|$|E

40|$|Rats {{treated with}} <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> have marked hypolipidaemia: serum {{cholesterol}} is decreased to 5 %, triacylglycerol to 10 % and phospholipid to 70 % of control concentrations. Loss of serum cholesterol follows an exponential decay, with a half-life of 1. 13 ± 0. 09 days. After 4 days of treatment, serum cholesterol concentrations remain relatively constant (ranging from 1 to 20 mg/ 100 ml) {{for at least}} 30 days. There is a concomitant 20 -fold decrease in the d< 1. 21 fraction of serum proteins and a similar decrease in serum apolipoproteins as measured by sodium dodecyl sulphate/ 10 %-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The activity of hepatic microsomal acyl-CoA–cholesterol O-acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 26) was significantly increased by <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> treatment (P< 0. 05). This activation caused hepatic cholesteryl esters containing mainly C 18 : 1 fatty acids to increase linearly as serum cholesterol concentrations decreased (r= 0. 9675, P< 0. 001). Triton WR- 1339, a non-ionic detergent that inhibits lipoprotein catabolism, was used to estimate hepatic lipid secretion by measuring the increment in serum lipids after its administration. At 15 h after Triton WR- 1339 administration, serum cholesterol concentrations were increased equally in both control and ethynyloestradiol-treated rats. In contrast, the increment of serum triacylglycerol of treated rats was 40 % of that found in control rats, indicating that <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> inhibits hepatic triacylglycerol secretion. Triton WR- 1339 inhibited the oestrogen activation of hepatic microsomal acyl-CoA–cholesterol O-acyltransferase and restored hepatic cholesteryl ester concentrations to normal values. These data suggest that <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> and its pharmacological `antagonist' Triton WR- 1339 alter hepatic triacylglycerol secretion via a mechanism associated with changes in hepatic cholesterol esterification...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of oestradiol- 17 beta or <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> {{as well as}} the synthetic progestogen norethisterone acetate resulted in translocation of the oestrogen receptor. Progesterone and the synthetic progestogen (+) -norgestrel were ineffective. The increases in nuclear oestrogen receptor content 1 h after injection of each steroid were similar but different subsequently. The increase with oestradiol- 17 beta extended for 3 [...] 6 h and for at least 9 h with <b>ethynyloestradiol.</b> With norethisterone acetate, nuclear content was still increased after 24 h. Oestrogen injection resulted in cytosol receptor depletion and a 'deficit' in receptor content extending for 6 h, whereas norethisterone acetate-induced translocation was quantitative. With injections of norethisterone acetate + <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> the increase at 1 h and retention of the nuclear receptors were similar to that with norethisterone acetate alone. In contrast, the depletion of cytosol receptor and its restoration were similar to that seen with <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> alone, suggesting that norethisterone acetate did not interfere with the oestrogen receptor replenishment. Specific binding in vitro of [3 H]oestradiol- 17 beta in liver cytosols was inhibited by (+) -norgestrel and norethisterone acetate, but not progesterone, at concentrations of 10 [...] 100 microM. Nuclear receptors present after norethisterone acetate injection bound oestrogen with high affinity (Kd = 1. 52 nM), similar to receptors of oestrogen-injected animals. In the uterus, differential retention of nuclear receptors in response to oestrogens is associated with different cellular responses. The differences in the response of the receptor system in liver to the various steroids suggests that the corresponding tissue responses may also be dissimilar. These results are discussed in relation to the problems of liver dysfunction in oral-contraceptive users...|$|E
40|$|Normal female rats {{were given}} 15 μg of ethynyloestradiol/kg body wt. for 14 days and were killed on day 15 after {{starvation}} for 12 – 14 h. The livers were isolated and were perfused with a medium containing washed bovine erythrocytes, bovine serum albumin, glucose and [1 - 14 C]oleic acid; 414 μmol of oleate were infused/h during a 3 h experimental period. The output of bile {{and the flow}} of perfusate/g of liver were decreased in livers from animals pretreated with <b>ethynyloestradiol,</b> whereas the liver weight was increased slightly. The rates of uptake and of utilization of [1 - 14 C]oleate were measured when the concentration of unesterified fatty acid in the perfusate plasma was constant. The uptake of unesterified fatty acid was unaffected by pretreatment of the animal with oestrogen; however, the rate of incorporation of [1 - 14 C]oleate into hepatic and perfusate triacylglycerol was stimulated, whereas the rate of conversion into ketone bodies was impaired by treatment of the rat with <b>ethynyloestradiol.</b> Pretreatment of the rat with <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> increased the output of very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerol, cholesterol, phospholipid and protein. The production of 14 CO 2 and the incorporation of radioactivity into phospholipid, cholesteryl ester and diacylglycerol was unaffected by treatment with the steroid. The net output of glucose by livers from oestrogen-treated rats was impaired despite the apparent increased quantities of glycogen in the liver. The overall effect of pretreatment with oestrogen on hepatic metabolism of fatty acids is the channeling of [1 - 14 C]oleate into synthesis and increased output of triacylglycerol as a moiety of the very-low-density lipoprotein, whereas ketogenesis is decreased. The effect of <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> on the liver is apparently independent of the nutritional state of the animal from which the liver was obtained. It is pertinent that hepatocytes prepared from livers of fed rats that had been treated with <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> produced fewer ketone bodies and secreted more triacylglycerol than did hepatocytes prepared from control animals. In these respects, {{the effects of the}} steroid were similar in livers from fed or starved (12 – 14 h) rats. Oestrogens may possibly inhibit hepatic oxidation of fatty acid, making more fatty acid available for the synthesis of triacylglycerol, or may stimulate the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol, or may be active on both metabolic pathways...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of specific oestrogen-receptor binding sites in rat liver nuclei is described. Nuclear receptors showed a high affinity for oestradiol (Kd approximately 3 x 10 (- 9) M), a low capacity, and a distinct specificity for substances with known oestrogenic and anti-oestrogenic activity. No sex differences were seen in the concentrations of nuclear receptors from either vehicle- or ethynyloestradiol-pretreated rats. Only {{a limited number of}} binding sites could be extracted with 0. 4 M-KCl. The remaining sites, which were solubilized by sonication and treatment with deoxyribonuclease I, sedimented at 3 - 4 S. Of four oestrogens tested (oestradiol, <b>ethynyloestradiol,</b> diethylstilboestrol, tri-p-anisylchloroethylene), <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> was the most effective translocation agent in vivo, nuclear uptake occurring at doses below 1 microgram/rat; changes in salt extractability of nuclear receptors occurred at doses lower than those required to achieve absolute increases in nuclear receptor concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Postmenopausal {{patients}} with primary breast cancer {{were treated with}} tamoxifen, <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> or prednisolone for up to 12 days before mastectomy {{and the effects of}} pretreatments with these drugs on the activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6 PGDH) and alpha-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) in the carcinomas were compared with age, stage and menopausal status matched untreated controls. The administration of tamoxifen or prednisolone resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} activity of alpha-GPDH and the alpha-GPDH/ 6 PGDH ratio, whereas ethynyl-oestradiol treatment produced a significant decrease in the activity of the enzyme and the ratio. When tamoxifen and ethynyl-oestradiol were administered together, it was found that tamoxifen failed to reverse the oestrogen-induced reduction in the activity of alpha-GPDH. Since increased activity of the enzyme or a higher alpha-GPDH/ 6 PGDH ratio are associated with a lower risk of recurrence (Deshpande et al., 1981), it is postulated that the beneficial effects of tamoxifen or prednisolone in terms of prolongation of the relapse free interval might be mediated via alterations in the activity of alpha-GPDH in micrometastases. The activities of PFK and 6 PGDH remained unaffected by these treatments...|$|E
40|$|Oestrogen receptors were {{measured}} in the cytosolic and purified nuclear fractions of rat liver. Both cytosolic and nuclear receptors bind oestrogen with high affinity (Kd = 1. 47 and 2. 28 nM respectively) and specificity {{similar to that of}} receptors in order oestrogen-target tissues such as the uterus. During the 4 -day oestrous cycle the receptor content and distribution between cytosol and nucleus did not vary; in particular, the content of nuclear receptor did not appear to fluctuate in concert with known cyclic changes in the concentration of plasma oestrogen. Injection of 50 micrograms of oestradiol- 17 beta or 10 micrograms of <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> resulted in a 4 [...] 6 -fold increase in the nuclear receptor content, with a concomitant decrease in the unoccupied-receptor content of cytosol 1 h after injection. The nuclear receptors present after injection bind oestrogens with similar affinity (Kd = 2. 78 nM) and specificity to receptors present in uninjected animals. The administration of lower doses of either oestrogen was less effective in producing increases in nuclear receptor content. Hence there is apparently substantial translocation of receptor to the nucleus in response to hyperphysiological doses of oestrogen, but not to the physiological changes in plasma oestrogen concentrations during the oestrous cycle. The response to exogenous oestrogens is discussed in relation to the clinical use of synthetic oestrogens and progestogens...|$|E
40|$|Endocrine-disrupting {{compounds}} (EDCs) {{have the}} capacity of altering the normal function of the endocrine system. EDCs have shown dramatic effects on the reproductive biology of aquatic wildlife and may affect human reproduction as well. Studies on EDCs in mammalian species have often investigated the effects of short-term, high doses on male and female reproductive physiology. However, {{it is difficult to}} predict from such studies the effects of EDC on populations that are exposed to very low doses throughout their life via contaminated food and water. We studied the effects of EDC on mammalian reproduction with an environmental-like protocol where the endpoint is the reproductive success of exposed pairs. We focused on a subclass of EDC, the xenoestrogens, which mimic the action of natural oestrogen hormones. Male and female rats were exposed to low doses of the pure oestrogen, <b>ethynyloestradiol,</b> during development, by oral administration to their mothers during pregnancy and lactation, and to them until puberty. We evaluated the effects of the exposure on development and reproductive physiology of individuals, and on fertility and fecundity of pairs in which both members had been exposed to the same treatment. We found that low doses caused major reproductive deficits in the experimental animals. Very low, environmentally relevant doses did not have evident effects on exposed animals; however, the fecundity of exposed pairs was substantially altered. Environmentally relevant doses of xenoestrogens which have no evident physiological effects can alter the reproductive success of exposed pairs in natural populations...|$|E
40|$|JAUNDICE {{is a large}} subject, but two topical aspects are the {{potential}} hepatic toxicity of oral contracep-tives, and the possible use of hepatic enzyme induction in therapy. Hepatic effects of oral contraceptives Oral contraceptives are usually prescribed as a combined pill containing 1 - 4 mg of a progestagen, and 0 - 05 - 0 - 15 mg of an oestrogen, taken for 3 weeks from the 5 th day of each menstrual cycle. Less commonly sequential administration is used, when oestrogen is taken for the first 2 weeks, and oestrogen plus progestagen for the next week. These doses are small compared to the normal production of pro-gesterone and oestradiol, for the corpus luteum of menstruation secretes 20 - 30 mg/day of the former and 1 mg/day of the latter, and in late pregnancy the placenta up to 300 mg, and 15 - 30 mg/day, respec-tively. The progestagens used in contraceptive pills are synthetic and of two types (Fig. 1). Most are derivatives of testosterone but, lacking its C 19 methyl group, are called 19 -norsteroids. They include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethynodrel and ethynodiol; and lynoestrenol. The two other pro-gestagens used, megestrol and chlormadinone, are derivatives of hydroxyprogesterone, and have a different structure. Either <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> or mestranol are used for the oestrogen component. None of these steroids are 17 c-alkyl-substituted, but the 19 -norprogestagens and these oestrogens do have unsaturated hydrocarbon groups in the 17 a position. Unlike testosterone, 19 -norprogestagens are partly converted to oestrogens in vivo (Bishop, 1968). About 10 % of norethisterone acetate is metabolized to urinary 17 a-ethynyloestradiol (Brown & Blair, 1960) which has twenty times the oestrogenic effect of oestradiol, and although Paulsen (1966) found that it produced gynaecomastia, other oestrogenic effects surprisingly are not marked. Megestrol and chlormadinone are not so metabolized (Cooper &...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{pollutants}} with estrogenic activity have {{a potential}} to disrupt oestrogen-dependent developmental processes. Thus, {{the aim of}} this thesis was to investigated how embryonic exposure to the estrogenic pollutants EE 2 (17 alpha- <b>ethynyloestradiol)</b> and o,p´-DDT (1 -[2 -chlorophenyl]- 1 -[4 -chlorophenyl]- 2, 2, 2 -trichloro-ethane) affects the reproductive system in the domestic hen (Gallus domesticus). Hens exposed in ovo to 20 or 60 ng EE 2 /g egg or 37 or 75 micro g o,p´-DDT/g egg produced a normal number of eggs but with thinner shells as adults. These hens also showed a reduction of shell gland capillaries with carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity. CA is considered a key enzyme in shell formation and the developmentally induced disruption of this enzyme may explain the observed eggshell thinning. Left oviduct and infundibulum was shortened in exposed hens and severely malformed in hens exposed to 150 or 300 micro g o,p´-DDT/g egg, which likely explained the inhibited egg production in these birds. Semen output was significantly reduced in both o,p´-DDT and EE 2 exposed roosters, whereas sperm quality was unaffected. The left testis was deformed with an atrophied epididymis. Altered plasma inhibin concentration and histological evaluation implied a disturbed Sertoli cell function resulting in reduced germ cell production. Structural malformations in the epididymis indicating disrupted fluid transfer and transport of spermatozoa are possible contributors to the reduced semen output. Exposure to o,p´-DDT resulted in a wider range of effects than EE 2 such as feminisation of the cloaca at hatch, cloacal deformation in adult roosters and a reduced comb weight, while hens showed retained right oviducts. Right spur diameter was affected by both substances. Localisation of epididymal progesterone receptors and cytoplasmic and membrane associated oestrogen receptor alfa in late spermatids, spermatozoa and epididymal tissues were novel findings in rooster. Embryonic exposure of domestic fowl to o,p´-DDT or EE 2 resulted in persistent malformations of the reproductive organs of both sexes, with eggshell thinning and reduced semen production as a consequence. The results provide a possible explanation for how eggshell thinning may be induced in wild birds and show that also male birds may suffer from reduced reproductive success due to oestrogen-like pollutants...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension {{is one of}} many {{side effects}} of oral {{contraceptive}} use in a small percentage of women. Although the underlying pathology has yet to be fully resolved, alterations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, sympathetic nervous system/ renal and cardiac function have been implicated. In the thesis to be presented, the possible involvement of alterations in renal and myocardial adrenoceptor characteristics in the pathogenesis of steroid contraceptive-induced hypertension in rats was examined by radioligand binding techniques. In Chapter 2, a rat model of OC hypertension is described. Chronic low-dose administration of <b>ethynyloestradiol</b> (EE 2), levonorgestrel (NG) or a combination of both steroids (EE 2 /NG) to female Sprague-Dawley rats was shown to significantly increase systolic blood pressure (SBP). Renal and cardiac hypertrophy developed in association with EE 2 -, EE 2 /NG- but not NG-induced hypertension. Moreover, whereas administration of NG alone attenuated body weight gain, combined EE 2 /NG administration increased body weight gain from the second week of treatment onwards. Based on the above observations, it is proposed that EE 2 and NG induce hypertension in rats via different mechanisms. Although SBP was elevated to a similar maximum in all steroid-treated groups (+ 20 mmHg compared to controls), only with EE 2 administration did SBP remain elevated {{for the duration of the}} 17 week treatment regimen. NG may therefore have a protective effect on blood pressure with long-term combined steroid contraceptive treatment. In Chapter 4, renal adrenoceptors were characterized using radioactively labelled adrenocephor antagonists. Under appropriate conditions, binding of [3 H]-prazosin and [3 H]-rauwolscine to membrane preparations of whole rat kidney displayed the kinetics, saturability and specificity of α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptors respectively, which were present in a ratio 3 : 1. In contrast, [3 H]-dihydroergocryptine ([3 H]-DHE) apparently bound to both α 1 and α 2 -adrenoceptors. Binding sites identified by [125 I] –iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) had the recognition characteristics of β-adrenoceptors. In drug competition studies using the subtype-selective antagonists practolol (β 1) and ICI 118, 551 (β 2) / the ratio of β 1 - to β 2 -adrenoceptors was found to be approximately 2 : 1. Subsequently, renal adrenoceptors were investigated at various stages during the development of hypertension with the different steroid contraceptive treatments (Chapters 5 and 6). Preliminary binding studies with [3 H]-DHE and [3 H]-prazosin suggested that the number of renal α 2 - but not α 1 -adrenoceptors was reduced in rats with established EE 2 -induced hypertension (17 weeks treatment). This was subsequently confirmed using [3 H]-rauwolscine, which in addition showed that the reduction in renal α 2 -adrenoceptor number occurred during the developmental stage of EE 2 /NG~induced hypertension (6 weeks treatment) and established EE 2 -induced hypertension (12 weeks treatment). NG induced hypertension was unassociated with changes in renal α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor characteristics. Renal β-adrenoceptor affinity was reduced in established EE 2 -, but not NG- or EE 2 /NG- induced hypertension. Moreover, the β-adrenoceptor agonist (-) -isoprenaline bound to renal β-adrenoceptors with reduced affinity following EE 2 administration. Several endogenous and synthetic steroids were found to be ineffective inhibitors of [3 H] –prazosin, [3 H] –rauwolscine and ICYP binding excluding a direct interaction of these steroids with renal α 1 -, α 2 - and β -adrenoceptors. In Chapter 7, myocardial adrenoceptors were characterized and investigated in steroid-treated rats. In membrane preparations of whole myocardium, [3 H]-prazosin binding was characteristically to α 1 - adrenoceptors, whereas there was a notable absence of [3 H]-rauwolscine binding. Using ICYP, β-adrenoceptors were also detected, the ratio of β 1 - to β 2 ~adrenoceptors being 3 : 1. Steroid contraceptive-induced hypertension was not associated with myocardial α 1 -adrenoceptor changes. Similarly, myocardial β-adrenoceptors were unchanged in established EE 2 -, NG- and EE 2 /NG-induced hypertension (12 weeks treatment). The affinity of (-) -isoprenaline for myocardial β-adrenoceptors was unaffected by EE 2 aditiinistration. These studies suggest that established EE 2 - but not NG-induced hypertension in rats is associated with selective alterations in renal α 2 - and (β-adrenoceptors. These adrenoceptor changes may help to maintain elevated blood pressure by affecting the control of renal function by the sympathetic nervous system, catecholamines and several hormones which affect renin release and the transport of fluid and electrolytes in the nephron...|$|E
