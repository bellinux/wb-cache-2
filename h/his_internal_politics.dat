500|$|His later {{resurgence}} in Polish memory and historiography {{can be traced}} to the 19th-century era of partitions of Poland, when the Polish state lost its independence. [...] He was remembered for his military triumphs and praised as an effective ruler by many, including John Baptist Albertrandi, Jerzy Samuel Bandtkie, Michał Bobrzyński, Józef Szujski and others. Though some historians like Tadeusz Korzon, Joachim Lelewel and Jędrzej Moraczewski remained more reserved, in 1887 Wincenty Zakrzewski noted that Báthory is [...] "the darling of both the Polish public opinion and Polish historians". During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic he was a cult figure, often compared - with the government's approval - to the contemporary dictator of Poland, Józef Piłsudski. After the Second World War, in the communist People's Republic of Poland, he became more of a controversial figure, with historians more ready to question <b>his</b> <b>internal</b> <b>politics</b> and attachment to Hungary. Nonetheless his good image remained intact, reinforced by the positive views of a popular Polish historian of that period, Paweł Jasienica.|$|E
50|$|He is {{regarded}} as one of the most skilled Piast Dukes of Cieszyn. He was a skilled diplomat and negotiator, experienced in many diplomatic efforts in several European countries. <b>His</b> <b>internal</b> <b>politics</b> in the Duchy thus remains little known.|$|E
50|$|In <b>his</b> <b>internal</b> <b>politics,</b> Casimir II made {{a gradual}} {{assimilation}} of the Red Ruthenia parts ruled {{by him and}} his brothers, into the Polish customs and laws. This involved, among others, {{the introduction of the}} Polish laws and administration.|$|E
50|$|Wilhelm was {{an unusually}} {{efficient}} ruler, and soon managed to stabilise the archbishopric's financial position, {{which was the}} prerequisite for the effective exercise of its territorial powers. <b>His</b> energetic <b>internal</b> <b>politics</b> {{formed the basis for}} (by and large) unwarlike and successful foreign politics, which culminated in an intensive engagement in imperial politics. He not only established political relations with France, England and north-west Europe, but was apparently involved in the formulation of the Golden Bull of Charles IV in 1356.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his role}} at the SABC, Perlman was one of South Africa's most popular and {{respected}} radio anchors. The SABC described Perlman as a [...] "seasoned journalist and an outstanding broadcaster" [...] and AM Live as [...] "arguably the most influential programme in South Africa". However, in March 2007 Perlman resigned after blowing the whistle on political censorship within the SABC. His resignation was widely thought to indicate <b>his</b> dissatisfaction with <b>internal</b> <b>politics</b> at the SABC.|$|R
50|$|About <b>his</b> <b>internal</b> {{and foreign}} <b>politics</b> {{there are little}} notices. In 1327, he became a vassal of the Bohemian crown; but, for unknown reasons, he didn't paid homage to King John of Luxembourg with the other Silesian Dukes in Opawa. In 1326, he granted urban Privileges to the capital of his Duchy, Strzelce. He also {{supported}} financially the Cistercian monastery of Jemielnica, who was founded by his father.|$|R
