5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} is a <b>full</b> <b>contact</b> outdoor men's sport {{played with}} ten players on each team. The sport originated among Native Americans, {{and the modern}} rules of field lacrosse were initially codified by Canadian William George Beers in 1867. Field lacrosse {{is one of three}} major versions of lacrosse played internationally. The other versions, women's lacrosse (established in the 1890s) and box lacrosse (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.|$|E
5|$|The first teams open to British {{players were}} {{established}} in 1983, and competition began the following year {{in the form of}} a series of one-off games. The match results were compiled into a 'Merit Table', with teams playing more than three games eligible for the championshipthe first champions were the London Ravens, who won all ten of their matches. Hundreds of clubs have since been formed, playing both <b>full</b> <b>contact</b> football and flag football at senior, university and youth level. Many of these clubs have since folded, renamed or merged with other local teams, but a few of the older clubs survive today.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} {{the effect of}} strain hardening on elastic-plastic contact of a deformable sphere with a rigid flat under <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> condition using commercial finite element software ANSYS. Different values of tangent modulus are considered to study the effect of strain hardening. It is found that under a <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> condition, strain hardening greatly influences the contact parameters. Comparison has also been made between perfect slip and <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> conditions. It is observed that the contact conditions have negligible effect on contact parameters. Studies on isotropic and kinematic hardening models reveal that the material with isotropic hardening has the higher load carrying capacity than that of kinematic hardening particularly for higher strain hardening...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} finite element based contact analysis of an elastic-plastic axisymmetric hemisphere using ANSYS {{to study the}} effect of material properties under <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> condition. Results are compared with previous elastic-plastic models for perfect slip and <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> conditions. It is found that materials with modulus of elasticity to yield strength (E/Y) ratio less than and greater than 300 show strikingly different contact behavior. When E/Y ratio is less than 300, contact load increases {{with the increase in}} modulus of elasticity whereas in elastic-plastic range, contact load decreases with the increase in yield strength...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rule was}} {{introduced}} to prevent players from playing [...] (i.e., deliberately fouling so as to leave the balls in a safe position, {{reducing the risk of}} giving a frame-winning chance to the opponent). Multiple misses often occur because players attempt to hit a shot very softly or thinly in situations where a <b>fuller</b> <b>contact</b> might leave their opponent an easy potting chance. This can lead to an apparently easy [...] being attempted several times, as players feel that it is better to concede many points but leave a safe position, than concede none and leave a frame-winning chance.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} utilizes the commercial finite element software ANSYS {{to study the}} effect of material properties such as yield strength (Y), modulus of elasticity (E) on the contact parameters like contact area, normal displacement and mean contact pressure in both perfect slip and <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> of fractal surfaces. The results indicate the nonlinear relationship among the contact parameters that {{are affected by the}} yield strength and the contact conditions; however the same E/Y ratio yields identical contact parameters. Load carrying capacity in <b>full</b> stick <b>contact</b> condition is slightly higher than that in perfect slip contact condition.

They are typical 50 micrometers thick, space quality, silicon solar cells except for variations of the back contact configuration. The back surfaces of the sample cells are polished to a mirror like finish, and have either conventional <b>full</b> <b>contacts</b> or grid finger contacts. Measurements and evaluation of various metallic back surface reflectors, as well as cells with total internal reflection, are presented. Results indicate that back surface reflectors formed using a grid finger back contact are more effective reflectors than cells with full back metallization and that Au, Ag, or Cu are better back surface reflector metals than Al...|$|R

25|$|Levels of {{physical}} contact during sparring vary considerably. <b>Full</b> <b>contact</b> karate has several variants. Knockdown karate (such as Kyokushin) uses full power techniques {{to bring an}} opponent to the ground. In kickboxing variants (for example K-1), the preferred win is by knockout. Sparring in armour, bogu kumite, allows full power techniques with some safety. Sport kumite in many international competition under the World Karate Federation is free or structured with light contact or semi contact and points are awarded by a referee.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{competition}} sparring: point sparring, in which all strikes are light contact and the clock is stopped when a point is scored; and Olympic sparring, where all strikes are <b>full</b> <b>contact</b> and the clock continues when points are scored. Sparring involves a Hogu, or a chest protector, which muffles any kick's damage to avoid serious injuries. Helmets and other gear is provided as well. Though other systems may vary, a common point system works like this: One point for a regular kick to the Hogu, two for a turning behind kick, three for a back kick, and four for a spinning kick to the head.|$|E
