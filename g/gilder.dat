5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson <b>Gilder</b> of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. <b>Gilder,</b> pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E

50|$|A {{landmark}} {{event in}} the world of gilding took place at the Newark Museum in New Jersey during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long gilding course hosted by the museum’s Arts Workshop, <b>gilders</b> met and exchanged gilding recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen’s guilds. Originally called the Guild of <b>Gilders,</b> the group changed their name to the Society of <b>Gilders,</b> welcoming fellow <b>gilders</b> and anyone interested in the art of gilding to join their ranks.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Northwestern High, <b>Gilders</b> joined the U.S. military; serving until 1953, Fletcher later {{enrolled}} at the Ohio State University. At OSU, <b>Gilders</b> won back-to-back (1954 & 1955) NCAA titles on the one-meter springboard. During each of his three seasons at Ohio State, <b>Gilders</b> led the Buckeyes to Big Ten Conference and NCAA swimming and diving team titles. He set an NCAA Division I record that stood until overturned by Greg Louganis. Fletcher <b>Gilders</b> was {{also a member of}} the OSU track & field, gymnastics and soccer teams; winning a total of 10 varsity letters to become the first four-sport letterman in Ohio State's modern history.During the summer of 1956, <b>Gilders</b> joined younger sister (Barbara Sue) at the Melbourne Olympic Games.|$|R
5|$|Wright, {{whose father}} was head {{biochemist}} at Unigate Dairies, grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex, and was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's School. He taught himself to play guitar, trumpet and piano at age 12 after he was recuperating from breaking a leg. His mother helped and encouraged him to play the piano. He took private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric <b>Gilder</b> School of Music and became influenced by the trad jazz revival, learning the trombone and saxophone {{as well as the}} piano. Uncertain about his future, he enrolled in 1962 at the Regent Street Polytechnic which was later incorporated into the University of Westminster. There he met fellow musicians Roger Waters and Nick Mason, and all three joined a band formed by classmate Clive Metcalf called Sigma 6.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was {{more receptive to}} Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and <b>Gilder</b> by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916.|$|E
25|$|With {{the design}} approved, the Spanish War Memorial Committee's {{attention}} {{turned toward the}} language to be inscribed on the memorial. Lyster and another Spanish War Memorial Committee member, Hortense Addison Batré, visited the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, {{in the summer of}} 1901, and were impressed by the inscriptions written on the pediment above the main doorway of each exhibit hall. They learned that these were written by the poet Richard Watson <b>Gilder,</b> editor of The Century Magazine. Townsend was acquainted with <b>Gilder,</b> and Lyster and Batré asked Townsend to convince <b>Gilder</b> to provide language for the bronze tablet. Townsend met with <b>Gilder,</b> and after some initial resistance he agreed to write the inscription.|$|E
