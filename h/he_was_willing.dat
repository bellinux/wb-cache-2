5|$|On June 15, Paul {{told reporters}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> {{to vote for a}} partial repeal, but not the {{implementation}} of new Republican entitlement programs, which he identified as present in both House and Senate versions of the bill.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the prior}} CBA, players {{could not be}} traded until after the lockout was resolved, meaning Roberto Luongo could not be moved. Once a new CBA was reached, the trade rumors returned, {{including}} one that alleged Maple Leafs GM Brian Burke was fired {{in order to help}} facilitate a trade. For his part, Luongo reiterated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to remain with the Canucks for the shortened season, but did not want to remain long-term.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as a publisher by writers from across the political spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E

If <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> and <b>is</b> unable, <b>He</b> <b>is</b> feeble, which is not in {{accordance}} with the character of God; if <b>He</b> <b>is</b> able and unwilling, <b>He</b> <b>is</b> , which is equally at variance with God; if <b>He</b> <b>is</b> neither <b>willing</b> nor able, <b>He</b> <b>is</b> both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if <b>He</b> <b>is</b> both <b>willing</b> and able, which alone is suitable to God, from what source then are evils? Or why does He not remove them? ...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a price {{mechanism}} uses announced bid and ask prices. Generally speaking, when two parties wish to engage in trade, the purchaser will announce a price <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to pay (the bid price) and seller will announce a price <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to accept (the ask price).|$|R

5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|In 1768 Johnson {{went into}} {{partnership}} with John Payne (Johnson {{was probably the}} senior partner); the following year they published 50 titles. Under Johnson and Payne, the firm published a wider array of works than under Johnson and Davenport. Although Johnson looked to his business interests, he did not publish works only to enrich himself. Projects that encouraged free discussion appealed to Johnson; for example, he helped Priestley publish the Theological Repository, a financial failure that nevertheless fostered open debate of theological questions. Although the journal lost Johnson money in the 1770s, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to begin publishing it again in 1785 because he endorsed its values.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{injuries}} claimed enough Maryland Agricultural {{football players}} {{that the team}} could no longer field a practice squad to scrimmage against. The college turned to Byrd, who was serving as coach at Western High School in Georgetown, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to help his alma mater with scrimmages. Byrd later replaced head coach Charley Donnelly, who resigned mid-season after accumulating a 2–4–2 record. Byrd led the Aggies to wins in both of their final games of the season, against Western Maryland, 6–0, and Gallaudet, 6–2.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{originally}} {{theorized that}} {{two men were}} involved in the murders of the Rogers women and this was reenacted in a 1991episode of Unsolved Mysteries. This theory was dismissed when Chandler was arrested. No evidence of a second manother than a former prison cellmate's claim that Chandler said another man, whose identity the cellmate claimed to know but would not reveal has ever surfaced. The second-suspect theory was belied by Chandler's approach of the two Canadian female touriststhat <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to approach more than one potential target by himself.|$|E
5|$|When {{presented}} {{with evidence of}} Benedict Arnold's activities, it is reported that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton {{over the fate of}} Major André. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan very nearly succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.|$|E
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E

5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1906, {{while still}} serving his ban, Meredith moved to Manchester United. He joined on a free {{transfer}} {{and received a}} £500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to forego on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer. He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907, and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa. In addition to Turnbull, Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess. This new forward line made the team into a powerful force, as they already possessed a dominant half-back line in captain Charlie Roberts, Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell. They ended the 1906–07 season in eighth place in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Marshall and Nichols began {{assembling}} the resources they would need. The {{first step was}} to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose. Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.|$|E

50|$|Socrates says he dreams, however, of a {{world in}} which no one pretends to <b>be</b> {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not (173a-d). In the end, Socrates appears to have recruited a new disciple to philosophy: Charmides says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to <b>be</b> charmed every day by Socrates, and Critias tells the boy that if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> to do this, he will have proof of his temperance. Charmides says that if his guardian instructs him to submit to Socrates' charms, then <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> wrong not to do it.|$|R

5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC–CVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King {{as long as their}} Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{believed}} that the nation {{was on the verge}} of major political change, and that he could be elected president in 1896, uniting the silver supporters of the South and West. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to consider a third party bid if Cleveland kept control of the Democratic Party, but felt the Populists, by allowing African Americans to seek office, had destroyed their credibility among southern whites. The stinging oratory of the South Carolina senator brought him national prominence, and with the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago likely to be controlled by silver supporters, Tillman was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate along with others, such as former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland, Texas Governor James Hogg, and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Nisibis, Diocletian and Galerius returned to Syrian Antioch. At some time in 299, the emperors took part in a ceremony of sacrifice and divination in an attempt to predict the future. The haruspices were unable to read the entrails of the sacrificed animals and blamed Christians in the Imperial household. The emperors ordered all members of the court to perform a sacrifice to purify the palace. The emperors sent letters to the military command, demanding the entire army perform the required sacrifices or face discharge. Diocletian was conservative in matters of religion, a man faithful to the traditional Roman pantheon and understanding of demands for religious purification, but Eusebius, Lactantius and Constantine state that it was Galerius, not Diocletian, who was the prime supporter of the purge, and its greatest beneficiary. Galerius, even more devoted and passionate than Diocletian, saw political advantage in the politics of persecution. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to break with a government policy of inaction on the issue.|$|E

5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused to comment on the issue to the media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Groves made {{critical}} {{decisions on}} prioritizing the various methods of isotope separation and acquiring raw materials {{needed by the}} scientists and engineers. By the time he assumed command of the project, {{it was evident that}} the AA-3 priority rating that Marshall had obtained was insufficient. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel Lucius D. Clay, the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to provide an AAA rating on request for critical materials to remove bottlenecks. Groves went to Donald M. Nelson, the chairman of the War Production Board and, after threatening to take the matter to the President, obtained a AAA priority for the Manhattan project. It was agreed that the AA-3 priority would still be used where possible.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1561, cannons {{were fired}} in Leith to {{announce}} Queen Mary's arrival in Scotland. When she attended Mass being {{celebrated in the}} royal chapel at Holyrood Palace five days later, this prompted a protest in which one of her servants was jostled. The next day she issued a proclamation {{that there would be}} no alteration in the current state of religion and that her servants should not be molested or troubled. Many nobles accepted this, but not Knox. The following Sunday, he protested from the pulpit of St Giles'. As a result, just two weeks after her return, Mary summoned Knox. She accused him of inciting a rebellion against her mother and of writing a book against her own authority. Knox answered that as long as her subjects found her rule convenient, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> to accept her governance, noting that Paul the Apostle had been willing to live under Nero's rule. Mary noted, however, that he had written against the principle of female rule itself. He responded that she should not to be troubled by what had never harmed her. When Mary asked him whether subjects had a right to resist their ruler, he replied that if monarchs exceeded their lawful limits, they might be resisted, even by force.|$|E
