500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that,</b> because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding the project's {{change in}} {{aesthetic}} from experimental recordings to more song-based compositions, Mondanile noted, [...] "I think it’s because I was on tour with Real Estate {{and we were}} playing with lots of indie bands that played pop songs, so <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>that</b> influenced me. I’ve played with quite a few indie bands in America, however with Landscapes I was playing a lot more experimental shows, mainly I was making a lot weirder music!" ...|$|R
