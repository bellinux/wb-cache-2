40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive a {{restricted}} vector err or-correction model (RVECM) {{to predict the}} Dutch <b>gross</b> <b>indigenous</b> pig <b>production</b> (GIP). For this purpose, we model the long-run supply behaviour of the producers of piglets and fattened pigs. We supplemented Johansen's maximum likelihood procedure with the asymptotic least-squares method to test the nonlinear cross-equation parameter restrictions in the long-run model. Our empirical results comply with the theoretical long-run model and show that the RVECM GIP predictions are slightly more accurate than the forecasts prepared by the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics for the European Commission...|$|R

40|$|Greece yearly allocates a {{substantial}} part of its national income to defence and its defence burden is the highest among EU and NATO members. To meet the demand for military hardware it relies almost exclusively on imports, ranking among the largest conventional arms importers in the world.

This finding is robust to controlling for omitted variables, sample selection and potential simultaneity bias. It is also in line with the view that inflows of foreign direct investment stimulate upgrading of <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> capabilities in host countries...|$|R
