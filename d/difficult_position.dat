5|$|At 1.15 pm, Parker {{was waiting}} outside the harbour with the reserve {{and raised a}} signal {{ordering}} Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves, repeated the signal but too did not obey it. Riou now {{found himself in a}} <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further half an hour before reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|At 6ft 4 in, 225lb (1.93m, 102kg), Ripken was a {{departure}} from the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans to be part of Ripken's legacy.|$|E
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and a worthwhile target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> for aircraft to attack.|$|E

5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking part}} in a tour of Jamaica by the Yorkshire team, on which he scored 115 and 75 in {{successive}} games, Leyland scored 1,790 runs at 45.89 in 1936. He hit seven centuries, including an innings of 263 runs against Essex in the season, the highest first-class score of his career. He played in two of the three Tests against India that season—he missed the second with injury—but only batted twice. In the first Test, he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when England were in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> The home side won the series 2–0. During the season, Leyland was among the first players chosen to tour Australia with the MCC in the forthcoming winter.|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
5000|$|Frank Marshall once {{commented on}} the highly {{agitated}} state that would possess Chigorin when faced with <b>difficult</b> <b>positions.</b> Aside from the usual frantic foot-tapping and crossing of legs, he would occasionally become [...] "a bundle of nerves", at which point his temperament could turn [...] "quite fierce".|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of Šolta and Brač, the Vis TG led by Pula sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Kaštela TG. As the ships approached the Split Entrance, they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed. Pula, attempting to enforce the blockade imposed in September, requested the vessel by radio to stop for an inspection. The vessel failed to respond and Pula fired several shots {{in front of it}} before Brčić noticed that it was a hydrofoil carrying an ECMM team and flying the flag of Europe. He abandoned the pursuit and proceeded to Šolta.|$|E
5|$|Like other Spanish liberals, Goya {{was left}} in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> after the French invasion. He had {{supported}} the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} concerned {{who should}} invest a new bishop {{with his staff}} and ring: traditionally, this had been {{carried out by the}} king in a symbolic demonstration of royal power, but Pope Urban II had condemned this practice in 1099, arguing that only the papacy could carry out this task, and declaring that the clergy should not give homage to their local temporal rulers. Anselm returned to England from exile in 1100 having heard Urban's pronouncement, and informed Henry that he would be complying with the Pope's wishes. Henry was in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> On one hand, the symbolism and homage was important to him; on the other hand, he needed Anselm's support in his struggle with his brother Duke Robert.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan that}} Ostojić drew up {{called for the}} Chetniks to remain south of the Neretva to avoid being outflanked by the Partisans. However, this {{essentially}} defensive strategy was rejected by Herzegovinian Chetnik commanders such as Dobroslav Jevđević and Bajo Stanišić, who wished to follow the Axis-led offensive strategy. This placed Ostojić in a very <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> {{with some of his}} key detachment commanders following the orders of the Italians rather than his, while the Chetniks were reliant on Italian air and artillery support, particularly around Jablanica. Ostojić subsequently changed his mind and supported the Italian offensive plans, launching an attack against the Partisans retreating from Jablanica to Prozor on 27 February 1943. The attack was indecisive and Ostojić reprimanded the detachment commanders responsible, particularly Stanišić.|$|E
5|$|Attacked {{from the}} north and south and facing the {{possibility}} of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian Order and the Archbishop of Riga in his own interests. He succeeded in bribing Andreas von Stierland, the master of the Order, who was still angry at Vykintas for the defeat in 1236. In 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return. In 1252, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas in Voruta, sometimes considered to be the first capital of Lithuania. The attack failed and Tautvilas' forces retreated to defend themselves in Tverai Castle, in the present-day Rietavas municipality. Vykintas died in or about 1253, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia. Daniel reconciled with Mindaugas in 1254; the Black Ruthenian lands were transferred to Roman, the son of Daniel. Vaišvilkas, the son of Mindaugas, decided to join a monastery. Tautvilas recognized Mindaugas' superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom.|$|E
5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and {{were told that they}} should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E

5|$|In February 1956 Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of {{personality}} at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and {{embarked on a}} reform course. The de-Stalinization of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.|$|E
5|$|In Ryne Sandberg's {{first full}} season as manager (after {{replacing}} Charlie Manuel {{near the end}} of the 2013 season), he reconfigured the Phillies' staff. Among his first acquisitions were long-time friend Larry Bowa (who managed the Phillies from 2001 to 2004) as bench coach and former bench coach Pete Mackanin as third-base coach. At the same time, the team announced the retention of Steve Henderson as hitting coach. Shortly thereafter, the Phillies announced that Juan Samuel would switch from third- to first-base coach and Wally Joyner would return for a second season as assistant hitting coach. About a month later, the team reported that the Detroit Tigers had lured Joyner away as their hitting coach. Although the most <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> to fill was pitching coach (vacated by Rich Dubee at the end of the 2013 season), on November 21 the Phillies announced that they had hired Bob McClure and retained pitching-coach candidate Rod Nichols as bullpen coach and Jesús Tiamo as bullpen catcher. Sandberg finished his staffing a week before Christmas by promoting minor-league assistant John Mizerock to assistant hitting coach.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus {{found himself in a}} <b>difficult</b> <b>position.</b> His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and {{crippled}} his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon in the spring of 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely.|$|E

5|$|One of Mary's first {{actions as}} queen was {{to order the}} release of the Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from {{imprisonment}} in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay. Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only conspirator of rank executed for high treason {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left in a <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The 1961–62 season {{proved to}} be highly disappointing, as Leicester {{finished}} 14th {{in the league and}} exited the FA Cup at the hands of Stoke City. The only highlight was the club's participation in the European Cup Winners' Cup, which actually put Banks in the <b>difficult</b> <b>position</b> of choosing to play for his club against Spanish club Atlético Madrid or choosing to attend the England versus Portugal match as a non-playing squad member. He elected to attend both games, leaving London at full-time to reach Leicester 30 minutes before the kick-off against Madrid. A last-minute goal earned the Spaniards a 1–1 draw at Filbert Street. In the return leg, Banks saved an Enrique Collar penalty, but Atlético were awarded a second penalty which Collar converted, and Leicester lost the game 2–0 (losing the tie 3–1 on aggregate).|$|E
5|$|The JNA further {{reinforced}} {{its position}} at the Kupres Plateau by ordering the redeployment of the 9th Armoured Battalion of the 9th (Knin) Corps to the area. It also established the Operational Group 11 (OG-11) which was {{to take over the}} operation on 7 April, when the AOR of the 9th Corps was extended to the region. At the same time, the armoured and mechanised assets of the force were organised into the Tactical Group 1 (TG-1), commanded by Lisica. By the end of the day, the divisional reserve was committed to the battle, and the JNA claimed that they had captured Zlosela, Olovo and Osmanlije, as well as reaching the outskirts of Kupres. The Bosnian Croat TO captured the centre of Kupres and brought the 1st Battalion of the 19th Partisan Brigade into a <b>difficult</b> <b>position,</b> only to begin withdrawing towards Tomislavgrad after the main JNA force reached the town in the night of 6/7 April.
