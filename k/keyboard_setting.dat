5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} of Liszt's late paraphrases is his setting of the Sarabande and Chaconne from Handel's opera Almira. This transcription was composed in 1879 for his English pupil Walter Bache, and it is the only setting of a baroque piece from Liszt's late period. Liszt's last song transcription was on Anton Rubinstein's [...] "Der Asra" [...] after a poem by Heine. No words are included, and the <b>keyboard</b> <b>setting</b> is reduced nearly to the absurd. In several parts the melody is missing. One of those parts is that with words, [...] "Deinen Namen will ich wissen, deine Heimath, deine Sippschaft!" [...] ("I want to know your name, your homeland, your tribe!") The answer is given at the song's end, but again without melody, i.e. with unspoken words. [...] "Mein Stamm sind jene Asra, die sterben, wenn sie lieben." [...] ("My tribe are those Asras, who are dying when they love.") Even more hidden, Liszt implemented still another answer in his piece. To the part with the question he put an ossia in which also the original accompaniment has disappeared. As own melody by Liszt, the solitary left hand plays a motive with two triplets, most resembling the opening motive of his Tasso. The key is the Gypsy or Hungarian variant of g-Minor. In this sense it was Liszt's answer that his name was [...] "Tasso", with meaning of an artist of outstanding creativity. His true homeland was art. But besides, he was until the grave [...] "in heart and mind" [...] Hungarian.|$|E

50|$|Some early pianos had {{shapes and}} designs {{that are no}} longer in use. The square piano (not truly square, but rectangular) was cross strung at an {{extremely}} acute angle above the hammers, with the <b>keyboard</b> <b>set</b> along the long side. This design is attributed to Gottfried Silbermann or Christian Ernst Friderici on the continent, and Johannes Zumpe or Harman Vietor in England, and it was improved by changes first introduced by Guillaume-Lebrecht Petzold in France and Alpheus Babcock in the United States. Square pianos were built in great numbers through the 1840s in Europe and the 1890s in the United States, and saw the most visible change of any type of piano: the iron-framed, over-strung squares manufactured by Steinway & Sons were more than two-and-a-half times the size of Zumpe's wood-framed instruments from a century before. Their overwhelming popularity was due to inexpensive construction and price, although their tone and performance were limited by narrow soundboards, simple actions and string spacing that made proper hammer alignment difficult.|$|R
