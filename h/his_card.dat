5|$|Beiderbecke {{attended}} Davenport High School from 1919 to 1921. During this time, {{he sat in}} {{and played}} professionally with various bands, including those of Wilbur Hatch, Floyd Bean and Carlisle Evans. In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school's Vaudeville Night, singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his horn. He also performed, {{at the invitation of}} his friend Fritz Putzier, in Neal Buckley's Novelty Orchestra. The group was hired for a gig in December 1920, but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, that the boys did not have union cards. In an audition before a union executive, Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed. He did not earn <b>his</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped <b>his</b> <b>card</b> on the floor and when he bent under the table to retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|Anya closes a {{restaurant}} where four men—northerners Archie, Malcolm and Kevin are entertaining southerner Craig—have finished a post-badminton meal. After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have <b>his</b> <b>card</b> declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E

5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of <b>his</b> <b>card,</b> '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E

50|$|Ciapanò can {{be played}} by more than two players: if the players are 4 or 5 each one plays on his own, and they receive 10 or 8 cards respectively. If the players are 2, the normal rules apply. If the players are 3, two players receive 13 cards and {{the one at the}} right of the dealer is dealt one more card. Before {{starting}} to play, he chooses one of <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> and passes it to the player at his right, who takes it and then passes one of <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> to the last player. The last player puts then one of <b>his</b> <b>cards</b> aside, to be taken by the player who wins the last trick.|$|R

25|$|Repeated plays {{also make}} it clearer why {{switching}} is the better strategy. After the player picks <b>his</b> <b>card,</b> it is already determined whether switching will win the round for the player. If this is not convincing, the simulation {{can be done with}} the entire deck. (Gardner 1959b; Adams 1990). In this variant, the car card goes to the host 51 times out of 52, and stays with the host no matter how many non-car cards are discarded.|$|E

25|$|Fangio was {{inducted}} into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. He returned to the spotlight in 1994, when he publicly opposed a new Province of Buenos Aires law denying driving licences to those over 80 (which included Fangio). Denied a renewal of <b>his</b> <b>card,</b> Fangio reportedly challenged Traffic Bureau personnel to a race between Buenos Aires and seaside Mar del Plata (a 400km (250mi) distance) in two hours or less, following which an exception was made for the five-time champion.|$|E
25|$|D'Angeville {{set off for}} Mont Blanc in 1838, in {{the company}} of Joseph-Marie Couttet, five other guides, and six porters.

25|$|Draft-card burning was {{a symbol}} of protest {{performed}} by thousands of young men in the US and Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s. The first draft-card burners were American men taking part in the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The first well-publicized protest was in December 1963, with a 22-year old conscientious objector, Eugene Keyes, setting fire to <b>his</b> <b>card</b> on Christmas Day in Champaign, Illinois. In May 1964, a larger demonstration, with about 50 people in Union Square, New York, was organized by the War Resisters League chaired by David McReynolds.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Page {{moved to}} New York City, where {{she hoped to}} find work as an actress. In the meantime, she {{supported}} herself by working as a secretary overlooking Rockefeller Center.

It was Officer Tibbs who suggested to Bettie that she style her hair with bangs in front, to keep light from reflecting off her high forehead when being photographed. Bangs soon became {{an integral part of}} her distinctive look.|$|E
