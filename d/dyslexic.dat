40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{identified}} a magnocellular pathway defect in approximately 75 % of <b>dyslexics.</b> Since these experiments have not classified dyslexia into subtypes, {{the purpose of this}} experiment was to determine if adult dyseidetic <b>dyslexics</b> or dysphoneidetic <b>dyslexics</b> suffer from a defect in the magnocellular pathway. Nine dyseidetic <b>dyslexics,</b> eight dysphoneidetic <b>dyslexics,</b> and nine normal readers participated in the experiment. Contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) were determined with vertically oriented sine wave gratings (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0, 8. 0, 12. 0 c/deg drifting at 1 and 10 Hz) by employing a two-alternative, forced-choice technique. The results of the experiment indicated that dysphoneidetic <b>dyslexics</b> had reduced sensitivity to low spatial frequencies at 10 Hz, whereas dyseidetic <b>dyslexics</b> did not have reduced sensitivity at either 1 or 10 Hz. These results suggest that the type of dyslexia influences whether losses in perception are found which are consistent with a magnocellular deficit...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} role of prospective memory among <b>dyslexics.</b> Prospective memory is realization of delayed intention. Realization of delayed intention requires self initiated process. The present study explored the role of memory (prospective and retrospective memory), meta-memory and attention among <b>dyslexic’s</b> children. One hundred and fifteen children (51 <b>dyslexics</b> and 64 normal controls) participated in the study. Prospective and retrospective memory questionnaire, everyday attention questionnaire and meta-memory were administered on children. Analysis of variance was used to analyses the data.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{compared}} comprehensive listening, comprehensive reading and vocabulary of high school children with and without dyslexia. We analysed the scores of pupils from the first grade of vmbo and vmbo-tl/havo. We examined listening, reading and vocabulary, to see whether <b>dyslexics</b> suffer from a general language problem or a specific reading problem. The results indicate that <b>dyslexics</b> on vmbo perform {{just as well as}} non-dyslexics on all tests (listening, reading and vocabulary), though they need more time for the comprehensive reading and vocabulary tests to obtain the same results. On vmbo-tl/havo, however, <b>dyslexics</b> did not need more time to complete the tests, but did score significantly worse on the vocabulary test. These findings suggest that <b>dyslexics</b> do not suffer from a general language problem, since they do not encounter problems with listening. Secondly, these results indicate that <b>dyslexics</b> on vmbo can perform equally well compared to their classmates when given more time. Thirdly, since <b>dyslexics</b> on vmbo can perform equally well on a comprehensive reading test, when given more time, it may be unnecessary to give them more adjustments in high school (e. g. reading texts aloud). Fourthly, the results on vmbo-tl/havo suggest that the vocabulary of <b>dyslexics</b> must be monitored well, to prevent them from falling behind. Finally, we advise teachers on vmbo to not only monitor <b>dyslexics</b> on reading. Our result indicate that the majority of non-dyslexics also have problems with reading...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} combines different paradigm {{in the area}} of visual perception of letter and words. These experiments aimed to understand the deficit underlying the problem associated with the faulty visual processing of letters and words. The present work summarizes the findings from two different types of population: (1) <b>Dyslexics</b> (reading-disabled children) and (2) Illiterates (adults who cannot read). In order to compare the results, comparisons were made between literate and illiterate group; <b>dyslexics</b> and control group (normal reading children). Differences for Even related potentials (ERP’s) between <b>dyslexics</b> and control children were made using mental rotation task for letters. According to the ERP’s, the effect of the mental rotation task of letter perception resulted as a delayed positive component and the component becomes less positive when the task becomes more difficult (Rotation related Negativity – RRN). The component was absent for <b>dyslexics</b> and present for controls. <b>Dyslexics</b> also showed some late effects in comparison to control children and this could be interpreted as problems at the decision stage where they are confused as to the letter is normal or mirrored. <b>Dyslexics</b> also have problems in responding to the letters having visual or phonological similarities (e. g. b vs d, p vs q). Visually similar letters were used to compare <b>dyslexics</b> and controls on a symmetry generalization task in two different contrast conditions (low and high). <b>Dyslexics</b> showed a similar pattern of response, and were overall slower in responding to the task compared to controls. The results were interpreted {{within the framework of the}} Functional Coordination Deficit (Lachmann, 2002). <b>Dyslexics</b> also showed delayed response in responding to the word recognition task during motion. Using red background decreases the Magnocellular pathway (M-pathway) activity, making more difficult to identify letters and this effect was worse for <b>dyslexics</b> because their M-pathway is weaker. In <b>dyslexics,</b> the M-pathway is worse; using a red background decreases the M activity and increases the difficulty in identifying lexical task in motion. This effect generated worse response to red compared to the green background. The reaction times with red were longer than those with green background. Further, Illiterates showed an analytic approach to responding to letters as well as on shapes. The analytic approach does not result from an individual capability to read, but is a primary base of visual organization or perception...|$|R

Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{assessed}} motion integration {{ability in}} seven adult developmental <b>dyslexics</b> using unidirectional and bidirectional (transparent) random dot kinematograms (RDKs) that varied {{in the number}} of frames. All adult <b>dyslexics</b> performed as well as normally reading age-matched controls with unidirectional RDKs, regardless of frame number. However, using orthogonal motion transparent stimuli, deficits were obvious in six <b>dyslexics</b> and depended on frame number. Whereas controls needed on average only 4. 4 frames (144 ms) to identify both directions correctly on 75 % of presentations, <b>dyslexics</b> needed on average 14. 6 frames (483 ms) to achieve this level of performance. Even though a unidirectional motion task failed to reveal processing abnormalities in adult <b>dyslexics,</b> the motion transparency task was effective at revealing significant perceptual dysfunction, suggesting that performance on this task is a better psychophysical indicator of visual motion deficits in dyslexia. This finding provides little support for the magnocellular deficit hypothesis and, rather, points to abnormality within dorsal extrastriate cortical areas that subserve the integration and segmentation of complex motion signals...|$|R

Reaction times (RTs) to multisensory stimuli were compared with predictions from Miller's race model. <b>Dyslexics</b> showed difficulty shifting their attention between modalities; but such "sluggish attention shifting" (SAS) appeared only when <b>dyslexics</b> shifted their attention from the visual to the auditory modality. These results suggest that <b>dyslexics</b> distribute their crossmodal attention resources differently from controls, causing different patterns in multisensory responses compared to controls.
