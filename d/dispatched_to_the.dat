5|$|In 1912, the United States {{established}} military {{ties with}} Liberia by sending some five black American officers to help reorganize the force. The LFF {{in its early}} years was frequently recruited by inducing men from the interior forcibly.

The Force's officers were drawn from either the coastal aristocracy or tribal elites.|$|E

5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted {{in the eastern}} and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were <b>dispatched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{entered the}} Second World War on 3 September 1939. At {{the time of}} the {{declaration}} of war against Germany the Australian military was small and unready for war. Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were <b>dispatched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E

Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were <b>dispatched</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day.
