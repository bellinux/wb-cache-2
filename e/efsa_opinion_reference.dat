The EFSA Panel on Plant Health acknowledges the responses provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and considers that the USDA misinterpreted the conclusions made by the Panel in its previous <b>opinion</b> (<b>EFSA</b> Panel on Plant Health (PLH), 2011). The Panel considers that the extrapolations of the data provided by Shiotani et al. (2009) and Gottwald et al. (2009) were not supported by sound evidence. The Panel considers that both the responses provided by Dr Shiotani and by Dr Gottwald and colleagues do not lead to any major change in the set of scientifically sound information related to citrus canker and Xanthomonas citri pv. citri. The Panel, after evaluating the response provided by the USDA regarding the previous <b>EFSA</b> scientific <b>opinion</b> on citrus canker, considers that the removal of mandatory mitigation measures in field and packinghouse facilities increases the risk of contamination of fruit during the growing season and thus the bacterial load and frequency of infected fruit in consignments. Permitting the trade of citrus fruit originating from infected orchards increases the probability of the presence of X. citri pv. citri on fruit in consignments from those sites.

Having considered the information package provided by Hungary and all relevant scientific publications, the EFSA Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO Panel) concluded that (i) no new data specific to the safety of the nptII gene have been provided; (ii) the therapeutic relevance of kanamycin and neomycin was already addressed in the previous <b>EFSA</b> <b>opinion</b> on antibiotic resistance marker genes and kanamycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis results largely from chromosomal mutations and not from the transfer of aminoglycoside resistance genes such as nptII; (iii) the knowledge gaps and uncertainties highlighted in the Hungarian document have already been considered in the previous <b>EFSA</b> <b>opinion</b> on antibiotic resistance marker genes, and no new information on the safety of nptII gene as present in the GM potato EH 92 - 527 - 1 has been identified in the scientific literature that would cause the GMO Panel to change its previous conclusions.

Mean EA levels in the three sampling years were 10. 6, 6. 2 and 8. 6 µg kg − 1, respectively (maximum: 115. 4 µg kg − 1), indicating that exposure to EAs would not have exceeded the health-based guidance values set by EFSA in 2012.

30|$|The {{other major}} GMO trait {{has to do}} with the mutated (mBt) insecticidal peptidic toxins {{produced}} by transgenes in plants. In this case, some studies with maize confirmed histopathological changes in the liver and the kidneys of rats after GM feed consumption. Such changes consist in congestion, cell nucleus border changes, and severe granular degeneration in the liver [16]. Similarly, in the MON 810 studies, a significantly lower albumin/globulin ratio indicated a change in hepatic metabolism of 33 % of GM-fed male rats (according to <b>EFSA</b> <b>opinion</b> on MON 810 and [5]). Taken together, the results indicate potential adverse effects in hepatic metabolism. The insecticide produced by MON 810 could also induce liver reactions, like many other pesticides. Of course, the mCry 1 Ab and other mBt (mutated Bt toxins derived from native Bacillus thuringiensis toxins) in GMOs are proteic toxins; however, these are modified at the level of their amino acid sequence by biotechnologies and introduced by artificial vectors, thus these could be considered as xenobiotics (i.e., a molecule foreign to life). The liver together with the kidneys are the major reactive organs in case of food chronic intoxication.|$|R

40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion further elaborates a previous <b>EFSA</b> <b>opinion</b> and assesses {{the extent to}} which meat derived from broilers contributes to human campylobacteriosis at EU level. It gives an overview of the public health significance and burden of campylobacteriosis, concluding that there is considerable underascertainment and underreporting of clinical campylobacteriosis in the EU. The known and hypothesised factors having an impact of the epidemiology of human campylobacteriosis are summarised. Handling, preparation and consumption of broiler meat may account for 20 % to 30 % of human cases of campylobacteriosis, while 50 % to 80 % may be attributed to the chicken reservoir as a whole. Many factors may explain this difference in attribution. There are differences in the point of attribution (reservoir vs. point of consumption). Strains from the chicken reservoir may reach humans by pathways other than food (e. g. by the environment or by direct contact). Results may be biased by inaccurate exposure assessments, confounding by immunity and incomplete data on reservoirs. Data for source attribution in the EU are limited and unavailable for the majority of Member States and there are indications that the epidemiology of human campylobacteriosis differs between regions.

40|$|The Panel {{has been}} asked to reconsider the {{possible}} age-dependent toxicokinetics of BPA in animals and humans and their implication for hazard and risk assessment of BPA in food. The Panel concluded that the exposure of a human fetus to free BPA would be negligible due to the maternal capacity for conjugation whereas the fetal rat would be exposed to free BPA from the maternal circulation. Taking account of data in human neonates on compounds structurally related to BPA which undergo glucuronidation/sulphation, the Panel considers that there is sufficient capacity in the neonate to conjugate BPA at doses below 1 mg/kg bw (the Panel noted that exposures at the TDI of 0. 05 mg/kg bw are 20 fold lower than this). Therefore, the Panel concluded that there is sufficient capacity for biotransformation of BPA to hormonally inactive conjugates in neonatal humans at exposures to BPA that were considered in the <b>EFSA</b> <b>opinion</b> of 2006 and the European Union Risk Assessment Report (EC, 2003, 2008). In addition, the Panel notes that because of the metabolic differences described, exposure to free BPA in adult, fetal and neonatal rats will be greater than in humans and that rats would therefore be more susceptible to BPA-induced toxic effects than humans on a equivalent dose basis. The Panel therefore considers that its previous risk assessment based on the overall NOAEL fo...|$|R

In order to protect consumer health, the European Community will be determining maximum concentrations, which are to come into force uniformly in 2008. At present, existing maximum limits are under review and, if found to be necessary, maximum limits for additional substances will be proposed and established. This is currently under way for boron and fluoride. While there is no maximum limit for boron, the German regulation for mineral and drinking water (TrinkwV 2001) lays down 5 mg per litre for fluoride. High concentrations of boron can have negative effects on reproduction and foetal development in animals. An overdose of fluoride can, depending on age, primarily cause adverse effects of skeletal or dental fluorosis. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has provided an Opinion on both elements and proposed upper intake levels. In order to protect all age groups, natural mineral waters should thus contain no more than 1. 5 mg boron {{and no more than}} 1 mg fluoride per litre.
