6000|$|Once more I felt, what I {{had felt}} already, {{that there were}} <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> of {{strength}} {{in the character of}} this innocent young fellow, which had utterly escaped my superficial observation of him. In choosing his vocation, he was, no doubt, only following the conventional modern course in such cases. Despair has its fashions, as well as dress. Ancient despair (especially of Oscar's sort) used to turn soldier, or go into a monastery. Modern despair turns nurse; binds up wounds, gives physic, and gets cured or not in that useful but nasty way. Oscar had certainly struck out nothing new for himself: he had only followed the fashion. Still, it implied, as I thought, both courage and resolution to have conquered the obstacles which he must have overcome, and to have held steadily on his course after he had once entered it. Having begun by quarreling with him, I was in a fair way to end by respecting him. Surely this man was worth preserving for Lucilla, after all! ...|$|E

[...] "Don't notice me," [...] was all he replied. [...] "You will be doing me a kindness, if you will let me bear it by myself." [...] In my former experience of him, he had talked his way out of all his other troubles--he had clamorously demanded the expression of my sympathy with him. In this greatest trouble, he was like another being; I hardly knew him again! Were the <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> in his nature (stirred up by another serious call on them) showing themselves once more on the surface as they had shown themselves already, on the fatal first day when Lucilla tried her sight? In that way I accounted for the mere superficial change in him, at the time. What was actually going on below the surface it defied my ingenuity even to guess. Perhaps I shall best describe the sort of vague apprehension which he aroused in me--after what had passed between us at the station--by saying that I would not for worlds have allowed him to go to England by himself.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} an {{alternative}} {{explanation for why}} auc-tioneers often keep the <b>reserve</b> price <b>hidden</b> or secret. We consider a standard independent private values {{environment in which the}} buy-ers are risk-averse and the seller has private information about her valuation of the object to be auctioned. The seller uses a Þrst-price sealed-bid auction mechanism combined with either an announced re-serve price or a <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price. We compare the sellers ex ante expected proÞts under these two policies and Þnd that the optimal <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price policy generates higher expected proÞts for the seller when the buyers are fairly risk-averse under particular restric-tions on buyers preferences and the distributions of private values. As the number of the buyers increases, the <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price is more likely to dominate. Numerical methods are used to demonstrate the generality of our main results.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} seller strategy on winning prices in online auctions. In our conceptual model, three strategic choices made by the seller - minimum opening price, auction length, and use of a <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> price - are mediated {{by the number of}} bids placed during the auction and moderated by product type. Our tests analyze eBay auction data for four consumer products through two matched studies (two products per study). In particular, we compare products for which value is easily determined with those for which value is less clear. Overall, we find strong evidence of the effects of minimum opening price and <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> prices on final winning prices. The impact of auction length on winning price is less clear. In general, our tests support the idea that potential buyers rely more on signals such as opening price and reserve price for products for which reference prices are less available.

50|$|Hasdrubal had {{not noticed}} Scipio's <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> of cavalry moving behind enemy lines, and a Roman cavalry charge created a double envelopment on either flank led by cavalry {{commander}} Gaius Laelius and Scipio himself. This broke the back of Hasdrubal's army and routed his forces—an impressive feat for the young Roman versus the veteran Carthaginian general. Despite a Roman victory, Scipio was unable to hinder the Carthaginian march to Italy. Much historical criticism has been levelled at his inability to effectively pursue Hasdrubal, who would eventually cross the Alps only to be defeated by Gaius Claudius Nero at the Battle of the Metaurus.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of IFRS {{has caused a}} broad variety of examinations in literature. Numerous research studies in this context refer to accounting quality, comparability of financial reports and whether fair-value accounting is superior to historical-cost principles or not. All these issues have in common that <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves,</b> as the difference between historical book values and their fair value counterpart, {{play an important role}} in these fields. Nevertheless, there is currently no detailed examination showing empirical data about <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> Using information from 456 Purchase Price Allocations, we are the first to show which balance sheet items mainly comprise <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> and to what extent. Our results show that <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> exist in all balance sheet items, even in positions which are not supposed to contain reserves. We also find fewer <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> than we expected in provisions but higher portions in inventories, for example. Moreover, we provide details of which factors seem to influence the extent of <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> We contribute to the existing literature by adding empirical evidence to the theoretical discussions of faithfulness and comparability of financial statements...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparability}} of IFRS {{financial statements}} is frequently discussed {{in literature and}} numerous researches show that entities from different countries or with particular characteristics tend to use IFRS differently. However, <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves,</b> i. e. {{the discrepancy between the}} historical book values and their fair value counterparts, are usually not part of these investigations. Since we assume that <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> can be a reliable measure of comparability, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to examine if specific factors of a company like size, country of origin or industry membership also indicate different odds to observe <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> Analysing 456 purchase price allocations, we do indeed find evidence for our aforementioned assumption. Our results show that the probability to observe <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> under IFRS seems to be dependent on certain factors. For instance, our results clearly indicate that large companies show <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> more frequently than small companies. We also find that entities from particular countries exhibit significantly higher odds to hold <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves</b> than others. In consequence, we assume that the comparability of financial statements under IFRS is still not achieved...|$|E

40|$|Section 340 f of the German Commercial Code allows {{banks to}} {{provision}} against the special risks inherent to the banking business by building <b>hidden</b> <b>reserves.</b> Beyond risk provisioning, these reserves are implicitly accepted as an earnings management device.

A solution to this problem might involve a higher degree of integration of female engineers into the workforce. Data from the microcensus 2006, the official representative statistics of the population and the labour market in Germany, confirm the existence of a <b>hidden</b> <b>reserve</b> of female engineers. Ordered response models and seminonparametric estimation methods are used to show that the labour supply in the engineering sector is mainly determined by age. In addition, the labour supply of female engineers depends on how many children they have, on the age of their youngest child, and on their partners' income. Moreover, women care more about their families, rather than focusing on their career. Demographischer Wandel; Discrete Choice-Modelle; Fachkräftemangel; Frauenerwerbstätigkeit...|$|R

Amazon is the first cloud provider to address this challenge, by allowing clients to bid on spare capacity and by granting resources to bidders while their bids exceed a periodically changing spot price. Amazon publicizes the spot price but does not disclose how it is determined. By analyzing the spot price histories of Amazon’s EC 2 cloud, we reverse engineer how prices are set and construct a model that generates prices consistent with existing price traces.
