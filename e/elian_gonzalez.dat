25|$|<b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> (born December 6, 1993) is a Cuban {{national}} who, as a {{young boy}} in 2000, became embroiled in a heated international custody and immigration controversy involving the governments of Cuba and the United States; his father, Juan Miguel González Quintana; his other relatives in Cuba and in Miami, Florida; and Miami's Cuban American community.|$|E

25|$|Lázaro González, {{backed by}} local Cuban Americans, took the {{position}} that the boy should remain in the United States and not be returned to his father. Marisleysis González (Lázaro's adult daughter) became <b>Elián</b> <b>González's</b> caretaker and spokesperson for the maternal relatives. Also, Armando Gutierrez, a local Cuban American businessman, became a spokesman. At the same time, Juan Miguel, with the support of Cuban authorities, demanded that his son be returned to Cuba.|$|R
25|$|<b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> {{was born}} December 6, 1993 to {{divorced}} parents. On November 21, 1999, González, his mother Elizabeth Brotons Rodríguez, and twelve others left Cuba {{on a small}} aluminum boat with a faulty engine; González's mother and ten others died in the crossing. González {{and the other two}} survivors floated at sea until they were rescued by two fishermen, who handed them over to the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> case, {{the area}} {{to the east of}} USINT (previously a grassed area {{containing}} the above-mentioned billboard) was paved and a stage was built. It is known as the José Martí Anti-Imperialist Plaza in Cuba. Whilst originally used for rallies and protest meeting (particularly those protesting against actions by the US government), this stage has also been used for concerts, such as Audioslave's concert released on their album Live in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|On March 21, a Federal judge {{dismissed}} the relatives' petition for asylum {{which they had}} filed on behalf of <b>Elián</b> <b>González.</b> Lázaro vowed to appeal. On March 29, Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas was joined by 22 other civic leaders {{in a speech in}} downtown Miami.

2500|$|On January 21, 2000, <b>Elián</b> <b>González's</b> grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodríguez, {{flew from}} Havana to the United States to seek their grandson's return to Cuba. While {{they were able}} to meet with the boy only once at the Miami Beach home of Barry University {{president}} Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, they journeyed to Washington and met with congressmen and Attorney General Janet Reno. After nine days of media coverage (during which Republican lawmakers acknowledged they did not have the votes to pass a bill to give González U.S. citizenship), they returned to Cuba to [...] "a hero's welcome".|$|R
5000|$|Peikoff {{is known}} for campaigning on behalf of <b>Elián</b> <b>González's</b> right to remain in Florida, rather than {{returning}} to his father in Cuba, stating that [...] "To send a child to rot in the prison of Cuba for the alleged sake of his own well-being is criminal hypocrisy. To send him there {{in order to preserve}} his father's rights is absurdity, since there are no parental or other rights in Cuba. To send him there because 'He needs a father, no matter what' is a mindless bromide. Does he need a father who {{has no choice but to}} watch his son being broken in mind and starved in body?" ...|$|R
25|$|Commentators have {{suggested}} that the <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> affair may have been a factor in voters' decisions in the 2000 United States presidential election, which could have affected the close outcome in Florida. Al Gore's handling of the matter may have angered the predominantly Republican Cuban community over the boy's return to Cuba. Gore initially supported Republican legislation to give the boy and his father permanent residence status, but later supported the administration position. He was attacked by both sides in the dispute for his equivocal position.|$|E
25|$|Attorney General Janet Reno {{ordered the}} return of <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} <b>Elián</b> <b>Gonzalez</b> {{lived with his}} father, stepmother, and three {{brothers}} in Cárdenas, where his father, Juan Miguel, was a waiter at an Italian restaurant at Josone Park, near Cardenas. Elián's father was interviewed at the restaurant in 2004 by Keith Morrison of the NBC News program Dateline NBC and Cover to Cover on CNBC. Juan Miguel filmed a home video on which Gonzalez was shown doing his arithmetic homework with Juan Miguel in their dining room, going to bed in his bedroom with his two younger half-brothers, and attending karate lessons.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> {{remained}} {{a subject of}} media attention as he went to Walt Disney World Resort one day, then met with politicians the next. Throughout the custody battle, opinion polls showed {{that a majority of}} Americans believed González should be returned to his father in Cuba, and that doing so was in the boy's best interest. On April 19, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled that González had to remain in the U.S. until the Miami Gonzálezes could appeal for an asylum hearing in May.|$|E
25|$|After González was {{returned}} to his father's custody, he remained in the U.S. while the Miami relatives exhausted their legal options. A three-judge federal panel had ruled {{that he could not}} go back to Cuba until he was granted an asylum hearing, but the case turned on the right of the relatives to request that hearing on behalf of the boy. On June 1, 2000, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Elián was too young to file for asylum; only his father could speak for him, and the relatives lacked legal standing. On June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the decision. Later the same day, <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> and his family returned home to Cuba.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{state that}} {{subjecting}} {{themselves to a}} one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show. The schedule also allows South Park to both stay more topical and respond more quickly to specific current events than other satiric animated shows. One of the earliest examples of {{this was in the}} season four (2000) episode [...] "Quintuplets 2000", which references the United States Border Patrol's raid of a house during the <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> affair, an event which occurred only four days before the episode originally aired. The season nine (2005) episode [...] "Best Friends Forever" [...] references the Terri Schiavo case, and originally aired {{in the midst of the}} controversy and less than 12 hours before she died. A scene in the season seven (2003) finale [...] "It's Christmas in Canada" [...] references the discovery of dictator Saddam Hussein in a [...] "spider hole" [...] and his subsequent capture, which happened a mere three days prior to the episode airing. The season 12 (2008) episode [...] "About Last Night..." [...] revolves around Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 presidential election, and aired less than 24 hours after Obama was declared the winner, using segments of dialogue from Obama's real victory speech.|$|E

2500|$|On April 14, a {{video was}} {{released}} in which <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> tells Juan Miguel {{that he wants to}} stay in the United States. However, many thought that he had been coached, as a male voice was heard off-camera directing the young boy. In a September 2005 interview with 60 Minutes after being sent back to Cuba, González stated that during his stay in the U.S., his family members were [...] "telling me bad things about [...] ", and [...] "were also telling me to tell him that I {{did not want to go}} back to Cuba, and I always told them I wanted to." ...|$|E

2500|$|His view {{of human}} rights led Rees to support a full hearing to {{determine}} whether little <b>Elián</b> <b>González</b> (born 1993) should remain with relatives in Miami or be returned to communist Cuba. Rees decried the pre-dawn raid that resulted in Elián's capture by INS agents. The whole case was, he said, a triumph for Cuban President Fidel Castro. [...] "Castro has actually been able to turn the Elián issue to his advantage across a broad field of ways." [...] When asked why the Republican Congress did not rise up against the seizure of Elián, presumably against the boy's wishes, to communist governance, Reese cited public opinion polls. [...] "Had the polls suggested that 70 or 80 {{percent of the people}} were appalled by the pre-dawn raid in Miami, you would have seen a different reaction in Congress," [...] said Rees.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI) {{expanded}} its educational programs into the Objectivist Graduate Center (OGC), which held classes led by Leonard Peikoff and Harry Binswanger.
