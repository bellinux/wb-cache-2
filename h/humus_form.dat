The <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> have been classified using two different approaches: the French one (Brethes et al. 1995, AFES-INRA 1998) and the Canadian one (Klinka et al. 1981, Green et al. 1993).

The <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> shows more variability on the hilly sites (350 - 600 m a. s. l.), with no dominant form.

The study tests the effectiveness of the recent European <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> classification (Zanella et al. 2011 b), based on morpho-genetic characteristics of diagnostic organic and organo-mineral horizons. Further- more it reveals how <b>humus</b> <b>forms,</b> at the level of diagnostic horizons, are related to vegetation/soil type and car- bon storage capacity of the soil. The <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> were surveyed in different substrates, soil types, and vegetation units of a Mediterranean forest ecosystem in Central Italy (Castelporziano Reserve). Thickness, organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (Ntot) contents in organic and organo-mineral horizons, pH and texture in the organo-mineral horizon were measured and statistically analysed. The three main <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> (Mull, Moder and Amphi) covering the soil of the Reserve appeared well separated on the PCA diagram. Thickness, OC and Ntot showed a high correlation with axes of PCA. Kruskal–Wallis tests re- vealed differences between Mull, Moder and Amphi: 1) the thickness of the A horizon was larger in Amphi; 2) OC in the A horizon was less in Moder; 3) Mull had less OC in organic horizons than Moder and Amphi; and 4) Mull and Amphi had twice OC of Moder in bulked organic and organo-mineral horizons. Two main ecological gradients, from neutral/aerated Mull to acid/anaerobic-water saturated logged Moder on one side and from fresh Mull to dry Amphi on the other, explain the distribution of <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> in the Reserve. The first gradient concerns circular belts around periodically filled small basins and is peculiar to the more or less impermeable plain of Castelporziano; on the contrary, the second progressive transition is very common in Med- iterranean forests.

In this work, the structure of the diagnostic A and OH horizons has been analysed in terms of aggregation force, diameter and composition of the soil lumps (peds). In order to study the aggregation force, two disaggregating tools have been conceived and used. The diameter of the lumps has been measured by sieving the soil samples with standardised webs. Observing the samples thanks to a binocular magnifying 10 X and 50 X, the organic or/and mineral composition of the soil aggregates has been determined, data being investigated with ANOVA and Factorial Analysis.

For that purpose 31 <b>Humus</b> <b>Form</b> Reference Groups (HFRGs) and a set of prefix and suffix qualifiers are proposed, following the rules erected for the WRB. An exhaustive classification key, respecting the principles of WRB, is suggested and examples of classification are given for some already well known humus forms...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{micromorphology}} plays a {{key role}} in the research of the decomposition, storage, and mineralisation of soil organic matter. It is often difficult to study the internal fabrics and stability of soil aggregates, based on soil micromorphological properties. Similar to physical fractionation of soil inorganic particles organic matter from ectorganic and endorganic horizons can also be fractionated. Quantification of aggregate stability can be achieved, by the weight percentage of such fractions. Also the micromorphological properties of soil particles can be studied using cryo-coupes from gelatin suspensions prepared in a cryostat. The results of physical fractionation and cryo-coupe analysis improve our knowledge on the development of the <b>humus</b> <b>form</b> in the soil...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{is a major}} {{carbon sink}} or source on ter-restrial ecosystems. Despite their great importance, <b>humus</b> <b>forms,</b> which {{constitute}} the small portion above the soil, have been often neglected in local studies and in interna-tional research projects. In the present work we evaluated the organic carbon stocked in the different <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> in a Mediterranean lowland forest, to highlight the carbon concentration in different vegetation types, particularly between evergreen and deciduous woodlands. Results showed that the carbon stock stored in the organic and organo-mineral horizons of humus and soil, expressed in Tons/Ha, had a wide range for each vegetation type, reﬂecting the high diversity of the forest vegetation and the variability within each type. The vegetation with the highest value of carbon stock despite its small extension was represented by humid woodlands dominated by Fraxinus oxycarpa, a relic forest type occurring in the dune slacks within the study area, which gives, therefore, {{an important contribution to}} the climate warming reduction. We demonstrated as the <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> {{play a role in the}} carbon sequestration in a forest ecosystem; therefore, it may be important to add the evaluation of carbon stock when carbon concentration is evaluated for the soil and above and plants below ground biomass...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoils {{formed in}} tidal and subtidal environments {{often do not}} show {{sufficient}} accumulation of undecomposed plant tissues to be classified as Histosols. In this article we present a first attempt of morpho-functional classification of aquatic humus, a revision of the terminology and of the diagnostic features employed by pedologists {{in the description of}} aqueous and submerged soils, and we finally suggest some criteria to be used during field investigations. According to the proposed criteria, Redoxi, Reductitidal, and Subtidal <b>humus</b> <b>forms</b> can be distinguished in aquatic systems, avoiding any possible confusion with Histic, Epihisto, Hydro and Para Anaero/Archaeo or Crusto <b>humus</b> <b>forms.</b> The article concludes with some examples of classification, including prefixes for detailing particular intergrades with the other groups of humipedons and with the discussion of the contribution of algae and seagrasses to the formation of Crusto forms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Humus Index, {{based on}} the visual {{assessment}} of topsoil horizons and a classification of <b>humus</b> <b>forms,</b> is a numerical score {{which can be used}} as a correlate of stand and soil properties. In oak stands from the Montargis forest (Loiret, France) we observed a good linear relationship of the Humus Index with most parameters describing stand development (age, basal area (BA), height and diameter at breast height of dominants) and soil type (depth of clay horizon). The relationship with parameters describing nutrient availability (exchangeable bases, base saturation) was similarly good but nonlinear. In the studied forest the Humus Index was affected first by stand age and second by soil type. When corrected for age and soil type, data (96 pooled estimates) indicated a slight decrease in the Humus Index (shift towards more active <b>humus</b> <b>forms)</b> in stands converted from old coppices-with-standards when compared with even-aged high forest...|$|R
