50|$|A {{stuffing}} box of a sailboat {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a <b>gland</b> <b>nut.</b> The packing is inside the <b>gland</b> <b>nut</b> and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} <b>gland</b> <b>nut.</b> Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|E

50|$|A gland is {{a general}} type of {{stuffing}} box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in {{the head of a}} tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The <b>gland</b> <b>nut</b> allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the piston rod of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.|$|E
50|$|The {{gauge glass}} on a boiler {{needs to be}} {{inspected}} periodically and replaced if it is seen to have worn thin {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>gland</b> <b>nuts,</b> but a failure in service can still occur. Drivers are expected to carry two or three glass tubes, pre-cut to the required length, together with hemp or rubber seals, to replace the tubes on the road. Familiarity with this disquieting occurrence was considered so important that a glass would often be smashed deliberately while a trainee driver was on the footplate, to give him practice in fitting a new tube. Although automatic ball valves are fitted in the mounts to limit the release of steam and scalding water, these can fail through accumulation of limescale. It was standard procedure to hold the coal scoop in front of the face while the other hand, holding the cap for protection, reached to turn off the valves at both ends of the glass.|$|R
