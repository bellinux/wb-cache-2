The VOC families studied in this work were alkenes, alkynes, <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> and amines. Solubility predictions in the form of infinite dilution activity coefficients were made using the Modified UNIFAC Dortmund group contribution model, and were computed using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet specifically designed for this purpose. It was found that, with the exception of cyclopentadiene, alkene activity coefficients decreased slightly with increasing temperature thereby generally deviating from ideality. Solubility of alkyne interactions with unsaturated esters increased with increasing temperature, but decreased with saturated ester interactions for the terminal alkynes. With the exception of trichloromethane <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> activity coefficients decreased with increasing temperature, thus deviating from ideality.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{investigations}} by Slater {{and colleagues}} into the metabolic activation of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> {{in general and}} carbon tetrachloride in particular. It is becoming increasingly accepted that free radical intermediates {{are involved in the}} toxicity of many such compounds through mechanisms including lipid peroxidation, covalent binding, and cofactor depletion. Here we describe the experimental approaches that are used to establish that <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> are metabolized in animal tissues to reactive free radicals. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is used to identify free-radical products, often using spin-trapping compounds. The generation of specific free radicals by radiolytic methods is useful in the determination of the precise reactivity of radical intermediates postulated to be injurious to the cell. The enzymic mechanism of the production of such free radicals and their subsequent reactions with biological molecules is studied with specific metabolic inhibitors and free-radical scavengers. These combined techniques provide considerable insight into the process of metabolic activation of halogenated compounds. It is readily apparent, for instance, that the local oxygen concentration at the site of activation is of crucial importance to the subsequent reactions; the formation of peroxy radical derivatives from the primary free-radical product is shown to be of great significance in relation to carbon tetrachloride and may be of general importance. However, while these studies have provided much information on the biochemical mechanisms of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkane</b> toxicity, it is clear that many problems remain to be solved...|$|R

30|$|The {{ability of}} Dehalogenimonas spp. to reductively dechlorinate high {{concentrations}} of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> {{has important implications for}} cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Abiotic transformation of these chemicals in the environment is generally quite slow. For example, the environmental half-life of 1, 2 -DCA from abiotic transformation in water was estimated to be 50 years ([Vogel et al., 1987]). Unlike chlorinated ethe nes (e.g., tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene), several of the polychlorinated etha nes and propa nes, 1, 2 -DCA in particular, are resistant to transformation by zero-valent iron ([Sarathy et al., 2010]; [Song and Carraway, 2005]), limiting physicochemical remediation approaches for cleanup.

Previous studies on reductive dechlorination of <b>halogenated</b> <b>alkanes</b> have generally been conducted in a relatively narrow range of low (e.g., 0.1 to 0.5 mM) contaminant concentrations ([Chen et al., 1996]; [De Wildeman et al., 2003]; [Fletcher et al., 2009]; [Grostern and Edwards, 2006, 2009]; [Lorah and Olsen, 1999]; [Maymó-Gatell et al., 1999]; [Yan et al., 2009 a]).

According to the Meyer-Overton correlation the anaesthetic potency of the drug is directly proportional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anaesthetics and are predicted to be potent anaesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exert only one constituent of the anaesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anaesthetics do.

The catalytic performance of the resulting catalyst samples in the hydrodechlorination (HDCl) of 1, 2 -dichloroethane at 220 ºC was investigated, to gain understanding of metal alloying phenomena governing the variation in ethene selectivity with time on stream (TOS).

The primary photochemical process consists in the photoinduced reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with the contemporaneous oxidation of the axial ligand to radical species.
