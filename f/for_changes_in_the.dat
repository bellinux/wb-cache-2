Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional caissons had {{to be added to the}} partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion.

5|$|The icy Galilean moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all {{generate}} induced magnetic {{moments in}} response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ambient field. The induction is thought {{to take place in}} subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence {{was one of the most}} important discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E

5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, working within the existing framework.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speed of light depending on {{the direction of the}} planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{selection}} for the Gator Bowl {{was not without}} controversy. The Hokies' three Big East losses pushed them to third place in the conference, behind Miami (which earned an automatic bid to the national championship game) and Syracuse, which lost only one Big East Conference game. Instead of attending the Gator Bowl, Syracuse earned a bid to the 2002 Insight Bowl, {{considered to be a}} less prestigious game due to its lesser payout and shorter history. Syracuse fans, coaches, and players were offended that Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the Gator Bowl despite Syracuse's better record due to Tech's reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games. In the wake of Tech's selection, Syracuse athletic director Jake Crouthamel vowed to lobby <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way the Gator Bowl's Big East selection was made.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of secondary sex characteristics in women {{is driven by}} estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated {{at the time of}} puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks), and maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.|$|E

25|$|Diffuse sky {{radiation}} is solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface {{after having been}} scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the atmosphere. It is also called skylight, diffuse skylight, or {{sky radiation}} and is the reason <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> color of the sky. Of the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere (approximately 25% of the incident radiation {{when the sun is}} high in the sky, depending on the amount of dust and haze in the atmosphere), about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation. When the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky, with 1361W/m2 above the atmosphere, direct sunlight is about 1050W/m2, and total insolation about 1120W/m2. This implies that under these conditions the diffuse radiation is only about 70W/m2 out of the original 1361W/m2.|$|E
