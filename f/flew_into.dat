5|$|By this time, {{the central}} {{pressure}} of the depression had decreased to 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) and gale-force winds were recorded over a large area, and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning. The system was {{compared to that of}} a Kona low, a large-scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii. Early on November2, the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic. Later that day, the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> Greta. During the day, an Air Force B-50 aircraft and NHRP B-47 high altitude jet <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> the storm. The storm executed a counter-clockwise loop, ending on November3, during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system. By this time, the storm had also begun a southeastward track.|$|E

5|$|Longyearbyen is {{the centre}} of tourism on the archipelago, {{although}} most tourism is generated based on natural experiences rather than visiting the town itself. However, Longyearbyen does provide supplies, accommodation and several museums. In 2008, Longyearbyen experienced 89,000 guest-nights, up from 30,000 in 1995. The average guest stayed 2.2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists. About 40,000 tourists <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> Longyearbyen. Two-thirds of the tourists come from Norway. In 2007, the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK291 million and produced 200 man-years.|$|E

5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The {{center of the storm}} was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward in response to an area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.|$|E
5|$|At about 04:30 on June 30, 1934, Hitler and {{his entourage}} <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> Munich. From the airport they drove to the Bavarian Interior Ministry, where they {{assembled}} the leaders of an SA rampage {{that had taken place}} in city streets the night before. Enraged, Hitler tore the epaulets off the shirt of Obergruppenführer August Schneidhuber, the chief of the Munich police, for failing to keep order in the city on the previous night. Hitler shouted at Schneidhuber and accused him of treachery. Schneidhuber was executed later that day. As the stormtroopers were hustled off to prison, Hitler assembled a large group of SS and regular police, and departed for the Hanselbauer Hotel in Bad Wiessee, where Ernst Röhm and his followers were staying.|$|E
5|$|Charley {{originated}} {{with a large}} swirl of clouds which parted off of {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a well defined center, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation center was present. The following morning, a second flight reported that a center had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression. Initially, the center was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.|$|E

5|$|In September 1999, about 20 SBS {{members were}} {{involved}} in the Australian led International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in East Timor. Together with the Australian Special Air Service Regiment and the New Zealand Special Air Service they formed INTERFET's special forces element named Response Force. Response Force departed from Darwin by C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> Dili tasked with securing the airport, a seaport and a heli-port to enable regular forces to land and deploy with the SBS filmed driving a Land Rover Defender out of a Hercules. Response Force was then utilised to perform to a variety of tasks including direct action and special reconnaissance throughout East Timor. The British forces withdrew in December 1999, including the SBS. A Sergeant was awarded the Military Cross after his patrol came under fire from pro-Indonesian militia.|$|E
5|$|In early September1972, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed within a near-equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands. On September11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as {{a tropical}} depression shortly after moving through the island chain. Initially, the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward {{along the edge of}} a ridge. On September13, a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name Paring. The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> the sky during storms. They could fly in spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could fly in body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E

5|$|Nine days later, Hurricanes, {{escorted by}} a pair of Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew a patrol over the island of Rab and {{adjacent}} areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again escorted by two Spitfires, were tasked with interdicting road communications between Bihać and Knin. One aircraft developed engine trouble and had to return to base, but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot bailing out and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near Trebinje. One aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered engine trouble and crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November, Major General David G. Barr, the {{commander}} of the 7th Infantry Division, <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> the Sinhung-ni inlet and met with Faith, who by now had assumed command of RCT-31. Faith expressed the difficulties for a breakout, particularly the 500 wounded that RCT-31 had to carry. On the same day, parts of the PVA 94th Division and the rest of 81st Divisionarrived as reinforcements for the 80th Division. By midnight, six Chinese regiments renewed their attacks and Zhan Danan, {{the commander}} of the 80th Division, ordered the complete destruction of RCT-31 before dawn. Again, the 57th Battalion's AA guns held the Chinese at bay, but the shell supplies were running desperately low. On the day of 1 December, Faith finally ordered RCT-31 to breakout from Sinhung-ni and withdraw to Hagaru-ri.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Reagan's casket {{was removed}} from the presidential library and driven in a {{motorcade}} to NAS Point Mugu in Oxnard, California; it was the same airfield Reagan <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> and out of during his presidency when visiting his California ranch. SAM 28000, one of the two Boeing 747-200s, which usually serves the president as Air Force One, arrived to transport the casket to Washington. Thousands of people gathered to witness the plane's departure. Just before she boarded the VC-25A Presidential Aircraft, Nancy Reagan waved to the crowd with her military escort at her side. The plane lifted off at about 9:40am PST.|$|E
