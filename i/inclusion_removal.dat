40|$|Abstract: More than 94 % {{steelmaking}} and ironmaking {{are released}} in continuous casting process. Product quality {{is closely related}} to metal cleanness and non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> <b>removal.</b> So, lliquid metal flow in ladles, tundishes and moulds is recognised to be of great importance in the quality of these products. The metal jet from the ladle to tundish tends to induce turbulent motions which can play important roles in non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> <b>removal</b> at the slag surface, thereby helping in the production of cleaner steel. To improve particle decantation, flow control devices such as dams and weirs are used. The present work is an experimental study released using similarity criteria, through Reynolds and Froude numbers. A reduced scale (1 / 4) water model of an industrial tundish is used to visualise and measure different parameters of a tracer flow injected in water.

40|$|Two aspects on {{macroscopic}} mixing in {{a continuous}} flow system – metallurgical tundish were studied. Specifically, 1) the first focus was on salt solution tracer mixing, which is important for tundish design from perspectives of tracer technology and Residence Time Distributions (RTD) {{as well as for}} the understanding of the macroscopic mixing in tundishes. The different amounts of salt solution tracer mixing in a tundish were studied by using both physical models and mathematical models. The disturbance of KCl salt tracer on the flow in the tundish with respect to different amounts is like the “butterfly effect”, i. e. only a slight increase of the amount of tracer, the flow field might be disturbed. This, in turn, will result in a shifted RTD curve. 2) The second focus was on Eulerian modeling of inclusions macroscopic transport and removal, which is important for tundish design from perspectives of <b>inclusions</b> <b>removal</b> and to provide information of macroscopic <b>removal</b> of <b>inclusions.</b> In the study, an approach that combined the meso-scale inclusions deposition at turbulent boundary layers of steel-slag interface and the macroscopic transport of inclusions in the tundish was used. The theoretical calculation results showed that the effect of the roughness on the deposition velocity of small inclusions (radius of 1 μm) were more pronounced than that for the big inclusions (up to the radius of 9 μm). The dynamic <b>inclusions</b> <b>removal</b> studies showed that the tundish with a weir and a dam exhibited a better performance with respect to the <b>removal</b> of bigger <b>inclusions</b> (radii of 5 μm, 7 μm and 9 μm) than that of the case without weirs and dams.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> from liquid steel by gas bubbling and bubble attachment in the tundish is complex {{due to the}} great number of variables involved, and {{it is even more}} difficult to study because of the turbulent flow conditions. The main objective of this work is to analyze and improve the understanding of the alumina <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> rate by bubble attachment and by gas bubbling fluid dynamics effects. The results show that the inclusion collection probability mainly depends on the attachment mechanism by collision. This parameter was determined by calculating the induction time, which is shorter when the rupture time and the formation time of a stable three phases contact (particle/liquid/gas) are ignored than when it is fully considered, affecting the attachment probability. In addition, to achieve acceptable <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal,</b> a smaller bubble diameter is required, such as 1 [*]mm. This consideration is almost impossible to achieve during tundish operation; a more realistic bubble diameter around 10 [*]mm is employed, resulting in a very inefficient <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> process by bubble attachment. Nevertheless, in a real casting tundish the <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> rate employing argon bubbling is efficient; is mainly due to the fluid flow pattern changes rather than bubble attachment.

As part of a long-term effort to develop and apply comprehensive models of these and other phenomena, this paper reports on work during the second year of this NSF grant that aims 1) to develop quantitative models of transient flow of molten steel, superheat and inclusions during the continuous casting of steel, and 2) to apply them to improve understanding and efficiency of inclusion particle removal in the process. Results are reported here for five interrelated subprojects. Firstly, models of transient flow using Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which were previously validated and used to predict flow, are used here to predict the accompanying transport of inclusion particles. Of most significance, the model can predict the ultimate distribution of inclusions in the final product.

40|$|Understanding and {{controlling}} <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> from steel {{is critical in}} modern steelmaking. Inclusions are usually formed as a reaction product of the steel deoxidation process, though they may also result from slag and mould flux entrainment, refractory degradation or precipitation events during steel solidification. They are generally removed by reacting with a slag (liquid oxide) phase. This is primarily achieved by optimising the process conditions to promote contact and reaction between the inclusion and liquid oxide. Efficient <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> from steel is achieved when the inclusions contact the slag phase, leading to bonding and dissolution in the slag. If the bond is weak, then local fluid conditions are {{likely to result in}} the shearing of the inclusion-slag bond and the inclusions remain in the steel. The strength of the inclusion bond or reactivity with slag may be assessed by measuring the dynamic wetting of the slag on a substrate made of the inclusion phase. The least understood component of <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> is inclusion reactivity/separation with the slag phase. The inclusion has to travel across the steel-slag interface to wet the slag. This is favoured when contact angle (θ) for the steel-inclusion is greater than 90 ° (non-wetting) and when this contact angle is greater than θ for the inclusion-slag. While it is understood that inclusion-slag interfacial tension/wetting {{play a critical role in}} <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal,</b> there are only limited wetting data of slags on typical inclusion phase types in literature. Recently, Choi and Lee investigated the wettability of alumina on slag and concluded that for a slag with a given CaO/SiO 2 ratio, an increase in Al 2 O 3 results in an increase in the wetting angle, θ. This may in part be explained by the change in thermodynamic driving force of the reaction and/or a change in the physical characteristics of the slag with increasing alumina...|$|E

40|$|A strong {{magnetic}} field, e. g., > 10 T, {{is considered}} an important tool {{in the process of}} small nonmetallic <b>inclusions</b> <b>removal</b> and related anisotropic materials preparation. In the present paper, a model system of aluminum containing alumina particles is used to investigate the strong magnetic field effects. Considerable segregation is induced by the applied gradient magnetic field, whereas no segregation is observed in a gravity field because of the convection. A high gradient magnetic field, together with the particle size and treatment time, {{is an important factor in}} generating the segregation. At the same time, magnetic alignment is detected after the strong magnetic field treatment. The (00 l) crystal planes of alumina are found to be aligned to the strong magnetic field direction. Experimental results agree with the theoretical calculations based on the theory of magnetic energy. Additionally, the rotation time for the alignment is estimated and the time for alumina particles of 15 mu m is found to be < 1 s. However, the alignment is easily disturbed by the convection during the quenching outside of the strong magnet, especially for small particles where the rotation time is much shorter.

It is found an annular particle layer is formed by the removed particles at free surface, which can capture other particles arriving at the free surface. However, the attachment of particles to the annular particle layer is not stable, and re-entrainment of particles occurs at high gas flow rate. It is shown the overall particle removal is determined by a balance of removal and re-entrainment.

The majorcontributor to inclusion growth is turbulent collision. Growthdue to Stoke's collisions is also somewhat important if largedifferences among inclusion sizes exist. Growth of inclusions in gas stirred ladles was studied usinga similar approach as the one for induction stirred ladles, butwith use of simulation results from a fundamental mathematicalmodel of a gas-stirred ladle. Similarly to what was found inthe case of induction stirring, it was found that turbulentcollisions and Stokes collisions appeared to be the majormechanisms for inclusion growth. The contribution of laminarshear collisions to growth was deemed negligible compared tothat of turbulent collisions. For the gas stirred ladle different removal mechanisms werealso studied, based on input data from a mathematical model ofa gas-stirred ladle. It was found that different modelssuggested to predict the <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> due to bubbleflotation gave very different results. Also, all models assumeda spherical shape of the gas bubbles, which was found to beless realistic. Therefore, a new model for <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal</b> byspherical cap bubble flotation was developed. In the newcalculations, the most important mechanisms of inclusionremoval were found to be removal to the top slag and removal bybubble flotation, assuming spherical-cap bubbles and planecontact. When the bubbles were assumed to be spherical,resulting removal rates were lower than when they were assumedto be spherical caps. Based on these results it is concludedthat {{more research is needed to}} obtain a better understandingof the importance of bubble flotation on <b>inclusion</b> <b>removal.</b> Experiments are clearly needed to determine which modelconcepts produce predictions in best agreement withcorresponding data from actual steelmaking processes.

Recent results showing that a single fibronectin gene can give rise to several different mRNAs by alternative splicing suggested an explanation for some of this diversity of fibronectin subunits.
