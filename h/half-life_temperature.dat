A small synthetic peptide was cleaved specifically by an esterase present in poliovirus-infected cells.

40|$|Background: Because of its {{half-life}} {{of about}} 35 million years, 92 Nb is {{considered as a}} chronometer for nucleosynthesis events prior {{to the birth of}} our sun. The abundance of 92 Nb in the early solar system can be derived from meteoritic data. It has to be compared to theoretical estimates for the production of 92 Nb to determine the time between the last nucleosynthesis event before the formation of the early solar system. Purpose: The influence of a low-lying short-lived isomer on the nucleosynthesis of 92 Nb is analyzed. The thermal coupling between the ground state and the isomer via so-called intermediate states affects the production and survival of 92 Nb. Method: The properties of the lowest intermediate state in 92 Nb are known from experiment. From the lifetime of the intermediate state and from its decay branchings, the transition rate from the ground state to the isomer and the effective half-life of 92 Nb are calculated {{as a function of the}} temperature. Results: The coupling between the ground state and the isomer is strong. This leads to thermalization of ground state and isomer in the nucleosynthesis of 92 Nb in any explosive production scenario and almost 100 % survival of 92 Nb in its ground state. However, the strong coupling leads to a temperature-dependent effective half-life of 92 Nb which makes the 92 Nb survival very sensitive to temperatures as low as about 8 keV, thus turning 92 Nb at least partly into a thermometer. Conclusions: The low-lying isomer in 92 Nb does not affect the production of 92 Nb in explosive scenarios. In retrospect this validates all previous studies where the isomer was not taken into account. However, the dramatic reduction of the effective <b>half-life</b> at <b>temperatures</b> below 10 keV may affect the survival of 92 Nb after its synthesis in supernovae which are the most likely astrophysical site for the nucleosynthesis of 92 Nb.

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation {{is dependent on}} the centromere-specific histone H 3 isoform known generally as CenH 3, or as Cse 4 in budding yeast. Cytological experiments have shown that Cse 4 appears at extracentromeric loci in yeast cells deficient for both the CAF- 1 and HIR histone H 3 /H 4 deposition complexes, consistent with increased nondisjunction in these double mutant cells. Here, we examined molecular aspects of this Cse 4 mislocalization. Genome-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated broader distribution of Cse 4 outside of centromeres in cac 1 Delta hir 1 Delta double mutant cells that lack both CAF- 1 and HIR complexes than in either single mutant. However, cytological localization showed that the essential inner kinetochore component Mif 2 (CENP-C) was not recruited to extracentromeric Cse 4 in cac 1 Delta hir 1 Delta double mutant cells. We also observed that rpb 1 - 1 mutants displayed a modestly increased Cse 4 <b>half-life</b> at nonpermissive <b>temperatures,</b> suggesting that turnover of Cse 4 is partially dependent on Pol II transcription.

40|$|Different uni- and bimolecular {{reactions}} of hydroxymethylene, an important intermediate in the photochemistry of formaldehyde, {{as well as}} its halogenated derivatives (XCOH, X = H, F, Cl, Br), have been considered using high-level CCSD(T) /CBS quantum chemical methods. The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) and Eckart approximations were applied to estimate the tunneling rate constant of isomerization of trans-HCOH to H 2 CO, and the WKB procedure was found to perform better in this case. In agreement with recent calculations and experimental observations [Schreiner et al., Nature 2008, 453, 906], the half-life of HCOH at the low temperature limit in the absence of bimolecular processes was found to be very long (similar to 2. 1 h).

40|$|Early in {{the history}} of the field of nuclear science, {{experiments}} were performed to ascertain whether the half-lives of the radioactive substances being studied ? isotopes then called the ?radium emanation? [222 Rn], ?radium A? [218 Po], ?radium B? [214 Pb], and ?radium C? [214 Bi] - were dependent upon any external factors. At that time, the external factors deemed most likely to affect <b>half-life</b> were <b>temperature</b> and pressure. After several experiments, designed to pick up any change in half-life in the course of changing temperature or pressure, had failed to find any significant changes, it was concluded that half-life does not depend on the physical properties of external environment. And that was the state of the field for a long time - for almost 100 years, in fact. Fairly recently, however, half-life measurements were recorded, and published, that seemed to show a change in half-life at the few percent level for certain radioactive nuclides which were exposed to extremes of temperature - thus challenging the long-held belief in the unchangeability of half-lives. In addition to half-life changes caused by temperature change, other experiments seemed to find half-life changes caused by other external influences, including the chemical environment of the decaying radioactive nuclide, and even the distance between Earth and the Sun at the time of the half-life measurement. In this study we present evidence that the initial beliefs in the immutability of radioactive half-life (with the exception of a few nuclides decaying by electron capture whose orbital electrons are involved in both the decay and also in the chemical bonding of those nuclides) is indeed correct; we have done this by performing precise half-life measurements on the ?? emitter 198 Au, the EC emitter 97 Ru, and on the ?? emitter 198 Au when sited in gold(III) oxide, Au 2 O 3, (an insulator for practical purposes). We have performed various experiments designed to detect any half-life change at the level of a few parts in 10 ^ 4 due to change in temperature, physical environment, or the Earth-Sun distance.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{recently}} identified the fifth {{member of the}} membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase subfamily, MT 5 -MMP/MMP 24, which is expressed in a brain specific manner (Duanqing Pei (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 8925 – 8932). To further characterize its enzymic properties, an expression construct was engineered to produce MT 5 -MMP as a soluble and active form by truncating its transmembrane domain. Stable expression cell lines were subsequently established from MDCK cells transfected with this construct. Unfortunately, purification of MT 5 -MMP from the culture media in large quantity proves to be difficult initially due to its rapid turnover via a mechanism which can be inhibited by a broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor, BB 94. Thus, BB 94 {{was included in the}} cell culture medium and throughout the purification process except the final step of chromatography to protect MT 5 -MMP from destruction. Purified to homogeneity and free of the synthetic inhibitor, MT 5 -MMP can activate progelatinase A efficiently in a TIMP 2 sensitive fashion. A preliminary screen for its potential substrates among extracellular matrix components identified the proteoglycans as the preferred substrates for MT 5 -MMP. Furthermore, it is determined that the stability of purified MT 5 -MMP is temperature dependent with rapid destruction at 37 °C, but being relatively stable at temperatures 4 °C or lower. These observations establish MT 5 -MMP as a proteoglycanase with a short <b>half-life</b> at body <b>temperature,</b> which may be critical for tightly controlled turnover of ECM components such as those in the brain...|$|R

Both the lateral movement of the adsorbed molecules about the surface and the transport of nanoparticles was {{the goal of this}} work. Thus, particularly suited photoswitchable molecules were designed towards this end. To achieve a lateral movement of the molecules on the surface an azobenzene moiety was spanned between two TATA platforms parallel to the surface. Two different molecules were synthesized which could both be switched to high percentage (> 95 %) to the corresponding cis configuration and several switching cycles show no fatigue or decay. For the realization of an artificial ciliated epithelium an imine-functionalized monolayer on a Au(111) surface was developed. Therefore, six imine-functionalized TATA platforms were synthesized and their photochemical properties were investigated in solution. The cis isomers could be accumulated upon irradiation with 365 nm up to 50 %, which was verified by low temperature 1 H NMR and UV/vis spectroscopy (215 - 233 K). Rate constants for the back isomerization were determined for several temperatures and hence, the <b>half-life</b> at room <b>temperature</b> could be extrapolated as t 1 / 2 = 0. 58 s. The formation of highly ordered monolayers was confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and UV/vis measurements of these surfaces showed the integrity of the photoswitchable unit.

These heterodiazocines exhibit outstanding photochemical properties whereas the synthesis is simplified with respect to the parent diazocines. Hence, a new approach for the synthesis of unsymmetric diazocines was developed. Moreover, these diazocines can be efficiently switched with light in the near infrared region which opens up applications as in vivo photoswitchable drugs and functional materials...|$|R

The most prominent bacterial cell type for each consortium was isolated in a serial dilutions test, and a substrate utilization profile was obtained for each using the Biolog Microstation System. Each bacterial community was tested {{for its ability to}} degrade sulfur heterocycles (benzothiophene: BT, 3 -methyl-benzothiophene: 3 -MBT, and dibenzothiophene: DBT), a nitrogen heterocycle (carbazole: CARB), and an oxygen heterocycle (dibenzofuran: DBF). Incubations were carried out at an optimum temperature for culture (25 °C) and at a temperature more typical of a northern environment (4 °C). Degradation of the compounds was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and degradation products were identified using GC-MS and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Bacterial growth was monitored using optical density measurements to determine the dry weight (μg) of cells/mL and the number of colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL). The 2 -ringed heterocycles were degraded faster and {{to a greater extent than}} the 3 -ringed compounds. Degradation of BT was not statistically different from that for 3 -MBT and, likewise, a comparison of the 3 -ringed heterocycles showed no significant differences in degradability at either incubation temperature. There was a significant difference in degradation of the compounds at the two incubation temperatures as biodegradation was 3 to 5 times greater at 25 °C than at 4 °C. Statistical examination revealed that no one culture demonstrated a significantly greater ability to degrade the 5 heterocycles studied which means that the bacterial consortium isolated from a beach in Bonne Bay, NF., where the sediments exhibited no visible signs of hydrocarbon contamination, demonstrated the ability to degrade the heterocyles as efficiently as bacterial communities from visibly contaminated soils at Come by Chance and Port aux Basques, NF.

The highly acidic arenium ion protonated unreacted starting 1, a reaction that could be supressed by the addition of water, and gave the neutral species 2 (t). Octahedral complex 2 (t) was induced to reductively couple, with two five-membered rings coupling to give square planar complex 5 containing a nine-membered ring. The crystal structure of 5 showed the nine-membered ring to span trans across the square planar metal accompanied by considerable distortion: the P–Pt–N bond angle is 155. 48 (5) °. Oxidation of 5 with PhICl 2 resulted in the addition of two chlorides and a change of the nine-membered ring ligand coordination to cis at an octahedral centre, still with considerable distortions: the P–Pt–N bond angle in the crystal structure of 6 is 99. 46 (5) °.

40|$|A local {{integrated}} {{pulp and}} paper Kraft mill had come {{under pressure from the}} local communities and mill personnel to reduce the odours that were perceived to be generated at the Farm Dams and irrigation farm situated adjacent to the mill. The typical odours associated with Kraft mills are due to the generation of four reduced sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), methyl-mercaptan (CH 3 SH), dimethyl-sulphide (CH 3) 2 S and dimethyl-disulphide (CH 3) 2 S 2. These compounds are collectively referred to as Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) components which are generated {{as a direct result of}} the Kraft pulping and chemical recovery process. These components can either be in the gaseous or aqueous phase depending on the characteristics of the effluent. Gaseous and aqueous TRS profiling of the mill indicated that hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) was the main odour component generated and emitted from the Clarifiers and the Treated Effluent Transfer Sump (TETS) at the effluent treatment plant. The hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) emission levels were affected by process upsets, sludge removal frequencies, chemical composition of the effluent, Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) activity, pH and temperature fluctuations. Treatment options such as pH control using slaked lime, dosing of biocides, addition of biomodifiers and/or a sulphate reduction inhibitor were investigated. The use of slaked lime, Ca(OH) 2, for pH control was not practical due to continuous pH fluctuations, increasing the pH would increase the scaling tendencies of the effluent and would also affect the soil cation-anion exchange properties of the irrigated farm land. The use of non-oxidising biocides was effective in reducing SRB activity between 99. 2 % and 99. 8 % at dosages between 4 mg/l and 25 mg/l. However, the use of biocides was not considered as a long term treatment option due to the various disadvantages such as the stability of the biocides at fluctuating pH and <b>temperatures,</b> <b>half-life,</b> environmental accumulation, toxicity and costs. The aqueous H 2 S level was reduced by 79 % using different combinations of biomodifiers (nitrates, nitrites, molybdenum). Increasing the dosages of the biomodifiers (> 500 mg/l) would be required to increase the reduction of H 2 S levels by more than 79 %. The increased dosages would significantly increase the cost of the treatment programme. The accumulation of nitrates, nitrites and molybdenum could affect the soil texture, cation-anion exchange capacity, permeability, Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) and nutrient availability. A more environmentally friendly and cost effective treatment was found using sodium nitrate (biomodifier) together with AQ (sulphate reduction inhibitor). The continuous dosing of 50 mg/l sodium nitrate together with 4 mg/l AQ would be effective in reducing the average aqueous H 2 S levels (40 mg/l) by at least 92 %. This treatment would also be compatible with aeration or oxidation procedures to further increase the removal of H 2 S to achieve an aqueous H 2 S level of < 1 mg/l. Aeration or oxidation would also increase the dissolved oxygen and COD levels, increase the inhibition of SRB activity and oxidise any reduced sulphur. The dosing of sodium nitrate and AQ to control the generation of H 2 S is not patented in South Africa. It can, therefore, be used to treat the Kraft mill effluent without violating any intellectual property rights in South Africa. Dissertation (MSc(Applied Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Nona-alkanoyloxy tribenzocyclononene (CTV-n, where n is {{the number}} of carbons in the side chains) were {{prepared}} for n = 2 to 14. The homologues of this series appear in two stable isomeric forms, rigid crown and flexible saddle. We report on their isomerization equilibria and dynamics in solution and on their mesomorphic properties in the neat state. The crown-saddle equilibrium and interconversion kinetics of the CTV- 8 isomers were studied in dimethyl formamide solutions using high-resolution 1 H NMR in the temperature range from 50 to 130 °C. At lower temperatures, the isomerization is too slow to measure. In this range the equilibrium saddle fraction increases from ∼ 0. 40 to ∼ 0. 65, whereas the isomerization rate increases from ∼ 10 - 4 to ∼ 1 s- 1. The saddle isomer undergoes fast pseudorotation at room temperature, but below about − 50 °C, it becomes slow enough to affect the NMR line width. The rate parameters for this process were estimated from the carbon- 13 spectra in methylene chloride solutions to be, kp(− 100 °C) ≈ 1. 7 × 103 s- 1 and Ea ≈ 9. 6 kJ/mol. The slow crown-saddle isomerization at room <b>temperature</b> (<b>half-life</b> of about one year) allows quantitative separation (by chromatography) of the two isomers and their separate investigation. When the alkanoyloxy side chains are sufficiently long both isomers are mesogenic (n ≥ 4 for the saddle and n ≥ 5 for the crown), exhibiting hexagonal columnar mesophases. The structure, dynamics, and mesomorphic properties of these mesophase were investigated by X-ray diffraction, optical polarizing microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and NMR. The lattice parameters of the crown and saddle mesophases of corresponding homologues are almost identical and increase monotonically with increasing length of the side chains. The clearing temperatures of the saddle isomers are consistently lower than those of the corresponding crowns. Within each series, the clearing temperatures are almost independent of the length of the side chains (156 to 170 °C for the crown and 115 to 148 °C for the saddle). The thermal and kinetic properties of the neat compounds lead to peculiar phase sequences, as observed in the polarizing microscope and in the DSC thermogram, involving repeated, back and forth, interconversion between the two isomers. Carbon- 13 MAS NMR measurements of the crown and saddle mesophases of several homologues were carried out. The spectra of the crown mesophase exhibit dynamic features consistent with planar 3 -fold molecular jumps about the column axes. A quantitative analysis for the CTV- 8 crown homologue yielded the following Arrhenius parameters, A = 3. 1 × 1022 s- 1 and Ea = 130. 1 kJ/mol. These unusually high values suggest that the barrier to the jump process is temperature dependent, decreasing with increasing temperature. The rate of this 3 -fold jump process is slower for the lower homologues and faster for the higher ones. In contrast, the saddle isomers in the mesophase do not show dynamic effects in their carbon- 13 MAS spectra. They do not undergo pseudorotation, and it appears that the molecules remain locked within the columns in a saddle conformation, up to the clearing temperature. However, on (super-) cooling to room temperature and below, selective line broadening is observed in their carbon- 13 MAS spectra. This suggests that the saddle conformation is twisted in the mesophase and undergoes fast high-amplitude jumps between the twisted forms. On cooling, these high-amplitude librations freeze out to give an orientationally disordered state. On a very long time scale (of the order of days at 100 °C), the saddle mesophase transforms into that of the crown, apparently by sublimation...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{applications}} of foamed bitumen technology in pavement construction in various {{places around the}} world, there are still several aspects about this technology that are not clear. In addition, knowledge on foamed bitumen technology is mainly empirical and lacks scientific basis. This study addresses some of the aspects for foamed bitumen technology such as: Investigation of any effects in binder composition during the production process for foamed bitumen; assessment {{of the effect of}} bitumen source on foamed bitumen characteristics; development of a rational method to optimise foamed bitumen characteristics and conditions; evaluation of aggregate particle coating within foamed bitumen mixes; further improvements in the mix design procedure specifically the method of compaction and optimum bitumen content determination stages are suggested.  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate any changes in bitumen composition after the production process of foamed bitumen. Fourier transform infrared tests were done on foamed bitumen and neat bitumen specimens for two bitumens with similar penetration grades. Foamed bitumen characteristics of three bitumens were established by producing foamed bitumen at temperatures of 150 ºC up to 180 ºC and foamant water contents of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 %. From the analysis of variation of foamed bitumen characteristics (maximum expansion ratio and <b>half-life)</b> at different <b>temperatures</b> a new method based on the equi-viscous bitumen temperature to optimize foamed bitumen conditions and characteristics was proposed. Rice density and surface energy concepts were used to evaluate aggregate particle coating with foamed bitumen. A granite aggregate divided into three different size fractions and three sets of foamed bitumen produced from three bitumen penetration grades were used. A gyratory laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen was established using the modified locking concept. Three laterite gravels with different chemical composition were mixed with foamed bitumen produced from one penetration bitumen grade. The resulting mixes were compacted up to 200 gyrations and the corresponding compaction curve defined in terms of height versus number of gyrations noted. In addition, the optimum moisture content requirements at the modified locking point were determined. 3 D packing theory concepts, primary aggregate structure porosity and an indirect tensile strength criteria were employed to determine optimum bitumen content for foamed bitumen mixes.   Fourier infrared techniques revealed that foaming did not cause any changes in the bitumen chemistry, implying that the foamed bitumen production process may possibly be a physical process. Characterisation of foamed bitumen produced from three bitumen penetration grades showed that foamed bitumen characteristics (maximum expansion ratio and half-life) were mainly influenced by binder viscosity rather than the source. The equi-viscous temperature seemed to provide a suitable criterion at which foamed bitumen with optimum characteristics could be produced. Rice density results showed that aggregate size fraction, binder expansion ratio and viscosity influenced aggregate particle coating. For the coarser aggregate fraction, results revealed that binder coating seemed to be mainly influenced by temperature. Whilst for fine aggregate fraction the coating was mainly influenced by surface area. Surface energy results revealed that foamed bitumen exhibited better coating attributes than neat bitumen. A new laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen based on the modified locking point was developed. The modified locking point represents the state at which maximum aggregate particle interlock occurs when mixes are compacted in the field. It is based on the iii analysis of the rate of change for the gyratory compaction curve. The compaction curve in this case is defined in terms of compaction height versus number of gyrations. Gradation analysis beyond the modified locking point showed that aggregate particle breakdown occurred. Analysis of the optimum moisture at the modified locking point revealed that the moisture conditions were less than the aggregate optimum moisture conditions. It is recommended that this point be used to determine the optimal compaction characteristics of foamed bitumen mixes.  Aggregate structure porosity and an indirect tensile strength criteria can be used to determine the bitumen content {{that could be used in}} design of foamed bitumen mixes. This would reduce the amount of resources required since the bitumen content could be estimated prior to carrying out the actual laboratory work given that the aggregate grading is known. The aggregate structure can be divided (based on 3 D packing theory) into oversize, primary, and secondary structures. The primary structure is mostly responsible for carrying loads whilst the secondary structure fills the voids within the primary structure and provides support to the primary structure. The aggregate size particles constituting the primary structure are deduced as a function of standard sieve sizes using the packing theory concepts. The minimum sieve size for the primary structure is proposed as 1 mm. The oversize structure consists of aggregate particles whose size is greater than the maximum size for the primary structure. The secondary structure consists of aggregate particles whose size is below the minimum size for the primary structure. The primary aggregate structure porosity can be used to establish the starting bitumen content; the bitumen content at which this porosity is 50 % is chosen as the initial bitumen content. Indirect tensile strength values corresponding to 50 % primary porosity are determined as well as the bitumen contents and compared against the recommended minimum values. QC 20161012 </p...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivos: i) quantificar e caracterizar as enzimas α-galactosidase e poligalacturonase (PG) em sementes de D. nigra, ii) verificar a composição e a alteração dos açúcares que compõem a parede celular e a fração péctica dos tegumentos das sementes durante a germinação. As sementes foram colocadas para embeber em água por 168 horas, sendo retiradas amostras para a caracterização bioquímica e cinética da enzima. A atividade da enzima α-galactosidase aumentou com a embebição nos dois compartimentos, embora não estivesse presente inicialmente no eixo embrionário de sementes secas. O pH de máxima atividade foi de 5, 5 para ambos os compartimentos. A temperatura que mais estimulou a atividade nos cotilédones foi de 50 °C e de 50 a 60 °C no eixo embrionário. A enzima mostrou-se termotolerante, mas não foi possível determinar a meia-vida na temperatura de 40 °C, no período de 10 horas. A atividade da α-galactosidase foi inibida por &# 946;-mercaptoetanol e CuSO 4 em ambos os compartimentos. A lactose e o cloreto de sódio estimularam a atividade tanto nos cotilédones como no eixo embrionário. Os valores de KM para o eixo embrionário e cotilédones foram de 0, 239 e 0, 228 mM, respectivamente. A enzima α-galactosidase está presente nas sementes de Dalbergia nigra e sua atividade específica aumenta durante o período de germinação. A atividade da PG foi detectada a partir do primeiro dia de embebição, tanto nos cotilédones como no eixo embrionário. A atividade máxima nos cotilédones foi detectada no segundo dia e, no eixo, no sexto dia de embebição. A variação no teor de proteínas foi significativa ao longo do tempo nos cotilédones e no eixo. A atividade de PG foi máxima nas temperaturas de 60 °C nos cotilédones e de 55 a 60 °C no eixo embrionário. O pH 4, 0 foi o de maior atividade da enzima para ambos os compartimentos. O KM foi de 5, 08 e de 4, 39 mM para os cotilédones e o eixo, respectivamente. O Vmax foi de 0, 026 mM min- 1 para cotilédones e de 0, 024 mM min- 1 para eixo embrionário. Nos tegumentos, a atividade específica da PG foi máxima no terceiro dia. O teor de proteína se reduziu a partir da embebição. A atividade de PG foi máxima nas temperaturas de 40 a 50 °C. O pH de maior atividade da enzima ficou na faixa de 3 a 7. O KM e o Vmax foram de 1, 34 mM e 0, 012 &# 956;mol min- 1, respectivamente. Verificou-se que a {{galactose}} é o principal componente da pectina, seguida pela manose. Na parede celular, o principal componente foi a arabinose, seguida pela xilose. Com base nos resultados, conclui-se que as enzimas α-galactosidase e PG atuam durante a germinação das sementes de Dalbergia nigra. This work {{aimed to}} study the enzymes α-galactosidase and polygalacturonase and to verify the composition and the alteration of the cell wall sugars and the pectic component in the teguments of D. nigra seeds during the germination. The seeds were submitted to water imbibition for 168 hours. Samples of seeds were taken for the biochemical and kinetic characterization of the enzymes. Activity of the enzyme α- galactosidase increased with the imbibition, {{although it was not}} present initially in the embryonic axis of dry seeds. The maximum activity was obtained at ph 5. 5 to both compartments. In the cotyledon the activity of the enzyme was higher at temperature of 50 °C, and in the embryonic axis it was between 50 and 60 °C. The enzyme was tolerant to temperature, but {{it was not possible to}} determine its <b>half-life</b> at the <b>temperature</b> of 40 °C, in the period of 10 hours. The activity of the α-galactosidase was inhibited by &# 946;- mercaptoethanol and CuSO 4 in both compartments, the lactose and the sodium chloride stimulated the activity in the cotyledons and in the embryonic axis. The KM values for the embryonic axis and cotyledons were respectively 0, 239 and 0, 228 mM. The α-galactosidase is present in the seeds of Dalbergia nigra and its specific activity increases during the germination period. Activity of PG was detected from the first day of imbibition, in the cotyledons and in the embryonic axis. Maximum activity in the cotyledons was detected in the second day and in the axis in the sixth day of soaking. The variation in the proteins content was significant along the time in the cotyledons and in the axis. The activity of PG was maximal at the temperature of 60 °C in the cotyledons and in the embryonic axis the maximal activity was observed in a range of temperatures from 55 to 60 °C. The activity of the enzyme was higher at pH 4, 0 to all compartments. The KM was 5, 08 and 4, 39 mM for the cotyledons and axis, respectively. Vmax was 0, 026 mM min- 1 in the cotyledon enzyme and 0, 024 mM min- 1 for embryonic axis enzyme. In the teguments, activity of PG was maximal in the third day. The protein content reduced along the imbibition period. The activity of PG was maximal temperatures ranging from 40 to 50 °C. The pH of higher activity to this enzyme was obtained from pH 3 until pH 7, 0. The KM and Vmax were 1, 34 mM and 0, 012 µmol min- 1, respectively. It was verified that the galactose is the main component of the pectin, followed by the mannose. Arabinose was the most abundant component in the cell wall, followed by xylose. Based on the results, we can conclude that the enzymes α-galactosidase and PG are acting during the germination of Dalbergia nigra seeds...|$|R
