40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia {{in pregnancy}} can have serious deleterious effects for {{both mother and}} fetus. Estimates of prevalence vary widely, but those based on hemoglobin determinations are always considerably higher than those based on ferritin, emphasizing {{the need for a}} full hematological work-up in diagnosis. Intravenous therapy usually results in a more rapid increase in hemoglobin and iron stores, but unresolved concerns of possible teratogenicity mean that it should not be used in the first trimester, while cost considerations make it a second choice to oral treatment in the second trimester where this is feasible and effective, except in severe anemia where a more rapid response is desirable. On the other hand, intravenous administration is the first choice treatment in the third trimester and postpartum. All the available intravenous iron preparations are similar in molecular composition, but the exact nature of the complex determines the molecular weight and particle size, which to a large extent determine the properties of the preparation. All are effective and relatively safe, but the higher molecular weight <b>iron</b> <b>dextrans</b> are associated with a greater number of adverse events, and there are concerns about iron toxicity with ferric gluconate. It seems that a degree of expertise and experience and rigorous adherence to protocols and precautions may be required for their safe and effective use...|$|R
40|$|According to Seno et al. it is {{said that}} when a small of the {{so-called}} "asparagine iron" preparated by mixing asparagine and Fecl 3 in a proper proportion, is instillated into vein, reticulocytes (RC) decrease markedly in number within a few hours. Such a change in the number of RC without any cocurrent change in the amount of Hb is understood to be due to the maturation of young RC, but its mechanism has remained still unclarified. However, it is easy to understand that this phenomenon will be dependent upon the accelerative action of iron on the hemoglobin synthesis, with the purpose to elucidate such a mechanism the author carried out experiments to find out whether or not there are some other substances possessing the action identical with "Asparagine iron", and obtained the following results: It has been found that serum iron colleid prepared by mixing FeCl(3) with serum and also the "ferritrat" from Nordmark in Germany both possess the action similar to that of asparagine iron. Namely, when 0. 25 mg/kg. of either one of these substances is instillated into vein as ferric iron, within 2 to 3 hours reticulocytes decrease one half to one tenth of the original number.

40|$|Background. Reliable {{information}} on the incidence of severe reactions to <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> is limited. Administration of agents of resuscitation in acute anaphylaxis {{may serve as a}} marker to quantify life-threatening adverse drug reactions. Methods. To determine the incidence of the most serious reactions to intravenous (i. v.) <b>iron</b> <b>dextran,</b> we searched the Gambro Healthcare US medical database for evidence of same-day administration of both i. v. <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> and parenteral adrenaline, corticosteroids or antihistamines. We confirmed each case as an <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> sensitivity reaction by direct inquiry. We also determined the total reported number of suspected adverse <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> reactions. Results. During the 16 month study period, we determined that 1 066 099 doses of i. v. <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> were given to 48 509 patients, including 20 213 patients who had not previously received <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> (<b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> naı̈ve). We identified seven patients who experienced reactions requiring resuscitative agents, all in response to a test dose (five patients) or first therapeutic dose (two patients), and therefore all in the iron-naı̈ve (incident) group. Thus, we found the incidence of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> reactions requiring resusci-tative agents to be 0. 035 % (7 out of 20 213). No reaction was fatal. In a combined group of incident and prevalent patients, we found 337 total reports of suspected adverse reactions to <b>iron</b> <b>dextran,</b> without regard to severity of reaction, yielding an overall per patient adverse drug event (ADE) rate of 0. 69 % (337 out of 48 509) and per exposure rate of 0. 03 % (337 out of 1 066 099).

With these NF membranes, <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> was almost completely rejected, while salt rejection {{was so small}} (R(obs) approximate to - 2 to 1. 5 %) that salt ions could pass through the membranes easily. No irreversible fouling was found for each membrane used and a distinct transmembrane pressure (TMP) drop appeared during diafiltration at a flux of 15. 5 Lm(- 2) h(- 1) (20 degrees C). And the weakening of concentration polarization (CP) of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> {{was thought to be}} the possible reason for TMP drop. It was found that with the decrease of salt concentration, the viscosity of solution decreased, thus enhancing the back transport of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> molecules.

40|$|Sodium ferric {{gluconate}} {{complex in}} hemodialysis patients: Adverse reactions compared to placebo and <b>iron</b> <b>dextran.</b> BackgroundParenteral iron is often required by hemodialysis patients to maintain adequate iron stores. Until recently, the only available form of intravenous iron was <b>iron</b> <b>dextran,</b> which {{is associated with}} significant adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and death. Sodium ferric gluconate complex (SFGC) was recently approved {{for use in the}} U. S. under FDA's priority drug review. This Phase IV study was designed to evaluate the safety of a single dose of intravenous SFGC as compared to placebo and a historical <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> control. MethodsThis multicenter, crossover, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled prospective comparative study was performed in hemodialysis patients requiring at least 125 mg of elemental iron. The historical control was obtained from a meta-analysis of four publications examining outcomes in patients exposed to <b>iron</b> <b>dextran.</b> SFGC naïve patients were administered SFGC without a test dose, undiluted, at a rate of 125 mg over 10 minutes, and compared to placebo comprising bacteriostatic saline. ResultsA total of 2534 patients were enrolled. The incidence of drug intolerance (an adverse event precluding re-exposure) was significantly less [0. 44 %, confidence interval (CI) 0. 21 to 0. 71 %] after SFGC as compared to the <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> control (2. 47 %, CI 1. 87 to 3. 07 %, P < 0. 0001), but higher than after placebo (0. 1 %, P = 0. 02). There was no difference found between SFGC and placebo in serious adverse events. A single life-threatening event occurred after SFGC (0. 04 %, CI 0. 00 to 0. 22 %), which was significantly less than following <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> (0. 61 %, CI 0. 36 to 0. 86 %), P = 0. 0001. ConclusionSFGC is well tolerated when given by intravenous push without a test dose. SFGC has a significantly lower incidence of drug intolerance and life-threatening events as compared to previous studies using <b>iron</b> <b>dextran.</b> The routine use of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> in hemodialysis patients should be discontinued...|$|E

Following results were obtained. 1) In the sideroblast staining of the patients with Banti's disease, the grade of appearence of the iron granules in the erythroblasts revealed considerably lower level than that in the healthy persons. In comparison with normal healthy persons, Fe(55) uptake into the erythroblasts in the patients with Banti's disease was markedly increased in vitro and to show that Fe(55) was uptaken by {{almost all of the}} erythroblasts and most of cells revealed moderate to markedly high uptake.

While, radioautographically, Fe(55) uptake into the erythroblasts clearly showed to be decreased in the same splenectomised case. In the oral administration of the iron (ferrous gluconate 1 to 2 g per day) for 3 months, appearance of type Ⅰ and Ⅱ of the sideroblasts was observed to remarkably high grade and Fe(55) uptake into the erythroblasts showed to be decreased.

Microparticles were characterized by iron content and release profile at gastrointestinal in vitro pigs' conditions. NHIM-B was selected and blended with HIM (oral iron supplement). Neonatal pigs (n = 66) were supplemented with 200 mg of injectable <b>dextran</b> <b>iron</b> on d 2 of life (parenteral group; n = 22), with 126 mg oral iron supplement on d 2 and 8 (oral I; n = 22), or with 84 mg oral iron supplement on d 2, 8, and 14 (oral II; n = 22). Red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), and serum ferritin (SF) were determined. The Hb content of the oral I group was lower (8. 3. 1. 3 g/dL) than the parenteral (10. 1. 1. 7 g/dL) and oral II (10. 2. 1. 4 g/dL) groups (P < 0. 05). Moreover, RBC, Ht, MCV, MCHC, and SF were altered in the oral I group, indicating iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia in piglets may be prevented by the administration of an oral encapsulated NHI/HI supplement (3 doses) presenting the same benefits as classical parenteral supplementationCONICYT Atraccion e Insercion de Capital Humano Avanzado en la Academia 	 7912010043 FONDECYT Iniciacion 	 1114024...|$|R
40|$|In the {{pathophysiological}} {{study on}} the iron-copper metabolism in idiopathic hypochromic anemia the author obtained the following results. 1. In the estimation {{of the contents of}} serum iron and copper in the patients with this disease it has been found that serum iron is markedly decreased while serum copper is normal, but showing a marked decrease in the iron-copper ratio. This indicates that in this disease there is a marked change in the iron metabolism while no marked change in the copper metabolism. 2. Iron absorption and intravenous iron injection tests show that this disease demands and utilizes iron actively, and that depending upon the kind of iron administered, the ironabsroption curve is not low, presenting hardly any difference from that of normal persons. In additon, when the change of the serum copper is estimated at the same time, it differs from that of normal persons in that it steadily maintains a certain fixed level. These findings are interpreted to be {{due to the fact that}} in the disease such as this which seem to demand iron actively and utilize it immediately as the material for hematopoiesis, a certain fixed amount of copper is always required in order that the hematopoiesis in the bone marrow may function smoothly. 3. There is no great difference in the amount of iron excreted in the urine of this disease as compared with that of normal person, so that it seems not necessary to consider the iron excretion as to be the cause of iron deficiency. Although copper excreted in the urine is somewhat greater than in the case of normal persons, it does not seen to have any significant influence from the standpoint of the copper metabolism. Consequently, the copper metabolism in this disease seems to be carried out rather normally and therefore, copper seems to play no important role directly inducing anemia. 4. In this disease when ACTH is administered intramuscularly, the serum iron content does not change and the serum copper content increases. The amount of iron excreted in the urine tends to decrease while that of copper tends to increase, proving that adrenocortical hormone affects the ironcopper metabolism in this disease. 5. When this disease is treated with <b>Dextran</b> <b>iron,</b> it has a therapeutic effect, and also showing peculiar changes in the contents of serum iron and copper at the time of anemia recovery, it has been confirmed that copper plays a role involving in the iron metabolism of anemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} in feed intake and growth rate that occurs following weaning is of major economic consequence to the pig industry. Currently, {{a range of}} antimicrobial products {{can be used to}} minimise the impact of weaning on piglet health and subsequent performance. However, the use of these products in pig diets is subject to increasing restriction worldwide because of perceived risks to public health and to the environment. Thus, alternative methods are required to mitigate the growth check that almost invariably occurs after weaning in most production systems. Piglets produced outdoors are claimed to experience less of a growth check at weaning {{and to be able to}} thrive in relatively unsophisticated weaner accommodation. However, these claims have not been substantiated under Western Australian conditions, nor a scientific basis for these claims established. Consequently, a series of experiments was designed to test the general hypothesis for this thesis – ‘the gut structure and function, and lifetime performance of the weaned pig are affected by its pre- and post-weaning rearing environments’. Experiment 1 was conducted in two parts to quantify differences in the growth performance, health and gut structure of weaner pigs produced indoors or outdoors and reared in conventional or deep-litter pens. The weaner diet in the first part of the experiment contained 100 ppm of olaquindox and 3, 000 ppm of zinc oxide (Exp 1 a). This experiment was repeated without using dietary antimicrobial products (Exp 1 b). Experiment 2 was conducted in conventional buildings to examine the effect of exposing piglets in lactation to similar substrates to those available to outdoor piglets used in Exp 1 a and Exp 1 b in the absence of other differences in the outdoor production milieu. Pre-weaning environments in Exp 1 a (indoor production (IP) and outdoor production (OP)) appeared to have little effect on gut structure and overall growth rate but significantly affected carcass composition, whereas post-weaning environments (conventional (C) or deep-litter (DL)) affected both overall growth rate and carcass composition. Although feed disappearance was similar, OP pigs grew faster than IP pigs in the first 47 d after weaning in Exp 1 a but not in Exp 1 b. Lifetime growth rate (GR), P 2 backfat, feed disappearance and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not significantly affected by the production environment in Exp 1 a whereas OP pigs grew slower with higher P 2 backfat and FCR in Exp 1 b. Interestingly, OP pigs had heavier carcass weights and higher dressing percentages than IP pigs in both parts of the experiment. The effects of post-weaning environment were more consistent as DL pigs grew faster, were fatter, and had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than C pigs. Villus height and crypt depth of IP and OP pigs were not different at 21 (weaning) or 28 d, but villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning. Pigs reared in C pens had greater faecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids than pigs in DL, indicating that the latter ingested sufficient straw to alter fermentation characteristics. In Experiment 2, there were no differences in gut structure or pre-weaning and lifetime GR of pigs offered no creep feed (NC), a commercial creep feed (CF) or an ‘outdoor’ mix (OM) comprising of 1 part straw, 5 parts sow feed and 25 parts of soil taken from paddocks in which OP pigs used in Exp 1 a and Exp 1 b were farrowed. However, NC pigs grew slower in the week after weaning than the other two treatments. Backfat and feed disappearance were similar for all treatments but pigs on the OM treatment had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than pigs on the NC and CF treatments. Villus height and crypt depth were not different between treatments and, although the piglets were weaned at 28 d, villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning to an extent similar to that experienced by piglets weaned at 21 d in Experiment 1. Although all piglets received intramuscular injections of 200 mg <b>iron</b> (Fe) <b>dextran</b> when 1 to 2 days old, piglets offered the OM during lactation had higher serum iron and blood haemoglobin (Hb) levels than those offered NC or CF. Furthermore, half the piglets offered NC or CF had Hb levels indicative of chronic Fe deficiency anaemia. The average parity of sows used in this experiment was 6. 3 litters, suggesting that piglets may have been born with low Fe stores, possibly because of low Fe stores in their dams due to sub-optimal mineral nutrition over successive parities. In summary, the findings from these experiments partly supported the general hypothesis for this thesis. Under the conditions of these experiments, access to outdoor substrates in lactation had little effect on gut structure and lifetime growth rate but increased both carcass weight and dressing percentage, whereas rearing in DL pens increased feed intake, FCR, growth rate, P 2 backfat, carcass weight and dressing percentage...|$|R
40|$|Anemia is a {{very common}} {{clinical}} problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. Erythropoietin is a hormone synthesized that is deficient {{in the majority of}} patients with advanced kidney disease, thereby predisposing these patients to anemia. The other cause of anemia is deficiency of iron. Iron deficiency anemia is common in people with CKD and its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is unquestioned, especially in those patients treated with erythropoietin. Intravenous iron is frequently used to treat anemia in CKD patients and is very efficacious in increasing hemoglobin {{but at the same time}} there are some safety issues associated with it. The objective of this review is to assess the frequency of adverse drug events associated with four different iron formulations: two <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> products known as high and low molecular weight <b>iron</b> <b>dextran,</b> iron sucrose, and sodium ferric gluconate complex. Several electronic databases were searched. In general, with the exception of high molecular weight <b>iron</b> <b>dextran,</b> serious or life-threatening adverse events appeared rare. Iron sucrose has the least reported adverse events and high molecular weight <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> has the highest number of reported adverse events.

40|$|Abstract. Serum immune complexes, plasma dextran {{antibodies}} {{and percentage}} conversion of complement have been measured in 20 dialysed patients {{before and after}} an intravenous infusion of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> providing 600 mg elemental iron. Complement conversion was unmeasurable {{and there were no}} changes in circulating immune complexes. The presence of dextran antibodies in nine patients before the infusion was not related to prior exposure to <b>iron</b> <b>dextran.</b> They became undetec-table in these patients within hours after the infusion, reappearing 1 month later in three. Two of three patients reporting mild aches and shivers on the day following the infusion had no detectable dextran anti-bodies. An adverse reaction involving inflamed joints occurred 1 - 2 days after a second infusion given to one of the patients studied above. The parameters under study were again measured and did not appear to relate to the reaction. The presence of dextran antibodies does not preclude the giving of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> to patients on dialysis, and the immune complex and complement systems remain undisturbed by <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> infusions...|$|E
40|$|To inform {{healthcare}} professionals {{of a rare}} serious reaction leading to leg amputation following intramuscular injection of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> and report comments for preventing such reactions. A case of leg amputation following intramuscular injection of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> reported to Iranian Pharmacovigilance Center was reviewed.

40|$|To {{establish}} the time-sequence relationship between ferritin accumulation and uroporphyrin crystal formation in livers of C 57 BL/ 10 mice, a biochemical, morphological and morphometrical study was performed. Uroporphyria was {{induced by the}} intraperitoneal administration of hexachlorobenzene plus <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> and of <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> alone. Uroporphyrin crystal formation started in hepatocytes of mice treated with hexachlorobenzene plus <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> at 2 weeks and in mice treated with <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> alone a 9 weeks. In the course of time, uroporphyrin crystals gradually increased in size. Uroporphyrin crystals were initially formed in hepatocytes in the periportal areas of the liver, in which also ferric iron staining was first detected. The amount {{and the distribution of}} the main storage form of iron in hepatocytes, ferritin, did not differ between the two treatment groups. Ferritin accumulation preceded the formation of uroporphyrin crystals in hepatocytes in both treatment groups. Moreover, uroporphyrin crystals were nearly always found close to ferritin iron. We conclude that uroporphyrin crystals are only formed in hepatocytes in which also iron (ferritin) accumulates.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of chelated iron supplementation on gestating and lactating sows and on their suckling and weaned piglets. Reproductive traits, piglet performance, hematological parameters, and the iron concentrations in colostrum, milk, and stillborn livers were measured. Ninety-six sows were subjected to one of three treatment groups. Group T 1 comprised pregnant and lactating sows treated with diets supplemented with inorganic iron (551 mg Fe/kg) and suckling piglets administered 200 mg of injectable <b>iron</b> <b>dextran.</b> Group T 2 was the same as T 1, except that sows after 84 days of gestation, lactating sows, and suckling piglets were fed a diet supplemented with 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron, and suckling piglets were administered injectable <b>iron</b> <b>dextran.</b> Group T 3 was the same as T 2 but without injectable <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> for suckling piglets. During the nursery phase, all of the weaned piglets were penned with their original groups or treatments and received isonutritive and isocaloric feeds. Piglets from the T 2 and T 3 groups also received an additional 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron via their feed. There were no differences among the treatments for reproductive traits or the iron concentrations in the colostrum, milk, or liver. The piglets that did not receive the injectable <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> showed the poorest performance during the pre-and post-weaning phases and showed the poorest hematological parameters of the suckling piglets. The chelated iron supplementation is insufficient to meet piglet demand. The <b>iron</b> <b>dextran</b> supply is necessary for suckling and weaned piglets...|$|E
