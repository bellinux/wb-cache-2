50|$|Unknown to {{the project}} initiators, this project coincided with {{the start of the}} post-World War II baby boom so the {{question}} of low fertility rates was not explored. The initial results showed enormous differences in birth outcomes between different classes in Britain - for example, the babies from mothers in the lowest social class were 70% more likely to be born dead than in the highest social class. The results from this survey influenced the decisions made when setting up the British National Health Service in 1948. The survey continued with a sample (which excluded illegitimate children and twins) of 5 362 of the children using regular follow-ups to explore the impact of a National Health Service on health and to <b>explore</b> <b>differences</b> in child development by factors like social class, health and education. As of 2016 it has continued and has itself developed into a study of ageing. The regularly updated information about this cohort also enables comparison with data from other longitudinal studies in Britain and elsewhere.|$|E
