50|$|The {{storage area}} at Wanuku Pampa {{includes}} 497 qullqas (storehouses) and 30 processing and administration buildings. The city {{may have been}} an extremely important redistributive center supplying the provincial villages of the area it administered with the products of other regions. Qollqas are constructed in rows and made of pirqa masonry, just as the residential districts. The groups of storehouses included: 1) a small zone of storehouses which may have held the stores, of the Sun, the state religion; 2) minor groups of single storehouses apparently devoted to special shrines or ceremonial activities; 3) an ill-defined section of buildings which may have held a wide variety of <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> for more immediate uses; and 4), the largest group, which was devoted to long-term storage of various food stuffs and other goods in technologically specialized facilities. Storage was very diverse among crops, for example, root crops were placed in the middle of layers of straw, bound into bales with rope and stored in rectangular structures, while maize was stored shelled, in large jars which were put in circular storehouses with stone floors. Highland root crops made up for 50-80% of the space, while maize made up for 5-7%.|$|E

40|$|Background: The neural {{substrates}} of olfactory {{working memory}} are unknown. We addressed {{the questions of}} whether olfactory working memory involves a verbal representation of the odor, or a sensory image of the odor, or both, {{and the location of}} the neural substrates of these processes. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activity in the brains of subjects who were remembering either nameable or unnameable odorants. We found a double dissociation whereby remembering nameable odorants was reflected in sustained activity in prefrontal language areas, and remembering unnameable odorants was reflected in sustained activity in primary olfactory cortex. Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest a novel dedicated mechanism in primary olfactory cortex, where odor information is maintained <b>in</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> to subserve ongoing tasks...|$|R

40|$|For the {{successful}} {{solution of the}} high-level waste (HLW) problem in Russia one {{must take into account}} such factors as the existence of the great volume of accumulated HLW, the large size and variety of geological conditions in the country, and the difficult economic conditions.

In this paper, the principal trends of geological investigation directed toward the solution of HLW disposal are considered. One urgent practical aim is the selection of sites in deep wells in regions where the HLW is now held <b>in</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>storage.</b> The aim of long-term investigations into HLW disposal is to evaluate geological prerequisites for regional HLW repositories...|$|R

The objectives of the model are cost minimization and minimization of risk from hazardous waste exposure.

40|$|Soybean leaves contain three {{proteins}} (the vegetative storage proteins or VSPs) that {{respond to}} nitrogen status and {{are believed to}} be involved <b>in</b> the <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> of nitrogen. One of these proteins, with a molecular mass of 94 kD and termed vsp 94, was microsequenced. Partial amino acid sequence indicated that vsp 94 was highly homologous to the lipoxygenase protein family. Further evidence that vsp 94 is a lipoxygenase was obtained by demonstrating that vsp 94 cross-reacted with a lipoxygenase antibody. Also, a lipoxygenase cDNA coding region was able to detect changes in an mRNA that closely parallel changes in vsp 94 protein levels resulting from alteration of nitrogen sinks. Extensive immunocytochemical data indicate that this vsp 94 /lipoxygenase is primarily expressed in the paraveinal mesophyll cells and is subcellularly localized in the vacuole. These observations are significant in that they suggest that plant lipoxygenases may be bifunctional proteins able to function enzymatically in the hydroperoxidation of lipids and also to serve a role <b>in</b> the <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> of nitrogen during vegetative growth...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Safe {{disposal}} of nuclear waste {{is a difficult}} problem. Long-term plans are to house nuclear waste permanently in underground facilities. In the near-term however, nuclear waste is stored <b>in</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> facilities at various sites around the country. Federal and state regulations require periodic inspection of these storage facilities to insure storage vessel integrity and verify inventory [1], [2]. Currently, personnel are required to enter the facility to check for leakage, spillage, and signs of deterioration. This procedure exposes personnel to elevated radiation levels and generates more waste material since protective garments must be disposed of as nuclear waste. Personnel exposure can be minimized {{by the use of}} an autonomous, mobile inspection robot. Such a robot remains in the facility and performs inspection continuously requiring little human intervention [3].

5000|$|Because {{the blocks}} were {{classified}} as mixed-level radioactive waste, including plutonium, Rockwell International was unable to store the blocks in the Nevada Test site. The Nevada Test Site {{did not have a}} permit to store mixed-level radioactive waste, so the blocks were left <b>in</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>storage</b> at Rocky Flats. Due to problems in production, many of the blocks did not harden correctly and eventually began to seep from the boxes causing large scale environmental contamination of the area. [...] The blocks, containing radioactive waste with a half-life of 24,000 years had failed in a year. Despite warnings by engineer Jim Stone that the blocks would most likely fail earlier than expected, the blocks were still produced.
