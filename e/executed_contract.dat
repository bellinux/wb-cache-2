40|$|Rationalising the {{doctrine}} of anticipatory breach is notoriously difficult.

Beliefs of individual agents change through interaction with participant agents and are reflected in their on-going relationships. An understanding of business relationships is fundamental to understanding trade between both human agents in traditional markets and software agents in electronic markets. Two parties in the market establish agreement for mutual beneficial deals or contracts and therefore execute that deal or contract. Contextual information e. g., constraints, preferences, deadlines etc., during execution of the contract are unknown to each of the parties while they established the contract. Deviations between signed contract and <b>executed</b> <b>contract</b> are observed and used to measure the strength of relationship between two parties. We have presented an E-Market framework to describe how Institution Agent can assist for mining Outcome of Contract Execution by observing Argumentation Dialogues to determine how business relationship develops and evolves.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{difficulties}} associated with the drafting of the Property Agents and Motor Dealers Act 2000 (Qld) (‘the Act’) is the operation of s 365. If the requirements imposed by this section concerning {{the return of the}} <b>executed</b> <b>contract</b> are not complied with, the buyer and the seller will not be bound by the relevant contract and the cooling-off period will not commence. In these circumstances, it is clear that a buyer’s offer may be withdrawn. However, the drafting of the Act creates a difficulty in that the ability of the seller to withdraw from the transaction prior to the parties being bound by the contract is not expressly provided by s 365. On one view, if the buyer is able to withdraw an offer at any time before receiving the prescribed contract documentation the seller also should not be bound by the contract until this time, notwithstanding that the seller may have been bound at common law. However, an alternative analysis is that the legislative omission to provide the seller with a right of withdrawal may be deliberate given the statutory focus on buyer protection. If this analysis were correct the seller would be denied the right to withdraw from the transaction after the contract was formed at common law (that is, after the seller had signed and the fact of signing had been communicated to the buyer) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{declarative}} language for compositional specification of contracts governing {{the exchange of}} resources. It extends Eber and Peyton Jones’s declarative language for specifying financial contracts [JE 03] to the exchange of money, goods and services amongst multiple parties, and it complements McCarthy’s Resources, Events and Agents (REA) accounting model [McC 82] with a view-independent formal contract model that supports definition of user-defined contracts, automatic monitoring under execution, and user-definable analysis of their state before, during and after execution. We provide several realistic examples of commercial contracts and their analyses. A variety of (real) contracts can be expressed in such a fashion as to support their integration, management and analysis in an operational environment that registers events. The language design is driven by both domain considerations and semantic language design methods: A contract denotes a set of traces of events, {{each of which is}} an alternative way of concluding the contract successfully, which gives rise to a CSP-style [BHR 84,Hoa 85] denotational semantics. The denotational semantics drives the development of a sound and complete small-step operational semantics, where a partially <b>executed</b> <b>contract</b> is represented as a (full) contract that represents the remaining contractual commitments. This operational semantics is then systematically refined in two stages to an instrumented operational semantics that reflects the bookkeeping practice of identifying the specific contractual commitment a particular event matches at the time the event occurs, as opposed to delaying this matching until the contract is concluded. ...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{projects}} are increasingly complex, resulting in complex contract documents. Complex construction can likewise result in complex disputes. Disputes is inevitable in construction projects which predominantly arise from complexity {{and magnitude of}} works, multiple prime contracting parties, poorly prepared and/ or <b>executed</b> <b>contract</b> documents, inadequate planning, financial issues and communication problems. Any of these factors can overturn a project and lead to complicated litigation, arbitration, mediation, time overrun, increased costs and a relationship break down among members of different parties involved. The objectives {{of this study are}} to identify the root causes of construction disputes as well as their impact on client’s organization. The methodology of study adopted was through questionnaire survey where the target respondents were clients, consultants and contractors. Based on the analyzed data, there are nine root causes of construction disputes caused by clients, five root causes caused by consultants and four root causes caused by contractors have been identified in the local construction industry. The impact of construction disputes in client’s organization as found in the study are time consuming, cost effective, loss of reputation and sour relationship between stakeholders and also loss of profit and business validity. ADRs were observed as the best method of resolving disputes because they were identified as none time consuming and cost effective. From the findings it can be concluded that construction disputes are a cause of concern in every project and the solution to this problem is to avoid and cautiously manage them for smooth running of construction process, prevention is believed is better than cure...|$|E

30|$|In {{our basic}} scenario, the {{decision}} model suggests aligning process variant 4 against the master process (Table  4). The submission of end customer information for those brokers who personally <b>execute</b> <b>contract</b> changes is then only possible in electronic form. The standardization of process variant 4 increases the risk-adjusted expected NPV {{of the process}} cash flows, because the positive effects on customer satisfaction and on the cost advantages of the electronic submission exceed the negative effects on the process demand. Relatively to the second best process variant profile of complete individuality, representing the broker pool’s status quo prior to BPS, the objective function increases by about 21, 018 EUR. Serving the fourth process context by the master process instead of the respective process variant reduces the context-specific demand by 5  % (Table  3, line 2), whereas the demand trend increases only marginally. As a result, the cumulative demand is larger for the status quo than for the standardization of process variant 4. However, the standardization directly increases the average profit margin of this context by 25  % (Table  3, lines 1 and 5). The cost advantages even accelerate over time due to experience curve effects. The net effect of the reduced process demand and the increased profit margin is positive and justifies the elimination of paper-based submission for brokers who personally <b>execute</b> <b>contract</b> changes.|$|R
