The museum appraised the sculptures at over $200,000. However, the sculptures ended up being destroyed because, according to Trump, there were <b>general</b> <b>hazard</b> concerns, expense, and a possible 10-day construction delay due to the difficulty of removing them. The Met's curator, Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, caught a cab to the building site and attempted to pay the workmen for the sculptures, but was rebuffed. The building's decorative grille, supposedly transported to a New Jersey warehouse, was never recovered. Instead the sculptures and grilles were scrapped, and several days later, Trump stated that he had ordered the destruction himself. Later in 1980, he boasted that the decor of his Grand Hyatt New York included [...] "real art, not like the junk I destroyed at Bonwit Teller". The New York Times condemned Trump's actions as [...] "esthetic vandalism", and a spokesman for Mayor Ed Koch said Trump had failed his [...] "moral responsibility to consider the interests {{of the people of the}} city". Scutt was outraged by the destruction, having initially hoped to incorporate the goddess sculptures into the new building's lobby design; Trump had rejected the plan, preferring something [...] "more contemporary". Robert Miller, the gallery owner who had appraised the pieces, lamented that such things would [...] "never be made again", and Peter M. Warner, a researcher who worked across the street, called the destruction [...] "regrettable". However, Trump later said that he used the notoriety of that act to advertise more residential units in the tower.|$|E

5000|$|The {{characteristics}} of coastal environments, however, pose some great challenges to human habitation. Coastlines are highly dynamic natural systems that interact with terrestrial, marine and atmospheric processes and undergo continuous change {{in response to}} these processes. Over the years, human society has often failed to recognize the hazards related to these dynamics [...] and this has led to major disasters and societal disruption to various degrees. Even today, coastal development is often taking place with little regard to the hazards present in these environments, although climate change is likely to increase the <b>general</b> <b>hazard</b> levels. Societal activities in coastal areas can also pose a hazard to the natural balance of coastal systems, thereby disrupting e.g. sensitive ecosystems and subsequently human livelihood.|$|E
50|$|Stevens {{was born}} in Newport, Rhode Island on June 9, 1842, the son of Isaac I. Stevens and Margaret Hazard Stevens. In 1854, his father became the first {{governor}} of the new Washington Territory and the Stevens family moved to Olympia, Washington. Both father and son volunteered in the Union army during the Civil War and served in the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry. Hazard Stevens was a major and assistant adjutant <b>general.</b> <b>Hazard</b> was wounded and his father, by then a general, {{was killed in the}} Battle of Chantilly on September 1, 1862. For his contribution to the capture of Fort Huger, Virginia, on April 19, 1863, Stevens received the Medal of Honor on June 13, 1894. Stevens was mustered out of the Union Army volunteers on September 19, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Stevens for appointment to the brevet grade of brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from April 2, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on March 12, 1866.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We study {{indifference}} pricing {{of mortality}} contingent claims in a fully stochastic model. We assume both stochastic {{interest rates and}} stochastic hazard rates governing the population mortality. In this setting we compute the indifference price charged by an insurer that uses exponential utility and sells k contingent claims to k independent but homogeneous individuals. Throughout {{we focus on the}} examples of pure endowments and temporary life annuities. We begin with a continuous-time model where we derive the linear pdes satisfied by the indifference prices and carry out extensive comparative statics. In particular, we show that the price-per-risk grows as more contracts are sold. We then also provide a more flexible discrete-time analogue that permits <b>general</b> <b>hazard</b> rate dynamics. In the latter case we construct a simulation-based algorithm for pricing general mortality-contingent claims and illustrate with a numerical example...|$|E
40|$|Paradoxically, trace {{contaminant}} {{control systems}} that suffer unexpected upsets and malfunctions can release hazardous gaseous contaminants into a spacecraft cabin atmosphere causing potentially serious toxicological problems. Trace contaminant control systems designed for spaceflight typically employ {{a combination of}} adsorption beds and catalytic oxidation reactors to remove organic and inorganic trace contaminants from the cabin atmosphere. Interestingly, the same design features and attributes which make these systems so effective for purifying a spacecraft's atmosphere can also make them susceptible to system upsets. Cabin conditions can be contributing causes of phenomena such as adsorbent "rollover" and catalyst poisoning can alter a systems performance and in some in stances release contamination into the cabin. Evidence of these phenomena has been observed both in flight and during ground-based tests. The following discussion describes specific instances of system upsets found in trace contaminant control systems, groups these specific upsets into <b>general</b> <b>hazard</b> classifications, and recommends ways to minimize these hazards...|$|E
40|$|In the Alps, {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of scientific research on glaciers and on landscapes formed by perennial surface ice. Investigation of problems connected to high-mountain permafrost is much newer. The interest in both, however, has risen considerably during recent years. This is primarily due to their close relationship with climate change. Glaciers and permafrost do indeed react sensitively to changes in atmospheric temperature because of their proximity to the melting point. As a consequence, climatic changes during the 20 th century have caused pronounced effects in the glacial and periglacial belts of mountain areas. Fast if not accelerating changes in ice conditions of cold mountain areas now increasingly influence the appearance and perception of alpine landscapes, the seasonal – ity of melt-water runoff, the intensity of erosion and sedimentation, the stability of high-altitude slopes and the <b>general</b> <b>hazard</b> situation. To anticipate and mitigate such consequences of climate change represents a challenge of historical dimensions to the fields of glacial and periglacial geomorphology...|$|E
