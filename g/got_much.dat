He <b>got</b> <b>much</b> of his information while working on the Harleian Catalogue, a catalogue of the collection of works and pamphlets owned by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He published this work, along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet's edition of Shakespeare's plays, as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave.|$|E
5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim <b>got</b> <b>much</b> better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E

25|$|The {{apartment}} {{resembles a}} prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily {{on all of}} us. As none of us do much, we haven’t <b>got</b> <b>much</b> to tell each other.

25|$|Attendance did {{not improve}} as the season progressed, in fact, it <b>got</b> <b>much</b> worse, {{averaging}} an announced 5,703. The two playoff games drew 2,836 and 3,340 respectively, even after the team launched their SOS (Save Our Soccer) campaign late in the season. Losses for the season were pegged in the $500,000 range. This led too many wondering {{if there would be}} a next season, or if the owner would just pull the plug.|$|E
25|$|The {{phonology}} {{of modern}} Cornish {{is based on}} a number of sources. The work of the linguist Edward Lhuyd who visited Cornwall in 1700 to record the language, as well as the modern Cornish dialect and accent of English, which <b>got</b> <b>much</b> of its intonation and sounds from the Cornish language, have provided a major source of input. Analysis of the traditional literature has also been used, as the Middle Cornish plays were often written in rhyming verse, and Late Cornish texts were written phonetically following English spelling conventions.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time in 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), mostly made up of {{diasporic}} Tutsi in Uganda, advanced to Rwanda. It had experience in organized irregular warfare from the Ugandan Bush War, and <b>got</b> <b>much</b> support from the government of Uganda. The initial RPF advance was halted by the lift of French arms to the Rwandan government. Attempts at peace culminated in the Arusha Accords. The agreement broke down after the assassination of the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents. Victorious {{in the aftermath of the}} genocide, the RPF came to power in July 1994.|$|E
25|$|On the {{international}} stage, England and Australia began their {{battle for the}} Ashes once again on 25 August, where England chased 129 to win with seven wickets down after earning a 259-run lead on first innings and becoming {{the first team to}} ask Australia to follow on in 17 years. The men's win <b>got</b> <b>much</b> more media coverage than the women's first Ashes victory since 1963, achieved through a six-wicket victory in the second and final Test inspired by the all-round efforts of Katherine Brunt (who took nine wickets and made 52 runs in her only innings).|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} never <b>got</b> <b>much</b> {{better for}} the Dolphins. After another three and out, Jacksonville got the ball back at their own 47-yard line, and they scored another touchdown when Taylor caught a short pass on third down and 14 and took it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Jaguars a 31–0 lead just 12 seconds into the second quarter. Then on Miami's next possession, Jaguars rookie Corey Chamblin blocked Hutton's punt and Chris Howard recovered {{the ball on the}} Dolphins 21-yard line. Faced with third down and 14 again on their ensuing drive, the Jaguars decided not to pass and Stewart ended up scoring with a 25-yard touchdown run.|$|E

25|$|The {{letters of}} Alfred Newton include one {{to his brother}} giving an {{eye-witness}} account of the debate, and written {{less than a month}} afterwards. Other eyewitnesses, with one or two exceptions (Hooker especially thought he had made the best points), give similar accounts, at varying dates after the event. The general view was and still is that Huxley <b>got</b> <b>much</b> the better of the exchange though Wilberforce himself thought he had done quite well. In the absence of a verbatim report differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, when Jones was ten, {{his family}} moved to Bremerton, Washington, where his father got a wartime job at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. After the war, the Jones family moved to Seattle, the major {{regional}} city, where Jones attended Garfield High School near his home. He had discovered music when he was 12 and became more deeply involved in high school, developing his skills as a trumpeter and arranger. His classmates there included Charles Taylor, who played saxophone and whose mother, Evelyn Bundy, had been one of Seattle's first society jazz-band leaders. The youths began playing with a band. At the age of 14, they were playing with a National Reserve band. Jones has said he <b>got</b> <b>much</b> more experience with music growing up in a smaller city; otherwise, he would have faced too much competition.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} years of the eighties, the arrival of some young novelists who, later on, {{obtained}} enough popularity, was heard. Monju Sarkar, Imdadul Haq Milon and Moinul Ahsan Saber are the few but most common names in this regard. Monju Sarkar's Tamosh, Nagno Agontuk, Protima Upakhyan and Abashbhumi, Imdadul Haq Milon's Jabojjibon (written in 1976, published in 1900), Nodi Upakhyan, Bhumiputro, Poradhinota, Rajakartontro, Moinul Ahsan Saber's Adomer Jonye Opekhkha, Pathor Somoy, Char Torun Toruni, Manush Jekhane Jai Na, Dharabahik Kahin, Opeksha, Kobej Lethel, Tumi Amake Niye Jabe, Prem O Protishodh, Songsher Japon <b>got</b> <b>much</b> recognition from the literati. Shahidul Zahir, wrote his first novel Jibon O Rajnoitic Bastobota, published in 1988 while his second, till now the last, Shei Rate Purnima Chhilo came out in 1995. Magic realism, which is a recent trend of the Latin American novels, takes place in Shahidul Zahir's narration.|$|E

500|$|Jack Cashill, American studies {{professor}} at Purdue University, argues that [...] "Although his literary career never <b>got</b> <b>much</b> beyond pamphleteering and an untitled anti-war, anti-capitalist manuscript", Parsons {{played a significant}} role—greater than that of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey—in shaping the Californian counterculture of the 1960s and beyond through his influence on contemporaries such as Hubbard and Heinlein. Hugh Urban, religious studies {{professor at}} Ohio State University, cites Parsons' Witchcraft group as precipitating the neopagan revival of the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|His {{portrayal}} in The Movie {{has also}} received praise: IGN's Andy Patrizio said that Spike [...] "opens up his soul a little" [...] during the film, while Chris Beveridge of Mania.com found Spike more likable {{in the film}} than {{in some parts of}} the series, comparing him to Lupin III and praising the moments where he could be himself and show more of his inner self. Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Review said that Spike's portrayal was one of the things that worked in the film, and DVD Talk's Neil Lumbard, alongside general praise of the characters, positively noted the further exploration of his personality. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol was less enthusiastic, saying that while Spike was the only one who <b>got</b> <b>much</b> attention during the film, some sequences felt like they could work without him.|$|E
500|$|Palpatine's wardrobe, {{tailored}} by {{costume designer}} Trisha Biggar, {{played an important}} part {{in the development of the}} character throughout the films. In Attack of the Clones, explained McDiarmid, [...] "The costumes ... have <b>got</b> <b>much</b> more edge to them, I think, than the mere senator had [...] So we see the trappings of power." [...] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, [...] "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering." [...] McDiarmid's favorite costume in Revenge of the Sith was a high-collared jacket that resembles snake or lizard skin. He stated that [...] "it just feels reptilian, which is exactly right for [...]" [...] According to Trisha Biggar, Palpatine's costumes proved the most daunting challenge. She said, [...] "His six costumes get progressively darker and more ornately decorated throughout the movie. He wears greys and browns, almost going to black, taking him toward the dark side." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{entered the}} 1991 National Football League Draft after his redshirt sophomore season, {{which began with}} him as the nation's leading rusher {{through the end of}} October. The season trailed off as Powers <b>got</b> <b>much</b> of the late season {{workload}} with four consecutive 100-yard efforts in Michigan wins. [...] Vaughn was one of a relatively small class of underclassmen, headlined by Ragib [...] "Rocket" [...] Ismail to be approved in the NFL's second class of players allowed to declare themselves eligible for the draft despite remaining amateur eligibility. [...] In addition to Vaughn, other headliners among the underclassmen were Herman Moore, Todd Marinovich and Rob Carpenter (who also played for the 1991 Patriots). [...] John Vaughn was drafted with the first pick of the fifth round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. [...] Coach Dick MacPherson used him sparingly from scrimmage in his rookie year as Leonard Russell was the featured back for the 1991 Patriots. [...] However, he had 34kickoff returns, including one touchdown for an average of 21.1yards in 1991. [...] He also completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to Marv Cook against the Houston Oilers on September 22, 1991 in what would be the Patriots only non-quarterback touchdown pass until Dave Meggett repeated the feat during the 1997 NFL season.|$|E
500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States.

[...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

Shortly after she drops out of her arts course at university, Natasha meets Ed in Charlie's. She initially believes he is trying to ask her out on a date, but is embarrassed when she realises that she has misread the signals. Natasha apologises and offers to help him out with a difficult maths equation he has been trying to solve. A writer for All About Soap explained [...] "judgemental Ed dismisses her, assuming the waitress hasn't <b>got</b> <b>much</b> in the brains department!".
