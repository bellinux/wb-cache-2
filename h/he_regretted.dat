5|$|He {{added that}} while <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who {{was related to}} Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|Max Allan Collins, who {{authored}} {{the graphic}} novel, {{was hired to}} write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at DreamWorks required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> taking on the task.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Capello {{returned}} to Milan, subsequently stating Baggio {{was not a}} part of his plans with the club. Baggio chose to move to Parma, but the manager at the time, Carlo Ancelotti, impeded the transfer, as he also did not feel Baggio would fit into his tactical plans. Ancelotti would later state <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> this decision, stating that in his naïveté, he believed that the 4–4–2 formation was the ideal formation for success, and he felt that at the time, creative players such as Gianfranco Zola and Baggio were not compatible with this system.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Appeals Court in Rome tried Opačić, General Ljubomir Bajić, {{commander}} of the 5th Aviation Corps, and Colonel Božidar Martinović, head of the Yugoslav Air Defence operational centre in Belgrade in absentia for the attack.

The court also ordered Serbia to pay compensation to families of those killed in the attack, in the provisional amount of 950,000 Euros.

5|$|The {{incineration}} {{was recorded}} on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film—Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid—was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in {{debate about the}} burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning {{for a period of}} 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted to the BBC that <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> burning the money.|$|E

5|$|When Tintin in the Congo {{was first}} {{released}} by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.|$|E
5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was not sorry, but <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E
5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed <b>he</b> <b>regretted.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E
5|$|Settling in California, Đujić {{played an}} {{important}} role in Serbian émigré circles and founded the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks alongside other exiled Chetnik fighters. He later retired to San Marcos, where he wrote poems and jokes that were published in both the United States and Serbia. He was instrumental in perpetuating Chetnik ideas in the Yugoslav Wars and controversially appointed Vojislav Šešelj as a Chetnik vojvoda in 1989. In 1998, Đujić said that <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> awarding the title to Šešelj on account of his involvement with Slobodan Milošević. On 21 May 1998, Biljana Plavšić, President of the Republika Srpska at the time, awarded him the Order of the Star of Karađorđe (First Class). Đujić died at a hospice in San Diego in 1999, aged 92.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano was {{appointed}} as {{captain of the}} urban militias in 1797 by viceroy Pedro de Melo, who was instructed by Spain to prepare defences against a possible British or Portuguese attack. Belgrano by then worked in the Consulate, and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible British attack, {{but he did not}} take interest in it. His first intervention in a military conflict took place when the British, under William Carr Beresford, arrived with 1,600 men and took Buenos Aires, starting the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Belgrano moved to the fortress as soon as he heard the warning, and gathered many men to launch resistance. But without the required knowledge, his men marched in disorder and Belgrano was ordered to disband after a single British cannon shot. Belgrano would write later in his autobiography that <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> not having by then even the most basic knowledge of militia work.|$|E

5|$|Boas Munyonga {{represented}} Zambia in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an additional {{place in the}} additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. He participated in the men's middleweight class, which includes athletes under 90 kilograms in weight. Munyonga was Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Olympic Games, at age 31, and was taking part in his first Olympic Games. He {{said that he would}} do his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal the start of the match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signalled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> the move and that he had forgotten about a rule which stated the leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor.|$|E
5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> if his quarter century in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{was portrayed}} by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had {{previously}} worked with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in both The Lieutenant and a pilot for a show he created called Police Story. Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting Star Trek before it aired, but did {{not appear in the}} first two pilots. Roddenberry set out the role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another, but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official explanation was that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was actually necessitated because the series was over budget and was looking to cut costs. It is unclear as to who suggested that her contract should be terminated, or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said <b>he</b> <b>regretted</b> it. Whitney later directly linked her departure from the show to her alcoholism.|$|E
