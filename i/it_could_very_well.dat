2500|$|While Human became Norwood's first {{effort not to}} be {{nominated}} for a Grammy Award in any category, it received generally favorable reviews from music critics, averaging a 67 out of a 100 among averaged reviews on Metacritic. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe complimented the album as appropriately rich and varied: [...] "It's better than good enough. It's a light, breezy listen that shows off Brandy's resilience, humility, joy, and vibrancy." [...] She especially highlighted Jerkins' input on the album: [...] "Jerkins manages {{to bring out the}} expressive best in her pleasantly raspy vocalizing." [...] The Guardian writer Alex Macpherson noted Human [...] "a thoughtful, intimate work on which Norwood sings movingly about fragility and fear," [...] giving it four and a half stars out of five, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic called the album Norwood's [...] "most platitudinal" [...] and [...] "least enjoyable release in her catalog," [...] adding: [...] "Brandy is clearly in a comfort zone that enables her to open up more than ever [...] Human is nothing if not a serious album.

But as he was developed and educated in this way, the simple became more difficult for him, and since with out this guidance he wanted to rule himself, everything {{became more and more}} complicated. – Perhaps he chose the guidance of thought, and in order not to owe anyone anything he let this seed sow itself and let one thought evolve out of another, until eventually the infinite manifested itself to him and made him dizzy. The more he stared fixedly at it, the more his eye lost the visual power to find the way back to finitude.-Perhaps desire blinded him, life seemed like a joke to him, and he let God grieve in heaven while he chose pleasure and let enthusiasm speak in vain about conflict and struggle, about courage in dangers, patience in tribulation, love in life, victory in death, reward in heaven, while he let every day have its pleasure.-Perhaps a worldly-minded worry about food and clothing scattered his mind so that he did neither the one nor the other."

Such a letter, at all events, read over with the general key, touches its contemporary scene and hour into an intensity of life for him; making indeed the great sign of that life my brother's signal vivacity and cordiality, his endless spontaneity of mind. Every thing in it is characteristic of the genius and expressive of the mood, and not least, of course, the pleasantry of paradox, the evocation of each familiar image by its vivid opposite. Our mother, e.g., was not at that time, nor for a good while yet, so venerably [...] "silvered"; our handsome-headed father had lost, occipitally, long before, all pretence to raven locks, certainly {{to the effect of}} their [...] "rippling"; the beauty of our admirable aunt was as happily alien either to wildness or to the [...] "hanging" [...] air as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> be; the [...] "mystery" [...] of our young sister consisted all in the candour of her natural bloom, even if at the same time of her lively intelligence; and H.'s mirth and garrulity appear to have represented for the writer the veriest ironic translation of something in that youth, I judge, not a little mildly--though oh so mildly!--morose or anxiously mute. To the same tune the aquiline in his own nose heroically derides the slightly relaxed line of that feature; and our brother Wilky's want of physical [...] "depth" [...] is a glance at a different proportion. Of a like tinge of pleasantry, I may add, is the imputation of the provincial gape to our friend T. S. Perry, of Newport birth and unintermitted breeding, with whom we were to live so much in the years to come, and who was then on the eve of entering Harvard--his face already uninterruptedly turned to that love of letters, that practice of them by dauntless and inordinate, though never at all vulgarly resonant, absorption which was to constitute in itself the most disinterested of careers. I had myself felt him from the first an exemplary, at once, and a discouraging friend; he had let himself loose in the world of books, pressed and roamed through the most various literatures and the most voluminous authors, with a stride that, as it carried him beyond all view, left me dismayed and helpless {{at the edge of the}} forest, where I listened wistfully but unemulously to the far-off crash from within of his felled timber, the clearing of whole spaces or periods shelf by shelf or great tree by tree. The brother-in-law of John La Farge, he had for us further, with that reviving consciousness of American annals which the War was at once so rudely and so insidiously to quicken in us, the glamour of his straight descent from the Commodores Perry of the Lake Erie in the war of 1812, respectively, and of the portentous penetration of Japan just after the mid-century, and his longer-drawn but equally direct and so clean and comfortable affiliation to the great Benjamin Franklin: as these things at least seemed to me under my habit (too musing and brooding certainly to have made for light loquacity) of pressing every wind-borne particle of personal history--once the persons were only other enough from myself--into the service of what I would fain have called picture or, less explicitly, less formulatedly, romance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard is an {{important}} pest of Solanaceae in several countries. Introduced accidentally to Africa, it presently occurs in many countries of that continent. In some of them, it is considered a key pest. The sus-pected area of origin of this mite is South America. The objective {{of the present study}} was to identify phytoseiid mites on solanaceous plants in association with T. evansi in south and southeast Brazil for introduction in the African continent for use in a classic biological control program. Almost 1, 400 predatory mites of the family Phytoseiidae were collected, on 22 solanaceous species. The Amblyseiinae were the most diverse group in this study. Twenty-three of the species found belong to this subfamily, while only three belong to the Typhlodrominae and two to the Phytoseiinae. The most abundant and most frequent phytoseiid species were Phytoseius guianensis De Leon and Galendromus annectens (De Leon) of the Phytoseiinae and Typhlodrominae, respectively. The most frequent and abundant species of Amblyseiinae was Neoseiulus tunus (De Leon). Phytoseius guianensis and N. tunus were never found in association with T. evansi and G. annectens was found only once in association with it. Two factors suggested Phytoseiulus longipes Evans as the most promising predator found in this study. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> walk <b>very</b> <b>well</b> on tomato leaves infested by T. evansi, without being hampered by the profuse webbin...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} a novel {{approach}} to Distributed Video Coding (DVC) using bitplane based unequal error protection. Distributed video coding (DVC) has recently attracted {{a vast amount of}} attention from the video coding community all around the world, since <b>it</b> <b>could</b> prove <b>very</b> <b>well</b> suited for some applications where low-complexity encoders are a must. The primary feature of DVC is its modified complexity balance in the encoder and decoder, in contrast to its traditional competitors. When considering each pixel of the frame, out of the 8 bits it constitutes, each bit position has a different significance decreasing gradually from the MSB to the LSB. Therefore a scheme which protects the initial bitplanes better would undoubtedly be desirable. Here we propose to protest each bitplane considering its significance using variable memory length in the encoder. Since increasing the memory length results in higher computational complexity, the optimum mix of the memory length is to be evaluated for the codec to operate within the conceptual restrictions of low-complex encoder in DVC. In this paper, the proposed codec is compared for performance with another DVC codec which uses a fixed memory length over the whole sequence with comparable complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms its fixed memory length counterpart t by a significant margin...|$|R
