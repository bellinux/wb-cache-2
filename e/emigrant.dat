MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden <b>emigrant</b> voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E

To fight for the control of Korean <b>emigrants,</b> the Fengtian clique attempted to persuade or force Korean <b>emigrants</b> to become naturalized citizens of China. But most Korean <b>emigrants</b> considered such policies as Chinese authority’s attempt to assimilate them into Han Chinese. In September 1930, realizing that Korean <b>emigrants</b> having no trust in Chinese governments, the Chairman of Jinlin Province Zhang Zuoxiang instead carried out policies to encourage Korean <b>emigrants</b> to become naturalized. [...] To prevent the Japanese from using Korean <b>emigrants</b> {{as a tool of}} infiltration into Northeast China, the Chinese government also tried to put Korean emigrants’ school into its own national education system, increasing investments on Korean emigrants’ schools annually to sever the Japanese influence on Korean <b>emigrants.</b> In 1921, Jinlin province quadrupled its annual investments on local Korean schools to repair the damages during the Japanese massacre of Koreans (間島慘變) in Oct. 1920. As the Japanese often used the excuse of protecting Korean <b>emigrants</b> to enlarge their sphere of influence in Northeast China, the views of Chinese government and people towards Korean <b>emigrants</b> changed after the mid of 1920, especially after the exposure of Tanaka Memorial and the Wanpaoshan Incident. Korean <b>emigrants</b> used to be considered as independent activists in China, but now they were generally considered as the vanguard of Japanese invasion. Relationship between local Chinese and Korean <b>emigrants</b> became tense. After the Chinese government signed the treaty with the Japanese government on 11 June 1925 to assist the Japanese get rid of Korean independent activists in Northeast China, the Fengtian clique began to use this treaty to expel and persecute Korean <b>emigrants</b> and began to take back the farm lands cultivated by non-naturalized Korean <b>emigrants</b> or put on more restrictions.

50|$|Political {{conditions}} {{as the main}} motive of emigration {{was the result of}} World War I and became much more significant immediately after World War II, when hundreds of thousands emigrated for fear of retaliation and the suppression of democracy by the Yugoslav authorities.
