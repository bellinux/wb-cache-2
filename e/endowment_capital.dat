The empirical methodology takes into account variable factor utilization with capital utilization calculated from the consumption of electricity. Estimation results show that ignoring variable capital utilization overstates the effects of technology on specialization. The model is used to explain the differential changes in specialization that occurred in Korea and Turkey between 1975 and 1995.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the use of}} experimental design in simulation modelling. Income growth prospects for small farms in northern Nigeria are examined under deterministic and stochastic conditions. A partial factorial design is employed {{to assess the impact}} on growth of resource endowment, stochastic yields and returns, consumption behavior, and enterprise opportunities. Analysis of variance on the deterministic results indicates that the key determinants of financial performance are stochastic events and family size and resource <b>endowment.</b> <b>Capital</b> accumulation under stochastic returns is slower than under fixed average returns. The value of a multi-year model is discussed. Key words: experimental design, farm model, Nigeria, simulation, stochastic. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate the use of experimental design in a recent farm-ing systems simulation study of traditional smallholder agriculture in northern Nigeria. Its value is discussed in relation to the objec-tives, costs, methodology, and results of the study.

The principal findings of the study are then outlined.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} optimal {{accumulation}} {{of renewable energy}} (backstop) generating capacity in a capital-energy economy with exhaustible fossil fuels. The analysis rests upon graphical illustrations of optimal control considerations. Due to the exhaustibility of fossil fuels the relative profitability of backstop capacity vs. capital investments increases in time. Furthermore, {{it turns out that}} the optimal economic evolution and, therefore, the steady-state levels of capital, backstop capacity, and consumption crucially depend on the <b>capital</b> <b>endowment.</b> In particular, a sufficiently large endowment gives rise to the accumulation of an excess capacity. Furthermore, a high <b>capital</b> <b>endowment</b> allows to use the full production potential of the steady-state capital stock, so that there is no mark-up on backstop costs in the steady-state. In contrast, a low <b>capital</b> <b>endowment</b> may render capacity investments non-optimal, so that the conomy is in a poverty trap. Both cases are based on an intertemporal consumption trade-off.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} intranational {{business}} cycle - {{that is the}} set of regional (prefectural) business cycles - in Japan. One reason for choosing to examine the Japanese case is that long time series of relatively detailed data are available. A Hodrick-Prescott filter is applied to identify cycles in annual data from 1955 to 1995 and bilateral cross-correlations of prefectural GDPs are calculated for all pairs of prefectures, in our results we find fairly high cross-correlations. The paper then turns to an econometric explanation of the cross-correlation coefficients in the augmented gravity model framework. Two prefectures with similar GDPs and a shorter distance between them lead to business cycle synchronization whilst those with larger regional gaps in factor <b>endowments</b> (<b>capital,</b> labor and human capital) result in more idiosyncratic business cycle.
