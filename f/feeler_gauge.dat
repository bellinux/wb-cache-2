The use of model, in both the imaging of displacements of the Solina Dam and forecasts made for the benchmarks located on the crest of the dam, gave satisfactory results, therefore further analysis were undertaken. Displacement forecasting was made based on data from <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> located at the pillars, retaining walls and four galleries. Analysis based on 4 different forecasting periods enabled for the conclusion that to obtain reliable forecasts, measurement data based on 10 years of operation with frequency of 1 per month is required.

5000|$|The {{surfaces}} which {{define the}} edges of the aperture are the anvils, which may be made of separate pieces of hard material such as tungsten carbide for wear resistance. Two apertures are frequently used to provide Go/No-Go testing and are often arranged such that a part being measured can pass through the two apertures in sequence; a part that is within tolerance will pass through the first maximum size limit aperture but {{will not be able to}} pass through the minimum size limit aperture. A snap gauge usually has a [...] "C" [...] shaped frame with the aperture(s) at the opening of the [...] "C". Snap gages may be machined and ground out of a single block of metal or adjustable snap gages, which have movable anvils that may be adjusted over a limited range of sizes, may be used. They may also be of built up construction in which one or more gage blocks or <b>feeler</b> <b>gauges</b> are sandwiched between two anvils. Adjustable snap gages may be reset to compensate for wear or re-tasked for measuring a different dimension and can be purchased off the shelf and set rather than needing to be fabricated from scratch when a new gage is needed.

The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark plug gauges from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars.

The traditional method is to use riveting pier <b>gauge,</b> checking template, <b>feeler,</b> dial <b>gauge</b> with auxiliary bracket[1] and so on.

40|$|The {{target of}} the mass {{production}} {{is to increase the}} productivity and increase the accuracy. This is done by reducing the set up cost and manual fatigue. Thus mass production can be achieved by the use of jigs. For large scale production of different materials a lot of time is wasted in set up of the device and clamping the device. Trial and error method is usually practiced until the axis of the hole is properly aligned with the axis of the drill. In such a situation a lot of time is being wasted to maintain the accuracy. Eventually it increases the operator’s fatigue. Thus drill jig increases productivity by eliminating individual positioning, marking and frequent checking. The main advantage of the jigs is interchangeability. A fixture is a production tool. The main aim is to locate, hold and support the work securely so that the required machining operations can be performed. Set blocks and <b>feeler</b> or thickness <b>gauges</b> are also used to provide reference of the cutter with the workpiece. A fixture must be easily fastened with the table and the machine. As a result the work can be done. Fixture is largely used in milling machines. But it can also be used for other operations on most of the standard machining tools like drilling machine. Fixtures are available in different shape and sizes ranging from simple and cheap devices to very expensive and complicated devices. Fixtures can also help to simplify the metalworking operations which are performed on the special equipment. Considering the advantages of jigs and fixtures, a fixture was designed to cater to our needs...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{interchangeable}} barrel revolvers produced {{were the}} Dan Wesson Models W8, W9, W11, and W12, all medium-frame size frame revolvers chambered in [...]38 Special or [...]357 Magnum. The W8 and W11 had either a fixed rear sight, or a rear sight adjustable only for windage, while the W9 and W12 featured a rear sight fully adjustable for both windage and elevation. The barrels and shrouds for both models were interchangeable {{and used a}} large externally mounted nut on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange (known to collectors as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] shrouds) which mated with {{the front of the}} revolver's frame. Initial barrel/shroud options were 2 1/2-inch, 4-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inches. A custom barrel nut wrench and <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> were supplied with each pistol, and barrel changes could be accomplished in two minutes or less.|$|E
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket head cap screw, allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, {{the end gap}} is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge.</b> End gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended [...] "load" [...] of engine. Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap closure, ring breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of blow-by gases or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or ring wear. (Radial wear on ring face reduces thickness of used/worn ring (face wear in bore) essentially decreasing face circumference of ring and thereby increasing size of ring end gap.) ...|$|E

40|$|High {{fidelity}} computational {{models are}} developed {{to study the}} nonlinear structural dynamics of a plunging membrane airfoil, which is based upon previous experimental work. Two airfoil structures are investigated: a one-dimensional string and a three-dimensional <b>Feeler</b> <b>gauge.</b> Time-periodic flapping is assumed for both cases. The nonlinear equations of motion are semi-discretized in space using the finite element method, and then discretized in time using both a high dimensional harmonic balance approach and a standard finite differencing scheme. Solutions for both time-discretization methods are compared. For weak to moderately nonlinear string problems, the harmonic balance solution compares favorably with the finite difference solution, and is two to three orders of magnitude faster to compute. When the string exhibits stronger nonlinear behavior, the harmonic balance method yields results that diverge from the true solution when multiple harmonics are used. This is likely due {{to the presence of}} multiple subharmonics in the frequency response curve. The <b>Feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> problem is investigated to explore the possibility of unstable planar motion and chaotic vibrations during plunging. While the spectral contents of the response contain multiple frequencies, neither unstable planar dynamics nor chaotic vibrations were encountered within the range of parameters tested. Further investigation is needed to determine whether such a response is possible for the current model. I...|$|E

40|$|Objective : To {{compare the}} time taken to achieve {{adequate}} separation of tooth contact and perception of pain {{associated with it}} using elastomeric and spring separators. Materials and methods : A total of 60 subjects (30 males, 30 females) in the age range of 18 to 25 years were divided into three groups with 20 subjects each (10 males and 10 females). Group 1, 2 and 3 were evaluated after 1, 2 and 3 days of separator placement respectively for the degree of separation and pain perception. Two types of separators namely elastomeric and spring separators were placed, at the mesial and distal contacts of the first permanent molars in the maxillary and mandibular arches. The amount of separation at each contact point was measured {{with the help of}} the <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> and discomfort level was recorded on verbal rating scale. Results : Both types of separators achieved adequate separation after 2 days of separator placement. There was no genderwise difference in the amount of separation and time taken for separation as well as pain perception with either of the separators. The intensity of pain remained mild-to-moderate on VRS scale scoring 2 to 3 with either of separators. The pain was worst after 2 days of separator placement and declined after 3 days irrespective of the type of separators. Conclusion : Both types of the separators are comparable for separation effect and pain perception associated with them.

The {{aim of this study}} was to enhance the orthodontic tooth movement by reducing the cortical bone layer (resistant to bone re-sorption relative to spongious bone) following Erbium, Chromium doped Yttrium Scandium Gallium Garnet (Er-Cr: YSGG) laser irradiation, without reflection of surgical soft tissue flap. METHODS: In the present experimental study, 8 New Zealand Male rabbits were the samples for the research. The right first premolar of each rabbit (experiment group) underwent treatment for mesial movement with 75 gram of orthodontic force by using closed Ni-Ti coil spring (Dentaurum®). Coil spring was fixed in the cervical region of first premolars by means of ligature wire and No-Mix composite (Dentaurum®) and also activated to the cervical site of incisors. The left first premolars of the subjects were considered as the control group. Laser corticotomy was performed in anesthetized rabbits. Samples were sacrificed for determination of tooth movement after initiating premolar protraction on the 21 th day. The amount of orthodontic tooth movement was assessed by using a metal <b>feeler</b> <b>gauge</b> with the precision of 0. 01 mm, between mesial surface of the second premolars and distal surfaces of the first premolars.
