40|$|It {{is now an}} {{accepted}} conclusion by many countries that economic development must be financed by domestic savings and foreign assistance. United States tops the list of borrowers with heavy external borrowing. India gets the 12 th place in the <b>debt</b> <b>ranking.</b> But in Economic Development India is in 162 nd position under the list of lower middle income country, while United States is in the higher income countries list. Hence {{it is necessary to}} examine the impact of debt on every economy and its development. This paper tries to examine the growth of debt of South Asian Countries over the last thirty years. Debt emerged as a crisis after the oil price hike. The enormous increase in the volume of oil demand led to steep increase in the oil prices during the early 1970 s, from 1. 30 U. S. Dollars per barrel in 1970 to 2. 70 U. S. Dollars per barrel in 1973. The second oil crisis started in June 1978. Mexico was in deep trouble following 1976 Peso devaluation. In 1982 debt crisis of Mexico made a halt. These two were the major reasons for the debt crisis of many of the countries. Baskar Majumder 1 in his article on ‘Globalisation of Highly Indebted Countries; Some Issues ’ attempts to identify the economic and structural dimensions of 12 highly indebted countries. According To Baskar, ‘out of the 12 countries, India and China are in a worse position than other countries’. India is continuing to carry severe debt in the region of South Asia. South Asia is also continuing to be an area with heavy borrowing. Hence this paper aims to examine th...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new model}} of students' concern about indebtedness within a rank-based social norms framework. Study 1 found that students hold highly variable beliefs about how much other students will owe {{at the end of their}} degree. Students' concern about their own anticipated debt – and their intention of taking on a part-time job during term time – was best predicted not by the size of the anticipated debt, but by how they, often incorrectly, believed their <b>debt</b> <b>ranked</b> amongst that of others. Study 2 manipulated hypothetical debt amounts experimentally and found that the same anticipated debt was rated as 2. 5 times more concerning when it ranked as the second highest being considered than when it was the fifth highest. Study 3 demonstrated that the model applies to evaluation of different types of debt (income contingent loans versus general debt) ...|$|R

40|$|Credit and {{liquidity}} shocks represent {{main channels}} of financial contagion for interbank lending markets. On one hand, banks face potential losses whenever their counterparties are under distress and thus unable {{to fulfill their}} obligations. On the other hand, solvency constraints may force banks to recover lost fundings by selling their illiquid assets, resulting in effective losses {{in the presence of}} fire sales-that is, when funding shortcomings are widespread over the market. Because of the complex structure of the network of interbank exposures, these losses reverberate among banks and eventually get amplified, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole financial system. Inspired by the recently proposed <b>Debt</b> <b>Rank,</b> in this work we define a systemic risk metric that estimates the potential amplification of losses in interbank markets accounting for both credit and liquidity contagion channels: the Debt-Solvency Rank. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183 European banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013, showing indeed that liquidity spillovers substantially increase systemic risk, and thus cannot be neglected in stress-test scenarios. We also provide additional evidence that the interbank market was extremely fragile up to the global financial crisis, becoming slightly more robust only afterwards...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{literacy}} affects all consumers. It is {{an important}} topic because {{the consequences of a}} financial decision can impact an individual’s choices {{for the rest of their}} lives. Young people in the United States of America have to make long-lasting financial decisions with little formal education in personal finance. One group of young adults needing to make financial decisions is university students. With such a high cost of post-secondary education, many finance it with student loans. Large student loan balances ultimately have repercussions on a young graduate’s future as the loans add a significant monthly payment to their budget. On average, students in the state of Iowa are graduating with 29, 732 in <b>debt,</b> which <b>ranks</b> Iowa as the eighth highest state for student loan debt in the United States of America.

50|$|Notwithstanding {{the senior}} {{status of a}} loan or other debt {{instrument}}, another debt instrument (whether senior or otherwise) may benefit from security that effectively renders that other instrument {{more likely to be}} repaid in an insolvency than unsecured senior debt. Lenders of a secured debt instrument (regardless of ranking) receive the benefit of the security for that instrument until they are repaid in full, without having to share the benefit of that security with any other lenders. If the value of the security is insufficient to repay the secured debt, the residual unpaid claim will rank according to its documentation (whether senior or otherwise), and will receive pro rata treatment with other unsecured <b>debts</b> of such <b>rank.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in various}} jurisdictions and circumstances, {{nominally}} [...] "senior" [...] <b>debt</b> may not <b>rank</b> pari passu {{with all other}} senior obligations. For example, in the 2008 Washington Mutual Bank seizure, all assets and most (including deposits, covered bonds, and other secured debt) of Washington Mutual Bank's liabilities were assumed by JPMorgan Chase. However other debt claims, including unsecured senior debt, were not. By doing this, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) effectively subordinated the unsecured senior debt to depositors, thereby fully protecting depositors while also eliminating any potential deposit insurance liability to the FDIC itself. In this and similar cases, specific regulatory and oversight powers can lead to senior lenders being subordinated in potentially unexpected ways.|$|R

40|$|Despite being {{thoroughly}} debunked, {{concern over}} high government debt-to-GDP ratios has hardly disappeared from policy debates. As such, an overlooked possibility for reducing a high debt burden is simply buying back bonds {{at a discount}} when interest rates rise, as is widely predicted. This issue brief calculates the potential savings to the government through a hypothetical buyback of government debt in 2017. Long-term bonds that are issued at low interest rates will sell at substantial discounts to their face value if market interest rates rise. Looking at publicly held marketable debt issued as {{of the end of}} February 2013, the face value of the debt is $ 3, 857 billion. The projected market value of this debt is $ 3, 399 billion for an implied debt reduction of $ 458 billion, or just under 2. 3 percent of the GDP projected for 2017. The interest burden on the Treasury will not change through these transactions. The only effect will be to lower the official value of outstanding debt. However if people in policy positions continue to attach importance to this number then this sort of <b>debt</b> exchange should <b>rank</b> {{high on the list of}} policy options. There is no less costly way to eliminate close to half a trillion dollars in debt...|$|R
40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{have looked}} at the literature (a number of Journal articles) and quantitative data from the Household Savings Survey (2001), Survey of Family, Income, and Employment (2004 / 2005) and Buzzthepeople (2008) to explore how New Zealand’s household debt (other than that of mortgage debt) has increased so quickly in the last 10 years. On the macro level a number of government policies around the liberalisation of the financial industry has made it easier for banks to sell credit and access it from overseas, whilst on the micro level attitudinal changes in spending habits and increasing acceptance of debt as a normal part of life has led to a much wider use of credit such as credit cards, hire purchase, bank debt and personal loans. The report also includes a literature review which looks at international literature which looks at a number of explanations of the growth of non-mortgage household debt, exploring among other things, how those on more modest incomes have become prone to using credit to supplement their often inadequate incomes. Ultimately the ‘hierarchy of debt’ which <b>ranks</b> <b>debt</b> types (student loan, credit card, personal etc) in order of their utility to the consumer, illustrates how the financially excluded sectors of society are forced to use those types of credit that are the least desirable in terms of interest rates and other related costs...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} theory-guided {{empirical}} research seeking to identify the correlates and contributors to the well-being and life satisfaction of lawyers. Data from several thousand lawyers in four states provide insights about diverse factors from law school and one’s legal career and personal life. Striking patterns appear repeatedly in the data and raise {{serious questions about the}} common priorities on law school campuses and among lawyers. External factors, which are often given the most attention and concern among law students and lawyers (factors oriented towards money and status—such as earnings, partnership in a law firm, law school <b>debt,</b> class <b>rank,</b> law review membership, and U. S. News 2 ̆ 6 World Report’s law school rankings), showed nil to small associations with lawyer well-being. Conversely, the kinds of internal and psychological factors shown in previous research to erode in law school appear in these data {{to be the most important}} contributors to lawyers’ happiness and satisfaction. These factors constitute the first two of five tiers of well-being factors identified in the data, followed by choices regarding family and personal life. The external money and status factors constitute the fourth tier, and demographic differences were least important. Data on lawyers in different practice types and settings demonstrate the applied importance of the contrasting internal and external factors. Attorneys in large firms and other prestigious positions were not as happy as public service attorneys, despite the far better grades and pay of the former group; and junior partners in law firms were no happier than senior associates, despite the greatly enhanced pay and status of the partners. Overall, the data also demonstrate that lawyers are very much like other people, notwithstanding their specialized cognitive training and the common perception that lawyers are different from others in fundamental ways. Additional measures raised concerns. Subjects did not broadly agree that the behavior of judges and lawyers is professional, or that the legal process reaches fair outcomes; and subjects reported quite unrealistic earnings expectations for their careers when they entered law school. Implications for improving lawyer performance and professionalism, and recommendations for law teachers and legal employers, are drawn from the data...|$|R
