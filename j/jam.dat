30|$|There {{are various}} kinds of <b>jamming</b> modes. Active <b>jamming</b> {{can be divided into}} {{blanketing}} <b>jamming</b> and deceptive <b>jamming,</b> where the blanketing <b>jamming</b> can be divided into several modulation modes [27]. Three of the <b>jamming</b> modes, namely noise amplitude modulation (AM) <b>jamming,</b> noise frequency modulation (FM) <b>jamming,</b> and noise phase modulation (PM) <b>jamming</b> are discussed in this paper as follows.|$|R
30|$|<b>Jamming</b> {{detection}} and <b>jamming</b> classification are different modules in the auditing algorithm. The auditing algorithm detects {{the presence of}} <b>jamming,</b> and if <b>jamming</b> is present, then the classification is performed based on various types of <b>jamming.</b> Classification of <b>jamming</b> cannot be performed before identifying the presence of <b>jamming.</b> Therefore, in the proposed JDF, first, <b>jamming</b> is detected (based {{on the results of}} statistical test), and then if <b>jamming</b> is present, classification of <b>jamming</b> is done (based on the results of statistical test). Thus, statistical tests are employed for both <b>jamming</b> {{detection and}} classification but the methodology followed for <b>jamming</b> detection and classification is completely different as detailed below.|$|R

5|$|Backspacer is {{the ninth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl <b>Jam,</b> released on September 20, 2009. The bandmembers started writing instrumental and demo tracks in 2007, and got together in 2008 {{to work on}} an album. It was recorded from February through April 2009 with producer Brendan O'Brien, who had worked on every Pearl <b>Jam</b> album except their 1991 debut Ten and 2006's self-titled record—although this was his first production credit since 1998's Yield. Material was recorded in Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California and O'Brien's own Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. The music on the album—the shortest of the band's career—features a sound influenced by pop and new wave. The lyrics have a more optimistic look than {{the ones in the}} politic-infused predecessors Riot Act and Pearl <b>Jam,</b> something frontman Eddie Vedder attributed to the election of Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|Binaural is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl <b>Jam,</b> released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl <b>Jam</b> took a short break before reconvening {{toward the end of}} 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder's writer's block, and guitarist Mike McCready's entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{initially}} {{turned his}} efforts to his side-project Wellwater Conspiracy, to which both Shepherd and Thayil have contributed. He then worked briefly with The Smashing Pumpkins on the band's 1998 album, Adore. In 1998, he played drums for Pearl Jam's Yield Tour following Jack Irons's health problems, and later joined Pearl <b>Jam</b> as an official member. He has recorded five albums as the band's drummer: Binaural (2000), Riot Act (2002), Pearl <b>Jam</b> (2006), Backspacer (2009) and Lightning Bolt (2013). Cameron also played percussion on Geddy Lee's album My Favourite Headache. In 2017, he {{was inducted into the}} Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl <b>Jam.</b>|$|E

30|$|For power-cooperative <b>jamming,</b> noise {{frequency}} modulation and smart noise convolution power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> can {{more or less}} reduce the detection probabilities of CFAR detectors. Additionally, smart noise convolution power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> has a better interference effect than noise {{frequency modulation}} power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> for the same noise duration. Interrupted-sampling and periodic repeater power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> can achieve a larger pulse compression gain than either of the two <b>jamming</b> methods mentioned above, but it is sensitive to the radar uncertain position. In summary, for power-cooperative <b>jamming,</b> noise barrage can be used to improve the noise floor and cooperate with deceptive <b>jamming,</b> i.e., interrupted-sampling and periodic repeater <b>jamming,</b> to accomplish power barrage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of {{studying}} how to improve and optimize the anti-jamming ability of the satellite navigation and positioning system, the satellite channel was faced with many types of <b>jamming</b> signals. It is difficult to adopt one kind of <b>jamming</b> suppression technology to effectively suppress all kinds of <b>jamming.</b> In order to solve these problems, a new anti-jamming architecture for satellite navigation and positioning system is proposed. That is adopting the <b>jamming</b> cognitive method combined with the time-frequency domain <b>jamming</b> type recognition, power analysis and <b>jamming</b> DOA estimation. Also, the anti-jamming architecture design of the satellite navigation and positioning system is given based on the <b>jamming</b> cognition. Theoretical analysis and simulation {{results show that the}} anti-jamming architecture can detect the different <b>jamming</b> signals according to different <b>jamming</b> types, simplify the <b>jamming</b> suppression algorithm, grade and classify to suppress <b>jamming</b> signals...|$|R
5|$|Control is {{the third}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson, released on February 4, 1986, by A Records. Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy <b>Jam</b> and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, <b>Jam</b> and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control {{becoming one of the}} foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music.|$|E

30|$|Cooperative <b>jamming</b> is an {{efficient}} interference method for the target, in which multiple jammers are organized {{to work together}} in a certain pattern [26]. According to the different situations in a cooperative <b>jamming</b> implementation strategy, cooperative <b>jamming</b> can be divided into power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> and time-cooperative <b>jamming.</b>|$|R
30|$|It can {{therefore}} be seen that {{the analysis of the}} time-circulating cooperative <b>jamming</b> is similar to the power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> when the entire time-circulating cooperative <b>jamming</b> process is divided. Therefore, this paper mainly discusses selection of the <b>jamming</b> parameters and the radar’s detection performance when using time-synchronized cooperative <b>jamming.</b>|$|R

40|$|A novel quasi-coherent noise <b>jamming</b> {{method is}} {{proposed}} against linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal and pulse compression radar. Based {{on the structure}} of digital radio frequency memory (DRFM), the <b>jamming</b> signal is acquired by the pseudo-random sequence phase-modulation of sampled radar signal. The characteristic of <b>jamming</b> signal in time domain and frequency domain is analyzed in detail. Results of ambiguity function indicate that the blanket <b>jamming</b> effect along the range direction will be formed when <b>jamming</b> signal passes through the matched filter. By flexible controlling the parameters of interrupted-sampling pulse and pseudo-random sequence, different covering distances and <b>jamming</b> effects will be achieved. When the <b>jamming</b> power is equivalent, this <b>jamming</b> obtains higher process gain compared with non-coherent <b>jamming.</b> The <b>jamming</b> signal enhances the detection threshold and the real target avoids being detected. Simulation results and circuit engineering implementation validate that the <b>jamming</b> signal covers real target effectively...|$|R

The PDR range for various types of <b>jamming</b> is formulated from the T test. The PDR range is estimated with the probability 0.001, and the PDR range varies based on various probabilities.

30|$|Time-{{cooperative}} <b>jamming</b> can {{be divided}} into time-synchronized cooperative <b>jamming</b> and time-circulating cooperative <b>jamming</b> according to the different interference durations of each jammer.
