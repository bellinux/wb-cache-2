40|$|As {{supplies}} of canola meal (CM) and dried <b>distiller</b> <b>s</b> <b>grains</b> (DDGS) increase, {{so does the}} incentive to use these feeds as protein supplements at higher inclusion levels in dairy cattle rations. However, this could have detrimental effects on animal production due to imbalances of amino acids (AA) or dietary rumen degradable protein (RDP) vs. rumen undegradable protein (RUP) ratios. Few studies have been completed comparing performance of dairy cattle fed CM and DDGS, and little information is available on inclusion levels higher than 120 g/kg dry matter (DM) for either protein source. Overall project objectives were to (1) determine the highest level at which CM and the high protein, low fat DDGS (HPDDG) alternative can be included in dairy rations before adversely affecting production, (2) identify nutritional limitations at high inclusion levels of CM, and (3) identify resolutions for the limitations associated with feeding very high levels of CM to high producing dairy cows. Treatments in Experiment 1 were created by varying ration inclusion levels of CM and HPDDG: (1) 0 g CM/kg and 200 g HPDDG/kg, (2) 65 g CM/kg and 135 g HPDDG/kg, (3) 135 g CM/kg and 65 g HPDDG/kg, (4) 200 g CM/kg and 0 g HPDDG/kg TMR DM. Results suggest that the optimum level of CM in the ration was {{in the range of}} 120 to 135 g/kg DM, and Met and Phe were identified as limiting AA. In Experiment 2 these AA were supplemented in a ruminally protected (RP) form, either alone or in combination, to a Control ration containing 200 g CM/kg DM. Compared to Control, supplemental Met shifted milk energy amongst milk components without affecting milk energy output. Phe alone had no effect on animal performance, but adding it in combination with Met diverted energy away from milk components towards body condition score (BCS) gain. While results suggest that neither Met nor Phe was a limiting AA in this experiment, at least in a classical sense, results suggest that both were metabolically bioactive. Experiment 3 used multiparity cows fed a wide range of contemporary early lactation dairy rations in California (USA), employing sampling practices easily performed on a routine basis on commercial dairy farms, in order to (a) determine normal ranges of microbial crude protein (MCP) flowing from the rumen, and plasma AA concentrations, in early lactation multiparity Holstein cows, to (b) benchmark their high, low and mean levels using sampling methods possible under commercial conditions in order to assist in evaluation of commercial rations formulated with or without the aid of metabolic models, and to (c) create a reference database to help interpret the biological meaning of treatment concentrations of these parameters under commercial and experimental conditions. Since relationships between milk production, total mixed ration (TMR) ingredient profiles and plasma AA concentrations from Experiment 3 confirmed the hypothesis that Phe is important relative to milk production, Experiment 4 was designed to determine if supplementing higher levels of RP Phe would enhance performance of early lactation dairy cows by supplying enough Phe to support increased milk production, after fulfilling its apparent 1 st priority of restoring previously mobilized peptides to muscle protein. Indeed this was confirmed since increased Phe supplementation regained the animal energy output lost when CM inclusion was increased above the optimal level.

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{current trends}} in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> industry. Many identity preservation(IP) grain systems have emerged recently, driven by a confluence {{of supply and demand}} factors. IP grain requirements for specific production protocols, marketing channels, and quality assurance depend on whether the crops are trait-specific, non-GM (genetically modified), organic, or pharmaceutical. Cost structures vary according to the relative importance of segregation and risk management. High information management, greater market coordination, and frequent reliance on contracts characterize IP grains. IP grain markets are also inherently riskier, with volatile supply, inelastic demand, and fluctuating price premiums. Increasing grain differentiation is altering the marketing structure of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> industry and creating possible roles for government policy, particularly in market facilitation, standard setting, and regulations affecting food safety and biosecurity.

40|$|Between 1993 and 1996, two {{developments}} {{occurred in}} world grain markets which posed {{a potential threat}} to the food security of import-dependent developing countries. First, starting in later 1994, real grain prices increased, limiting the ability of less developed countries (LDCs) to import grain during production shortfalls.

40|$|Export demand {{functions}} for U. S. wheat were estimated for five world regions. Estimates {{of the effects}} of income, price, and nonprice variables on U. S. wheat exports were obtained using various econometric procedures. The major finding of the paper indicates that exchange rate changes have had a substantial impact on U. S. wheat ex-ports. This result, conditioned on the aggregative nature of the study, supports the belief expressed by some researchers in recent years. Some economists have suggested that dol-lar devaluations were important factors in the increased demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> during the early 1970 's. 1 Furthermore, Schuh (1974) ar-gues that an important share of the income problems of U. S. agriculture in the post-World War II period resulted from persistent over-valuation of the U. S. dollar. The argu-ment goes as follows: over-valuation of the dollar implies higher U. S. prices in terms of foreign currencies. This, in turn, reduces the demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain</b> exports, and therefore reduces the total demand (domestic and foreign) for U. <b>S.</b> <b>grain.</b> Consequently, U. <b>S.</b> domestic prices are depressed below those that would apply under correct valuation of the U. S. dollar. Schuh (1974, p. 2) expresses this result as " [...] an under-valuation of our agricultural resources in relation to their world opportunity costs. " When the opposite event occurs, namely, devaluation of the U. S. dollar, the reverse sequence of events take place. The end result in this case is both an increase in U.
