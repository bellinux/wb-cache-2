5000|$|Council of Europe: The Council of Europe {{is one of}} {{the most}} active {{intergovernmental}} institutions for the protection of human rights of athletes and youth. The Council has established norms and standards which encourage member states to adopt laws, policies and programmes. The Council of Europe has developed the 1992 <b>European</b> <b>Sports</b> <b>Charter</b> with the view to the promotion of sport as an important factor in human development and provides that Governments should take the steps necessary to apply the provisions of the Charter in accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Sports Ethics set out by the Council. This Charter will help to enable every individual to participate in sport and to ensure that all young people should have the opportunity to receive physical education instruction and the opportunity to acquire basic sports skills. The Council wants to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to take part in sport and physical recreation in a safe and healthy environment and in co-operation with the appropriate sports organisations. [...] It will also look to ensure that everyone with the interest and ability should have the opportunity to improve their standard of performance in sport and reach levels of personal achievement and/or publicly recognised levels of excellence. The Charter will also help to protect and develop the moral and ethical aspects of sport and promote the human dignity and safety of those involved in sport, by safeguarding sport, sportsmen and women from exploitation for political, commercial and financial gain and from practices that are abusive or degrading including the abuse of drugs and the sexual harassment and abuse of children, young people and women.|$|E
40|$|U svezi sa štetama nastalim u regatnom jedrenju jedno od temeljnih pitanja jest ocjena protupravnosti. Regatno jedrenje je posebno uređeno Regatnim pravilima Međunarodne jedriličarske federacije (ISAF) priznatim od strane nacionalnih jedriličarskih saveza. S obzirom na to da Regatna pravila nisu donesena u zakonodavnoj proceduri, postavlja se pitanje u kojoj mjeri i koga obvezuju, odnosno predstavljaju li dio pravnog poretka na način da se ponašanje protivno njima ocjenjuje protupravnim. Regatna pravila na području regate i za vrijeme njenog trajanja najčešće zamjenjuju opća plovidbena pravila u odnosu na druge sudionike regate. Regatna pravila ne derogiraju primjenu općih plovidbenih pravila. Nisu samostalna općeobvezujuća pravna pravila i tijela državne vlasti primijenit će ih u svezi odgovornosti za štetu nastalu pri jedriličarskim regatama samo kao dodatni kriterij koji će omogućiti ocjenu jesu li postupci štetnika bili protupravni. Sudionik regate dužan je upoznati se s tipičnim opasnostima i rizicima regatnog jedrenja. Pristanak na rizik zapravo je pristanak na poduzimanje radnje koja može izazvati štetu. Takav pristanak isključuje protupravnost radnje koja je obuhvaćena pristankom, a protupravnost je jedna od pretpostavaka odgovornosti za štetu i njezin nedostatak štetnika oslobađa odgovornosti. Pristanak na poduzimanje radnje koja može izazvati štetu, kao očitovanje volje, mora zadovoljavati sve pretpostavke koje se traže za valjano izražavanje pravno relevantne volje. To očitovanje volje daje se najčešće konkludentno samim dobrovoljnim sudjelovanjem u regati. One of {{the basic}} issues {{connected}} with damages occurring during sailing regattas is the assessment of illegality. Sailing rules for safe navigation in territorial seas and on inland waters are laid down in the Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, and for open sea navigation by the Convention on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (IRPCAS). Observance of these regulations is obligatory for any navigators. Sailing regattas are separately regulated by the Regatta Rules of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) recognised by the national sailing federation, including the Croatian Sailing Federation. However, since the Regatta Rules have not been adopted according to a legislative procedure, the question arises as to what extent and for whom they are binding, or whether they constitute {{a part of the}} legal order so that their violation is considered illegal. The Regatta Rules belong to the category of sports rules. The regulation of sports does not fall within the primary interest of public authority. From the viewpoint of a state, sports are considered as a subsidiary activity left to the corresponding sports organisations recognised by the state as national federations of particular sports. Regatta sailing is thus regulated by the Regatta Rules of the International Sailing Federation, also recognised by the Croatian Sailing Federation as a sports organisation authorised by public authority for sailing activities. Sport is of great importance for the social community and its importance in Croatia is proclaimed in the Constitution. The importance of sports is also proclaimed {{at the level of the}} Council of Europe and the European Union by the <b>European</b> <b>Sports</b> <b>Charter</b> and the Declaration on the Specific Characteristics of Sport and its Social Function in Europe. Sailing is a sport which is undoubtedly of immense social importance. The Regatta Rules applied to the area where a regatta is held and for its duration are a substitution for the general navigation rules applied to all other participants in a regatta (unless there are particular regatta instructions issued by the regatta committee specifying that the general rules are applied). Public authority tolerates the derogation of its own coercive rules because it has recognised sailing competitions as being of special social importance not specifically regulated by public authority. This tolerance applies only to regattas and those who voluntarily participate in them. Therefore, in the case of sailing boats not taking part in a regatta or encountering those which do participate, the Regatta Rules do not derogate the application of general navigation rules. The sailing regatta rules are part of the legal order (just like the rules of other recognised sports) and have their specific place within the legal order. They do not constitute independent, generally binding legal rules, and the bodies of state authority will refer to them in cases of liability for damages occurring during sailing regattas only as an additional criterion to assess the conduct of a wrongdoer as a member of society in order to establish whether the conduct during a regatta has been illegal or not. Risk is a constituent part of sailing activity. A certain level of sailing risk must be accepted by all those who voluntarily and freely decide to participate in it. Therefore, they must also accept the possibility of damages occurring during a sailing competition. In principle, consent to risk operates within the limits which the participants in a regatta have accepted when informed about the possible consequences. Every participant must acquaint himself or herself with the basic rules of sailing in a regatta and with the knowledge of at least some typical dangers that can be expected by a good seaman in any type of navigation. Having accepted the risk, they also accept to undertake various acts which may cause damages. Such acceptance excludes the illegality of an act comprised by consent (volenti non fit iniuria), and illegality is one of the preconditions for liability for damages. In the absence of such illegal acts, a wrongdoer is exempted from such liability. The consent to undertake an act which may result in some damage is a legally relevant declaration of will and must, therefore, satisfy all the preconditions required by a legal order for a valid expression of the legally relevant will. Such a declaration may be expressed in any form, and in the case of sailing regattas, it is most frequently given conclusively, i. e. by voluntary participation in a regatta...|$|E
