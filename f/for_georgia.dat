5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against {{the construction of the}} pipeline. The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline has been {{a major factor in the}} United States' support <b>for</b> <b>Georgia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bobby Dodd {{oversaw the}} {{integration}} of Georgia Tech football team as Athletic Director. Eddie McAshan was the first African American football player to start <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech. Bud Carson started McAshan in 1970 at quarterback as a sophomore and McAshan {{would go on to}} set several career records <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech (which have since been broken by Shawn Jones and Joe Hamilton). McAshan's first career start was on September 12, 1970 against South Carolina. His start marked the first time that an African American had ever started at quarterback for a major Southeastern university and McAshan did not disappoint. He rallied Tech with a fourth quarter deficit, defeating the Gamecocks 23-20 with two late touchdown drives. McAshan threw for 32 touchdowns during his college football career, and Georgia Tech had 22-13-1 record during that time frame.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{considered}} two of {{his biggest}} victories at Tech came against Alabama, including a 7–3 victory in 1952 and a 7–6 victory in 1962. The former victory secured a perfect season <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech {{which led to a}} national title. The latter victory came against a top ranked Alabama team and cost the Crimson Tide another national title.|$|E

5|$|Dodd married Alice Davis in 1933, {{and they}} had two children, Linda Dodd Thompson and Robert Lee Dodd Jr., who played quarterback for the University of Florida from 1960–61. Dodd Jr. had wanted to play <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, but Dodd {{thought it would be}} best if he played for another college. On October 1, 1960, Dodd Jr. contributed to Florida's 18-17 upset of the Yellow Jackets at Florida Field with Ray Graves, Dodd's former assistant, as Gator head coach.|$|E
5|$|During Strupper's {{three years}} playing <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, the team {{compiled}} {{a record of}} 24–0–2 and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. In Georgia Tech's record-setting 222–0 win over Cumberland College in 1916, Strupper scored eight touchdowns. For many years, 1917 Georgia Tech was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred {{as part of a}} renowned backfield including also Joe Guyon, Judy Harlan, and Al Hill. Strupper and teammate Walker Carpenter were the first players from the Deep South selected for an All-America first team.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>Georgia,</b> {{discussion}} {{centered on}} the play-calling duties of assistant coach Mike Bobo. Bobo had been named the temporary offensive coordinator for the Bulldogs after then-assistant coordinator Neil Calloway had been named the new head coach at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. Calloway would remain with the Bulldogs as the offensive line coach during the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Bobo would take over his role as offensive coordinator for the game. It was {{only the second time}} that Bobo performed as a play-caller for the Bulldogs, the previous game having come in Georgia's regular-season closer, a 15–12 win against Georgia Tech.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Dodd {{stepped down}} as head {{football}} coach due to health concerns, and he was succeeded by assistant Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950 from William Alexander. Dodd retired as athletic director in 1976 and was followed in the position by Doug Weaver. Dodd continued to serve during his retirement years as an Alumni Association consultant and as a fundraiser <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech. In 1983, he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one, but the league folded before Atlanta received a team.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, Jones filed to run <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> House of Representatives, {{this time}} in District SH 091, an open seat vacated by Dee Dawkins Haigler {{to run for the}} Georgia State Senate. In the May 2016 Democratic primary election, Jones came within sixty votes of an {{outright}} victory, but was forced into a runoff election with Rhonda Taylor. Jones won the July runoff election and in November 2016, once again won election to the Georgia House, defeating Republican Carl Anuszczyk.|$|E
5|$|On defense, Clemson {{defensive}} end Da’Quan Bowers led all defenders with 11 total tackles, {{including one for}} loss. Bowers' performance was a personal best for him and was the second-most in ACC Championship Game history. <b>For</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech, Mario Edwards was the leading tackler with seven, including two assisted tackles. Tech's Jerrard Tarrant, who had five tackles, the second-most on the team, also had one interception and returned it 50 yards. The interception and return, Tarrant's first of the season, was the longest in ACC Championship Game history. Georgia Tech's other interception was fielded by Dominique Reese, for no return.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech had the edge in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to concentrate on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could not be said <b>for</b> <b>Georgia,</b> whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.|$|E
5|$|The 18-point {{comeback}} was {{the largest}} <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> under coach Mark Richt up to that point. In recognition of their performances during the game, Georgia linebacker Tony Taylor and quarterback Matthew Stafford were named the defensive and offensive MVPs of the game, respectively. Taylor's two interceptions tied the Georgia bowl record for interceptions, first set by Scott Woerner and Ronnie Harris. The four Virginia Tech turnovers resulted in 18Georgiapoints. Georgia's sole turnover resulted in seven points for Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The {{interlocking}} GT logo {{was created}} in 1967 {{at the request of}} Bobby Dodd. One of the varsity players was asked to design a logo for the helmets. Several variations of the design were submitted, including a yellow jacket design. The yellow jacket was not submitted because to make the insect look mean {{it would have to be}} stinging and therefore flying backwards. The interlocking GT was selected during the summer of 1967 and formalized into decals for the helmets. Over the years it became the official logo <b>for</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Athletics.|$|E
