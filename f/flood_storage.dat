To allow for the drainage of surface water from the Nar Ouse Regeneration Area, the channel below the bridge on Wisbech Road has been enlarged.

Although it will not normally contain any water, in storm conditions where high water levels in the Ouse prevent the discharge of water from the Nar, the basin may be filled to a depth of up to , and will drain back into the river once tide levels fall, normally after 5 to 6 hours.

25|$|The Puyallup River and {{its main}} tributary, the White River, have been {{subjected}} to major modifications during the 20th century. The Puyallup River between Sumner and its mouth at Tacoma was straightened. A diversion dam was built at Game Farm Park in 1914 to prevent the White River from flowing on its natural course into the Green River at Auburn; since then it has flowed into the Puyallup River instead of the Green River. Flood protection structures were built along many rivers in the basin, including extensive levees. A <b>flood</b> <b>storage</b> reservoir, Mud Mountain Lake, was created on the White River with the construction of Mud Mountain Dam. As part of the flood control efforts, river channels and embankments have been generally kept clear of debris such as gravel bars, large trees, logjams, and other woody debris. These modifications have radically altered the natural character of the rivers. River widths have been generally reduced. Water now fills nearly all of the land between river banks, instead of the historic pattern of braided meanders and wetlands.|$|E

25|$|Morgan hired nearly 50 {{engineers}} {{to analyze the}} Miami Valley watershed and precipitation patterns and to determine the flood volume. They analyzed European flood data for information about general flooding patterns. Based on this analysis, Morgan presented eight different flood control plans to the City of Dayton officials in October 1913. The city selected a plan based on the flood control system in the Loire Valley in France. It consisted of five earthen dams and modifications to the river channel through Dayton. The dams would have conduits to release {{a limited amount of}} water, and a wider river channel would use larger levees supported by a series of training levees. <b>Flood</b> <b>storage</b> areas behind the dams would be used as farmland between floods. Morgan's goal was to develop a flood plan that would handle 140 percent of the water from the 1913 flood. The analysis had determined the river channel boundaries for the expected 1,000-year major floods, and all businesses located in that area were to be relocated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Flooding in the {{northern}} part of The Netherlands has caused serious economic threats to densely populated areas. Therefore a project has been carried out in a pilot area to assess the retention of water in two river basins as a way to reduce flooding. The physically-based groundwater and sur-face water model SIMGRO was used to model the hydrology of the basins. The model was calibrated using discharges and groundwater levels. Scenarios of measures to assess the possibility of retaining water in the basin were then defined and tested. The first measure was the retention of higher dis-charges using culverts or gates in the upstream part of the basin. The second measure was to make the streams shallower and thereby, increase <b>flood</b> plain <b>storage.</b> The last measure was <b>flood</b> water <b>storage</b> in a designated area in the downstream part of one basin. The analysis indicates that holding water in the upstream parts of the basins proved to be feasible and can result in significant reductions of peak flows...|$|R

500|$|In 1960, {{there was}} {{extensive}} flooding of the Rother Valley, with some [...] inundated, {{and in some}} areas the water did not recede for several months. In 1962 the Kent River Board introduced a bill to Parliament, which would authorise improvements to the river banks, {{with the construction of}} a sluice and associated lock below Rye, to prevent tidal flooding. At the time, the river was used by a fishing fleet of at least ten trawlers, and a freighter of 250 tons used the river for a trade in timber. There was some concern in the House of Lords that the lock would not be large enough to accommodate the freighter, although {{it would be possible to}} open both sets of lock gates when the tide level was suitable. The bill did not become an Act of Parliament, due to lack of parliamentary time, and so the sluice was not constructed. However, the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme began in 1966, and was completed in 1980. This involved raising the level of the floodbanks along much of the river. Those in the Wet Level, an area of [...] between the junction with the Maytham Sewer and Blackwall Bridge, were not raised as much, so that during periods of high flow when the river is tide-locked, the levels can be used for <b>flood</b> <b>storage.</b> The scheme included the installation of 20 pumping stations, which raise water from the low-lying marshes into the embanked river using Archimedes' screw pumps. Some of the drainage ditches in the marshland had to be reconfigured to deliver the water to the pumping stations.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Additional demands are being placed upon reservoirs to meet a variety of diverse needs. These demands require efficient management of the limited storage through reservoir operations. This efficiency is most critical with water supply reservoirs. Reservoirs operated strictly for conservation purposes typically provide only incidental flood control. As the construction age of water resources declines, innovative strategies to utilize the finite water supplies Must be developed. Significant numbers of reallocations in reservoir <b>storage</b> between <b>flood</b> control and water supply pools have occurred in the past. Historically, storage transfer has increased the conservation pool at the cost of <b>flood</b> control <b>storage</b> due to the greater direct economic benefits associated with municipal and industrial water supply. This transfer can only occur in multipurpose reservoirs; however, the majority of reservoirs contain no <b>flood</b> control <b>storage.</b> This characteristic is fostered by the high (and generally rising) cost of including the flood control purpose in the reservoir scope. This investigation presents findings specific to operating strategies of reservoirs lacking <b>flood</b> control <b>storage.</b> The non-structural strategies applied include seasonal and permanent reallocations of water supply <b>storage</b> for <b>flood</b> control purposes. Lake Limestone in Central Texas serves as the case study. The highly variable conditions of the watershed commonly exhibit both hydrologic extremes, floods and droughts. The agency responsible for this reservoir, the Brazos River Authority (BRA), is intensifying their efforts in the management of the water resources under their jurisdiction. This active role highlights the legal aspects involving water resources management; and, in particular, reservoir operations. Thus, the related matter of institutional liabilities of reservoir operations are discussed herein to give a comprehensive view of the affiliated concerns in the complex world of reservoir operations...|$|R

The built areas in the city increased during the study period by approximately four folds while the population increased by more than 10 folds. The study results demonstrate the historical increase in runoff potential, flooding potential and runoff coefficient and decline in water storage potential.
