5|$|There were 100–200 HV {{troops in}} Kupres during the battle. Those {{included}} a group <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 204th Brigade, led by Robert Zadro (son of late Blago Zadro, former {{commander of the}} 3rd Battalion of the brigade). During the fighting, elements of the Zrinski Battalion reached Kupres, while relatively small groups of soldiers <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Frankopan Battalion and the 4th Guards Brigade arrived when the battle was nearly over. A company <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 126th Infantry Brigade was deployed in Šuica, but it is unclear if it actively {{took part in the}} battle. There were also Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS) units raised in Tomislavgrad and Posušje, which were involved in the fighting around Kupres. At the time, overall command of the Bosnian Croat forces was held by Brigadier Milivoj Petković.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the smaller}} Biblical scenes and {{supported}} by the Ignudi are ten circular parade shields, sometimes described as being painted to resemble bronze.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Ohio, Hensley {{returned to his}} personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha would read passages from the Bible during services, after which Hensley would deliver a sermon on a theme <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> verses. He also frequently preached {{on the topic of}} faith healing during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Fumito Kondō {{considered}} the print revolutionary; such expressive, individualized faces are {{not seen in}} the stereotyped figures {{in the works of}} Utamaro's predecessors such as Harunobu and Kiyonaga, {{and it was the first}} time in ukiyo-e history that the beauties were <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> general urban population rather than the pleasure quarters.|$|E
5|$|In early September, the German Army {{had sent}} a strong force into San Marino to defend it against the Allies; this would also give them control {{of one of the}} major roads in the area, and allow {{artillery}} observers to occupy the mountain peaks. The defending force was <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 278. Infanterie-Division, whilst the 4th Indian Division was assigned to attack it on the 17th.|$|E

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{for digital}} {{terrestrial}} television in Australia {{can be traced back}} to 1993, when a group of specialists was <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> then-Australian Broadcasting Authority, Department of Transport and Communications, in addition to broadcasters and manufacturers. The ABA Specialist Group was intended to bring together studies taking place in a number of Australian forums and investigate potential options and policies relating to digital television.|$|E
5|$|Registered daffodils {{are given}} a {{division}} number and colour code such as 5W-W ('Thalia'). In horticultural usage {{it is not uncommon}} to also find another unofficial division of 'Miniatures', which, although <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. These are sometimes referred to by nurseries as 'Division 14'. Over 140 narcissus cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

5|$|The Senate is the {{statutory}} body responsible for governing the University's academic matters, including teaching and research, and the regulation {{and direction of}} the education and conduct of students. The composition of the Senate is <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> academic staff of the University, together with a number of ex-officio, elected and co-opted members. The Chair of the Senate is the President and Vice-Chancellor of the University.|$|E
5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nobility, the same social class {{that served as the}} recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E

5|$|The current {{concrete}} {{stairs to}} the keep are modern, and the original medieval stairway, made from timber and stone, would have incorporated a drawbridge just before the castle doors.

5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E

5|$|These {{themes were}} later expounded upon in The Fundamentals, {{a series of}} essays financed by wealthy Presbyterians Milton and Lyman Stewart.
