40|$|Three {{deformation}} measurement experiments have been undertaken where, in each experiment, a structure {{was subject to}} controlled loading. Terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) were used to make measurements at critical intervals during each load test. TLSs, which are a relatively recent innovation, are capable of rapidly capturing thousands of three dimensional points {{over the surface of}} an object. They are largely untried in the area of structural deformation monitoring. The purpose of these tests is to assess the sensitivity of TLSs for the measurement of vertical deformation of loaded structures and to investigate their potential for metrology tasks where remote observations (completely non-contact and targetless at distances greater than 5 m) are desirable. A Riegl LMS-Z 210 laser scanner was used for all three experiments and a Cyra Cyrax 2500 was available for the first. The point cloud data were represented with analytical models representing the vertical deflection of each beam. The development of these models required knowledge of the dimensions of the beam, spatial position of the load point(s) and support points. Functional models (low-order polynomials) were derived based on <b>generalised</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the analytical models.

40|$|Abstract- An {{analysis}} of connectedness in the French Holstein cattle population was carried out. This study {{was motivated by}} the fact that artificial insemination (AI) bulls are evaluated at the national level, whereas they are usually progeny tested only in the region of their AI stud. Connectedness among AI studs was measured by the <b>generalised</b> <b>coefficient</b> of determination (CD) of contrasts between mean breeding values of bulls from the different AI studs. Four connectedness components were distinguished. The relative influence of each component was assessed through the increase in prediction error variance (PEV) of the contrasts after this information was discarded. CDs of contrasts were always higher than 0. 80. Therefore, connectedness level among AI studs was high and provided an accurate national genetic evaluation. Out of the different components of connectedness, withdrawing of proven bull connection data caused the greatest increase in PEV (+ 47. 5 %) primarily due to the change in the connecting structure of the data. Genetic relationships among bulls were the next important source of information. In contrast, contributions fro...|$|R

40|$|Environmental impact estimations, {{often carried}} out in the {{framework}} of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on production machines and machine tools, show that a significant (if not the greatest) part of the environmental impact is related to the use-phase of the machine. A closer analysis reveals that the energy efficiency of the bearing systems, i. e. their friction loss, is the main culprit in this. Cost reduction and maintenance savings were the main motivations that initiated tribology as a scientific discipline (cf. Jost report), which is presently becoming more pertinent than ever, warranting new investigations in light of the advances made thus far in tribological technology. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the total energy efficiency of the various (classes of) bearing solutions: plain, fluid, rolling-element, and magnetic, by means of a dimensionless performance number. This number is a <b>generalised</b> <b>coefficient</b> of friction (CoF) that works as a measure of this efficiency, which we call the ‘performance’ or the ‘total’ coefficient of friction, depending on the type of assessment.

Therefore, measuring the quality of clustering is an important issue by itself. This is exactly the issue this work is dealing with.

Our approach not only inherits many desirable statistical properties from the local maximum likelihood estimation and nonconcave penalised likelihood method, but also computationally attractive thanks to the proposed computational algorithm. Under some mild conditions, we establish the theoretical properties for the proposed procedure such as sparsity, oracle property and the uniform convergence rates of the proposed estimators.

40|$|The {{clustering}} coefficient {{has been}} used successfully to summarise important features of unweighted, undirected networks across {{a wide range of}} applications in complexity science. Recently, a number of authors have extended this concept to the case of networks with non-negatively weighted edges. After reviewing various alternatives, we focus on a definition due to Zhang and Horvath that {{can be traced back to}} earlier work of Grindrod. We give a natural and transparent derivation of this clustering coefficient and then analyse its properties. One attraction of this version is that it deals directly with weighted edges and avoids the need to discretise, that is, to round weights up to 1 or down to 0. This has the advantages of (a) retaining all edge weight information, and (b) eliminating the requirement for an arbitrary cutoff level. Further, the extended definition is much less likely to break down due to a ‘divide-by-zero’. Using our new derivation and focusing on some special cases allows us to gain insights into the typical behaviour of this measure. We then illustrate the idea by computing the <b>generalised</b> clustering <b>coefficients,</b> along with the corresponding weighted degrees, for pairwise correlation gene expression data arising from microarray experiments.

40|$|In most meson strong {{decay and}} unquenched (coupled-channel) quark models, the pair-creation {{operator}} is a scalar product of vectors in the spin and spatial degrees of freedom. While differing in the spatial part, most models {{have the same}} spin part, which creates a qq* pair coupled to spin triplet, with the spins of the initial quarks as spectators. This is a basic assumption of the 3 P 0 model, and is well-known to arise also in the flux tube model, starting from the strong coupling expansion of lattice QCD. In this article the same structure is shown {{to emerge in the}} Cornell model, in the dominant contributions of a more general microscopic decay model, and in the pseudoscalar-meson emission model. A solution is obtained for arbitrary matrix elements in these ``non-flip, triplet'' models, expressed as a weighted sum over spatial matrix elements. The coefficients in the expansion, which involve the spin degrees of freedom and the associated angular momentum algebra, are model-independent. Tables of the angular momentum coefficients are presented which can be used in future calculations, avoiding tedious Clebsch-Gordan sums.
