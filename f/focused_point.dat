5000|$|Checkpoint {{is a part}} of the {{independent}} digital documentary movement in the early 2000s, thanks to the introduction of relatively inexpensive digital tape-based video cameras and the sudden affordability of powerful desktop video editing systems.This in-the-trenches filmmaking lent itself to direct cinema or cinéma vérité, a definition that spans from reality TV to the Pennebaker films of the 1960s. Even the astoundingly popular documentaries in the 2000s such as Fahrenheit -9-11 and Supersize Me may have been driven by narrative and personal point of view, but their camera style certainly draws on the vérité trope of letting reality play out before the camera. Recalled as The Year of the Documentary, these films came out in 2004 during a convergence of new media possibilities and world conflict including 9-11, as well as tensions in the Middle East during the Second Intifada, according to Paul Falzone in his dissertation, Documentary of Change.“From this conflict emerges a generation of muckraking filmmakers and a new style of documenting filmmaking,” wrote Falzone. Maxine Baker in her book, “Documenting in the Digital Age” goes a bit further. She refers to the digital revolution as no less as explosive as the Lumiere Brothers’ invention of the Cinematograph during the turn of the 19th Century. According to Falzone, a specific kind of documentary was forged by filmmakers looking to challenge mainstream media’s interpretation of events. She observed that this new batch of films tended to replace the protagonist with antagonist. In Checkpoint’s case, the director Shamir replaced the antagonist with the subject, which in turn served as the antagonist. But while the director may have omitted narration or any stated point of view, he sticks to the vérité technique of hammering home a <b>focused</b> <b>point.</b> Checkpoint follows the looming sense of futility from shutting down access between two groups of people.In an interview with Documentary Film Quarterly in 2004, Shamir says, “Everybody is like a victim; the soldiers, the Palestinians. I want to show what effects the occupation has on the Palestinians but even more what the effects are on society.” ...|$|E

However, the complex three-dimensional distribution of cells on LBC slides requires manual focusing, long scanning-times, and multi-layer scanning. Here, we present a solution that overcomes these limitations in two steps: first, we make sure that <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> are only set on cells. Secondly, we check the total slide focus quality. From a first analysis we detected that superficial dust can {{be separated from the}} cell layer (thin layer of cells on the glass slide) itself. Then we analyzed 2, 295 individual <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> from 51 LBC slides stained for p 16 and Ki 67. Using the number of edges in a <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> image, specific color values and size-inclusion filters, <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> detecting cells could be distinguished from <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> on artifacts (accuracy 98. 6 %). Sharpness as total focus quality of a virtual LBC slide is computed from 5 sharpness features. We trained a multi-parameter SVM classifier on 1, 600 images. On an independent validation set of 3, 232 cell images we achieved an accuracy of 94. 8 % for classifying images as focused. Our results show that single-layer scanning of LBC slides is possible and how it can be achieved. We assembled <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> analysis and sharpness classification into a fully automatic, iterative workflow, free of user intervention, which performs repetitive slide scanning as necessary. On 400 LBC slides we achieved a scanning-time of 13. 9 ± 10. 1 min with 29. 1 ± 15. 5 <b>focus</b> <b>points.</b> In summary, the integration of semantic focus information into whole-slide imaging allows automatic high-quality imaging of LBC slides and subsequent biomarker analysis...|$|R

The micro-lenses were fabricated {{on both sides of}} the substrates which were aligned to each other. The optical properties of these lenses were characterised by a laser scanning transmission/reflection confocal microscope. It has been confirmed by the confocal microscopy technique that the laser beam was focused twice as it shone through the substrates.
