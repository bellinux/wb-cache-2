5|$|The odd girth is, equivalently, the {{smallest}} odd number g {{for which there}} exists a homomorphism from the cycle graph on g vertices to G. For this reason, if G → H, then the odd girth of G is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal to the odd girth of H.|$|E
5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal to F'N+1 which in turn is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal to the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks.

5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found to be less than, <b>greater</b> <b>than,</b> <b>or</b> equal to another number.|$|E

5|$|Tau Ceti {{has been}} a target of a radial {{velocity}} planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured over a five-year time span. This result excludes the presence of hot Jupiters, and probably excludes any planets with minimum mass <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> equal to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.|$|E

Vargha and Delaney [28] suggest that A-statistic of <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 0.64 (<b>or</b> less <b>than</b> 0.36) is indicative of “medium” effect size, and of <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> 0.71 (<b>or</b> less <b>than</b> 0.29) can be indicative of a “large” effect size.|$|R
