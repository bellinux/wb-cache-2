40|$|AbstractOrthographic Learning Through Self-Teaching: Effects of Decoding Accuracy, Decoding Speed, Word Length, Morphology, and Individual DifferencesbyMaria Deborah CallahanDoctor of Philosophy in EducationUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Anne E. Cunningham, ChairThe self-teaching {{hypothesis}} (Share, 1995) {{posits that}} readers learn the orthography of new words incidentally {{through the process}} of phonological recoding. In the current study, the self-teaching hypothesis was tested by simulating everyday reading through the use of real and pseudowords, analyzing the effects of syllable length, and considering the independent contributions of general cognitive ability, including rapid naming ability and prior orthographic knowledge. A total of 94 second grade children were presented with 24 pseudoword targets over a 7 -week period, each embedded 4 times within a short passage to be read aloud and independently. The targets varied by length (containing 1, 2, or 3 syllables) and by morphological legality (with real affixes or fabricated affixes). Findings indicated that the length of a word and its morphological legality significantly influenced decoding speed and accuracy. Shorter words were read faster and more accurately than longer words, although the difference in accuracy between 2 - and 3 -syllable words was only seen in the morphologically <b>illegal</b> <b>condition.</b> In all cases, morphologically legal words were read faster and more accurately than their morphologically illegal counterparts. A week after encountering a new pseudoword, the children were assessed for orthographic learning using two measures [...] an orthographic choice task and a naming task. Children demonstrated robust orthographic learning on the orthographic choice posttest for all words, regardless of word length or morphological legality, and for 2 - and 3 -syllable words on the naming posttest. There were no word length effects on posttest performance, however morphologically legal words resulted in more orthographic learning on the orthographic choice task than their illegal counterparts. In order to examine mediating factors that may contribute to children's orthographic learning, measures of vocabulary, prior orthographic knowledge rapid automatized naming, morphological awareness, and print exposure were administered. Children were also given tests to measure individual levels of vocabulary, prior orthographic knowledge, rapid automatized naming, morphological awareness, and print exposure. These factors, along with decoding speed, decoding accuracy, morphological legality, and word length were then analyzed for the contributions to orthographic learning using hierarchical linear and logistic regression models. Consistent with prior research, decoding accuracy and prior orthographic knowledge were the most powerful independent predictors of orthographic learning. The trajectories of decoding speed and accuracy across 4 exposures to a new word were also examined. It was observed that decoding duration time drops off dramatically after the first encounter and, intriguingly, that children tend to stay with their first pronunciation of a word, accurate or inaccurate...|$|E

40|$|An {{estimated}} 500, 000 women, 99 {{percent of}} them from the developing world, die each year from pregnancy-related causes. About three quarters of these deaths are the direct result of obstetrical complications [...] hemorrhage, infection, toxemia, obstructed labor, and abortion (under primitive and <b>illegal</b> <b>conditions).</b> An estimated equivalent number of infants do not survive their mother's death. For surviving mothers, the consequences of pregnancy have a severe impact on health and family economics. The strategy for safe motherhood is based on two approaches. First, the encouragement of activities that indirectly improve maternal health. These include education, policies to improve women's rights and working conditions, health care and nutrition, transportation and communication systems, water and sanitation facilities, and increases in family income and food production. The second approach targets activities to reduce maternal deaths. These activities include reducing unwanted pregnancies through the provision of family planning services, and through national policies that recognize the importance of this issue. A second objective is to reduce the risks of pregnancy through providing community-based family planning and prenatal services to identify high-risk cases'adequate referral services for the complications of pregnancy, and communication and transport systems to support patient referral procedures.

40|$|Today in the EU, {{within which}} the labour factor is {{relatively}} scarce, policies of open goods markets are often linked to closed labour markets for foreign manpower. These policies do contrast with well known theoretical models of international commerce, as stated by Heckscher-Ohlin and Stolper-Samuelson (Leamer, 1995) demonstrating that labour mobility (migration) and goods mobility (free trade) are substitutes, {{that is to say}} international commerce and international labour mobility can generate the same economic effects in the involved countries and the increase of the first can reduce to zero the second one (Mundell, 1957). The Euro-Mediterranean strategy embraces this point of view, even though local policies (national and regional) continue to protect local labour market not considering that recent researches assure foreign manpower doesn’t spoil local resident wages and actually contribute to local economies (Longhi, Nijkamp e Poot, 2005).

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} women in Chile embody being criminalized for abortion {{in the context}} of inequality. Using a critical phenomenological research design, an element of this research focused on structural, cultural, and direct forms of violence against women. The study is anchored in the narratives of poor, indigenous, and immigrant women who have a history of terminating a pregnancy under <b>illegal</b> <b>conditions.</b> Participants revealed that the construction of laws and policies regulate and control women’s reproductive lives and construct them as criminals; that cultural systems of inequality legitimize and sustain harmful attitudes and practices; and that structural and cultural violence manifest as concrete expressions of discrimination and other forms of violence against women. The in-depth interviews with women who have a history of terminating a pregnancy revealed how illegality is inscribed upon a woman’s body and embodied reality, linking broader constructs of violence to lived experience. Women’s narratives uncovered how their voice and experience with abortion are rendered invisible within clandestine spaces of illegality and only made visible as a result of health or legal consequences. Despite barriers negotiating and embodying inequality within a highly criminalized environment women revealed resistance to dominant structures, laws, and cultural discourse, illustrating individual and collective forms of agency. The role of social work is vital on both policy and practice levels. This research calls on social workers to challenge a criminal justice paradigm as a response to social issues; understand the conditions that affect women’s reproductive health, such as poverty and discrimination; and work toward the implementation of a social justice and human rights-based approach to reproductive health and wellbeing...|$|R
