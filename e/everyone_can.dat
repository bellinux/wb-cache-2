5|$|When {{asked by}} {{the staff of the}} {{magazine}} Animerica if the anime was influenced by Western superheros like Spider-Man or Batman, Taniguchi denied that influence. Instead, he said his inspirations for s-CRY-ed were other works he had produced for Sunrise. The society shown in the series was not meant to be another take on classic superheroes but instead investigate how <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> adapt to their own situation. While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented. To distinguish the HOLY members, the Sunrise staff researched the costumes they could design. Taniguchi said their outfits are meant to resemble prison uniforms.|$|E
5|$|According to the Coat of Arms Act, <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> use the Polish flag, {{especially}} during national and cultural events, {{as long as}} it is done in a respectful manner. This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty. Until 2004, Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays. The use of both variants was restricted, but only flying the flag with coat of arms was, from 1955 until 1985, punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year. After 1985, unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction. A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially-promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre-war (and current) national holiday of Poland, the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable, no later than the following day it must have been hidden.|$|E

5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> break a single stick, but no one can break a bundle of sticks.|$|E

25|$|Linda Gottfredson (2006) {{has argued}} that {{thousands}} of studies support the importance of intelligence quotient (IQ) in predicting school and job performance, and numerous other life outcomes.

25|$|In this noise society, the {{collective}} expectation of privacy will increase, but the individual expectation of privacy will decrease. In other words, not <b>everyone</b> <b>can</b> be analyzed in detail, but one individual can be. Also, {{in order to}} stay unobserved, it can hence be better to blend in with the others than trying to use for example encryption technologies and similar methods. Technologies for this can be called Jante-technologies after the Law of Jante, which states that you are nobody special.|$|E
