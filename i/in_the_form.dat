The {{study was conducted to}} get a complete feed of dairy cows that can be developed commercially. The evaluation was done on a physical test: bulkiness, hardness and hygroscopic properties of pressed complete feeds. The results of this research showed that the bulkiness of pressed complete feed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> cubes, cylinders and balls were between 0. 20 up to 0. 48 liter/kg; the hardness of pressed complete feed, cylinders and balls were 3 lbs up to 14 lbs; the hygroscopic factor of pressed complete feed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> cubes, cylinders and balls were around 1. 10 % up to 9. 69 %. The pressed complete feed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> of cube and cylinder are better than <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of ball <b>in</b> physical characteristics...|$|R
