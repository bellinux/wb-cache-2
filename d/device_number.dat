2500|$|An {{overcurrent}} relay {{is a type}} of protective relay which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value. The ANSI <b>device</b> <b>number</b> is 50 for an instantaneous over current (IOC) or a Definite Time Overcurrent (DTOC). In a typical application the over current relay is connected to a current transformer and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level. When the relay operates, one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip (open) a circuit breaker. The Definite Time Overcurrent Relay has been used extensively in the United Kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source {{led to the development of}} the IDMT relay.|$|E
60|$|In that interval, Mrs. Norbury's maid {{found an}} {{opportunity}} of confidentially informing the valet {{of what had}} passed between her mistress and herself. The valet had other friends to whom he related the circumstances in his turn. In due course of time, the narrative, passing from mouth to mouth, reached the ears of the manager. He instantly saw that the credit of the hotel was in danger, unless something was done to retrieve {{the character of the}} room numbered Fourteen. English travellers, well acquainted with the peerage of their native country, informed him that Henry Westwick and Mrs. Norbury were {{by no means the only}} members of the Montbarry family. Curiosity might bring more of them to the hotel, after hearing what had happened. The manager's ingenuity easily hit on the obvious means of misleading them, in this case. The numbers of all the rooms were enamelled in blue, on white china plates, screwed to the doors. He ordered a new plate to be prepared, bearing the number, '13 A'; and he kept the room empty, after its tenant for the time being had gone away, until the plate was ready. He then re-numbered the room; placing the removed Number Fourteen on the door of his own room (on the second floor), which, not being to let, had not previously been numbered at all. By this <b>device,</b> <b>Number</b> Fourteen disappeared at once and for ever from the books of the hotel, as the number of a bedroom to let.|$|E

50|$|This parameter, the <b>device</b> <b>number,</b> {{identifies}} {{a specific}} peripheral {{attached to the}} computer. Devices 0 through 3 address the keyboard, tape cassette, RS-232 interface, and video display, respectively, {{all of which are}} directly controlled by the kernal ROM. Device numbers 4 and higher address devices attached to the peripheral bus, such as printers or disk drives. In the case of a disk drive, the <b>device</b> <b>number</b> refers to the unit's controller, not the drive mechanism(s) within the unit. By convention, the first disk drive unit on a system has <b>device</b> <b>number</b> 8, the second drive, if present, 9, etc., up to a maximum of 15. The <b>device</b> <b>number</b> scheme was derived from the IEEE-488 or general purpose interface bus (GPIB) that was used with the Commodore PET/CBM models.
