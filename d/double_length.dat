500|$|The {{episode was}} {{made as a}} pilot for the new Star Trek series, and was a <b>double</b> <b>length</b> episode at Paramount Television Group's insistence. After the show was {{initially}} announced on October 10, 1986, Roddenberry put together a production team which included staff members from the original series such as Robert H. Justman. The show utilized some existing sets and props from the Star Trek films and both [...] and [...] New actors were hired for the pilot, which in some cases required the character concepts to be redeveloped to better fit the actor. Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby were hired for the roles of Macha Hernandez and Deanna Troi respectively, but were later switched by Roddenberry and Crosby's new role renamed to Tasha Yar. DeForest Kelley agreed to appear in a cameo role in the pilot but as a gesture to Roddenberry, he refused to be paid more than the minimum possible salary. The show made its debut in syndication to a mixed critical response, an assessment which was upheld by critics reassessing the episode {{following the end of}} the entire series.|$|E

2500|$|Wire selection, {{when making}} a cantilever, is principally {{determined}} by {{the length of the}} cantilever itself. Factors of importance are the load/deflection rate and the maximum elastic moment or yield moment. If a cantilever has to be short (e.g. 10mm), it is important to use a wire with a low stiffness, i.e. high elasticity as beta titanium 0.018" [...] round. This wire does, however, rotate in the bracket and can thus only be applied when welded to a stiffer, 0.017"x0.025" [...] piece of wire. The yield moment (My) of this wire is 1450gm-mm, thus deforming permanently with 145gm of activation. If the cantilever had a <b>double</b> <b>length</b> (20mm), its maximum activation would be [...] 72.5gm.|$|E

The effect of reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, space velocity, feed composition), {{as well as the}} effect of support to ZSM- 5 zeolite ratio on the conversion of methanol to light olefins (C 2 <b>double</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash–C 4 <b>double</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash) was studied. The best catalyst and optimum reaction conditions leading to a maximum yield of C 2 <b>double</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash–C 4 <b>double</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash were determined. Use of γ-alumina as support improved the catalyst selectivity to propene and light olefins. Zeolite/alumina catalyst with 25 wt. % ZSM- 5 dispersed in a matrix containing 75 % alumina led to highest selectivity to propene and light olefins. ZSM- 5 zeolite was modified with phosphorus, Cs, Ca and Fe. The effect of their impregnation on the conversion of methanol and selectivity to light olefins was studied. Modification in all cases increased the shape-selectivity to light olefins. ZSM- 5 zeolite ion exchanged by Cs led to highest selectivity to light olefins and particularly propene by changing the acid sites distribution...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{security}} of <b>double</b> block <b>length</b> hash functions with rate 1, {{which are based on}} a block cipher with a block length of n bits and a key length of 2 n bits, is reconsidered. Counter-examples and new attacks are presented on this general class of fast <b>double</b> block <b>length</b> hash functions, which reveal unnoticed flaws in the necessary conditions given by Satoh et al. and Hirose. Preimage and second preimage attacks are presented on Hirose’s two examples which were left as an open problem. Our synthetic analysis show that all rate- 1 hash functions in FDBL-II are failed to be optimally (second) preimage resistant. The necessary conditions are refined for ensuring a subclass of hash functions in FDBL-II to be optimally secure against collision attacks. In particular, one of Hirose’s two examples, which satisfies our refined conditions, is proven to be indifferentiable from a random oracle in the ideal cipher model. The security results are extended to a new class of <b>double</b> block <b>length</b> hash functions with rate 1, where the key length of one block cipher used in the compression function is equal to the block length, whereas the other is doubled.
