5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} never {{seemed to have a}} dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E

25|$|Ackerson was {{not worried}} with the album being perfect; for example, when Pierre forgot {{to record a}} lyric at the studio, he {{recorded}} it on his computer {{and sent it to}} Ackerson, who simply added reverb and mixed it into the recording. The band at the time considered their work on <b>Go</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> than anything they had done prior, which included hiring a live string ensemble to perform. The band finished 16–17 songs, using 11 for the album and the remainder for B-sides and bonus tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Lynn Keller {{notes that}} the long poem enabled modernists to include sociological, anthropological, and {{historical}} material. [...] Many long poems deal with history not in the revisionary sense but as a simple re-telling {{in order to prove}} a point. [...] Then there are those who <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> and recite a place's or people's history in order to teach. [...] Like revisionary mythopoesis, they may attempt to make a point or demonstrate a new perspective by exaggerating or editing certain parts of a history.|$|E
2500|$|Where a fixed trust {{gives the}} trustee no discretion, and a {{discretionary}} trust gives the trustee discretion and requires him to exercise it, powers <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further.</b> A [...] "mere power", while not a trust obligation, grants the holder {{of the power}} the ability to exercise it, but without any requirement to do so. These powers are normally given to trustees; Hudson gives {{the example of a}} situation where the trust instrument states that [...] "the trustee may advance £1,000 to X". The trustee has the power to advance £1,000, but as evidenced by the word [...] "may", is not required to. However, the trustee is bound to consider exercising his powers, and must be able to justify his use. In Re Hay's ST, Megarry VC said that: ...|$|E

60|$|The latter {{supposition}} {{might have}} been an admissible one in a very early period of our study of nature.
