25|$|The Miami Herald {{reports that}} Abul Hashem's family didn't know what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> until 2004, when the Red Crescent {{informed}} {{them he was}} in Guantanamo.|$|E
25|$|Marshall's {{family did}} not know what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> until several months later when they {{received}} a letter from Marshall's cousin F. Lewis Marshall informing them that James K. Marshall died at Gettysburg. The family had heard conflicting reports, and hoped that he was a prisoner of war.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2010, {{just hours}} {{before the start of}} his tour in Eugene, Oregon, O'Brien {{announced}} that he would host a new show on cable station TBS. The show debuted on November 8, 2010, and airs Monday through Thursday beginning at 11:00pm ET/10:00pm CT. O'Brien's addition moved Lopez Tonight with George Lopez back one hour to midnight ET/11:00pm CT. Refusing at first to do to Lopez what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> at NBC, O'Brien agreed to join the network after Lopez called to persuade him to come to TBS. In Canada, CTV would air the show and in Turkey, CNBC-e would air the show.|$|E
50|$|That night, Gary {{proceeds}} alone {{out onto}} the island where he is bitten by a giant spider and turns into some type of spider-man beast. He flees into the woods, leaving the women <b>to</b> wonder what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> The next day, seemingly possessed by uncontrollable violent urges, Gary kills one of the girls. The remaining women, still unaware of what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>have</b> no idea {{that he is the}} one who has done this.|$|R

25|$|With {{his freedom}} restored, the Doctor chose to {{counteract}} his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered {{all manner of}} unusual beings – from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> had happened for a reason, and {{he might as well}} make use of the advantages it offered.|$|E
25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E
500|$|Manekshaw was {{evacuated}} {{from the battlefield}} by Sher Singh, his orderly, who took him to an Australian surgeon from the medical team. The surgeon initially declined to treat Manekshaw, {{saying that he was}} badly wounded and his chances of survival were very low, but Singh forced him to treat Manekshaw. Meanwhile, Manekshaw regained consciousness, and when the surgeon asked what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> he replied that he was [...] "kicked by a mule." [...] Impressed by Manekshaw's sense of humour, he treated him, and removed seven bullets from his lungs, liver, and kidneys. Much of his intestines were removed and stitched. Over Manekshaw's protests that he treat the other patients, the regimental medical officer, Captain G. M. Diwan, attended to him.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1990, Fatt (whose {{nickname}} is [...] "Fatty") {{has taken}} a photo a day documenting the most eventful thing that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He was [...] "a keen surfer".|$|R
500|$|XF-104 53-7787 {{was lost}} on 14 April 1955 after accumulating over 1,000 flying hours when test pilot Herman Salmon {{was forced to}} eject during gun firing trials at [...] The gun malfunctioned during a test firing, and severe {{vibrations}} began to build up which knocked loose the ejection hatch below the cockpit. Cabin pressure was lost with Salmon's pressure suit inflating and covering his face {{so that he could}} not see. Recalling LeVier's harrowing experience with the exploding cannon shell the previous December, Salmon believed that the same thing <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and that he had no option but to eject. He later found out that he could have saved 53-7787 by bringing it down to a lower altitude and waiting for his pressure suit to deflate. With the loss of the armament testbed, Lockheed engineers were forced to find an alternative, and armament trials were continued on a modified Lockheed F-94C Starfire. The two XF-104s amassed an approximate total of 2,500 flight hours.|$|E
2500|$|... "Frank {{was talking}} to Sarah on the telephone. They were arguing. He {{went out into the}} garden and let his shotgun off into the air. She was frightened that {{something}} <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and called the emergency services. He did it to try to make her scared." ...|$|E
2500|$|The furious Count de Tour {{threatens to}} leave the [...] "accursed house and this accursed country" [...] in a fury (Selby had already {{been removed from the}} scene earlier on, with no {{explanation}} of what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> It was presumed that he had been sent back to Europe after this scheme failed so miserably).|$|E

6000|$|... "Body of me--the old Worcester man?" [...] {{said the}} King. [...] "Oddsfish, I {{remember}} <b>him</b> well--some harm <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> I think--Is he not dead, or very sick at least?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On the 2003–04 tour of Australia, Vermeulen {{fractured}} {{his skull}} during a One-Day International match against India. [...] This {{was the second}} time this <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> inside a year, after the identical injury occurred in February 2003 while practising. [...] Successful surgery has limited the impact that these injuries have had on Vermeulen's cricketing career.|$|E
2500|$|... 11 And all his brethren and {{his sisters}} heard all that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{and they came}} to him, and so did all that had known him from the first: and they ate and drank with him, and comforted him, and {{wondered}} at all that the Lord had brought upon him: and each one gave him a lamb, and four drachms’ weight of gold, even of unstamped gold.|$|E
2500|$|Selby {{is injured}} pretty badly, {{and while he}} is in his bed, Mrs. Warbucks screams at and demands that Oliver have more sympathy for Selby (during that time, he was gleefully {{whistling}} and humming the popular song, [...] "Yessir, That's My Baby" [...] in honor of Annie who had beat him up). It is clear that Warbucks believed that Selby brought what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on himself and that he got exactly as he deserved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we can rush {{about and}} tell all Grandfather Frog's friends what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{and where he}} is. Perhaps some of them can help us," [...] the Little Breeze continued.|$|R
60|$|She lay {{wondering}} what it was, why Siegmund had not written, what could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> She imagined all of them terrible, and endued with grandeur, for she had kinship with Hedda Gabler.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed so}} {{improbable}} that anything could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> there without their knowing it, {{that no one}} ventured to put his suspicions into words, and each waited for the other to speak.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{it took a}} {{few months}} for the realities of the Stalinist purges to become apparent, Martha Ruben-Wolf was forced to become aware {{of the extent to which}} friends were disappearing, notably after her husband was arrested by the {{security}} services on 28 November 1937 or 15 January 1938. [...] (Sources differ.) [...] Accused of being a Gestapo spy, on 4 October 1938 he was sentenced to death and shot. [...] It is not clear whether Martha ever learned of his fate. [...] She certainly devoted desperate energy, apparently without success, to trying to find out what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> after he disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} before his death, in a final statement, he {{declared}} that nobody among either his associates or the general public had understood what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> (as the conduit of the teaching). He added that the [...] "supreme intelligence" [...] operating in his body would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, [...] he stated that people could perhaps get into touch with that somewhat [...] "if they live the teachings". In prior discussions, he had compared himself with Thomas Edison, implying that he did the hard work, and now all that was needed by others was a flick of the switch.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 December 2014 a bin lorry {{collided}} with pedestrians {{in the city}} centre of Glasgow, Scotland, killing six and injuring fifteen others. The driver of the council-owned vehicle, Harry Clarke, said he had passed out at the wheel. A similar blackout <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in the driving seat of a bus, although he had not disclosed the incident on his heavy goods vehicle licence renewal [...] application, despite such self-reporting being mandatory. Clarke was officially told he would not face further prosecution, effectively giving him immunity over the deaths and causing protests from victims' families {{at the way the}} case had been handled. In October 2015 it was reported that Clarke had been arrested on suspicion of driving without a licence in September 2015.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah I don't say I {{like him}} better," [...] she granted after a thought. [...] "But he's grim, he's worn--and things <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He doesn't make shift, for sight, with your charming monocle." ...|$|R

60|$|NO {{word from}} George Thorne {{had come to}} Forlorn River in weeks. Gale grew {{concerned}} over the fact, and {{began to wonder if}} anything serious could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Mercedes showed a slow, wearing strain.|$|R
2500|$|As Rivers {{notes in}} Instinct and the Unconscious, one manifestation of {{his lack of}} visual memory was his {{inability}} to visualise {{any part of the}} upper floor of the house he lived in until he was five. This visual blank is made even more significant by the fact that Rivers was able to describe the lower floors of that particular house with far more accuracy than {{he had been able to}} with any house since and, although images of later houses were faded and incomplete, no memory since had been as inaccessible as that of the upper floor of his early home. [...] With the evidence that he was presented with, Rivers was led to the conclusion that something <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> on the upper floor of that house, the memory of which was entirely suppressed because it [...] "interfered with [...] comfort and happiness". Indeed, not only was that specific memory rendered inaccessible but his sensory memory in general appears to have been severely handicapped from that moment.|$|E
60|$|Then Pivi told Kabo {{about the}} kind woman, and all the {{wonderful}} things that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "You are deceiving me!" [...] she cried. [...] "Something serious <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> The truth! {{tell me the}} truth! Oh! it's shameful, it's heartless of both of you {{to deceive}} a wretched blind {{creature}} like me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{right back}} and see what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> then come and tell me quietly. I'll wait for you here. I wouldn't have his mother startled for the world," [...] said the good soul, when she knew all.|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all, madam," [...] was the {{somewhat}} depressed admission. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} something must <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He {{was not the kind}} of gentleman to go away like this and leave no word behind him." ...|$|R
