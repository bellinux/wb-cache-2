25|$|Kalākaua was {{the first}} monarch to travel around the world. While visiting Europe, he took note of the grand palaces owned by other monarchs. Like Kamehameha V, <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> a royal palace {{befitting}} of the sovereignty of a modern state such as Hawaii. He commissioned the construction a new Iolani Palace, {{directly across the street}} from Aliiōlani Hale, to become the official palace of the Hawaiian monarchy.|$|E
25|$|The {{legend of}} the {{founding}} of the city of Puebla attributes the act to a vision had by friar Julián Garcés, who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> a festival in honor the Archangel Michael happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs.

25|$|Gillespie {{was born}} in Cheraw, South Carolina, the {{youngest}} of nine children of James and Lottie Gillespie. James was a local bandleader, so instruments were {{made available to the}} children. Gillespie started to play the piano at the age of four. Gillespie's father died when he was only ten years old. Gillespie taught himself how to play the trombone as well as the trumpet by the age of twelve. From the night he heard his idol, Roy Eldridge, play on the radio, <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> becoming a jazz musician. He received a music scholarship to the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina which he attended for two years before accompanying his family when they moved to Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his {{political}} setbacks McLane never lost his ambition for high political office. One of his last remaining political friends from the congressional days was James K. Polk, who was now President of the United States. While <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> something much greater, McLane took {{a leave of absence}} from the railroad in 1845 and 1846 to return to England as Minister Plenipotentiary, primarily for the purpose of coordinating negotiations over the Oregon boundary. McLane was remembered fondly from his previous service, and renewed his old friendships. The basis of the settlement was easily established, but the hard line public position of Polk was shaken only by outbreak of the Mexican–American War. McLane succeeded in keeping the British agreeable to the eventual settlement until the administration came to the same conclusion, even if he risked suggesting the president was posturing when he insisted on “54-40 or Fight.” McLane never received the higher appointment desired and reluctantly returned to the railroad.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Kallinger often {{rebelled against}} his {{teachers}} and his adoptive parents. <b>He</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> becoming a playwright, and had played {{the part of}} Ebenezer Scrooge in the local YWCA's performance of A Christmas Carol in the ninth grade. When Kallinger was 15, he began dating a girl named Hilda Bergman, whom he met at a theater which {{he was allowed to}} visit on Saturdays. His parents told him not to see her, but he married her and had two children with her. She later left him because of the domestic violence she suffered at his hands. Kallinger was hospitalized at St. Mary's on September 4, 1957 due to severe headaches and loss of appetite which doctors believed was a result of stress surrounding his divorce. Kallinger remarried on April 20, 1958 and had five children with his second wife. He was extremely abusive towards his family, and often inflicted the same punishments on them that he had suffered from his adoptive parents.|$|E

Leicestershire got into finals day, having had to achieve their highest ever T20 chase of 203 in 20 overs, which they managed in 19.2 overs, with Nixon scoring 31 runs from 17 deliveries. Leicestershire then {{went on to win the}} competition; firstly beating Lancashire in a super over eliminator, then beating Somerset by 18 runs in the final, meaning that Nixon got the fairytale end to his career that <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of.</b> His retirement on 27 August 2011 marked the end of his 23-year career.|$|E

500|$|Ramanujan {{has been}} {{described}} as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners. He lived a rather Spartan life at Cambridge. Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Mahalakshmi of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> blood drops that symbolised her male consort, Narasimha. Afterward he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. He often said, [...] "An equation for me has no meaning unless it represents a thought of God." ...|$|E
500|$|Herriman's ethnic {{heritage}} {{was unknown}} to his colleagues. [...] Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him [...] "the Greek", a label which stuck {{and was taken}} up by his biographers and the press, who called him {{the son of a}} Greek baker. [...] At other times, he was identified as French, Irish, and Turkish. [...] He told a friend that he was Creole, and speculated that he may have [...] "Negro blood" [...] in him, as he had [...] "kinky hair". [...] The friend said that Herriman wore a hat to hide his hair, which may have been an attempt to pass as white. [...] Herriman said that <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> being reborn a Navajo. [...] On his death certificate, he was listed as [...] "Caucasian", and his daughter Mabel had his father's birthplace listed as Paris and his mother's as Alsace-Lorraine.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the French crew is {{rescued by}} a cargo ship, and the U.S. Navy is {{deployed}} by NATO after getting {{word from the}} cargo ship captain that the pirates now have [...] "advanced weaponry" [...] (which was really just Kevin's toy lightsaber, that the French crew thought was real). Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E

2500|$|Another historian, Maxime du Camp wrote after Thiers' funeral: [...] "Certainly people {{laughed at}} his contradictions, and during his {{lifetime}} he was not spared mockery, but he continued to be respected, because he passionately loved France. In times of good fortune, <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> a France that was great, strong, and respected; [...] and when France was bent {{under the weight of}} misfortune which its faults had brought upon it, he made a superhuman effort to save it and to make it less miserable.

Though a tall and quiet teenager, his prankish {{sense of humor}} found outlet in his art, sometimes in depictions of immigrants or of women dominating men in comic situations. Later in life, he mostly depicted women as the figures in his paintings. In high school, <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> being a naval architect, but after graduation he declared his intention to follow an art career. Hopper's parents insisted that he study commercial art to have a reliable means of income. In developing his self-image and individualistic philosophy of life, Hopper {{was influenced by the}} writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. He later said, [...] "I admire him greatly...I read him over and over again." ...|$|E

[...] "We're risking our lives out there. We could die." [...] Instead, he said, <b>he</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> being a pilot. [...] Soon after, Wallenda made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13. When he graduated high school, his parents encouraged him {{to go to college and}} explore his options.
