25|$|Pakistan's {{economic}} expansion for financial year (FY) 2015, which ended on 30 June 2015, {{was led by}} services as growth in manufacturing slowed. Industrial growth was hobbled by a slowdown in large-scale manufacturing to 3.3% owing to continued power shortages and weaker external demand. The resilience of small-scale manufacturing and construction sustained industrial growth at 3.6%. Agriculture growth remained modest at 2.9%. Private <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> slipped to equal 9.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 10.0% a year earlier because of continuing energy constraints and the generally weak business environment that has depressed investment for several years.|$|E
25|$|The {{macroeconomic}} measures worked {{wonders for}} production. GDP shot up 9.5 percent in 1986 and a further 7.7 percent in 1987. Manufacturing output and construction both increased {{by more than}} one-fourth in these two years. An even greater surprise was that agricultural production per capita went up, running counter to its long downward trend. And the rate of inflation came down from 163 percent in 1985 to 78 percent in 1986, although it edged back up to 86 percent in 1987. In response to stronger market conditions and perhaps also to growing confidence that Peru's economic problems were at last being attacked successfully, private <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> went up by 24 percent in 1986, and capital flight went down.|$|E
25|$|GDP, long {{stuck at}} its 1973 level {{even with a}} growing population, grew by about a third from early 1991 to late 1994. <b>Fixed</b> <b>investment,</b> {{depressed}} since the 1981–82 crisis, more than doubled during this period. Consumers also benefited: income poverty fell by about half (to under 20%) and new auto sales (likewise depressed since 1982) jumped fivefold, to about 500,000 units. This boom, however, had its problems early on. Tight federal budgets kept the budget deficits of the provinces from improving and, though many benefited from Cavallo's insistence that large employers translate higher productivity into higher pay, this same productivity boom (as well as the nearly 200,000 layoffs the privatizations caused) helped unemployment jump from about 7% in 1991–92 to over 12%, by 1994. The 1995 Mexican Crisis shocked consumer and business confidence and ratcheted joblessness to 18% (the highest since the 1930s).|$|E

25|$|Following {{the loss}} of the Front for Victory's {{absolute}} majorities in both houses of Congress, opposition lawmakers passed a bill on October 14, 2010, reinstating the 82% móvil schedule. The President vetoed the bill, citing the improvements gained by the Inclusion and Mobility Laws, as well as the cost of the bill itself, which would increase ANSES spending by us$10 billion, and force the sale of us$19 billion in securities held by the FGS (56% of the total in 2010). The size and growth of the FGS portfolio, which grew by 60% in US dollar terms in the three years after the absorption of AFJP pensions in late 2008, accompanied an increased reliance on the FGS for national budgetary borrowing requirements. The FGS held us$27 billion in government bonds at the end of 2011; a further US$6.5 billion finances <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> by the state or sponsored enterprises.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{success was}} short-lived. Following a lumbering {{recovery}} during 1933 to 1945, from 1946 to 1953 Argentina gained benefits from Perón's five-year plan. The GDP expanded by over a fourth during that brief boom, {{about as much}} as it had during the previous decade. Using roughly half the US$1.7billion in reserves inherited from wartime surpluses for nationalizations, economic development agencies devoted most of the other half to finance both public and private investments; the roughly 70% jump in domestic <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> was accounted for mostly by industrial growth in the private sector. All this much-needed activity exposed an intrinsic weakness in the plan: it subsidized growth which, in the short term, led to a wave of imports of the capital goods that local industry could not supply. Whereas the end of World War II had allowed Argentine exports to rise from US$700million to US$1.6billion, Perón's changes led to skyrocketing imports (from US$300million to US$1.6billion), and erased the surplus by 1948.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{differences}} about {{indirect effects}} of public investments on private investments (crowdingin or crowding-out effect) reflect different theoretical ideas. The potential reason {{of these differences}} is that studies applied traditional unit root and cointegration tests which ignore structural breaks. Since, the power of these tests might decrease {{in the presence of}} structural breaks. For this purpose, in this study which analyzed the relationship between public investment expenditures and private <b>fixed</b> <b>investments</b> over 1970 - 2013 period in Turkey, Unit Root Tests taking into account the structural breaks such as Zivot - Andrews Unit Root Test (One Break) and CMR Unit Root Test (Two Break) was applied. Consequently, the vital differences between findings of traditional tests and tests with breaks were detected. ARDL Bounds Test which to construct in terms of these findings indicates that there is no long-run relationship between public investment expenditures and private <b>fixed</b> <b>investments</b> contrary to general findings in literature. On the other hand, Classical Regression Analysis indicates that public investment expenditures have exhibited crowding-in effect on private <b>fixed</b> <b>investments</b> in short-ru...|$|R

2500|$|Generous {{depreciation}} write-off provisions or depletion allowances are {{in reality}} pure profit, or {{are at least}} partly a de facto profit component. The government may give tax incentives, provide guaranteed minimum prices, various economic subsidies etc. The statistical concept of [...] "economic depreciation" [...] (consumption of fixed capital) diverges considerably from actual depreciation – thus, economic depreciation is only an imputation, and is not directly derived from real gross revenue. If the total actual write-off is larger than economic depreciation, for example because of tax incentives for new <b>fixed</b> <b>investment,</b> {{it is likely that}} a component of profit income is being ignored in the statistical measure (there exists no other way to verify what the value of total net output is, than adding together the various components of factor income/expenditure).|$|E
2500|$|When {{government}} statisticians compile gross {{fixed capital}} formation (GFCF) figures, they usually add in [...] "ownership transfer costs" [...] (fees, taxes, charges, insurance costs, installation costs etc.) {{associated with the}} acquisition of a fixed asset put in place. In the United States, these costs represent around 1% of GDP, or around 4.5% of total <b>fixed</b> <b>investment.</b> This inclusion may be perfectly valid {{for the purpose of}} a realistic gross investment measure, but when GFCF data is subsequently used to extrapolate the value of fixed capital stocks using the PIM (the perpetual inventory method), it includes elements which are, strictly speaking, not part of the value of fixed assets themselves. It appears [...] "as if" [...] ownership transfer costs are incurred and depreciated each year in the lifetime of fixed assets, since the value of these costs is carried forward in the perpetual inventory (unless a special adjustment is made). This has the effect of raising the fixed capital stock estimate above true value, cumulatively.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2007–2009 slump, corporate profits surged to new heights while real wages stagnated, but this did not lead to a full recovery of real employment, real output growth and real <b>fixed</b> <b>investment.</b> As Mohamed El-Erian of Pimco predicted fairly accurately in 2009, the number of jobless in the US economy has settled at a higher level that looks like persisting in the longer term. This result is mainly attributable to long-term unemployed people being unable to find paid work again, and dropping out of the labour force. BLS data showed that between 2008 and 2014, the US labor force (those employed for one hour per week or more + officially unemployed workers) stayed basically at the same size, although the proportion of unemployment within the labor force grew; yet according to the US Census Bureau the total US population increased by a net 13 million people at the same time (about half of whom were immigrants), and, according to the BLS, the number of US adults in the economically active population who are classified as [...] "not in the labor force" [...] increased by a net 12 million. It took seven years for the US economy to recover from the financial crash, but US senator Bernie Sanders has claimed that real US unemployment is twice the official figures. For Europe, Mario Draghi suggested an average increase in [...] "structural" [...] unemployment from 8.8% in 2008 to 10.3% by 2013. Just as in the 1970s and 1980s, the grand-average jobless rate has risen to a higher level. This creates a downward pressure on the modal average real wage, though at the top end salary packages still increase. In September 2014, Robert Reich stated that although profits were at record levels, the median US household income, adjusted for inflation, was now 8% lower than in 2007.|$|E
60|$|A bank {{of deposit}} lends capital which it {{collects}} {{from the community}} in small parcels, sometimes without paying any interest, and, if it does pay interest, it still pays much less than it receives; for the depositors, who {{in any other way}} could mostly obtain for such small balances no interest worth taking any trouble for, are glad to receive even a little. Having this subsidiary resource, bankers are enabled to obtain, by lending at interest, the ordinary rate of profit on their own capital. The disposable capital deposited in banks, together with the funds belonging to those who, either from necessity or preference, live upon the interest of their property, constitute the general loan fund of the country; and the amount of this aggregate fund, when set against the habitual demands of producers and dealers, and those of the Government and of unproductive consumers, determines the permanent or average rate of interest, which must always be such as to adjust these two amounts to one another.(286) But, while the whole of this mass of lent capital takes effect upon the permanent rate of interest, the fluctuations depend almost entirely upon the portion which {{is in the hands of}} bankers; for it is that portion almost exclusively which, being lent for short times only, is continually in the market seeking an investment. The capital of those who live on the interest of their own fortunes has generally sought and found some <b>fixed</b> <b>investment,</b> such as the public funds, mortgages, or the bonds of public companies, which investment, except under peculiar temptations or necessities, is not changed.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{expectations}} about returns on <b>fixed</b> <b>investment,</b> {{every level of}} the real interest rate (i) will generate {{a certain level of}} planned <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> and other interest-sensitive spending: lower interest rates encourage higher <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> and the like.

The multiplier effect of an increase in <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the IS curve. In summary, this line represents the causation from falling interest rates to rising planned <b>fixed</b> <b>investment</b> (etc.) to rising national income and output.|$|E
