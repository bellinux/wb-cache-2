5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> {{the best way}} to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me {{there were a number of}} the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened {{as far as the}} viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E

They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named Team of the Year for 2012.

"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios {{employed}} three development teams. These {{included the}} Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, {{and a team}} working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, [...] "I don't know when the producers {{decided to make the}} game, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon", and that Feargus Urquhart [...] "asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about {{it for the rest of}} the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development." [...] During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, [...] "In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title." [...] Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of [...] After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with all}} emotions, saudade {{has been an}} {{inspiration}} for many songs and compositions. [...] "Sodade" [...] (saudade in Cape Verdean Creole) is {{the title of the}} Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora's most famous song. Étienne Daho, a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. The Good Son, a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as saudade. He told journalist Chris Bohn: [...] "When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the Portuguese word for this feeling was saudade. It's not nostalgia but something sadder." ...|$|E

[...] The executive elder stated that he was blackmailed by a staff who asked for more severance pay. He also stated that [...] "former Mars Hill elders were working to file formal charges against me also. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> a former lead pastor was approached to lead a group of people who hoped to force my resignation so that I 'could not help Pastor Mark Driscoll'." ...|$|E

At one point {{at the end of my}} first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Being {{the son of}} Ali Bourguiba and Fattouma Khefacha, who was 40 when he was born, Bourguiba {{stated that}} his mother was ashamed to {{conceive}} a child at that late age, her last pregnancy being seven years old at the time. Meanwhile, his father wondered whether he could raise his son at this old age. Habib Bourguiba later described his birth in these words: [...] "When she conceived me, it was for her, the unfortunate, a catastrophe. She was already forty years old. Many of her pregnancies weakened her. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> when she gave birth to me, she was so ashamed of having a child at that age that she stifled her cries for deliverance while gritting her teeth with a towel placed in her mouth.

2500|$|Not {{only did}} the Chinese customs {{concerning}} death greatly burden the family, but an unmarried daughter became {{a source of great}} embarrassment and concern.

[...] For girls who choose to remain unmarried, [...] "bride-initiated spirit marriage" [...] (or a ghost marriage initiated by a living bride) was a successful [...] "marriage-resistance practice" [...] that allowed them to remain single while still being integrated into a lineage.

Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long.
