25|$|Once {{a design}} has been digitized, an <b>embroiderer</b> can use {{software}} to edit it or {{combine it with}} other designs. Most embroidery programs allow the user to rotate, scale, move, stretch, distort, split, crop, or duplicate the design in an endless pattern. Most software allows the user to add text quickly and easily. Often {{the colors of the}} design can be changed, made monochrome, or re-sorted. More sophisticated packages allow the user to edit, add, or remove individual stitches. Some embroidery machines have rudimentary built-in design editing features.|$|E

The present study explores how {{the knowledge and}} skills of female <b>embroiderers</b> in the chikan industry of Lucknow illuminate relations of production between merchants and <b>embroiderers,</b> and among <b>embroiderers</b> themselves. ^ Informal organisation, piece-wages and cheap products have characterised the chikan industry for a century. All stages of production are presently affected by the overwhelming emphasis on a cheap form called bakhya. <b>Embroiderers</b> are almost all Muslim women from town and country, linked to merchants through male and female sub-contractors. With occupational opportunities and organisational capacities constrained by purdah, <b>embroiderers</b> are in fierce competition for meagre and unreliable piece-wages. ^ Highly-skilled <b>embroiderers</b> find limited outlets for their creativity in government award schemes and in commissioned work for private patrons. Most make their living sub-contracting simpler work to other women. Agent roles have often been passed in the family from previous generations of embroidering men. ^ Government organisations give some work directly to rural workers at the bottom of agent pyramids. In circumventing agents, the government frustrates the same women they reward in other setting with awards and incentives for their fine work. Increasingly, the highly skilled have less control over the terms by which fine chikan is defined. Any fine chikan they do make is subsidised by agent-activities in the commercial sector. ^ One must recognise the ways in which skilled <b>embroiderers</b> exploit other workers, as well as show the ways in which <b>embroiderers,</b> as women, share some of the conditions of their oppression. Caught up in the volatile fashion market inside India, the future of chikan and of <b>embroiderers</b> is uncertain. Future research needs to be conducted into the wider relationships of <b>embroiderers,</b> and of the productive lives of other specialists implicated in chikan, in order to form a more comprehensive portrait of working class culture surrounding this unique commodity. ...|$|R

He takes her cold hand (Che gelida manina—"What a cold little hand") and tells her of his life as a poet, then asks her to tell him more about her life. The girl says her name is Mimì (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì—"Yes, they call me Mimì"), and {{describes}} her simple life as an <b>embroiderer.</b> Impatiently, the waiting friends call Rodolfo. He answers and turns to see Mimì bathed in moonlight (duet, Rodolfo and Mimì: O soave fanciulla—"Oh lovely girl"). They realize that they have fallen in love. Rodolfo suggests remaining at home with Mimì, but she decides to accompany him to the Cafe Momus. As they leave, they sing of their newfound love.|$|E
25|$|Unlike woven carpets, {{embroidery}} carpets' are not {{formed on}} a loom. Their pattern is {{established by the}} application of stitches to a cloth (often linen) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch {{are two of the}} most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have been an avid <b>embroiderer.</b> 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the Bradford carpet). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the coat of arms of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. Victorian embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called Berlin wool work, were introduced in Germany in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.|$|E

A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest <b>embroiderer</b> in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E

2500|$|To create free-motion machine embroidery, the <b>embroiderer</b> {{runs the}} machine and skillfully moves tightly hooped fabric under the needle to create a design. The [...] "feed dogs" [...] or machine teeth are lowered or covered, and the <b>embroiderer</b> moves the fabric manually. The <b>embroiderer</b> {{develops}} the embroidery manually, using the machine's settings for running stitch and fancier built-in stitches. In this way, the stitches form an image {{on a piece of}} fabric. An <b>embroiderer</b> can produce a filled-in effect by sewing many parallel rows of straight stitching. [...] A machine's zigzag stitch can create thicker lines within a design or be used to create a border. Many quilters and fabric artists use a process called thread drawing (or thread painting) to create embellishments on their projects or to create textile art.|$|E
