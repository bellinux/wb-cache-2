Wildlife is sparse and dominated by invasive species such as the house mouse, mongoose, brown rat, black rat, house sparrow, <b>Java</b> <b>sparrow</b> and common mynah. An endangered owl, the endemic pueo (a subspecies of the short-eared owl), has been seen hunting on the island. Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native, including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín. The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including mullet, milkfish and Hawaiian anchovy. The National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service oversee and administer the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument battlefields at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island.|$|E

40|$|Cryptosporidiosis is a {{cosmopolitan}} parasitosis that affects {{a wide range}} of hosts including birds. As information concerning Cryptosporidium in birds is limited, the present study examined the prevalence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium in <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> in Beijing and Shangqiu, northern China. Three hundred and fifty fecal samples were collected from <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Lonchura oryzivora, 225 white <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> and 125 gray <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows)</b> in Beijing and Shangqiu in October 2015, and the samples were examined by PCR amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene. The overall Cryptosporidium prevalence is 13. 42 % (47 / 350), with 16. 44 % (37 / 225) in white <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> and 8. 00 % (10 / 125) in gray <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows.</b> Cryptosporidium prevalence was 9. 82 % (16 / 163) in <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> from Beijing and 16. 58 % (31 / 187) in <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> from Shangqiu. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in females and males was 40. 63 % (26 / 64) and 7. 34 % (21 / 286), respectively. The Cryptosporidium prevalence in <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> of different ages varied from 10. 47 % to 16. 33 %. Sequence analysis of the SSU rRNA gene revealed that all the samples represented C. baileyi. This is the first report of Cryptosporidium in gray <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> in China, which extend the host range for C. baileyi.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bill {{structure}} on seed preference and handling time in granivorous birds was determined for a long, slender dove bill, a conical finch bill, and a hooked parrot bill using diamond doves (husked seeds prior to ingestion; lovebirds took significantly longer than <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> in handling all seed species. Seed characteristics, {{size and shape}} affected handling time with reference to bill structure. Diamond doves took significantly longer to handle elongate seeds while <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> handled round seeds slowly and Fischer’s lovebirds required similar handling times for all seed species. <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> and Fischer’s lovebirds selected greater proportions of the same seed species, suggesting that birds which husk seeds prefer similar seed species. Seeds were not selected according to nutritional intake rate. Japanese millet was the preferred seed species of Fischer’s lovebirds and <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows,</b> but provided few calories and little protein per unit time. Seed selection was influenced by bill structure, as seeds were selected, amongst others, according to handling time, and handling time was dependent on bill structure.

At the meeting, the recent release of European starlings, Japanese finches and pheasants into the park were noted.

40|$|Mutual {{interactions}} between sexes have multiple signalling functions. Duet singing in songbirds {{is related to}} mutual mate guarding, joint resource defence, and signalling commitment. Coordinated visual displays of mating pairs are thought to perform similar functions, but are less well understood. The current study evaluated mutual interactions in an Estrildid species to explore {{the relative importance of}} duet dancing and male singing in mating success of pairs in a first encounter. When <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Lonchura oryzivora) court prospective mates, only males sing. However, both males and females perform courtship dances, often in a duet-like manner. These dances are typically terminated by female copulation solicitation displays (CSDs). In the current study, we observed higher mating success when courtship dances were mutually exchanged, and when males sang. However, the sex initiating the courtship did not affect mating success. Most females produced CSDs after duet dancing but before hearing the entire song, indicating that duet dancing {{played a crucial role in}} mating. This finding highlights an unexplored aspect of duetting behaviour in the process of mutual mate choice. These results conflict with the majority of past songbird research, which has interpreted songs as primary behavioural sexual signals...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the flight of {{vertebrates}} and the studies of different modes of flight. Flight has always fascinated mankind and this fascination gave inspiration for our attempts at flying. Yet {{there are many different}} modes of flight among vertebrates and this thesis focuses mainly on the flapping flight of bats and intermittent flight of birds, as well as compares some of the factors concerning the differences between the flight of bats and birds, and the underlying aerodynamics. In the first three papers we have described the characteristics of flight for small, nectivorous bats, G. soricina, flying in a wind tunnel over a wide range of speeds. Paper I describes the wake structure of flying bats, revealing novel structures not previously seen in neither birds nor bats, such as e. g. individual vortex loop for each wing, and a rather complex wake pattern. In paper II we analyzed the wake of G. soricina further and compared the near and far wake measurements in the wind tunnel. We could show that, the strength of start and stop vortices does not differ significantly between the near and far wake, but there is a risk of missing details of the wake morphology by only looking at the far wake. Paper III concerns the kinematics of flying G. soricina bats and ties the wingbeat kinematics together with the observed wake, collected simultaneously. In Paper IV we compared quantitative measures of the circulation of the wake of the bat G. soricina with the wakes of three bird species. Our results showed differences in how the circulation was regulated and how the wake pattern changed in birds and bats. Paper V concerns bounding flight of birds and presents the results of a wind tunnel study of bounding budgerigars and <b>Java</b> <b>sparrows,</b> showing body lift production at all investigated flight speeds in both species. It also points to several differences between the two species that may be caused by the differences in the wing morphology. Body drag was also estimated during bounds and although it was large at lower speeds due to the high body angle during bounds, it was close to 0. 2 at higher speed. To fully understand ecology and behavior of animals we have to understand the underlying mechanisms and factors involved. The technological advances have opened up a new possibilities to study flight in much more detail than previously possible. However there are still just a few detailed studies available and this thesis can hopefully ad to our knowledge about flight. Future studies will also need to couple the aerodynamics with morphological data in comparative analyses. The rapid development of methods available for aerodynamic studies opens new possibilities for future projects and every new study performed awakens new questions...|$|R
