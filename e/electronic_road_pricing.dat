40|$|Economists' {{favorite}} {{remedy for}} traffic congestion is <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> Not only is <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> based on sound economic principles, but also given current technology {{it could be}} implemented at reasonable cost and in a flexible and sophisticated manner. But there are serious obstacles to the widespread adoption of <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> There are problems of phase-in: the fixed costs of introducing any system of <b>road</b> <b>pricing,</b> {{as well as the}} problems of coordinating <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> across jurisdictions, including standardization and the treatment of out-of-towners. Political acceptability is an even more serious obstacle. How can congestion pricing be 'sold' to economically unsophisticated voters who are justifiably suspicious of any new government taxes and charges? This paper will not argue against <b>road</b> <b>pricing,</b> though it will point out some of the difficulties associated with the policy that economists have tended to ignore or to gloss over. Rather, it will examine some of the alternatives to <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> More specifically, it will focus on two related questions, one positive, one normative, on the assumption that congestion pricing is not introduced, at least on city streets. The positive question: What are the likely effects of policies other than <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> on alleviating <b>road</b> congestion? The normative question: What mix of policies (<b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> excluded) would be most effective in alleviating traffic congestion? Throughout the focus will be on urban traffic congestion. Alternatives to <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> can be grouped into five categories: 1. Expansion and upgrading of existing road capacity; 2. Expansion and upgrading of mass transit; 3. Regulation; 4. Information; 5. Non-road transport pricing. While the emphasis of the paper will be on qualitative analysis, there will be some attempts at quantification via back-of-the-envelope calculations. traffic congestion, <b>road</b> <b>pricing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{application}} of advanced transport information system (ATIS) and <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> is studied in a transportation system under non-recurrent congestion. A stochastic network deterministic user equilibrium model (SNDUE) with elastic demand is formulated and {{used to evaluate the}} welfare and private impacts of different market penetrations of ATIS, together with <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> for a simple network. Both marginal first-best <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> and a second-best fixed <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> are considered. The incentives of private users to use ATIS are analyzed and the characteristics of optimum tolls as a function of ATIS market penetration are shown. We conclude that ATIS is an efficient and necessary tool to reduce the effects of non-recurrent incidents in a transportation network, especially when non-recurrent congestion causes a significant deterioration of operational conditions of the network. If the impact of non-recurrent incidents on free flow costs is small or is reduced only to congestion effects, the use of <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> would be more efficient. Social benefits obtained when jointly implementing ATIS and <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> are practically the same whether first-best or second-best <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> is used. Considering the private costs perceived by the network users, and the benefits experienced by equipped users, the maximum level of market penetration achieved could be limited because private benefits disappear after certain market penetration is obtained.

40|$|Public {{acceptance}} {{is possibly}} the ‘key’ {{for the implementation}} of <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> Understanding any special attitudes of older people to the policy may inform attempts to enhance acceptability by identifying some of the potential social dilemmas of <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> In an ageing society, where older people have a growing influence in politics in general, and potentially on the acceptability of <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> in particular, their attitudes to <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> are of interest because they face specific types of risk of transport-related social exclusion. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that older people favour, more than any other age group, what is positively valued for society – a process known as ‘pro-social value orientation’. Hence in a transport context, older people {{may be more likely to}} express positive or negative attitudes to the acceptability of <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> depending on whether they believe it would be good or bad for others, or society in general. Family and friends may also affect older people’s considerations about their intentions and choices - thus the importance of studying the influence of ‘social norms’ on older people’s attitudes to <b>road</b> <b>pricing.</b> The paper develops a theoretical and empirical understanding of these issues, based on a two phase research scheme consisting of a quantitative survey and a series of focus groups that was conducted in Bristol a city that has been seriously discussing for a number of years the introduction of a <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>pricing</b> {{has been}} {{discussed}} since {{quite a long time}} as a political measure to shift transport costs directly to the infrastructure users thus also meeting the need for providing efficient transport infrastructures in the future. Other general objectives related to <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> concern traffic management, in particular the backing of an efficient handling of traffic. Ecological effects are more or less considered as welcome side effects. <b>Road</b> <b>pricing</b> exists in the form of either highway tolling or inner urban congestion charging. While Germany has restricted <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> to a highway toll for heavy vehicles, there are no experiences concerning urban congestion charging. First reports coming from European cities like London, Oslo or Trondheim where congestion charging was introduced in the last years, seem to confirm a considerable change in the behaviour of road users – irrespectively of effects perceived by the individual road user. The experiences made in various European cities indicate that <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> is able to decrease at least partially the problems of congestion, noise and other environmental annoyances thus increasing {{the quality of life in}} the concerned areas. This, so far, endorses the expectations that <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> could be an effective tool for traffic management and the improvement of traffic in cities. Despite these positive ‘signs’, the discussion about <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> and congestion charging, however, remains controversial and sometimes becomes even emotional. At the time, the question if <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> might be accepted by a considerable part of the road users is mostly ‘automatically’ denied.
