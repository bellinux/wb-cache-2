5000|$|In June 2000, {{during the}} European Council stated {{that all the}} SAP {{countries}} are [...] "potential candidates" [...] for EU membership. In November 2000, at the Zagreb Summit, the SAP was officially endorsed by the EU and the Western Balkan countries (including Albania). 2001 was {{the first year of}} the new CARDS programme specifically designed for the SAP countries. In June 2001 the Commission recommended the undertaking of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Albania. The Göteborg European Council (June 2001) invited the Commission to present draft negotiating <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negotiation</b> of a SAA. In October 2002 <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> the <b>negotiation</b> of a SAA with Albania were adopted 31 January 2003. On 31 January, Commission President Prodi officially launches the <b>negotiations</b> <b>for</b> a SAA between the EU and Albania. In June 2003 at the Thessaloniki Summit, the SAP was confirmed as the EU policy for the Western Balkans and the EU perspective for these countries was confirmed (countries participating in the SAP started to be eligible for EU accession and would join the EU once they would become ready). In December 2005 the Council made the decision on the principles of a revised European Partnership for Albania. On 12 June 2006 the SAA was signed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{gain insight}} into how advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> {{euthanasia}} affect resident care in Dutch nursing homes. DESIGN: Survey of elderly care physicians and additional qualitative interviews with a selection of elderly care physicians and relatives of people with dementia who had an advance <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia. SETTING: Dutch nursing home practice. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred thirty-four elderly care physicians completed the general part of the questionnaire; 110 physicians provided case histories. Interviews were conducted with 11 physicians and eight relatives. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire contained general questions about the incidence of advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia in people with dementia. A second part involved questions about the most recent case of a person with dementia and an advance <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia who had died. The interviews with elderly care physicians and relatives focused on further exploration of the decision-making process regarding adherence to the advance <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia. RESULTS: Despite law-based possibilities, advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia of people with dementia were rarely adhered to, although {{they seem to have}} a supportive role in setting limitations on life-sustaining treatments. Elderly care physicians and relatives were found to be reluctant to adhere to advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia. Not being able to engage in meaningful communication {{played a crucial role in}} this reluctance. CONCLUSION: Advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia are never adhered to in the Netherlands in the case of people with advanced dementia, and their role in advance care planning and end-of-life care of people with advanced dementia is limited. Communication with the patient is essential for elderly care physicians to consider adherence to an advance <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> euthanasia of a person with dementia. © 2011, The American Geriatrics Society...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of advance {{directives}} in clinical dementia research. The focus is on advance consent to participation of demented patients in non-therapeutic research involving more than minimal risks and/or burdens. First, morally relevant differences between advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> treatment and care, and advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> dementia research are discussed. Then {{attention is paid to}} the philosophical issue of dementia and personal identity, and the implications for the moral authority of research advance directives. Thirdly, a number of practical shortcomings of advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> non-therapeutic dementia research are explored and attention is paid to the role of proxies. It is concluded that upon a closer look the initial attractiveness of advance <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> dementia research is lessened, and that it is doubtful whether these instruments can compensate for the lack of subject consent in case of non-therapeutic dementia research involving more than minimal risks and/or burdens for the incompetent demented subject...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In speaking, someone {{performed}} something while saying, {{that what}} was called speech act. Directive speech act was part of speech act. In daily life, speech act was met in many aspects including in film, such as Â“Fast and Furious 6 Â” film directed by Justin Lin, in which in this research, it would be analyzed its directive speech act uttered by its main character, Dominic. This study was descriptive qualitative research because it presented data {{in the form of}} Dominic directive speech acts in Justin Lin Film, Fast and Furious 6, deeply. The data were taken from document, such as dialogue and small scope, and then it resulted in the depth of understanding of Dominic directive speech act in Justin Lin Film, Fast and Furious 6. Besides, this study was also focused on specific phenomenon without manipulating the document. Also, the researcher applied objective approach in this research, as the researcher focused only on the study about directive speech act without being influenced by the writer/ authorÂ’s background. Meanwhile, the researcher didnÂ’t include her experience or emotion; instead, it presented an independent literary work. The finding of this study showed that there were twelve utterances which belonged to DominicÂ’s directive speech acts in the film Â“Fast & Furious 6 Â“. Those directive speech act included <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> ordering, <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> requesting, <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> recommending, <b>directives</b> <b>for</b> commanding and <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> advising. First of directive speech acts which were found in Justin Lin Film, Fast & Furious 6 belonged to <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> ordering, such as: Â“Go!Â”, Â“Get in thereÂ”, Â“Go, now!Â”;directives for requesting, such as: Â“I just want to raceÂ”, Â“LetÂ’s do itÂ”, Â“Show me how you driveÂ”, Â“IÂ’ll show you who you areÂ”, Â“LetÂ’s goÂ”, Â“LetÂ’s break this downÂ”; <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> advising, such as: Â“You donÂ’t turn your back on family, even when they doÂ”, Â“Be carefulÂ”. Then, there were two ways in performing directive speech act that is done by Dominic. They are direct and indirect speech act. The total of direct speech acts were eleven utterances. Furthermore, indirect speech act was one utterance. It can be concluded that Dominic more likely to use a directive illocutionary acts directly. Then, DominicÂ’s directive speech acts with Letty and Brian as the interlocutor emphasized a force to them in the form of <b>directive</b> <b>for</b> ordering.
