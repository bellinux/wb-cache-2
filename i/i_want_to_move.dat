40|$|Film {{and video}} {{releases}} in the UK are amongst the most tightly regulated in the Western World, and {{are subject to}} greater censorship than any other artistic medium. Given the popularity of film-viewing within the UK, this routine exercise of regulatory power affects almost all of us. However, {{following in the footsteps}} of Michel Foucault, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond what Annette Kuhn might call a ‘prohibitive model’ of censorship and suggest that this power has been highly productive in its effects. In particular, what I want to demonstrate is that the wider discourses of censorship (which includes scientific studies and popular debate as well as the ‘official’ stance of the BBFC) actively constitute a particular form of contemporary spectatorship. That is, within the discourses of regulation and censorship, particularly those concerning issues of sex and violence on the screen, the body of the spectator becomes a central term around which these discourses revolve. As such, the discourses of censorship not only constitute a theoretical form of ‘corporeal spectatorship’, but actively shape the experience of watching certain kinds of ‘controversial’ films...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} debates {{centring}} {{on the so-called}} ‘obesity epidemic’ {{have sprung up in}} the last 10 years. Although debate is the normal state of affairs in any scientific endeavour, my focus here is on two broad camps we might call ‘alarmists’ and ‘sceptics’. While alarmists have characterised the ‘obesity epidemic’ as a looming global health catastrophe, sceptics have argued that the consequences of rising obesity levels have either been greatly exaggerated or are unclear. In focusing on obesity, my intention is not to prove the case of one camp or the other but rather to construct a kind of anatomy of the obesity controversy. In this essay, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> beyond the idea of there being two camps in debates about obesity and provide a more complex account of the different groups that make up both sides. My interest in this research is to explore the idea that belief matters more than truth. In the context of debates about obesity, nothing could be more irrelevant than the ‘truth’ of fatness. The energising principle will be what people, particularly but not only politicians and journalists, can be made to believe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceI’m {{going to}} argue, in this paper, {{that there is}} at least {{justification}} for experimenting with King Lear and going beyond the rather sombre and ultimately po-faced performances and readings we’ve got used to.

But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the modern model of the two parts played by a woman (first suggested, though not carried through, by Macready’s casting of a woman as the Fool in his 1838 revival of the Shakespearean text and the primary thrust of the doubling argument) in favour of the rather more Jacobean perversion of casting Robert Armin as Cordelia: two parts in one; a less than pretty, dirty-minded little comedian as the beautiful and upstanding Queen of France. I want to champion this theory – and more importantly to call for similar casting in future performances – for precisely the same reasons that most critics reject it: because it ironises the drama of many of the pivotal scenes, because it creates all kinds of confusions of gender and sexuality, because it tends to allow the often childish bawdy puns to ‘drowned the cocks’ of the tragedy, because it’s wilful bad casting, and because (ultimately) it makes the tragic ending (not just ‘feminine,’ as Philippa Berry suggests but) laughable… poor, infirm, weak and despicable...|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} the first stage in a larger project that investigates an inter-imperial history of {{knowledge}} production {{through the prism of}} Baḥrī's activities and networks at various imperial sites in the Dutch, British and German empires as well as the French imperial nation-state. In this essay, I begin by asking how we can tell the history of the nationalist, journalist, author and traveller Yūnis Baḥrī (ca. 1901 - 1979) - once known in Arab-speaking populations from Europe across the Middle East to South East Asia as the "Iraqi traveller" (Arabic al-sāʾiḥ al-ʿirāqī) - by acknowledging his inter-imperial life and activities. Taking the archives of the German Foreign Office as examples, I seek to render these inter-imperial coordinates of his life visible. Previous research on Baḥrī has neglected these inter-imperial connections. Due to this reduction, Baḥrī's case could be described as a dualistic story of "Middle Eastern-German" relations. Thus, he could be a symbol for an ideological proximity of Arab nationalists and National Socialism. In this essay, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the civilizational lens underlying such arguments by developing a broader methodological outlook. If Baḥrī's story forms part of the historical relationship between Arab nationalists and National Socialism, it is also an element of wider inter-imperial histories. To bring out these histories requires reading practices of the archives that do not follow civilizational or national logics. I therefore take what the archives of the German Foreign Office tell about Baḥrī as a starting point to tease out how his activities transgress civilizational historio graphical frameworks. In conclusion, I explain how the conceptual shift involved in my argument leads to a both broader and denser account of the politics that governed Baḥrī's life and other actors like him...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two things}} I’d like {{to talk with you}} about today. First, I want to talk about how our field—“diplomatic history, ” {{as it used to be}} called, or the history of {{international}} relations, or even just plain “international history”—has changed over the last thirty or forty years—that is, even since I did my own graduate work in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. And then <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on to what many of you might find a more interesting, although not unrelated, topic, and that’s the question of how this field should develop in the years to come. But let me start by talking neither about the past nor about the future of the discipline, but about the present. Where do we stand now? What are we to make of the kind of work that is being done today? This is not an easy question to answer in any simple way. I don’t know how many of you are familiar with the sentence that Charles Dickens used at the start of A Tale of Two Cities—“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times”—but I couldn’t get that sentence out of my mind when I was trying to decide what to say here today. In some ways, we’re living in a golden age: the best works today—I think, for example, of Adam Tooze’s history of the “making and 2 breaking of the Nazi economy, ” his book The Wages of Destruction—are quite extraordinary, better than anything that had been produced in the past. Just compare that book with another book on the same topic that came out in 1959, Germany’s Economic Preparations for War by Burton Klein. Tooze’s analysis is just much deeper and more penetrating: what is impressive is not simply the mass of evidence that he presents, although that’s extraordinary in itself, but the way that evidence is marshaled into an argument—and even more the way that argument forces you to rethink, in a very fundamental way, your whole understanding of the origins of the Second World War. Or compare Paul Kennedy’s Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism (which came out in 1980) with Raymond Sontag’s Germany and England: Background of Conflic...|$|E
40|$|June 17, 1963 Dear Dick: In {{answer to}} your memo of June 17, 1963. The State Labor News of which Carl W. Reinig {{is one of the}} incorporators and also was {{designated}} as the Agent has no connection with 'Labor'. It is merely a privÿe profit-making organizÿtlon purportinÿ to be giving labor news. Carl Reinig once ran the Franklin County AFL-CIO New-s Tribune, but that was back in the 1940 's; since then, he has had no connection with labor unions, but is the Agent of the State Publishing Comparÿwhich publishes both the State Labor News (ÿ 1. 50 per year) and the Labor Forecast ÿdReÿiew ($ 30. 00 per year) e Reinig is also President and probably the principal owner. I sent Bill Groeber a copy of both of those publications. I hÿve enclosed with this letter a copy of the Articles of Incorporation which were filed ÿith the Secretary of State of Ohio. Ae I said inÿ letter to Bill Groeber, the State Publishing Company was originally incorporated ÿn July 30, 1942; were reinstated on November 23, 1948 and again reinstated on January 20, 1950. There is nothing in the Secretary of State's office to show that they had filed azÿthlng since 1950 which might mean that their franchises has been cancelled. I asked our ÿttorney if there was anyway that Reinig could be stopped from using the name "State Labor News", but he doesn't think we could. I'm sure that many people think that he is speaking for Labor and he takes some antiÿlabor views at timesÿ If interested in this approach you might talk to Francis. So far as the particular issue we are both interested inÿ I have been {{trying to figure out how}} to find eut where he got that information, but can't think of an angle; of course, he may have just dreamed it up.
