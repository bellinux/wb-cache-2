50|$|A {{link between}} the flight of the Briouzes and Rǫgnvaldr appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century</b> Histoire des ducs de Normandie et des rois d'Angleterre, which states that, whilst en route to Scotland just before their capture, the Briouzes stayed on Mann for four days.

In any case, English depredations on Mann are corroborated by other sources, such as the Annals of Loch Cé, and the continuation of William de Newburgh's (died 1198×) Historia rerum Anglicarum. In his own account of events, John declared that he had learned of the capture of Briouze's wife and children whilst at Carrickfergus, a statement which may hint that the attack on Mann was punitive in nature.|$|R

The traditional interpretation fosters an assumption that royal sponsorship lay behind this whole process, starting from an alleged ordinance given by King Enrique II of Trastámara. However, a detailed analysis seems to suggest a very different interpretation that reflects the bishop`s own ability in government. Using to his own advantage the monarch`s death and the ensuing coronation of Juan I, he obtained the grant of several important favours (mercedes) for the support of the cathedral chapter. At the same time he succeeded in establishing a direct relationship between the royal family and the cathedral of Lugo. Prom this relationship a special status is awarded to the chapel of St. Dominic —founder of the order to which the bishop himself belongs— which subsequently becomes the "royal chapel". And finally, at the entrance to the new royal chapel, the family arms of Aguiar are placed, thus evoking the importance of a noble lineage in direct relation to royal power...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the image of relations between husband and wife presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century</b> educational treatise De regimine principum by Giles of Rome. It belonged to the most popular ‘mirrors of princes’ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages. Giles shows how conjugal relations should be arranged primarily by outlining the husband’s duties to, and his treatment of, his wife. He is responsible for her moral development. He is to lead her to temperance, silence and stability (ad temperantiam & ad taciturnitatem & ad stabilitatem). In marital sex he is to comply with the Church’s teachings, to provide his wife with adequate material goods, to show signs of love, and to give appropriate warnings when her behaviour is improper. The instruction of how to deal properly with the wife is formulated by Giles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the authority assigned to her husband over her, and consequently of his responsibility for guiding her. This prerogative of the husband is due to a woman’s natural subordination to a man because of his superiority over her in terms of prudence and reason. The government that the husband exercises over his wife should not be that of the parent over his child nor that of the master over his servant. He should treat his wife as a companion (tamquam socia). A natural element of conjugal relations is amicitia (love) that results – as it may be assumed – from living together, and that manifests itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ways spouses treat each other. The proper fulfilment of their duties by the husband and the wife was to guarantee their harmonious coexistence, although far more responsibility fell on the husband because of his natural superiority over the woman...|$|R

40|$|In medieval western literature, the home/exile binary {{has three}} {{distinct}} but interrelated valences: political, familial and spiritual. The kindred {{is the fundamental}} context for engagement with the wider community of the homeland; Christian theology draws upon images of family and polity to describe the relationship between God and humanity. The gendered nature of medieval social relations is reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depiction of exile and homecoming in hagiography and romance. Of particular interest to me are those tales {{in which a woman}} is driven from home by the threat of paternal incest (AT 510 B in Aarne 2 ̆ 7 s folktale typology). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century</b> Latin Vita Dympnae et Gereberni, Saint Dympna flees Ireland to escape her father 2 ̆ 7 s desire and to establish an ideal eremetic community; he pursues and martyrs her. Her deliberate choice of exile is characterized as both the act of a femina virilis and the nuptial journey of a sponsa Christi. Repudiating her ties to family and polity, she gains the freedom to pursue her spiritual commitments, yet the familial and political structures she rejects shape her community <b>in</b> exile. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth-century Middle English romance Emaré, the eponymous protagonist is banished on two different occasions—once by her father for refusing to marry him, once through the machinations of the woman whose son she does marry—but returns triumphant as the mother of an heir to two kingdoms. Exile in this text is primarily a family affair, and Emaré 2 ̆ 7 s response to it is typically feminine. She does not choose exile, but endures it; her homecoming is achieved not through conquest, but through stage—management. What power she wields arises from her maternity; its exercise is linked with her care for her son and the perpetuation of the patrilineages with which she is affiliated. In each case, navigating exile challenges the woman outcast 2 ̆ 7 s ability to maintain her balance. Her survival requires her to be true to her allegiances even when that web of loyalties is tangled to the breaking point. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} first poetry written in Castilian by intellectuals, the 'mester de clerecía', ‘craft of clerics’. Exploring the unique {{circumstances}} of Iberia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages as a hub for the intellectual vanguard and a holy territory for encounters with saints, pilgrimage and Reconquest, I examine the canonical texts of an alleged thirteenth-century poetic school as the Castilian bedrock {{of a wider}} Iberian and European literary movement. Notably including analysis of the fourteenth-century "Libro de buen amor", a canonical work {{in its own right}} thought to parody the earlier poems, I also reassess the significance of the verse form 'cuaderna vía' for the 'mester de clerecía', <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century</b> poems are exclusively written. Over an introduction and four chapters, I combine close reading of the "Libro de Alexandre" (Chapter 1), Berceo’s Vidas of Millán, Domingo and Oria (Chapter 2), the "Libro de Apolonio" and "Poema de Fernán González" (Chapter 3), and the "Libro de buen amor" (Chapter 4), with research into intellectual, pedagogical, and religious contexts. Notably, I have found the poems analyzed to be especially concerned with the landscape of the reading mind. The result is an expanded view of the 'mester de clerecía' as theological and philosophical poems that offer ways of understanding and approaching {{the life of the mind}} as well as that of the body that are thought-provoking and informative to this day. Concluding that <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century,</b> canonical poems are the witnesses of a 'textual community' of authors rather than a poetic school, I advocate an inclusive definition of the 'mester de clerecía'. The 'mester de clerecía' are of extremely rich intellectual scope and are of potential interest to scholars of all European literatures, and literary, intellectual, and social history, as well as theology and philosophy.

40|$|The role of {{sexuality}} in Christian marriage and Christian society {{was the subject}} of much heated debate during the medieval period. Although marriage as a Christian institution of mutual contract was well defined {{by the end of the}} twelfth century, the definition of acceptable sexual relations within a valid marriage continued to be problematical. An examination of primary sources, particularly from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, has shown that not all views {{of sexuality}} were negative, and that the topic was the focus of lively discussions within all factions of society. ^ The west portal of Senlis cathedral, completed around 1170 under the tenure of Bishop Amaury, is presented as a monument which visually supported the marriage reforms of the late twelfth century. The strong association between Bishop Amaury and Pope Alexander III, a leading figure in marriage reform during this period, is examined. Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s insistence on mutuality of contract between the marriage partners is represented visually on the Senlis tympanum where the Heavenly Bride and Groom are given equal status. ^ <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century</b> Roman de la Rose, Jean de Meun brings to the reading public for <b>the</b> first time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vernacular, issues relating to the debate on the role of sexuality in society [...] matters which had been the topic of discussion amongst the literati before this time. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> form of an unresolved disputation, <b>the</b> characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poem address many aspects of human sexuality, but the issue of which 2 ̆ 2 authorities 2 ̆ 2 should dictate the sexual behavior of the individual remains unresolved. ^ By the fourteenth century, Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales is still wrestling with the issue of the relationship between marriage and sexuality, particularly in his presentation of the Wife of Bath and her tale. Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s garrulous pilgrim openly admits to using her sexuality for economic gain in her first three marriages and seems also to advocate 2 ̆ 2 maistrie, 2 ̆ 2 for herself in her final marriage to Jankyn.

In his monumental study of 1896, La leyenda de los infantes de Lara, Ramon Menendez Pidal rescued the story of the Seven Knights de Lara (SKL) from near oblivion and sought to resolve the more problematic issues of <b>the</b> narration included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth-century</b> Estoria de España for the first time. Approximately a half-century later, the same story was retold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Crónica de 1344 with more vivid and novelistic details, as well as episodes that were absent from the earlier version. Many scholars have dedicated their careers to studying the medieval epic, yet they have never read the SKL because there was no English translation of it. I have pioneered the first bilingual edition of the legend with the hope of making it accessible to a broader audience ofscholars and students ofthe Middle Ages. My objective was to capture accurately the details of the original texts while providing a translation that can be read independently of them. In order to achieve this goal, I took minor liberties and suppressed unnecessary repetitions, modernized the syntax, and divided the text into paragraphs. Keeping <b>in</b> mind <b>the</b> needs of an audience of scholars and students, I have provided explanations about key historical figures and events, geographical names, concepts of medieval law, specific points of contention among critics regarding certain passages or characters, and references to other literary works. A principal component of the edition is the preliminary study that presents the social, political, and literary contexts <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> narration was composed as well as the major problems that literary scholars discuss today: the questions about the origins of the legend and its authorship, the date of composition, medieval historiography, history and fiction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SKL, the structure of the two versions and their differences, and the representation of <b>the</b> SKL <b>in</b> later literary works. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> study I not only present the major trends of scholarship that have emerged, but also develop and expound my own perspective on the legend. I assert that the chroniclers included <b>the</b> SKL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Estoria de España to preserve a well-known story with a moralizing lesson about the dangers of internal enemies and treason...|$|R
