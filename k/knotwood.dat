They plea that the Hero must defend their treasures from the wretched BB Bandits. When investigating the Digadigmid, the Hero encounters a woman by the name of Nevada Montecarlo (a reference to Indiana Jones). The two later team up and take on Vivian, the leader of the BB Bandit Trio. In the meantime, Rosie becomes cursed and is only able to speak in a similar manner to those of the Digadigs. This curse will last throughout the majority of the game. Once the villains flee and peace is restored, Nevada and the Hero part ways. He and Rosie then head back to the Island to compete in their second Level-Up Battle, in which both emerge victoriously. Even a very familiar character is cast under this spell, forcing the character to say [...] "digadig" [...] in every sentence.|$|E
30|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{properties of}} hydrophilic extracts of <b>knotwood</b> of several industrially important tree species {{were evaluated by}} lipid-peroxidation inhibition and peroxyl-trapping capacity tests. The results were compared with the antioxidant properties of hydrophilic extracts of bark, and pure lignans and flavonoids isolated from <b>knotwood</b> extracts. The knot extracts from several tree species were stronger antioxidants than the bark extracts, which can, however, also be classified as strong antioxidants. In addition, the antioxidant properties {{of most of the}} <b>knotwood</b> extracts are stronger than the pure compounds. It is concluded that <b>knotwood</b> is a rich source of natural antioxidants.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrevious studies {{reported}} that <b>knotwood</b> of several European Pinus sp. contains extractives contents {{much higher than}} stemwood consisting mainly of phenolic compounds which may find valuable applications in cosmetic, nutraceutic or pharmaceutic sectors. At the same time, no comprehensive studies on the tropical species Pinus merkusii have been reported. Determination of extractives amounts present in sapwood, heartwood and <b>knotwood</b> of P. merkusii has been performed and their chemical composition analyzed using GC-MS and LC-MS. Antioxidant and antifungal activities were also evaluated by DPPH method and growth inhibition method, respectively. The results showed that <b>knotwood</b> contains more extractives than heartwood, the latter containing more extractives than sapwood. <b>Knotwood</b> extracts contain mainly lignans, especially nortrachelogenin, stilbenes and resin acids, while heartwood extracts were constituted mainly of stilbenes, especially pinosylvin monomethyl ether, pinosylvin and pinosylvin dimethyl ether and of flavonoid like pinocembrin. Acetone <b>knotwood</b> extract presents the higher antioxidant activity, while acetone heartwood extract possesses the higher antifungal activities against the two tested fungi Trametes versicolor and Poria placenta...|$|E
40|$|Extractives {{are present}} in much larger amounts in <b>knotwood</b> than in {{heartwood}} in the 12 tested hardwood and softwood species. The chemical identity of the extractives varies largely among species, lignans being only present in softwood species. Extractives from <b>knotwood</b> may constitute {{an important source of}} new chemicals and remain still poorly known. The content of extractives (and particularly lignans) in knots was compared to that of heartwood {{in a number of different}} European softwood and hardwood species. Twelve species characteristic of European forests were sampled. Extractions were carried out with four solvents of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, acetone, toluene/ethanol and water). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for the identification of the compounds present in acetone extracts which are expected to contain lignans. In all tested species, <b>knotwood</b> presented larger contents of extractives than heartwood. The main compounds were lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids, lignans being present only in softwood species. With the exception of oak, <b>knotwood</b> in softwood species contain larger amounts of extractives than that in hardwood species. The chemical nature of extractives present in <b>knotwood</b> varies with species. Their amount is generally much higher in softwood than heartwood species...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} lipophilic extractives in the hexane extracts from grey alder bark, <b>knotwood,</b> and cones has been investigated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The efficiency of two extraction methods was compared. The highest amount of lipophilic extractives (about 9 % of o. d. material) was observed in grey alder cone, while the lowest (about 3 %) was found in <b>knotwood.</b> The three different morphological parts of alder showed significant differences {{not only in the}} content but also in composition of extractives, namely fatty acids, triglycerides, and triterpenes. The main identified compounds were triterpenoids (lupen- 3 -one, lupeol, betulone, betulinol, and betulinic acid) in bark, and triglycerides in cones. The major group in <b>knotwood</b> was free fatty acids (mainly linoleic acid, 18 : 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Polyphenolic {{compounds}} occurring {{naturally in}} <b>knotwood</b> of plants {{are known to}} have antimicrobial effects. The knots (i. e. the branch bases inside tree stems) and outer branches in pine trees contain a remarkably high concentration of phenolic stilbenes, while lignans are the major phenolic constituents of spruce knots. Large amount of these phenolic compounds can be extracted from wood knots at pulp and paper mills where their presence is undesirable. In Finland, marinating of broiler meat is done not only to increase or add value to the meat, but also to enhance the safety and shelf-life. These products are usually packed under a modified atmosphere for further protection against spoilage microorganisms. However, studies have revealed that addition of marinades to poultry products do not have an inhibitory effect on either some psychrotrophic anaerobic bacteria, such as Brochothrix thermosphacta or lactic acid bacteria associated with spoilage. Also, the activity of pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni is not affected by marinating. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the inhibitory and lethal activities of extracts from spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.) <b>knotwood</b> and outer branches that are dissolved in ethanol against the spoilage microorganisms in modified atmosphere packaged marinated broiler products. Modified atmosphere packaged broiler products were separately inoculated with ‘normal’ marinades, marinades with 70 % ethanol, marinades with a mixture of spruce and pine extracts dissolved in 70 % ethanol or mixture of spruce and pine extracts in powder form. The bacterial colony forming units per gram obtained from each of the samples were analysed on de Man Rogosa and Sharpe agar at days 1, 6, 12 and 15. The results showed that there were significant differences in bacterial colony forming units per gram (P < 0. 05) between packages with ‘normal’ marinades and packages with extracts added to their marinades on the 12 th and 15 th day. It can be concluded that the addition of extracts from spruce and pine <b>knotwood</b> to marinades significantly retarded growth of spoilage microorganisms during the 15 day test period. However further research is warranted to characterise and establish the safety and suitability of the compound(s) in spruce and pine <b>knotwood</b> extracts that are responsible for inhibitory or lethal activity against the microbes that may be present in marinated poultry meat...|$|E

40|$|Background: Forestry {{residues}} {{consisting of}} softwood {{are a major}} lignocellulosic resource for production of liquid biofuels. Scots pine, a commercially important forest tree, was fractionated into seven fractions of chips: juvenile heartwood, mature heartwood, juvenile sapwood, mature sapwood, bark, top parts, and <b>knotwood.</b> The different fractions were characterized analytically with regard to chemical composition and susceptibility to dilute-acid pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification. Results: All fractions were characterized by a high glucan content (38 - 43 %) and a high content of other carbohydrates (11 - 14 % mannan, 2 - 4 % galactan) that generate easily convertible hexose sugars, and by a low content of inorganic material (0. 2 - 0. 9 % ash). The lignin content was relatively uniform (27 - 32 %) and the syringyl-guaiacyl ratio of the different fractions were within the range 0. 021 - 0. 025. The <b>knotwood</b> had a high content of extractives (9 %) {{compared to the other}} fractions. The effects of pretreatment and enzymatic saccharification were relatively similar, but without pretreatment the bark fraction was considerably more susceptible to enzymatic saccharification. Conclusions: Since sawn timber is a main product from softwood species such as Scots pine, it is an important issue whether different parts of the tree are equally suitable for bioconversion processes. The investigation shows that bioconversion of Scots pine is facilitated by that most of the different fractions exhibit relatively similar properties with regard to chemical composition and susceptibility to techniques used for bioconversion of woody biomass...|$|E
40|$|The term extractives defines {{chemical}} compounds of different classes {{that can be}} extracted from wood or bark by means of polar or non-polar solvents. Extractives are derived mostly from the metabolic processes of the tree, particularly the sapwood to heartwood transformation. The first objective of the research was to study the distribution of extractives within Sitka spruce trees at different heights in the trunk, {{as well as the}} distribution between bark, rootwood, <b>knotwood,</b> heartwood and sapwood. The second aim of the work was to learn about the influence of yield class, site elevation, North/East location and thinning on the extractives content and composition of Sitka spruce across Scotland. The samples were sawdust obtained in different ways from either discs, knots or roots sawn from Sitka spruce trees freshly cut in the forest, or collected during the coring of trees from 64 sites all around Scotland and northern England. The extraction was carried out on Soxhlet extractors using acetone as solvent. Two analytical techniques were used: gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results of the research showed that the extractive content and composition of Sitka spruce differed according to the type of wood studied with the largest amount detected in bark and the lowest in heartwood and sapwood. The last two types of wood were studied in more detail, showing that the difference in extractive content between heartwood and sapwood was consistent at all heights in the trunk. The chromatographic analysis of heartwood, sapwood, <b>knotwood,</b> rootwood and bark showed that their compositions differed slightly from published data on Norway spruce.

40|$|White-rot fungi {{possess the}} unique ability to degrade and {{mineralize}} {{all the different}} components of wood. In other respects, wood durability, among other factors, {{is due to the}} presence of extractives that are potential antimicrobial molecules. To cope with these molecules, wood decay fungi have developed a complex detoxification network including glutathione transferases (GST). The interactions between GSTs from two white-rot fungi, Trametes versicolor and Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and an environmental library of wood extracts have been studied. The results demonstrate that the specificity of these interactions is closely related to the chemical composition of the extracts in accordance with the tree species and their localization inside the wood (sapwood vs heartwood vs <b>knotwood).</b> These data suggest that the fungal GSTome could reflect the chemical environment encountered by these fungi during wood degradation and could be a way to study their adaptation to their way of life...|$|E

30|$|One {{of active}} topic due to NIRS is {{application}} of imaging. Also {{in case of}} Wood-NIR research, many researchers try to introduce NIR-imaging technique. Fernandes et al. [55] measured intra-ring wood density by means of visible-NIR hyperspectral imaging. The measurements were performed with a spatial resolution of 79  µm. The coefficient of determination value between the present method and X-ray microdensitometry is 0.810 with a root mean squared error of 6.54  ×  10.2  g cm− 3. Lestander et al. [56] applied NIR hyperspectral images to explore various fractions of pine and spruce wood. The average image PLS models {{could be used to}} make prediction of images showing the location of the regions with high extractive content in <b>knotwood.</b> Meder et al. used hyperspectral images for compression wood. NIRS has been used to predict the severity of compression wood in samples of Radiata pine using a subjective microscopic assessment of compression wood as the reference method [57]. The calibration statistics are only moderate which {{may be due to the}} subjectivity of the traditional method. Mora et al. [58] also used NIR hyperspectral imaging for the estimation of basic density (BD) and moisture content (MC) of Loblolly pine disks. The predictive ability of the calibrations was acceptable, with RMSEP of 23.6  kg m− 3 for BD and 2.1  % for MC. Kobori et al. [59] monitored the surface moisture content of wood using hyperspectral imaging during natural drying. Visible-NIR hyperspectral imaging was tested for its suitability for monitoring MC of wood samples. Hyperspectral imaging has a high potential for monitoring the water distribution of wood.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine, in some detail, the {{thermally}} induced changes in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) wood with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopies. These techniques were also utilised to identify lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts from heat-treated and native wood samples. Furthermore, the molecular structures of the extractable compounds characteristic for Scots pine wood were comprehensively studied with UVRR spectroscopy. Spectroscopic data revealed that the structure of thermally treated wood was extensively modified at temperatures above 200  °C. These modifications included the depolymerisation and condensation of lignin, degradation of hemicelluloses as well as the removal and/or decomposition of the wood resin components. UVRR and FT-IR spectral data indicated that thermally modified wood treated at temperatures above 200  °C had increased durability against fungal attack and damage. The structure of lignin on the surface of thermally treated wood was less vulnerable to weathering than that of untreated wood. A diminished content of hemicelluloses contributed, at least partially, to the improved fungal and weather durability of heat-treated wood, as did the lower equilibrium moisture content and swelling. It is likely that the modified structure of lignin in the heat treated wood partially retarded UV light-induced degradation reactions of lignin during natural weathering. All unsaturated model compounds of wood resin were resonance enhanced by UV excitation. Spectra recorded from solid heartwood, <b>knotwood,</b> and branchwood samples included medium to strong Raman signals due to the unsaturated structures of wood resin. Moreover, characteristic bands for particular extractable compounds were observed in the UVRR spectra of the lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts and solid wood samples. Of these, pinosylvin had a useful band in the fingerprint region at 997  cm− 1 and was identified as being present sometimes in significant quantities. reviewe...|$|E
