5|$|The Dornier Do 17, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift ("flying pencil"), was a light bomber of Nazi Germany during World War II. It was produced by Claudius Dornier's company, Dornier Flugzeugwerke. The aircraft was designed as a Schnellbomber ("fast bomber"), a light bomber which, in theory, would be so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> it could outrun defending fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Shield nickel {{series has}} yielded {{a large number}} of varieties. Howard Spindel, a leading expert on Shield nickels, notes that Shield nickel dies {{produced}} far fewer coins than other coin dies, as the dies wore out so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> the Mint was continually under great pressure to produce new ones. According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E

5|$|In {{the solid}} state, flerovium is {{expected}} to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density variously predicted to be either 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) {{is expected to}} move so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> it has a mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like lead and tin are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13million years ago. This steepened {{the stream}} {{gradient}} of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon {{section of the}} park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defeat at}} Sedan left the Allied Army Groups in Belgium with sparse flank protection. The German attack, {{especially}} the breakout from the bridgeheads at Sedan, was so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> there were hardly any major combats. Many French soldiers were in such shock {{that they were}} taken prisoner before they could offer resistance, which also explains the low casualty rates for both sides. The two assault engineer battalions under Korthals achieved the most important success. By eliminating the bunkers in the Bellevue sector, they made the breakthroughs of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions possible. This was achieved without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|The inert pair {{effects in}} livermorium should be even {{stronger}} than for polonium {{and hence the}} +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this {{is reflected in the}} expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be possible to attain. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature. It should also be denser than polonium (α-Lv: 12.9g/cm3; α-Po: 9.2g/cm3); like polonium it should also form an α and a β allotrope. The electron of the hydrogen-like livermorium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Lv115+) is expected to move so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> it has a mass 1.86 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like polonium and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so <b>fast</b> <b>that</b> it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so <b>fast</b> <b>that,</b> despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
