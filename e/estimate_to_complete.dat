5000|$|Soon after {{completion}} in 1812, the embankment was breached {{in a violent}} storm. Repairs were completed {{by the end of}} September 1814. Although the original <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> The Cob was £23,500 (£16.9million in 2014), it eventually cost Madocks £60,000 (£43.3million in 2014) to finish.

5000|$|ETC is the {{independent}} variable, EAC is the dependent variable, and AC is fixed based on expenditures to date. ETC {{should always be}} reported truthfully to reflect the project team <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the outstanding work. If ETC pushes EAC to exceed BAC, then project management skills are employed to either recommend performance improvements or scope change, but never force ETC to give the [...] "correct" [...] answer so that EAC=BAC. Managing project activities to keep the project within budget is a human factors activity, not a mathematical function.|$|E

50|$|Site {{surveys are}} {{inspections}} {{of an area}} where work is proposed, to gather information for a design or an <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the initial tasks required for an outdoor activity.

Examples of projects requiring a preliminary site survey include urban construction, specialized construction (such as the location for a telescope) and wireless network design.|$|E
50|$|The {{confidence}} {{aspect of}} the ARCS model focuses on establishing positive expectations for achieving success among learners. The confidence level of learners is often correlated with motivation {{and the amount of}} effort put forth in reaching a performance objective. For this reason, it's important that learning design provides students with a method for estimating their probability of success. This can be achieved {{in the form of a}} syllabus and grading policy, rubrics, or a time <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> tasks. Additionally, confidence is built when positive reinforcement for personal achievements is given through timely, relevant feedback.|$|E
50|$|Joseph Locke was {{appointed}} as the engineer, {{but it was}} evident that substantially more capital was required to complete the line—Giles' original estimate had been £1 million including an allowance for contingencies, but the updated <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> was £1.5 million. Parliamentary authority to increase the capital by what is nowadays known as a rights issue was obtained on 30 June 1837, not without unwelcome opposition from Giles. The Act also authorised a number of local deviations to the route which reduced the earthworks necessary, and which replaced a proposed tunnel at Popham with a cutting on an eight-mile deviation from the original route.|$|E

40|$|The Early Flight Fission-Test Facilities (EFF-TF) team at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) {{has been}} tasked by the Naval Reactors Prime Contract Team (NRPCT) {{to provide a}} cost and {{delivery}} rough {{order of magnitude estimate}} for a refractory metal-based lithium (Li) flow circuit. The design is based on the stainless steel Li flow circuit that is currently being assembled for an NRPCT task underway at the EFF-TF. While geometrically the flow circuit is not representative of a final flight prototype, knowledge has been gained to quantify (time and cost) the materials, manufacturing, fabrication, assembly, and operations to produce a testable configuration. This Technical Memorandum (TM) also identifies the following key issues {{that need to be addressed}} by the fabrication process: Alloy selection and forming, cost and availability, welding, bending, machining, assembly, and instrumentation. Several candidate materials were identified by NRPCT including molybdenum (Mo) alloy (Mo- 47. 5 %Re), tantalum (Ta) alloys (T- 111, ASTAR- 811 C), and niobium (Nb) alloy (Nb- 1 %Zr). This TM is focused only on the Mo and Ta alloys, since they are of higher concern to the ongoing effort. The initial <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a Mo- 47 %Re system ready for testing is =$ 9, 000 k over a period of 30 mo. The initial <b>estimate</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a T- 111 or ASTAR- 811 C system ready for testing is =$ 12, 000 k over a period of 36 mo...|$|E
40|$|Businesses need to {{estimate}} the workforce requirements based on predicted future workloads. A typical company will have many projects which are either already in process or predicted to start within a 1 to 2 year window. For the class project a specific company {{was used as a}} case study. The number of projects being evaluated in this company was over one hundred and fifty. With this many projects its easy to understand why forecasting resource needs with variation in start date, duration and effort is no simple task. The company has an existing spreadsheet model which it uses for resource calculation. The existing spreadsheet captures historical resource usage information up to the current month, but it was lacking in its ability to project future resource needs based on project variation from a fixed plan. To improve on this existing model uncertainty variables were added to: The individual project start dates, project durations and work for each labor code or <b>Estimate</b> <b>To</b> <b>Complete</b> (ETC.) This allows the program office to simulate different scenarios for labor needs in the future. The project uses Monte Carlo simulations based on the user input to generate the forecasted labor needs. The goals of this project included: Giving the program office a simulation environment to game different project scenarios with minimal effort. For example if the program office wanted to determine the company wide resource implications of a specific project(s) ending later then expected. Giving the program office a range over which resource needs could vary per labor code as input to their current process for resource needs calculation. This range could be used by the program ffice to better estimate overall need. It can be used as justification for the anticipated resource levels that are reported to executive staff...|$|E
