The Chick-fil-A Bowl had the second pick of bowl-eligible teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the fifth pick from eligible teams in the Southeastern Conference. <b>In</b> <b>picking</b> Virginia Tech and Tennessee, the selection committee bypassed teams with better or similar records {{in order to create}} a matchup appealing to television audiences. Pregame media coverage focused on the close geographic rivalry between the two teams and the success of Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin in reversing his team's poor fortune from the previous season.|$|E

He was succeeded by Ha' K'in Xook, who was possibly his brother.|$|E

He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting that in that case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E

They stop at a roadhouse bar where Day's band is performing, not realizing it has an exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas and they quickly exit, smashing up Flounder's borrowed car and leaving their dates behind.|$|E

In Germany, however, the leading figures such as Albrecht Dürer and his pupils, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Albrecht Altdorfer and the Danube school, and Hans Holbein the Younger all followed the Reformers. The development of German religious painting had come to an abrupt halt by about 1540, although many prints and book illustrations, especially of Old Testament subjects, continued to be produced.|$|E

25|$|While the 2016–17 {{campaign}} {{was similar to}} the previous two in some ways (a dual ECWHL championship, an ACHA tournament bid), it was also different in others. Beyond his typically-stout freshman class, Wright picked up three key transfers, including goaltender Amber Greene (via Penn State's NCAA Division I team), swing player Sonja Klumpp (who led the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference in scoring as a freshman at Maryland) and Olivia Knight (another NCAA player, from Division III's Nichols College). Thus bolstered, the Minutemen wasted no time <b>in</b> <b>picking</b> up the key non-conference win that had proven somewhat elusive in recent seasons: a wild 5–4 outcome over then-second-ranked Liberty, an affair that saw UMass go from up 3–0 after the first period to down 4–3 early in the third, before goals from Tatum Schulz and Joanna Olson pulled the tilt back. Other key non-conference results included a subsequent tie against the Flames, another with No. 1 Miami, still another with No. 5 Grand Valley State and a rout of No. 9 Michigan. Meanwhile, the Minutewomen flexed an unprecedented amount of muscle within the ECWHL, as a late-season tie with Rhode Island was the only blemish on the squad's league record over 14 regular season games and a pair of playoff tilts, including the third straight championship game win over URI.|$|E
