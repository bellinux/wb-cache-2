40|$|Background: Contact {{hypersensitivity}} quantitative {{risk assessment}} (QRA) for fragrance ingredients {{is being used to}} establish new international standards for all fragrance ingredients that are potential skin sensitizers. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the retrospective clinical data on three fragrance ingredients in order to provide a practical assessment of the predictive value of the QRA approach. It is important to have data to assess that the methodology provides a robust approach for primary prevention of contact sensitization induction for fragrance ingredients identified as potential sensitizers. Methods: This article reviews clinical data for three fragrance ingredients <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde,</b> citral, and isoeugenol to assess the utility of the QRA approach for fragrance ingredients. Results: This assessment suggests that had the QRA approach been available at the time standards were established for these fragrance ingredients, the clinical response might have been noticeably improved.

40|$|Chemicals in our {{environment}} {{with which we}} have repeated skin contact can cause skin sensitisation (contact allergy). To trigger an immune response a compound (hapten) {{must be able to}} penetrate the skin, where it needs to be reactive enough to bind to proteins and form immunogenic complexes that are recognised as foreign. Electrophilicity has been identified as an important characteristic, which enables haptens to react with nucleophilic amino acids in proteins. In this thesis, a specific type of electrophiles, epoxides, have been investigated. Skin sensitising potencies related to physicochemical parameters have been investigated using structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Studies on the formation of epoxides by abiotic (air oxidation) and biotic (metabolically in skin) activation from unsaturated compounds and the impact on the sensitising potency of such compounds were also performed. Cinnamic alcohol, a fragrance and flavouring compound, is a well-known contact allergen. However, it lacks the necessary structural alerts to function as a hapten and must be activated to be able to act as a sensitiser. In this thesis, cinnamic alcohol was used to study the formation of allergenic oxidation products (i. e. epoxides) by air exposure and metabolically. The autoxidation study was performed to gain knowledge regarding stability of cinnamic alcohol upon air exposure, oxidation products and sensitising potencies. The sensitising potency (as examined by the murine local lymph node assay) of cinnamic alcohol after two weeks of air exposure was enhanced about four-fold. Two strongly sensitising compounds, epoxy cinnamic alcohol and <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde,</b> were detected in the formed oxidation mixture. Thus, for the first time, it was shown that cinnamic alcohol acts as a prehapten. The bioactivation of cinnamic alcohol, using human liver microsomes, resulted in the same oxidation products although the mechanism for their formation is completely different. In addition, epoxy <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> was detected. Most likely, the two epoxides and <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> are all contributing to the sensitising potency of cinnamic alcohol whether they are formed outside the skin or in the skin. Up to now, the contact allergenic effect seen from cinnamic alcohol has only been associated with <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> formed as a metabolite from cinnamic alcohol. The present findings shed new light on the mechanism behind the allergenic effect of cinnamic alcohol and offer explanations to the many clinical cases of contact allergy to cinnamic alcohol not reacting to the aldehyde. Terminal epoxides are known contact sensitisers present in compounds used in epoxy resin systems (ERS). The most commonly used epoxy resin monomer (ERM), diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), is causing high rates of occupational contact allergy. Thus, it would be highly advantageous to replace this strongly sensitising compound with less hazardous alternatives, since even a single accidental exposure may induce primary sensitisation to ERM. In this thesis, specially-designed analogues of phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) and DGEBA, with terminal epoxides intact, were investigated. The results reveal that the design of series of well-defined compounds can give important insights into the SARs thereof and increased knowledge about the structural basis for sensitisation potential. It has been demonstrated, for the first time, how the chemical reactivity and the sensitising potency of terminal epoxides vary with the overall structure of the compound. Using this knowledge regarding SARs of terminal epoxides novel epoxy resin monomers with reduced sensitising potency were achieved for the first time without compromising the technical properties. By modifying the intrinsic reactivity of ERMs, the fundamental and underlying causes of contact allergy to ERS have been addressed. Using these modified analogues with reduced sensitising potency, in addition to regulations and protective clothing, would reduce occupational contact allergy in the future...|$|R

The essential oils of Rosmarinus officinalis and Salvia officinalis, which are rich in monoterpenic hydrocarbons and monoterpenic ketones, respectively, showed poor activity, whereas the oils of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and Thymus sp. showed a marked toxic effects (over 90 % mortality after 72 h). This {{could be explained by}} the activity of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> (about 80 % of the Cinnamomum oil) and carvacrol (68 % of Th. capitatus oil and about 45 % of Th. herba barona oil). The first consequence of ingesting even small quantities of essential oils was a depressive effect on the nervous system. Dissection of dead flies showed marked differences compared with the controls and microscopic examination revealed anomalies in the gut region...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Biofilms are {{communities}} of microorganisms {{that can be}} found in almost every habitat. They can be attached to a surface and protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules that substantially protect microorganisms from environmental effects. The aim of this research is to explore the potency of essential oils from Cinnamomum burmannii Nees ex Bl. and Massoia aromatica Becc. against planktonic growth and biofilm formation of, two opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. Essential oil from C. burmannii and M. aromatica showed a 50 % inhibition of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus planktonic growth (PMIC 50) at concentration of 0. 12 % v/v. Essential oil from C. burmannii and M. aromatica showed capability to inhibit 50 % (MBIC 50) of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilm formation at concentration of 0. 03 % v/v, whereas higher concentration (0. 12 % v/v) was needed by C. burmannii and M. aromatica oil to disrupt 50 % of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus established biofilm. The analysis by GC-MS showed <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> (92. 02 %) to be the major component of C. burmannii essential oil, whereas Massoialactone (92. 05 %) was the mai...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of {{a series}} of para-substituted 2 -methyl-cinnamaldehy- des (1 - 7) at 20 °C and at pH = 2 - 3 afforded S-enantiomers of {{saturated}} alcohols 8 - 14 in 20 - 80 % yield and 75 - > 99 % enantiomeric excess (e. e.); at 30 °C, lower yields and e. e. s were obtained. Relative rates of the formation of allylic alcohols 15 - 21, catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), correlate with the Hammett a+ values of para-substituents, revealing that a more efficient delocalization of the positive charge on carbonylic carbon slow down the reduction rates, whereas no correlation of the electronic properties of the substituents with the rate of C=C double bond reduction, catalyzed by enoate reductase, is observed. On reduction of 3 by dried yeast in 2 H 20, a,(5 -carbon atoms in 10 a bear 2 H atoms, in accordance with the previously reported hydrogenation of selectively 2 H-labeled <b>cinnamic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> and <b>cinnamic</b> alcohol. The accumulated data indicate that the mechanism of the enone C=C bond reduction that comprises nucleophilic attack of the hydride ion species on the (5 -carbon in the first step, followed by enantioselective protonation on the a-carbon atom...|$|R
