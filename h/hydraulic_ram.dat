5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This {{was based on the}} principle of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
25|$|A noria (Arabic: ناعورة, nā‘ūra) {{performs}} {{the function of}} moving water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation. In this it {{is similar to the}} saqiya and other pumps like the Persian wheel (Rahat in Urdu), but those are generally powered by other means or a combination, usually lifting water from a pond or well. Noria is similar to the modern <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram,</b> which also uses the power of flowing water to pump some of the water out of the river.|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} has {{two distinct}} wings {{with a large}} hallway between them, originally with an iron staircase and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> elevator both leading to the third floor. Each side of the hallway on each floor had three doors [...] wide. [...] iron pipes were placed through the walls and floors every thirty feet in order to pipe wine {{from one part of}} the building to another, and {{into and out of the}} building.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> BOPs were in {{use by the}} 1940s. Hydraulically {{actuated}} blowout preventers {{had many}} potential advantages. The pressure could be equalized in the opposing hydraulic cylinders causing the rams to operate in unison. Relatively rapid actuation and remote control were facilitated, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> were well-suited to high pressure wells.|$|R

50|$|The Carter <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Rams</b> were {{constructed}} circa 1924 by George Lafayette Carter to supply water to his summer residence near Hillsville, Carroll County, Virginia. A series of four <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> {{are housed in}} concrete and tile block pumphouses along an intermittent stream. A nearby gas-powered pump provided backup power, but when the rams were in operation they depended only on {{the flow of water}} for their operation. The rams were supplanted in the 1950s by an electric pump system.|$|R
500|$|Razer's {{hydraulic}} system pumped pressurised liquid, {{as opposed to}} pneumatics where a force is generated by the controlled release of a pressurised gas. Razer's arm was often said to exert nine tonnes of force; however, it was the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> which produced up to nine tonnes of pressure per square inch (1,395kg/cm2, [...] ) at its output, and this was geared down to three tonnes per square inch (465kg/cm2, [...] ) {{at the tip of}} the arm.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{decided on}} a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> design, Leader Williams {{appointed}} Edwin Clark as principal designer. At that time the Anderton Basin consisted of a cut on the north bank of the Weaver surrounding a small central island. Clark decided to build the boat lift on this island. The wrought iron caissons were [...] long by [...] wide by [...] deep, and could each accommodate two [...] narrowboats or a barge with a beam of up to [...] Each caisson weighed [...] when empty and [...] when full of water (because of displacement, the weight is the same with or without boats). Each caisson {{was supported by a}} single <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> consisting of a hollow [...] long cast iron vertical piston with a diameter of , in a buried [...] long cast iron vertical cylinder with a diameter of [...] At river level the caissons sat in a water-filled sandstone lined chamber. Above ground the superstructure consisted of seven hollow cast iron columns which provided guide rails for the caissons and supported an upper working platform, walkways and access staircase. At the upper level the boat lift was connected to the Trent and Mersey canal via a [...] long wrought iron aqueduct, with vertical wrought iron gates at either end.|$|E

50|$|CPT rigs advance {{specialized}} {{testing equipment}} (such as electronic cones), and soil samplers using large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams.</b> Most CPT rigs are heavily ballasted (20 metric tons is typical) as a counter force against the pushing {{force of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> which are often rated up to 20 kN. Alternatively, small, light CPT rigs and offshore CPT rigs will use anchors such as screwed-in ground anchors to create the reactive force. In ideal conditions, CPT rigs can achieve production rates of up to 250-300 meters per day.|$|R
2500|$|In normal {{operation}} the cylinders of the hydraulic rams were {{connected by a}} [...] diameter pipe that allowed water to pass between them, thus lowering the heavier caisson and raising the lighter one. To make adjustments at the start and end of a lift either cylinder could be operated independently, powered by an accumulator or pressure vessel {{at the top of}} the lift structure, which was kept primed by a [...] steam engine. If necessary, the steam engine and accumulator could operate either <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> independently to raise the caissons, although in this mode it took about 30 minutes to raise a caisson, as opposed to three minutes in {{normal operation}}.|$|E
2500|$|Removal of the primer, called decapping, in {{reference}} to primers being often previously called primer caps or just caps, is usually done with a die containing a steel pin that punches out the primer. Berdan primed cases require a different technique, either a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> or a hook that punctures the case and levers it out from the bottom. Military cases often have crimped-in primers, and decapping them leaves a slightly indented ring (most common) or, for some military cartridges, a set of stabbed ridges located {{on the edge of}} the primer pocket opening that inhibits or prevents seating a new primer into a decapped case. A reamer or a swage is used to remove both these styles of crimp, whether ring crimps or stab crimps. [...] The purpose of all such primer crimps is to make military ammunition more reliable under more extreme environmental conditions. [...] Some military cartridges also have sealants placed around primers, in addition to crimps, to provide additional protection against moisture intrusion that could deactivate the primer for any ammunition exposed to water under battlefield [...] conditions. [...] Decapping dies, though, easily overcome the additional resistance of sealed primers, with no significant difficulty beyond that encountered when removing non-sealed primers.|$|E

60|$|But if Mrs Marrot's {{surprise}} at the scissors was great, not less great was it at the punching machine, which punched little buttons {{the size of a}} sixpence out of cold iron full half-an-inch thick. This vicious implement not only punched holes all round boiler-plates so as to permit of their being riveted together, but it cut patterns out of thick iron plates by punching rows of such holes so close to each other that they formed one long cutting, straight or crooked, as might be required. In short, the punching machine acted the part of a saw, and cut the iron plates in any shape that was desired. Here also they saw the testing of engine springs--those springs which to most people appear to have no spring in them whatever--so very powerful are they. One of these was laid on an iron table, with its two ends resting against an iron plate. A man approached and measured it exactly. Then a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> was applied; and there was something quite impressive in the easy quiet way, in which the ram shoved a spring, which the weight of a locomotive can scarcely affect, quite flat against the iron plate, and held it there a moment or two! Being released, the spring resumed its proper form. It was then re-measured; found not to have expanded a hair's-breadth, and, therefore,--as Will Garvie took care to explain,-- was passed as a sound well-tempered spring; whereat Bob remarked that it would need to be a good-tempered spring, to suffer such treatment without grumbling.|$|E
