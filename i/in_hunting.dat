5|$|Animals, and {{products}} made from them, {{are used to}} assist <b>in</b> <b>hunting.</b> People have used hunting dogs to help chase down animals such as deer, wolves, and foxes; birds of prey from eagles to small falcons are used in falconry, hunting birds or mammals; and tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting {{dogs in the}} United Kingdom, with the term cocker deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed {{was brought to the}} United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Its use <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> was varied, and {{the breed}} was useful both {{on land and}} in the water.

5|$|Minnesota has {{an active}} program of {{organized}} amateur and professional sports. Tourism {{has become an}} important industry, especially in the Lake region.

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is an ambush predator that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision is of little importance <b>in</b> <b>hunting,</b> as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E

5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch {{may be used as}} a vantage point <b>in</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{park was}} {{established}} {{next to the}} castle; a park was highly prestigious and it enabled Thomas to engage <b>in</b> <b>hunting,</b> provided the castle with a supply of venison as well as generating income. Most of the village of Wittenham had to be destroyed {{to make way for}} the park and the site eventually became a deserted village. A new parish church, St Leonard's Chapel, was built by Thomas just outside the castle, after he had demolished the earlier, simpler 12th-century church during the construction of the inner court. Thomas died in 1397 and was buried in the newly built St Anne's Chapel, forming the north transept of St Leonard's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E

5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger than males, prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{inherited}} {{not only}} the status afforded his family, but also had skills praised in his grandfather Andaigweos. Noted for his abilities <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> and battle, Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people because of his speaking and oratorical skills, which were highly valued in his culture.

5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} hearing and can detect an extremely {{broad range of}} frequencies. They can hear higher-pitched sounds than either dogs or humans, detecting frequencies from 55Hz to 79,000Hz, a range of 10.5octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9octaves. Cats can hear ultrasound, which is important <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls. However, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do. Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute {{in the range of}} 500Hz to 32kHz. This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise.|$|E
5|$|Hunting hare with beagles {{became popular}} again in Britain in {{the mid-19th century}} and {{continued}} until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who {{do not wish to}} participate <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or <b>in</b> <b>hunting</b> and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
