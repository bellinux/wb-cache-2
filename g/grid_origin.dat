A delay is unwelcome to pedestrians given that their slow speed and limited range of reach; the more frequent the intersections the higher the delay.

Addresses are coordinates within the system (similarly to latitude and longitude). Odd and even address numbering depends on the quadrant of the grid in which an address is located.

40|$|The {{geodetic}} datum, and {{its possible}} descriptions, of the Italian cadastral networks are analyzed, {{in order to}} provide a solution to fit the cadastral sheets to modern map contents and grids, using just their corner crosshair data. Analyzing the extension of the Genova 1902 datum to the whole Italian territory, it occured that the transformation error is acceptable only in the original survey area of the respective triangulation net. For Souther Italy and Sicily (Sicilia), the errors exceed the 20 meters. The Molodensky-type transformation parameters of the Castanea della Furie 1910 and the Guardia Vecchia (Sardinia) datums are provided using only their fundamental point coordinates, without error estimation. While these datums are not correctly checked at their whole application are, we suggest to define local datums of the Bessel ellipsoid, using the Bessel and WGS 84 coordinates of the respective cadastral <b>grid</b> <b>origins</b> and use them for geo-reference as a basis of the local Cassini grids...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Distribution maps {{of species}} {{based on a}} grid are useful for {{investigating}} relationships between scale and the number or area of occupied grid cells. A species is scaled up simply by merging occupied grid cells on the observation grid to successively coarser cells. Scale-occupancy relationships (SORs) obtained in this way {{can be used to}} extrapolate species down, in other words to compute occupancies at finer scales than the observation scale. In this paper we demonstrate that the SOR is not unique but depends on where one positions the origin of the grid map. Innovation: The effect of <b>grid</b> <b>origin</b> on SORs was explored with the aid of the Dutch national data base FLORBASE, which contains the observation records of all 1410 wild vascular plants in the Netherlands on a 1 -km square basis. For each species, we generated 2500 unique SORs by scaling up from 1. km, in steps of 1 km, to squares of 50 km. We computed the sensitivity of the SOR to the <b>grid</b> <b>origin</b> for each species, and subsequently analysed the factors that determined this sensitivity. The effect of <b>grid</b> <b>origin</b> on downscaling was demonstrated by means of a simple power function that we used to extrapolate down from both a 2 -km and a 5 -km grid, to the original 1 -km grid. It appeared that the position of <b>grid</b> <b>origin</b> could have a substantial effect on SORs. The sensitivity of SORs to the position of the <b>grid</b> <b>origin</b> depended on three characteristics of a species'spatial distribution: rarity, degree of spatial clustering and the position of the distribution relative to the border of the investigated area. Rare species with a clustered distribution near the border were particularly highly sensitive. The dependence of SOR on <b>grid</b> <b>origin</b> caused unpredictable and non-random errors in downscaled occupancies. Main conclusions: In future, the whole bandwidth of scaled occupancies should be considered when testing and interpreting mathematical relationships between scale and occupancy. Moreover, downscaled occupancies should be interpreted cautiously. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|In biology, {{the study}} of the life cycle of plants and animals helps one to {{understand}} the phenology of a particular species, which is useful in pest management or in biological conservation. Spiders {{are one of the most}} widespread animals on earth. They eat a huge variety of other animals and are good indicators of environmental changes. We studied for the first time the life cycle of an endemic desert spider (Syspira tigrina). Many spider researchers have used the direct estimation of the number of instars to describe the arachnid life cycle. Other methods are based on the analysis of the length-frequency throughout time (indirect methods). Length-frequency distributions are commonly analyzed by histograms. However, this procedure depends on <b>grid</b> <b>origin,</b> and the interval width is discontinuous and uses a fixed interval width. These problems have motivated the interest of statisticians in alternative, more computationally intensive methods. Kernel density estimators (KDEs) do not depend on the origin position and are continuous distribution estimators. In addition, there are several methods for choosing the interval width. In this study, we present in Stata the use of KDEs to examine length-frequency distributions of spider size in combination with the traditional approach using histograms. ...|$|E

40|$|A novel Gaussian-Sinc mixed basis {{set for the}} {{calculation}} of the one-electron electronic structure within a uniform magnetic field in three dimensions is presented. The one-electron system is used {{to demonstrate the utility}} of this new methodology and is a first step in laying the foundation for further development of many-electron atomic and molecular methodology. It is shown in this manuscript how to effectively calculate all basis set integrals, which includes the mixed Gaussian-Sinc integrals, with a fast and accurate method. The Sinc basis is invariant to the choice of the position of the Coulomb potential, as opposed to traditional grid based methods. This invariance guarantees that the choice of the <b>grids</b> <b>origin</b> has no effect on the electronic structure calculation. This is because the Coulomb potential is treated properly in this methodology, as opposed to DVR methodologies. The off-diagonal terms are sparse but very important around the Coulomb singularity. In general, five to six significant digits of accuracy on all converged results without the linear dependency problems of the Gaussian methodologies are achievable. This methodology is applied to calculate the ground state energy of H atom, $H_ 2 ^{+}$ ion and $H_ 3 ^{ 2 +}$ ion in magnetic fields up to a magnetic field strength of 2. 35 x$ 10 ^ 13 $ G (10, 000 au). From these calculations it is shown that $H_ 3 ^{ 2 +}$ ion is unstable without relativistic considerations. Comment: 12 pages and 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new global}} {{georeferencing}} system—the World Geographic Reference System (WGRS) —is proposed. This system has particular advantages for location description and communication with electronic devices, i. e., in digital environments that are shared {{between humans and}} machines. The new World Geographic Reference System strikes a compromise between the dominant use of numbers in established scientific coordinate systems, such as latitude/longitude, and the colloquial preference for names, particularly names of administrative units and populated places, in everyday life. Specifically, WGRS defines a system of uniform regional grids, each 100 x 100 km in extent, anchored on and named by prominent cultural and/or physical features. Subsets of these regional grids, called local grids, which are particularly adapted to smaller places, also may be defined. A location within a regional or local grid is georeferenced by suffixing the grid identifier with a coordinate string of dotted-digit-pairs that represent interleaved Cartesian x-y displacements from the <b>grid</b> <b>origin.</b> A typical WGRS locator, for example, is US. DC. WAS. 54. 18. 28, representing a 100 x 100 m area, {{the southwest corner of}} which is 0. 512 of the way across (east) and 0. 488 of the way up (north) in the Washington, D.

40|$|I n {{contrast}} to many scientific disciplinesembracing {{the vision of}} a uniform global distributed infrastructure to sup-port their activities, ubiquitous comput-ing is currently characterized by an extremely diverse set of infrastructure platforms. Such heterogeneity makes conducting large-scale wide-area exper-iments extremely difficult—most re-searchers choose instead to construct their own ubiquitous computing envi-ronment within which they can run their experiments. This heterogeneity makes the basic vision of ubiquitous computing difficult to realize because interworking between components at different sites isn’t possible. One suggestion is that Grid technolo-gies 1 will make an ideal starting point for developing future infrastructure support for ubiquitous computing, facilitating the deployment of ubiquitous computing technologies and helping to accelerate progress toward Weiser’s vision. FORMING AN ALLIANCE The Grid promises a world where access to computational resources across institutional boundaries is standardized, uniform, inexpensive, ubiquitous, and reliable. The Grid is often seen as a plat-form for networking large computational resources to help execute demanding sci-entific experiments. Over time, however, the Grid has moved away from the mere sharing of computational resources and has become a more generic platform for sharing any kind of networked resource. Although the <b>Grid</b> vision’s <b>origins</b> might not exactly match those of ubiq-uitous computing, we can identify many common elements. 2 For example, both the Grid and ubiquitous computing require solving problems associated with large-scale deployment, resource management, billing and accounting, and interface standardization. In 2003, we began the process of establishing a Global Grid Forum (GGF) Research Group called Ubicomp-RG to explore these synergies between ubiquitous computing and the Grid. For those unfamiliar with the stan-dardization process that the Grid com-munity employs, the GGF is the Grid community’s equivalent of the IETF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Information Technology {{is widely}} used in health care for {{efficiently}} managing the Personal Health Records (PHR) in a cost effective manner. Under this scenario a computing paradigm (cloud computing) where the resources are provided as services will offer a ubiquitous access to medical data. However, there have been wide privacy concerns as personal health information could be exposed to those third party servers and to unauthorized parties. In our paper a hybrid password authentication scheme based on shape and text is used. It uses shapes of strokes on the <b>grid</b> as the <b>origin</b> passwords and allows users to login with text passwords {{with the help of}} traditional input devices. Hidden-camera and shoulder-surfing is highly resistible with this approach. The scheme also has high scalability and flexibility to enhance the authentication process security. Such a privacy preserving PHR system should be enforced cryptographically too. We also leverage attribute based encryption (ABE) techniques to encrypt each patient’s PHR. Apart from previous works in secure outsourcing of data, multiple data owner scenario is focused, and users in the PHR system is divided into multiple security domains that greatly reduces the key management complexity for owners and users...|$|R
5000|$|The Airy {{ellipsoid}} is {{a regional}} best fit for Britain; more modern mapping tends {{to use the}} GRS80 ellipsoid used by the Global Positioning System (the Airy ellipsoid assumes the Earth to be about 1 km smaller in diameter than the GRS80 ellipsoid, and to be slightly less flattened). The British maps adopt a Transverse Mercator projection with an origin (the [...] "true" [...] origin) at 49° N, 2° W (an offshore point in the English Channel which lies between the island of Jersey and the French port of St. Malo). Over the Airy ellipsoid a straight line grid, the National Grid, is placed with a new false origin to eliminate negative numbers, creating a 700 km by 1300 km <b>grid.</b> This false <b>origin</b> is located south-west of the Isles of Scilly. The distortion created between the OS grid and the projection is countered by a scale factor in the longitude to create two lines of longitude with zero distortion rather than one.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} and accurate grid method for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for an atomic system interacting with an intense laser pulse. Instead {{of the usual}} finite difference (FD) method, the radial coordinate is discretized using the discrete variable representation (DVR) constructed from Coulomb wave functions. For an accurate description of the ionization dynamics of atomic systems, the Coulomb wave function discrete variable representation (CWDVR) method needs three to ten times fewer grid points than the FD method. The resultant grid points of the CWDVR are distributed unevenly so that one has a finer <b>grid</b> near the <b>origin</b> and a coarser one at larger distances. The other important advantage of the CWDVR method is that it treats the Coulomb singularity accurately and gives a good representation of continuum wave functions. The time propagation of the wave function is implemented using the well-known Arnoldi method. As examples, the present method is applied to multiphoton ionization of both the H atom and the H- ion in intense laser fields. The short-time excitation and ionization dynamics of H by an abruptly introduced static electric field is also investigated. For {{a wide range of}} field parameters, ionization rates calculated using the present method are in excellent agreement with those from other accurate theoretical calculations...|$|R

The presence of two sets of magnetic nanowires perpendicular {{to each other in}} the same device enables better control over spin waves. The grid was fabricated using e-beam lithography followed by DC-Magnetron sputtering and liftoff technique. It has dimensions of 800 +/- 10 and 400 +/- 10 nm as periods along X and Y directions with permalloy wires of width 145 +/- 10 nm. FMR studies were done at X-band (9. 4 GHz) with the field sweep up to 1 Tesla. The in-plane angular variation of resonant fields shows that there are two well separated modes present, indicating two uniaxial anisotropy axes which are perpendicular to each other. The variation in the intensities in the FMR signal w. r. t. the grid angle is used to describe the spin wave confinement in different regions of the grid.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{wind energy}} is a global trend {{as part of the}} overall transition to a more sustainable energy system. By using modern technologies, the wind energy is converted into electric power which is transported to the consumers by means of the electric power system. The use of these technologies, in the meantime, plays a significant role in maintaining power quality in the electric power system; including positive as well as negative impacts. This thesis emphasises on harmonic distortion within a wind power plant (WPP), for a wind turbine and for the plant level. The harmonic study presented in this thesis has been based on field measurements at a few different individual wind turbines and at a second location in one WPP. In general, the levels of harmonic distortion as percentage of the turbine and WPP ratings are low. Among the frequency components, even harmonics and especially interharmonics are present at levels comparable with the levels of characteristic harmonics. The measurements show that both harmonics and interharmonics vary strongly with time. Interharmonics further show a strong dependence on the active power production of the turbine, while characteristic harmonics are independent on the power production. The even harmonics and interharmonics may excite any resonance in the collection grid or in the external <b>grid.</b> The <b>origin</b> of interharmonic emission due to power converters has been verified through a series of measurements over a two-week period. The interharmonic emission originates from the difference between the generator-side frequency and the power system frequency. A series of interharmonic frequencies are produced and they vary in accordance with the generator-side frequency. Both these interharmonic frequencies and the magnitudes are related to each other, and the theoretical relations have been confirmed through the measurements. The harmonic propagation in a collection grid has been studied by using transfer functions. Without the need to know the harmonic sources, the characteristics of harmonic propagations are quantified through transfer functions. The method has been used to estimate the total harmonic level in a WPP, by combining knowledge of the transfer function with information from harmonic emission of the individual wind turbines. The harmonic aggregation of the emission from the individual turbines towards the point of connection (PoC) has been studied as well. From the studies it was found that interharmonics show a stronger cancellation compared to harmonics, especially compared to lower-order harmonics. According to the object of interest and the harmonic propagation, a distinction has been made between primary and secondary emission. A more detailed classification of the different propagations within a WPP has been proposed. A systematic approach for harmonic studies in association with WPPs has resulted from this. The harmonic voltages and currents at any location are obtained as the superposition of the contribution from different emission sources to this specific location. This location can be either within the WPP or in the external grid. The studies presented conclude that all the contributions should be included to get a reasonable overview of the harmonic distortion in the WPP.
