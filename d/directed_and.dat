40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{estimating}} the genetic effects {{that affect the}} pre-weaning performance of animals from multibreed crosses. In order to do so, it was used information of the weight at weaning of 79, 521 animals, sired by 1, 020 bulls and 61, 898 cows from Aberdeen Angus and Nellore breeds and from many genetic groups resulted from their crosses. Five genetic models were tested: model 1, containing the fixed breed genetic effects (additive <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal effects, heterozygote <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal effects, epystatic <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal effects, joint additive <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal effects); model 2, equal to model 1, excluding <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal joint additive effects; model 3, equal to model 1, excluding <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal epystatic effects; model 4, equal to model 1, excluding <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal epystactic effect <b>and</b> <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal joint additive effects; and model 5, equal to model 1, excluding <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal heterozygotic effects, <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal epystatic effects <b>and</b> <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> maternal joint additive effects. The models were analyzed by the following methods: least square means method, ridge regression method, and the restricted maximum likelihood method. The dominant additive models usually used for genetic evaluations do not give a good description of the pre-weaning performance variations, making it necessary to add the heterozygote and epystatic effects; the joint additive effects do not significantly improve the adjustment of the analysis model and the heterozygote effects are efficient in representing a quadratic breed additive effect, in addition to insert an unnecessary bias assigned to multicollinearity related to the joint additive effects...|$|R

5|$|Eastwood <b>directed</b> <b>and</b> {{starred in}} White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an {{adaptation}} of Peter Viertel's roman à clef, about John Huston {{and the making of}} the classic film The African Queen. Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4million. Later in 1990, Eastwood <b>directed</b> <b>and</b> co-starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie, a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks at}} {{different}} forms of <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect employee participation in the EU. The research questions are: (1) which forms of <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect employee participation can we distinguish?; (2) {{to what extent do}} forms of <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect employee participation coincide within organisations?; and (3) to what extent are forms of <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect employee participation associated with (a) workplace wellbeing and (b) the (economic) performance of the organisation? Using the ECS- 2013 we analyse data from 24, 251 establishments in the 28 EU Member States. Latent class analyses distinguished four types of indirect employee participation and five types of direct employee participation that vary in the extent to which participation is being facilitated. We found little support for the hypothesis that direct employee participation is deployed to replace indirect employee participation: establishments most commonly combine <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect forms of employee participation. Multilevel analyses showed that more extensive forms of <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect employee participation are associated with beneficial outcomes for the organisation (performance) and their employees (workplace wellbeing) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the agreement between <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect comparisons of competing healthcare interventions. DESIGN: Meta-epidemiological study based on sample of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMed. Inclusion criteria Systematic reviews that provided sufficient data for both <b>direct</b> comparison <b>and</b> independent indirect comparisons of two interventions {{on the basis}} of a common comparator and in which the odds ratio could be used as the outcome statistic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Inconsistency measured by the difference in the log odds ratio between the <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect methods. RESULTS: The study included 112 independent trial networks (including 1552 trials with 478, 775 patients in total) that allowed both <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect comparison of two interventions. Indirect comparison had already been explicitly done in only 13 of the 85 Cochrane reviews included. The inconsistency between the <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect comparison was statistically significant in 16 cases (14 %, 95 % confidence interval 9 % to 22 %). The statistically significant inconsistency was associated with fewer trials, subjectively assessed outcomes, and statistically significant effects of treatment in either direct or indirect comparisons. Owing to considerable inconsistency, many (14 / 39) of the statistically significant effects by direct comparison became non-significant when the <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect estimates were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Significant inconsistency between <b>direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect comparisons may be more prevalent than previously observed. <b>Direct</b> <b>and</b> indirect estimates should be combined in mixed treatment comparisons only after adequate assessment of the consistency of the evidence...|$|R
