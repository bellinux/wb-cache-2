If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's <b>directory</b> <b>information,</b> ruining the data stored on the disk. Starting with 1.1 or 1.2 this danger was reduced: if one changed disks without reading the new disk's directory, and tried to write to it, the operating system would signal a fatal error, avoiding overwriting but requiring a reboot (which took {{no more than a}} few seconds, but entailed losing whatever data you were trying to save).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an approach for collaborative construction of artifacts, such as e. g. graphical maps and annotatable text documents, without requiring write-access {{to a common}} single file. Our approach is applicable {{to any kind of}} artifacts that can be divided into separate contributions, where each one is authored and stored independently, and, on request, merged into the artifact. The goal is to move collaboration issues from the files where artifacts are expressed, to an <b>information</b> <b>directory.</b> This <b>information</b> <b>directory</b> manages <b>information</b> around artifacts and keeps track of existing contributions to artifacts. Our prototype of such an <b>information</b> <b>directory,</b> named Collaborilla, is designed to be a flexible service, which can be updated by anyone in a wiki-style manner. With this approach, viewing a collaboratively constructed artifact gives each viewer the control of including or excluding various contributions. Moreover, each viewer can easily choose to participate and provide a new contribution to the artifact without the other authors being aware of this. If information about this new contribution is published in the Collaborilla directory, the contribution will also be seen by others. 1...|$|R
