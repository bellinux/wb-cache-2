5000|$|The Report on the Covert Activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (The Doolittle Report) is a 69-page {{formerly}} classified {{comprehensive study}} on the personnel, security, adequacy, and efficacy of the Central Intelligence Agency written by Lieutenant General James H. Doolittle. United States President Dwight Eisenhower requested the report in July 1954 {{at the height of}} the Cold War and following coups in Iran and Guatemala. The report compares with other contemporary Cold War documents such as George Kennan's [...] "X" [...] article in Foreign Affairs, which recommended a policy of [...] "containment" [...] rather than direct confrontation with the Soviet Union, and NSC-68, the secret policy document produced in 1950, which recommended a similarly restrained policy of “gradual coercion.” Doolittle wrote with an abandon-all-principles approach that conveyed the national fear that the United States faced the prospect of annihilation at the hands of the Soviet Union:“It is now clear that we are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever means and at whatever cost,” Doolittle wrote. “There are no rules in such a game… <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> to survive, long standing concepts of ‘fair play’ must be reconsidered.” Doolittle’s forceful policy and language reflected the fear that motivated American citizens and policymakers in the wake of Soviet communism.|$|E

40|$|The United States of America {{is for all}} {{practical}} purposes, an empire. It has territories separated by bodies of water that are under its control, has the world's largest economy, {{and it has the}} ability to project its force with a large and powerful military. Like other empires, the U. S. is prone to follow the historical model of an imperial rise to power and a later fall from power. I hypothesize that the United States {{is on the verge of}} a fall from preeminence. By comparing the United States with the Roman and British Empires, I intend to research the economic causes behind the collapse of these two empires and see <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> in a comparable situation. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> falling from power, then it has two options, accept its fate, or like the Romans and British, change course and try to continue to hold onto power as long as possible. The United States can learn something by studying the successes and mistakes made by previous world powers. By studying older world powers, this thesis will attempt to compare current problems the U. S. faces to those problems that Rome and Great Britain faced in their respective eras. This thesis will use these two historical case studies to find solutions to some of the problems that the U. S. faces today, and make a case for how new fiscal policy as a part of a larger National Strategic Narrative might change the fate of the empire of the United States of America.

40|$|Abstract. Because {{risks are}} {{on all sides}} of social situations, it is not {{possible}} to be “precautionary ” in general. The availability heuristic ensures that some risks stand out as particularly salient, whatever their actual magnitude. Taken together with intuitive costbenefit balancing, the availability heuristic helps to explain differences across groups, cultures, and even nations in the assessment of precautions to reduce the risks associated with climate change. There are complex links among availability, social processes for the spreading of information, and predispositions. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> to take a stronger stand against climate change, it is likely to be a result of available incidents that seem to show that climate change produces serious and tangible harm. 1...|$|E

40|$|This speech {{addressed}} the issue of educating minorities in the mathematical sciences. The speech is based on six regional workshops, and the national convocation of the Mathematical Sciences Foundation Board (MSEB).

This is followed by a challenge and a vision. The challenge is for America to not rely on drawing mathematicians from outside the country, but to develop the necessary human resources from within the country, especially from within the minority groups.
