40|$|The {{success of}} future systems for {{computer}} assisted {{foreign language learning}} relies on providing the learner personalized diagnosis and relevant corrections of its pronunciations. After a presentation {{of the problem of}} reliable automatic prosodic feedbacks in language learning, we present our work related to the processing of some errors stemming from the learner and from the system itself. The first part deals with the relevant rejection of incorrect entries (for example due to learner’s errors) while being tolerant to non-native speech deviations. The second part focuses on the automatic phonetic segmentation of nonnative speech. A detailed analysis has showed the benefit of taking into account non-native variants, and lead to determining the classes of phonemes whose temporal boundaries are the most accurate and which should be favored in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercises</b> for language learning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{deals with}} the grammar {{sections}} in one older and one newer textbook series for Swedish in grades 7 – 9. The questions for the study are: firstly, {{the scope of the}} teaching materials, the content and the number of exercises, and secondly if the content presentation can be classified as deductive or inductive, and if the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercises</b> is mainly product or process-oriented. Furthermore the relationship between the goals of the national curriculum and progression in grades 7 – 9 is investigated. The method chosen for this study is a text analysis. The results show that both textbook series contain similar content for word classes, that the material presentation is predominantly deductive and that most exercises are product-oriented. Differences that can be seen are that the older teaching series contain more pages devoted to word classes and parts of speech and more exercises. Furthermore, the older textbooks series show a clearer progression to the curriculum goals. The conclusions are that the two teaching materials have difficulties to deviate from the focus on grammatical terminology, but also to link grammar to students' own writing...|$|E

An overlooked aspect of abdominal exercises is the compression the abdomen, leading to increased diaphragmatic work. We hypothesized that core exercises would produce a variety of transdiaphragmatic pressures. We also sought to determine {{if some of the}} easy exercises would produce pressures sufficient for a training stimulus to the diaphragm. We evaluated the effect of 13 different abdominal exercises, ranging in difficulty, on transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), an index of diaphragmatic activity. Six healthy subjects, aged 22 to 53, participated. Each subject was instrumented with two balloon-tipped catheters to obtain gastric and esophageal pressures, from which Pdi was calculated. Prior to initiating the exercises, each subject performed a maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) maneuver. Resting Pdi was also measured. The exercises were performed from least to most difficult, with five repetitions each. There was {{a significant difference between the}} exercises and the MIP Pdi, as well as between the exercises and resting Pdi (p 50 % of the Pdi during the MIP maneuver, which may provide a training stimulus to the diaphragm if used as a regular exercise.

40|$|This work aims at {{providing}} {{a tool for}} supporting cognitive rehabilitation. This is a wide field, that includes a variety of diseases and related clinical pictures; for this reason the need arises to have a tool available that overcomes the difficulties entailed by what currently {{is the most common}} approach, that is, the so-called pen and paper rehabilitation. Methods: We first organized a big number of stimuli in an ontology that represents concepts, attributes and a set of relationships among concepts. Stimuli may be words, sounds, 2 D and 3 D images. Then, we developed an engine that automatically generates exercises by exploiting that ontology. The <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercises</b> has been carried on in synergy with neuropsychologists and speech therapists. Solutions have been devised aimed at personalizing the exercises according to both patients’ preferences and performance. Results: Exercises addressed to rehabilitation of executive functions and aphasia-related diseases have been implemented. The system has been tested on both healthy volunteers (n 1 / 4 38) and patients (n 1 / 4 9), obtaining a favourable rating and suggestions for improvements. Conclusions: We created a tool able to automate the execution of cognitive rehabilitation tasks. We hope the variety and personalization of exercises will allow to increase compliance, particularly from elderly people, usually neither familiar with technology nor particularly willing to rely on it. The next step involves the creation of a telerehabilitation tool, to allow therapy sessions to be undergone from home, thus guaranteeing continuity of care and advantages in terms of time and costs for the patients and the National Healthcare System (NHS).

40|$|This thesis has {{researched}} and designed a programme that offers an alternative {{way of working}} with aggression in a male prison population, using an art therapy approach that incorporates Buddhist concepts as an intervention. Buddhist practices have traditionally been used in Eastern cultures to calm the mind and to develop compassion {{as an antidote to}} aggression. Therefore these practices have seen used as a basis for the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercises</b> in the programme. The purpose of the programme is to offer an intervention that will complement, support, or be an alternative to existing treatments, which are primarily cognitive-behavioural in orientation. The research method for designing the programme was qualitative, based on an action research model. This paradigm has an approach of co-operative and participatory inquiry which has its roots in humanistic psychology; therefore, working in such a tradition was appropriate {{to the nature of the}} research undertaken in that it gave a humanistic and holistic character to the method. The male prison population was chosen as the focus for the proposed programme because it is a convenient sample, clearly identifiable as a group which is likely to have a problem with aggressive behaviour. If art therapy can be successfully applied with such a group, then it may have relevance to other groups exhibiting less aggressive forms of behaviour. Another potentially positive outcome of this treatment intervention is the benefit that it may have on staff, family, and others who are in contact with this population. In other words, a reduction in the stress levels of aggressive prisoners would hopefully have a more general therapeutic effect upon the quality of all the interpersonal relationships within the larger prison community. The benefit of this research to the field of art therapy is that it has explored the potential of such an intervention being used as a therapeutic strategy in dealing with aggression. The study 2 ̆ 7 s findings indicate that Buddhist concepts can be successfully incorporated into the design of an art therapy programme. It is hoped that this programme could be used with any population manifesting aggressive behaviours, either covertly or overtly. The results of this study could potentially benefit a range of client populations where an alternative to aggressive or violent behaviour is sought, and it is suggested that future research could be conducted by implementing the programme with diverse groups...|$|E
40|$|Några av de ändringar som gjordes 2011 i läroplanen för gymnasieskolan var att vektorer lades in i det centrala innehållet för ämnesplanen Matematik 1 c. Denna studie behandlar utformandet av uppgifter som testar elevers förståelse för vektorbegreppet där urvalet omfattar gymnasieelever som har läst eller läste kursen Matematik 1 c inom perioden för uppsatsen. Metoden som användes var semistrukturerade intervjuer där uppgifterna agerade frågor och eleven fick svara på följdfrågor så att tankebanor, funderingar och hinder skulle kunna observeras. Svaren som eleverna har gett på de uppgifterna har skapat ett brett spektrum av olika svar, en svarsrymd. Denna svarsrymd har sedermera blivit svarsalternativen till det slutliga test som studien har arbetat fram. Testet har således beprövade uppgifter som är skapade med en rad olika områ-den som utgångspunkter. Utgångspunkterna, tillika inspirationen och stödet i uppgiftsskapande, har varit gymnasieskolans läroplan, ämnesplanen för matematik 1 c samt forskning kring möjligheter och hinder i förståelsen för vektorbegreppet. I utformandet såväl som under insamlandet av data har revideringar gjorts och vi har uppmärksammat de hinder och tankar som eleverna haft, som också då finns att tillgå. Some of {{the changes}} made in 2011 in the {{curriculum}} of secondary schools was that vectors {{were added to the}} central content to the plan of the subject Mathematics 1 c. This study deals with the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercises</b> that test students' understanding of the vector concept, where the selection in the study includes high school students who have read or are reading the course Mathematics 1 c within the period of the thesis. The method used was semi-structured interviews where exercises acted as questions and the student had to answer attendant questions, this to observe the students' thoughts, speculations and hindrances. The responses that students gave to the exercises created a wide range of different answers, a space of different responses. This space of different responses became available choices to the exercises in the final test, that the study have brought forth. The test has thus created well-tried exercises that were created with a variety of starting points. The starting points in the task of creating the exercises took inspiration and support from the high school curriculum as well as the plan of the subject Mathematics 1 c alongside research about opportunities and hindrances in the understanding of the vector concept.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Appendix J has been removed for copyright reasons. Dementia incidence is rising as our population is ageing. There is growing evidence for the protective effect of physical activity against cognitive decline. However, there are inconsistent results across studies despite {{the large number of}} high quality trials. The role of psychosocial factors on cognitive outcomes was investigated in the present thesis due to the evidence of their relationship with physical activity and for their effect on cognitive ability in other contexts. The psychosocial factors investigated were attitudes towards ageing, perceived control, mental health, and self-efficacy using cross-sectional studies and pilot randomised controlled exercise trials to test proof of concept. Study 1 a found that more positive attitudes towards ageing were associated with better self-reported subjective and functional health. Perceived control mediated the effect of attitudes related to psychosocial loss with ageing and physical activity level mediated the effect of attitudes related to psychological growth with ageing on subjective health. Attitudes towards ageing mediated the effect of perceived control on functional health. Study 1 b and 1 c explored attitudes towards ageing in more detail and found that older adults attitudes towards ageing were similarly negative to those held by young adults in the UK. A substantial proportion of attitudes reported by older adults related to physical functioning and cognitive ability. Attitudes towards ageing in China were more positive than those in the UK which suggested a potential relationship with socio-cultural and environmental factors and possible scope for attitude change from an intervention. A higher proportion of attitudes towards ageing reported in the UK were related to physical functioning and cognitive ability compared to China. These findings highlighted the potential for attitudes towards ageing and perceived control {{to play a role in}} the context of physical activity, cognitive ability and subjective health. Study 2 a found that physical, social, and mental activities were independently associated with cognitive ability which informed the study <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercises</b> to include a pseudo control group that controlled for social interaction and mental stimulation. Study 2 b found that mental health partially mediated the association between walking and cognitive ability. In older adults with better mental health, walking was not associated with cognitive ability. In older adults with poorer mental health walking was associated with better cognitive ability. Study 3 utilised available data from a pilot resistance training randomised controlled trial with middle-aged adults to test proof of concept for the role of psychosocial factors in this context. Preliminary evidence was provided for a potential association between improvements on some psychosocial factors and cognitive performance improvements. The associations of cognitive gains with psychosocial factors were independent to those of physical fitness improvements, which may indicate a potentially additive effect. Study 4 assessed the feasibility of the pilot randomised controlled trial of resistance training with older adults. Recruitment was successful but high drop-out rates lead to between group differences in age and baseline cognitive ability. Adaption of exercise to suit individual capabilities increased participation and adherence of those who completed the programmes was high. The limited usefulness of analysis by group was highlighted due to the large variation in response to exercise within groups on psychosocial and cognitive measures. Older participants were more likely to report a negative effect of resistance training on psychosocial measures, which indicated a potential confound on outcomes of exercise interventions with older adult populations. Preliminary analysis indicated that improvements on some psychosocial factors were associated with domain specific cognitive gains. This association could be due to a variety of mechanisms, such as meta-cognitive motivational processes, for example sustained effort and attention and the use of memory strategies. However, these findings need to be interpreted with caution due to the parallel change of variables, small sample size and feasibility and pilot nature of the interventions. There is a potential implication for the design of exercise programmes if they facilitate improvements in psychosocial factors as well as physical fitness, then this could enhance the effect of exercise on cognitive outcomes. Future research should replicate these studies with larger sample sizes to further understand the role of psychosocial factors in cognitive gains during exercise interventions in older adults...|$|E

However, the potential for physical activity to influence recovery may be age-dependent. This paper describes physical activity levels and HRQoL among younger and older women after surgery for breast cancer and explores the correlates of physical inactivity. Methods: A population-based sample of breast cancer patients diagnosed in South-East Queensland, Australia, (n= 287) were assessed once every three months, from 6 to 18 months post-surgery. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast questionnaire (FACTB+ 4) and items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire were used to measure HRQoL and physical activity, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—The first {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce a nonlinear system to model the heart rate (HR) response during and after treadmill walking exercise. The model is a feedback interconnected system which has components to describe the central and peripheral local responses to exercise, and their interactions. The parameters of the model were experimentally identified from subjects walking on treadmill at different speeds. The stability of the obtained nonlinear model was mathematically proven. The modelling results demonstrate that the proposed model can be useful in examining the cardiovascular response to exercise. Based on the nonlinear model, the second objective is to present a computer-controlled treadmill system for the regulation of HR during treadmill exercise. The proposed nonlinear con-troller consists of a feedforward and a feedback components. The designed control system was experimentally verified and the results demonstrated that the proposed computer-controlled treadmill system regulated the HR of the experimental subjects according to two different exercising HR profiles, indicating that it can play an important role in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>exercise</b> protocols for individuals.
