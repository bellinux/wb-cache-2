His first test at the international stage was during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. Canada finished sixth in the tournament while Anderson scored four points in six games. Later on, Anderson credited the practice he received {{in preparation for the}} Olympics as a <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> future success in the NHL.|$|E

Findlemeyer the second, has taken a vacation to Miami. Findlemeyer has taken the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> safe with him, which prevents filming from commencing because the safe contains the film scripts. Seymour must blow the safe with dynamite to access the scripts and then collect 16 Academy Awards from around the game and award one {{to each of the}} actors. Only then can filming commence.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{compete to}} become VP under Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) by seducing her after {{work at the}} hotel bar. For most of the night, Packer {{seems to be the}} most successful, so Dwight has Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) spike Packer's beer with his asthma inhaler, which causes Packer to vomit and leaves Dwight alone with Nellie. Dwight {{eventually}} succeeds in seducing Nellie as she asks for a <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> room. Dwight scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to Nellie, stating the seduction was only to gain approval and that he does not intend to have sex with her.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman {{states that the}} <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> satyagraha {{is rooted in the}} Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E
5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E

The premise of the plot focuses on two businessmen who are friends Will (or Bill in some publications) and John. Will gives John the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> apartment so he had stay there while Will goes on vacation. The landlady of the house leases the apartment to two ladies. John decides to go to Will's apartment and lets himself in with the key and finds the two girls asleep. They awake and take him for a burglar and threaten to kill him and John pleads for mercy instead of addressing the misunderstanding. John is later revealed to be her employer after he is caught opening a safe in the office the next morning. The film was released on August 26, 1910 and was met with positive reviews by the trade publications. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} {{described}} by Peck were distinguished {{on the basis}} of physical features that were later found to be somewhat overlapping. In terms of microscopic characters, spore sizes were not sufficiently different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters. Subsequent investigators of North American mushroom flora had difficulties in interpreting Peck's concepts of these three taxa and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations. For example, McIlvaine (1902), Hard (1908), and McDougall (1925) reported (as variety or species) only C.ebulbosus. Bisby (1938), Christensen (1946), Smith (1958), and Groves (1962) mentioned only C.quadrifidus. Both Kauffman (1918) and Graham (1944) described C.ebulbosus and C.quadrifidus; Graham, however, only included C.quadrifidus in his <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> descriptions of Coprinus species. In 1979, W.Patrick published a comparative analysis of the three taxa from material collected by Peck, and, after concluding that the three were not sufficiently distinct to be considered separate species, reduced them to synonymy with Coprinopsis variegata, the earliest name.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his reign}} Otto {{was unable to}} resolve Greece's poverty and prevent {{economic}} meddling from outside. Greek politics in this era was based on affiliations with the three Great Powers, and Otto's ability to maintain {{the support of the}} powers was <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> remaining in power. To remain strong, Otto had to play the interests of each of the Great Powers' Greek adherents against the others, while not aggravating the Great Powers. When Greece was blockaded by the British Royal Navy in 1850 and again in 1854, to stop Greece from attacking the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War, Otto's standing amongst Greeks suffered. As a result, there was an assassination attempt on the Queen, and finally in 1862 Otto was deposed while in the countryside. He died in exile in Bavaria in 1867.|$|E

He holds the track record at Bristol International Speedway, for wins with 12 victories, and for pole positions at Martinsville Speedway, with 8 pole position awards. His short-track success would continue into the 1980s, and was <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> winning 3 NASCAR championships.|$|E

25|$|His playing {{style is}} that of the {{creative}} playmaker - picking out passes to his full forwards, as well as taking his own scores, usually at vital junctures of a game. The main <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> play that sets him apart from his contemporaries is his ability to control the pace, and direction of a match, through leading by example. Peter Canavan, whose influence since his retirement has been missed, has expressed he feels McGuigan's leadership is the key to any Tyrone success, and have struggled to take control of matches in his long absence.|$|E
25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as {{he did not want}} anybody to think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Paley's {{recognition}} {{of how to}} harness the potential reach of broadcasting was the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> growing CBS from a tiny chain of stations into what was eventually one of the world's dominant communication empires. During his prime, Paley was described as having an uncanny sense for popular taste and exploiting that insight to build the CBS network. As war clouds darkened over Europe in the late 1930s, Paley recognized Americans' desire for {{news coverage of the}} coming war and built the CBS news division into a dominant force just as he had previously built the network's entertainment division.|$|E

25|$|Records {{state that}} Beuys was conscious, {{recovered}} by a German search commando, {{and there were}} no Tatars in the village at that time. Beuys was brought to a military hospital where he stayed for three weeks from 17 March to 7 April. It is not inconsistent with Beuys' work that his biography would have been subject to his own reinterpretation; this particular story has served as a powerful myth of origins for Beuys's artistic identity, as well as providing an initial interpretive <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> use of unconventional materials, amongst which felt and fat were central.|$|E
25|$|Moi won {{elections}} in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by political violence on both sides. Moi skilfully exploited Kenya's mix of ethnic tensions in these contests, especially smaller tribes' ever-present fear of domination {{by the larger}} tribes. In {{the absence of an}} effective and organised opposition, Moi had no difficulty in winning. Although it is also suspected that electoral fraud may have occurred, the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> victory in both elections was a divided opposition. He always won the election with a minority vote of about 30% against the opposition who had a combined 70%, which was nonetheless of no consequence because it was subdivided among the opposition who had failed to unite.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, PayPal {{introduced}} an optional security key {{as an additional}} precaution against fraud. A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process. The account holder enters his or her login ID and password as normal, but is then prompted to enter a six-digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder's mobile phone. For convenience, the user may append the code generated by the hardware <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> or her password in the login screen.
