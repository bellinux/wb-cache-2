50|$|Because {{the level}} is {{typically}} {{held at the}} surveyor's eye-height, {{it is common to}} use the face of a second surveyor of similar height as a target. If the second surveyor is not the same height, the approximate location of eye-height must be noted (i.e. chin, nose, top of <b>head).</b> <b>Mounting</b> a face-sized target at eye-height on a level staff may be more accurate. Because most Abney levels do not contain a telescope, direct reading from a level staff is only possible at short range, although it is possible to make special staffs that can be read at a distance without magnification.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem with}} the {{cylinder}} heads was the arrangement of cylinder head fixing studs, half of which were vertical {{and the other half}} at an angle. The angled studs when heated and cooled, expanded and contracted at a different rate to the alloy heads, causing sideways forces which caused premature failure of the cylinder head gaskets. Anecdotally this arrangement was to reduce production costs as the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>mounting</b> studs and bolt were all accessible with the rocker covers fitted. This allowed the factory to completely assemble the cylinder head assembly before fitting to the engine. However this was not possible in the end due to the cam chain fitting and setting of the cam timing requiring the removal of the rocker covers.|$|E

50|$|Spring tension {{from the}} <b>head</b> <b>mounting</b> {{constantly}} pushes the heads towards the platter. While the disk is spinning, the heads {{are supported by}} an air bearing and experience no physical contact or wear. In CSS drives the sliders carrying the head sensors (often also just called heads) are designed to survive a number of landings and takeoffs from the media surface, though {{wear and tear on}} these microscopic components eventually takes its toll. Most manufacturers design the sliders to survive 50,000 contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above 50%. However, the decay rate is not linear: when a disk is younger and has had fewer start-stop cycles, it has a better chance of surviving the next startup than an older, higher-mileage disk (as the head literally drags along the disk's surface until the air bearing is established). For example, the Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 series of desktop hard disk drives are rated to 50,000 start - stop cycles, in other words no failures attributed to the head - platter interface were seen before at least 50,000 start - stop cycles during testing.|$|E

40|$|High speed {{testing of}} a brake system using two {{different}} callipers and two different discs {{on a special}} test rig with a swinging calliper <b>head</b> <b>mounting</b> shows similar results with regard to hot judder. Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder – the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the calliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the calliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A “strobing” effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes “just off” the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc centre. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface. Other observations include hot spotting on the disc surface and a surface scan of the disc face indicates a depression at these positions. A metallurgical analysis of the blue spot is currently being carried out to determine if a material phase change has occurred within the disc body and this will be included in the paper. The introduction of a pressure fluctuation absorber shows an improvement in the pressure amplitude and subsequent vibration signal and the possible development of this system is discusse...|$|E
