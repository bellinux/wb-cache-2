5|$|<b>Devolution</b> {{continued}} {{to be part of}} the platform of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish <b>devolution</b> referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Labour's 1997 election victory, referendums {{were held in}} Scotland and Wales regarding <b>devolution.</b> There was a clear majority supporting <b>devolution</b> in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales; Scotland received a stronger degree of <b>devolution</b> than Wales. The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, the first elections for these were held in 1999. Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering {{the creation of a}} regional parliament and government. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was made, which allowed for a 108-member elected assembly and a power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists. Blair was personally involved in these negotiations.|$|E
5|$|After <b>devolution</b> {{began to}} take place {{in other parts of the}} United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected {{regional}} assemblies as a counterweight. London accepted in 1998: the London Assembly was created two years later. However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England <b>devolution</b> referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled. The regional assemblies outside London were abolished in 2010, and their functions transferred to respective Regional Development Agencies and a new system of Local authority leaders' boards.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Elis-Thomas {{announced}} that the Pierhead Building would display {{the history of the}} black community in Butetown, Cardiff Docks and Welsh <b>devolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} Argo and the Trojan War, {{there was a}} {{generation}} known chiefly for its horrific crimes. This includes the doings of Atreus and Thyestes at Argos. Behind {{the myth of the}} house of Atreus (one of the two principal heroic dynasties with the house of Labdacus) lies the problem of the <b>devolution</b> of power and of the mode of accession to sovereignty. The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the <b>devolution</b> of power in Mycenae.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>devolution</b> in 1999, {{the newly}} devolved governments in Scotland and Wales brought {{in their own}} acts on tuition fees. The Scottish Parliament established, and later {{abolished}} a graduate endowment to replace the fees. Wales introduced maintenance grants of up to £1,500 in 2002, a value which has since risen to over £5000.|$|E
5|$|In Opposition, Thatcher {{wanted to}} prevent the {{creation}} of a Scottish assembly. She instructed Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was successfully defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on <b>devolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since <b>devolution,</b> {{in which}} other {{countries}} of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal's rejection by the North East in a referendum, {{this has not been}} carried out.|$|E
5|$|The Local Governments of Japan (地方公共団体) are unitary, {{in which}} local jurisdictions largely {{depend on the}} {{national}} government both administratively and financially. They are established {{as an act of}} <b>devolution.</b> Under the Constitution, all matters pertaining to the local self-government is allowed to be determined for by law; more specifically, the Local Autonomy Law.|$|E
5|$|The MTV Video Music Brazil, {{commonly}} known as VMB, was MTV Brazil's annual award ceremony, established in 1995. In 2013, due to the <b>devolution</b> of the brand MTV to Viacom, and with the reformulation of the channel, the ceremony was discontinued. Gaga has received three nominations and won one of them.|$|E
5|$|The Orkney Movement, a {{political}} party that supported <b>devolution</b> for Orkney {{from the rest of}} Scotland, contested the 1987 general election as the Orkney and Shetland Movement (a coalition of the Orkney movement and its equivalent for Shetland). Their candidate, John Goodlad, came 4th with 3,095 votes, 14.5% of those cast, but the experiment has not been repeated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} not contesting the election because {{the area was}} a Conservative stronghold, the Liberals decided {{to do so in}} order to generate a discussion on the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Allsopp was in agreement with the Conservative policy, which was to maintain full governmental control over Ireland, and pass further Coercion Acts to reduce lawlessness in that country. Sanders, who had lost two previous elections for the Liberal Party, was in favour of <b>devolution</b> of powers to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Campaigns for {{regional}} autonomy for the North have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies {{for the three}} Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England <b>devolution</b> referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the parish and town council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government {{with the power to}} make laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.|$|E
5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western European nations to defense of Crete. The Ottomans were {{planning}} to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the Island at Candia. He intervened in the War of <b>Devolution</b> and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect {{the outcome of the}} Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.|$|E
5|$|Faisalabad was {{restructured}} into city district status; a <b>devolution</b> {{promulgated by}} the 2001 local government ordinance (LGO). It {{is governed by}} the city district's seven departments: Agriculture, Community Development, Education, Finance and Planning, Health, Municipal Services, and Works and Services. The district coordination officer of Faisalabad (DCO) {{is head of the}} city district government and responsible for co-ordinating and supervising the administrative units. Each of the seven departments has its own Executive District Officer who is charged with co-ordinating and overseeing the activities of their respective departments.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 {{the castle}} {{was given to}} the State by Sir Michael Duff. It is now {{maintained}} by Cadw and is protected as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument. In the light of Welsh <b>devolution</b> and other political changes, the history of Dolbadarn Castle and similar Welsh castles has become increasing prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|E
5|$|It {{shares a}} similar right-wing policy {{platform}} with UKIP, with Nattrass stating as such amid the party's launch. Key policies include withdrawing the UK from the European Union (EU), prioritising {{relations with the}} Commonwealth of Nations and introducing more stringent measures on immigration. It further supports widespread use of referenda, promoting English <b>devolution</b> and abolishing the National Assembly for Wales. Nattrass places his party {{to the left of}} UKIP, however, due to both the party's general opposition to privatisation and its proposed nationalisation of targeted infrastructure and amenities.|$|E
5|$|Manchester's civic {{leadership}} {{has a reputation}} for business acumen. It owns two of the country's four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal <b>devolution</b> has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} transport executive (PTE) {{has become a}} major player in the organisation of public transport within Northern city regions; of the six PTEs in England, five (Transport for Greater Manchester, Merseytravel, Travel South Yorkshire, Nexus Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire Metro) are located in the North. These coordinate bus services, local trains and light rail in their regions. Following the passage of the Cities and Local Government <b>Devolution</b> Act 2016, Transport for the North is expected to become a statutory body in 2017, and will be given powers to coordinate services and offer integrated ticketing throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{status quo}} {{is no longer an}} option and there is an unquenchable desire for greater <b>devolution.</b> Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come. It is with this uppermost in mind that today we launch The National, a daily newspaper that will fly a vibrant flag for independence and the right for Scots to govern themselves.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, {{demand for}} a Scottish Parliament grew, {{in part because the}} {{government}} of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a pressure group, leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for <b>devolution</b> in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|After many years, {{the site}} was finally cleared of {{undergrowth}} in the 1850s, revealing more of the castle's remains, and William Wynne, {{the owner of the}} site, carried out the first archaeological investigations. In 1949 Charles Corbett, the last private owner of the ruins, placed them into the guardianship of the state. In the 21st century the site is in the care of Cadw and is protected as a scheduled monument and maintained as a tourist attraction. In the light of Welsh <b>devolution</b> and other political changes, the history of Castell y Bere and similar Welsh castles has become increasingly prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the <b>devolution</b> of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the <b>devolution</b> of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009 the SNP {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat. After the 2011 elections gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, a referendum on independence for Scotland was held on 18 September 2014. The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%. During the campaign, the three main parties in the UK Parliament pledged to extend {{the powers of the}} Scottish Parliament. An all-party commission chaired by Lord Smith of Kelvin was formed, which led to a further <b>devolution</b> of powers through the Scotland Act 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} the Labour Party usually won most Scottish {{parliamentary}} seats, losing this dominance briefly to the Unionists in the 1950s. Support in Scotland {{was critical to}} Labour's overall electoral fortunes as without Scottish MPs it would have gained only three UK electoral victories in the 20th century (1945, 1966 and 1997). The number of Scottish seats represented by Unionists (known as Conservatives from 1965 onwards) went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997. The Scottish National Party gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974. However, a referendum on <b>devolution</b> in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40 per cent of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal) and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s. The introduction in 1989 by the Thatcher-led Conservative government of the Community Charge (widely known as the Poll Tax), one year {{before the rest of}} the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct Scottish control over domestic affairs. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of Battle of Stirling Bridge, the Blair-led Labour government again held a referendum on the issue of <b>devolution.</b> A positive outcome led to the establishment of a devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999. The new Scottish Parliament Building, adjacent to Holyrood House in Edinburgh, opened in 2004. Although not reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the Scottish Parliamentary elections with their system of mixed member proportional representation. It became the official opposition in 1999, a minority government in 2007, a majority government from 2011 and a second minority government in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Miliband campaigned in the Scottish {{independence}} referendum {{with the}} cross-party Better Together campaign, supporting Scotland's {{membership of the}} United Kingdom. Opinion polls showed solid leads for the 'no' campaign, with a 20 point-lead on 19 August. However, {{by the end of}} the month, the lead has fallen to just 6 points, with YouGov analysis showing a big shift in support among Labour supporters. Miliband made an unplanned visit to Lanarkshire to draw a contrast between a Labour and Conservative future for Scotland within the UK. A poll on 7 September showed a 2-point lead for the 'yes' campaign, leading to a joint commitment by Miliband, Cameron and Clegg for greater <b>devolution</b> to Scotland through a version of home rule. The results on 19 September showed victory for the 'no' campaign, 55.3% to 44.7%.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20th century {{there has}} been {{significant}} population movement to England, mostly {{from other parts of}} the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent. Since the 1970s {{there has been}} a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called the European Economic Community which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. <b>Devolution</b> has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After <b>devolution,</b> in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of <b>devolution,</b> was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E
5|$|The monarch has {{a similar}} {{relationship}} with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Sovereign appoints the First Minister of Scotland on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales. In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts {{on the advice of}} the Scottish Government. However, as <b>devolution</b> is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The Sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} intense media debate and {{discussion}} throughout 2014 and 2015 about possible 'Combined Authorities' within the West Midlands region, especially following the Scottish Independence Referendum 2014, the 'Greater Manchester Agreement' on <b>devolution</b> and the 2015 General Election. Five local authorities within the West Midlands County initially agreed {{to start the}} process to form a combined authority, however the official announcement in June 2015 encompassed all seven metropolitan councils. The new body {{became known as the}} West Midlands Combined Authority and was formally established on 17 June 2016. Sir Albert Bore, Birmingham City Council's leader said that he envisioned a combined authority stretching from Wolverhampton to Coventry and beyond, and from East Staffordshire to Redditch would form the core of a Midlands powerhouse to compete with city regions around the world.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was elected}} to Parliament on his second attempt as a Labour MP for Dunfermline East in 1983 general election. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency, Tony Blair. Brown became an {{opposition}} spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a biography of the Independent Labour Party politician James Maxton, {{the subject of his}} doctoral thesis. Brown was Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992. Having led the Labour Movement Yes campaign, refusing to join the cross-party Yes for Scotland campaign, during the 1979 Scottish <b>devolution</b> referendum, while other senior Labour politicians – including Robin Cook, Tam Dalyell and Brian Wilson – campaigned for a No vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, signing the Claim of Right for Scotland in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 <b>devolution</b> referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>devolution</b> in 1999, Scotland has devolved {{stronger}} working relations {{across the}} two other devolved governments, the Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive. Whilst there are no formal concordats between the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, ministers from each devolved government meet at various points throughout the year at various {{events such as the}} British-Irish Council and also meet to discuss matters and issues that is devolved to each government. Scotland, along with the Welsh Government, British Government as well as the Northern Ireland executive, participate in the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) which allows each government to discuss policy issues together and work together across each government to find solutions. The Scottish Government considers the successful re-establishment of the Plenary, and establishment of the Domestic fora to be important facets of the relationship with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations.|$|E
5|$|Manchester Airport {{serves as}} the main {{international}} hub for Northern England and is the busiest airport anywhere in the UK outside London, handling 25.6 million people in 2016. In total, there are seven international airports in the North; these are (in descending order of passenger traffic) Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Sheffield, Humberside and Durham Tees Valley. Many of these airports were developed during the boom in low-cost air travel during the early 2000s, but have suffered since the Great Recession – Durham Tees Valley is running at just 3% of its maximum capacity, and Blackpool Airport closed as an international airport in 2014. The <b>devolution</b> of Air Passenger Duty to Scotland represents a further possible threat to Northern English airports, allowing Scottish airports to offer cheaper flights than their English rivals. Few spoke flights operate between Northern airports and the national hubs at Heathrow and Gatwick, putting further strain on the smaller Northern airports and forcing connecting passengers to travel via continental European airports. The planned High Speed 2 station at Manchester Airport will offer direct high-speed services to London, allowing spare capacity at Manchester Airport {{to take some of}} the flights which currently serve busy London airports.|$|E
5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the <b>devolution</b> of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial background, or were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E
25|$|In Wales, the Conservatives campaigned against <b>devolution</b> in the 1997 referendum, however {{likewise}} as with Scotland, {{they have}} vowed to maintain the Welsh Assembly's continued existence, and in 2011 supported the further <b>devolution</b> of power.|$|E
