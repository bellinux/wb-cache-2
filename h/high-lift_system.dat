40|$|A prior trade study {{established}} {{the effectiveness of}} using Active Flow Control (AFC) for reducing the mechanical complexities associated with a modern <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> without sacrificing aerodynamic performance at low-speed flight conditions representative of takeoff and landing. The current technical report expands on this prior work in two ways: (1) a refined conventional <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> based on the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) is presented that is more representative of modern commercial transport aircraft in terms of stall characteristics and maximum Lift/Drag (L/D) ratios at takeoff and landing-approach flight conditions; and (2) the design trade space for AFC-enabled high-lift systems is expanded to explore {{a wider range of}} options for improving their efficiency. The refined conventional high-lift CRM (HL-CRM) concept features leading edge slats and slotted trailing edge flaps with Fowler motion. For the current AFC-enhanced high lift system trade study, the refined conventional <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> is simplified by substituting simply-hinged trailing edge flaps for the slotted single-element flaps with Fowler motion. The high-lift performance of these two high-lift CRM variants is established using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions to the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. These CFD assessments identify the high-lift performance that needs to be recovered through AFC to have the CRM variant with the lighter and mechanically simpler <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> match the performance of the conventional <b>high-lift</b> <b>system.</b> In parallel to the conventional high-lift concept development, parametric studies using CFD guided the development of an effective and efficient AFC-enabled simplified <b>high-lift</b> <b>system.</b> This included parametric trailing edge flap geometry studies addressing the effects of flap chord length and flap deflection. As for the AFC implementation, scaling effects (i. e., wind-tunnel versus full-scale flight conditions) are addressed, as are AFC architecture aspects such as AFC unit placement, number AFC units, operating pressures, mass flow rates, and steady versus unsteady AFC applications. These efforts {{led to the development of}} a novel traversing AFC actuation concept which is efficient in that it reduces the AFC mass flow requirements by as much as an order of magnitude compared to previous AFC technologies, and it is predicted to be effective in driving the aerodynamic performance of a mechanical simplified <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> close to that of the reference conventional <b>high-lift</b> <b>system.</b> Conceptual system integration studies were conducted for the AFC-enhanced high-lift concept applied to a NASA Environmentally Responsible Aircraft (ERA) reference configuration, the so-called ERA- 0003 concept. The results from these design integration assessments identify overall system performance improvement opportunities over conventional high-lift systems that suggest the viability of further technology maturation efforts for AFC-enabled high lift flap systems. To that end, technical challenges are identified associated with the application of AFC-enabled high-lift systems to modern transonic commercial transports for future technology maturation efforts...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{captures the}} {{three-dimensional}} implementation of noise-reducing high-liftsystems. A parametric CAD model is {{developed for the}} FNG aircraft and different high-lift configurationsare built up. In the course of research, these configurations are designed based onformerly obtained two-dimensional results of DLR’s LEISA project featuring {{the design of a}} verylong chord slat (VLCS), whose slat shape resulted in a favourable aeroacoustic behaviour at noiserelevantapproach conditions. The high-lift systems derived in this thesis differ in the spanwisevariation of the slat geometry planform {{as well as in the}} applied high-lift settings described bygap, overlap and deflection angle. The aerodynamic performance is computed via CFD RANS simulations and the results arecompared to a reference <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> of the FNG aircraft, which has been designed in previousstudies. The observed CFD results are further evaluated in the reference wing section of the FNGaircraft in order to display the agreement between the implemented 3 D high-lift configurationsand the 2 D LEISA reference data. Besides the aerodynamic performance, aeroacoustic aspects arealso considered in this diploma thesis. By means of the obtained CFD results, indirect statementsabout the success of the 3 D low-noise implementation approach are made. The geometrical concordance of the derived reference wing section of the 3 D CAD model isfound in general to be very high in comparison to the 2 D-optimized LEISA design wing section. With regard to the observed pressure distributions of the initial four designed high-lift systemshowever, small geometry deviations are noticed to affect the obtained pressure distributions in asignificantly unintended way. The requirements of a low-noise <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> are thus not metfor these high-lift configurations. In the 3 D implementation, the 2 D-optimized slat settings haveto be modified in order to maintain the favourable aeroacoustic behaviour of the 2 D considerations. Based on a reduced slat deflection angle, a further derived 3 D VLCS <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> isobtained to match the 2 D-optimized pressure distributions in the reference wing section more accurately. A significant pressure increase at the VLCS trailing edge is noticed for this configuration,which shows the noise-reducing potential of the derived VLCS device. However, the aerodynamicdegradations obtained for the designed low-noise <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> are found to be too high in orderto still provide improved aeroacoustic behaviour during conditions of increased approachspeed. A 3 D noise-reducing <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> is therefore not achieved, although the 2 D-optimizedLEISA pressure distributions are well captured in the reference wing section of the implemented 3 D <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> featuring modified high-lift setting parameters...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{aircraft design}} of the Collaborative Research Centre (SFB) 880 features a new active <b>high-lift</b> <b>system.</b> This <b>high-lift</b> <b>system</b> is comprised of a droop-nose leading edge device and a Coanda flap as the trailing edge device. It offers very high lift coefficients and thus the ability to operate at airports that have reduced runway lengths, such as regional airports. Consequently, the assessment of aircraft noise is of utmost importance. The overall system noise {{on the ground is}} predicted using a parametric aircraft noise prediction tool. Although a parametric noise source model for the Coanda flap does not exist, it is estimated with a conventional Fowler flap model to evaluate the qualitative noise reduction potentials. The new design is compared with a regular aircraft that is equipped with a conventional <b>high-lift</b> <b>system.</b> Both designs are tested on individually calculated continuous decent approaches. The results show that airframe noise of the new aircraft is decreased due to later flap deflection and reduced speed. The engine noise, however, is significantly increased, especially on the glide slope.
