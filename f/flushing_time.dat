The currents in the main channel associated with this circulation are typically 0.05 to 0.15 m/s, but immediately after a flood event they can be much larger.

5000|$|Calculations of {{tidal prism}} {{are useful in}} {{determining}} the residence time of water (and pollutants) in an estuary.If it is known how much water is exported compared to {{how much of the}} estuarine water remains, it can be determined how long pollutants reside in that estuary. If the tidal prism forms {{a large proportion of the}} water in an estuary at high tide, then when the tide ebbs, it will take with it the majority of the water (this occurs in shallow estuaries) and any pollutants or sediments suspended in that water. This means that the estuary has a good <b>flushing</b> <b>time,</b> or that the residence time of water in that estuary is low. [...] On the contrary, in deeper estuaries, the amount of water that is influenced by the tides forms a smaller proportion of the total water. The difference between high tide and low tide is not as great as in shallower estuaries creating a smaller tidal prism and a longer residence time.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{determination}} of <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> {{is crucial for}} maintaining sustainable production in fish culture zones (FCZs), as it represents the physical self-purification capability via tidal exchange with clean water in the outer sea. However, owing to the temporal and spatial complexity of the coastal flushing process, existing methods for determining <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> may not be generally applicable. In this paper, a systematic method for determining the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> in FCZs is presented, in which bathymetry, runoff, tidal range and stratification are properly accounted for. We determine the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> via numerical tracer experiments, using robust 3 D hydrodynamic and mass transport models. For FCZs located in sheltered and land-locked tidal inlets, the system boundary can be naturally defined at the connection with the open sea. For FCZs located in open waters, hydrodynamic tracking is first {{used to assess the}} extent of tidal excursion and thus delimit the initial boundary between clean water and polluted water. This general method is applied to all designated marine FCZs in Hong Kong for both the dry and wet seasons, including 20 sheltered FCZs (in semi-enclosed waters of Tolo Harbour, Mirs Bay, and Port Shelter) and 6 FCZs in open waters. Our results show that <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> is the longest in inner Port Shelter (about 40 days in dry season), and the shortest for the FCZs in open waters (less than one week in dry season). In addition, the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> in dry season is commonly longer than that in wet season: 20 %~ 40 % for most well-sheltered FCZs; 2. 6 ~ 4 times for the others. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> and distance to open boundary, supporting the view that the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> of a FCZ is closely related to its location.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{advantageous}} to model a semi-enclosed estuarine or coastal embayment (e. g. fish farms or tidal inlets, or typhoon shelters) {{as a separate}} system within a larger water body connected to the outer sea. The water quality of the system depends crucially on its <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> - the average time of a particle in the system. The <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> is governed by the barotropic and baroclinic tidal exchanges between the system and the outer sea. We describe herein a general method to determine systematically the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> of a stratified water body via a numerical tracer experiment. Numerical solution of the 3 D flow and mass transport equations for many practical problems show that the tracer mass removal process depends on the physical topography and bathymetry, tidal range {{and the degree of}} stratification in the outer sea. Field application suggests that the tracer mass variation can be well approximated by a double-exponential decay curve that can be described by three flushing coefficients. Using a simple analytical two-segment model, the flushing coefficients can be given a clear physical interpretation, and the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> can be easily determined in terms of the coefficients. The method is illustrated by application to a number of tidal inlets in Hong Kong, in both the dry and wet season.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of tidally flushed, semi-enclosed basins with negligible freshwater inflow, and under steady periodic flow conditions, three frequently used local transport time scales to quantify the efficiency of water renewal, namely water age, exposure time, and local <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> are studied and compared to each other. In these environments, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion, and it is significantly affected by the return flow (i. e., the fraction of effluent water that returns into the basin on each flood tide). The definition of water age is here modified {{to account for the}} return flow, in analogy with exposure time and local <b>flushing</b> <b>time.</b> We consider approximate time scales, whose accuracy is analyzed, in order to overcome problems related {{to the size of the}} computational domain and to reduce the computational effort. A new approximate procedure is introduced to estimate water age, which is based on the water aging rate. Also, the concept of local <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> as a relevant time scale is introduced. Under steady periodic conditions, we demonstrate that the local <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> quantitatively corresponds to water age, and well approximates exposure time when the flow is dominated by diffusion. Since the effort required to compute water age and exposure time is greater than that required to compute the local <b>flushing</b> <b>time,</b> the present results can also have a practical interest in the assessment of water renewal efficiency of semi-enclosed water basins. The results of a modeling study, in which the lagoon of Venice is used as a benchmark, confirm the substantial quantitative equivalence between these three transport time scales in highly diffusive environments...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{hydrodynamic}} modelling {{has been}} used extensively {{over the last few}} decades to simulate flow in the ocean, bays and estuaries; however, modelling of much smaller scale phenomena is less common. In this work a commercially available Computational Fluid Dynamics package (FIDAP), normally used for industrial applications, was used to simulate tidally-induced flow in multi-opening animal burrows. U-shaped burrows of varying complexities were modelled to determine the effect of different surface characteristics and burrow geometries on surface water velocities, burrow velocities and burrow <b>flushing</b> <b>times.</b> The turbulent 2 D model showed the slope of the surface water was proportional to the square of both the surface and burrow velocities. The effect of placing a root in the surface flow was to reduce the surface water velocity; however, the burrow flow depended upon the root position. For the root location either upstream or downstream of the burrow, the burrow velocity was reduced by 50 %. With the root located between the burrow openings the burrow velocity increased by 200 %, due to the increase in pressure difference across the burrow openings. A buttress root placed in the flow immediately downstream of the upstream burrow, caused the burrow flushing rate to increase significantly with increasing buttress height. <b>Flushing</b> <b>times</b> for burrows of varying depth were determined computationally by use of a tracer for the burrow water. For a burrow of depth 1 · 2 m, the <b>flushing</b> <b>times</b> were 5 and 28 min for root location between the burrow openings and downstream of the burrow, respectively. Animal burrows often consist of multiply-connected loops. A second burrow was added to the primary burrow and <b>flushing</b> <b>times</b> were found to be 15 and 38 min, respectively. A burrow system of four connected burrows was modelled which had corresponding <b>flushing</b> <b>times</b> up to 24 and 47 min, respectively. The calculated times are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant flushing of animal burrows occurs within a single tidal event. This preliminary investigation indicates that CFD models may be very useful in studying small scale hydrodynamic phenomena such as flow in animal burrows...|$|R

In order {{to examine the effects}} of tidal amplitude, river discharge, and stratification on the spatially varying <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> of the Sumjin River Estuary (SRE), 24 longitudinal salinity transects were obtained during spring and neap tides from August 2004 to April 2007. The widely accepted freshwater fraction method has been used to calculate the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> for multiple estuarine segments using a spatially varying freshwater fraction. The effects of tidal amplitude, river discharge, and stratification on estuarine flushing were identified reasonably well by the spatially varying time scale. The <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> appears to be close to the semidiurnal (M 2) tidal period during spring tide, but it is twice as long during a neap tide near the mouth. The <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> increases in the central regions with a decrease in the tidal amplitudes and reduces in the inner-most regions owing to the strong influence of gravitational circulation. A linear function negatively relates estuarine flushing to the tidal amplitudes near the mouth of the estuary, whereas a power-law function relates estuarine flushing to the freshwater inflow near the head. In addition, strong stratification induced by freshwater discharge and small tidal amplitude exerts dominant control to reduce the estuarine flushing in the central and upper regions of the estuary during a neap tide...|$|E

40|$|Global {{climate change}} has {{resulted}} in a gradual sea level rise. Sea level rise can cause saline water to migrate upstream in estuaries and rivers, thereby threatening freshwater habitat and drinking-water supplies. In the present study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was established to simulate salinity distributions and transport time scales in the Wu River estuary of central Taiwan. The model was calibrated and verified using tidal amplitudes and phases, time-series water surface elevation and salinity distributions in 2011. The results show that the model simulation and measured data are in good agreement. The validated model was then applied to calculate the salinity distribution, <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> and residence time in response to a sea level rise of 38. 27 cm. We found that the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> for high flow under the present condition was lower compared to the sea level rise scenario and that the <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> for low flow under the present condition was higher compared to the sea level rise scenario.

40|$|Transport {{time scales}} are key {{parameters}} to assess water renewal of estuaries and tidal basins {{and they have}} long been used to this purpose. In a modern-day Tower of Babel, an ever-increasing confusion has involved terminology, use and estimation of time scales, despite valuable efforts towards a sounder theoretical framework. Within the framework of tidally flushed, semi-enclosed basins with negligible freshwater inflow, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion. The inlet of a tidal basin acts alternatively as a source and as a sink. A significant fraction of effluent water can return to the basin each flood tide. Accordingly, to correctly assess water renewal of such basins, a region larger than the basin itself has to be considered. To account {{for the effects of}} return flow, the concept of exposure time was introduced {{as an alternative to the}} residence time. However, deep analysis of exposure time revealed unexpected complications that, in part, are still open questions. The present contribution extends the concepts of water age and local <b>flushing</b> <b>time</b> to account for the return flow, as for exposure time. These time scales are studied and compared to each other, aided by a modelling study focusing on the Venice lagoon.
