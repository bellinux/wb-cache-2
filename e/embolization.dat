5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (<b>embolization)</b> and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (<b>embolization)</b> of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. <b>Embolization</b> treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{relationship}} between {{air pollution and}} exacerbation of respiratory diseases is well established. Nevertheless, its association with hemoptysis has been poorly investigated. This paper describes the relationship of air pollutants with severe hemoptysis. Methods. All consecutive subjects with severe hemoptysis during a 5 -year period were included. The {{relationship between}} the contamination measurements {{and the frequency of}} <b>embolizations</b> was analyzed using Poisson regressions. In these regressions, the dependent variable was the monthly number of <b>embolizations</b> in a given month and the independent variable was either the concentration of an air contaminant during the same month, the concentration of the air contaminant during the previous month, or the difference between the two. Results. A higher total number of <b>embolizations</b> per month were observed over the months with increases in the concentration of NO. The number of <b>embolizations</b> was 2. 0 in the 33 months with no increases in the concentration of NO, 2. 1 in the 12 months with small increases, 2. 2 in the 5 months with moderate increases, 2. 5 in the 4 months with large increases, and 4. 0 in the 5 months with very large increases. Conclusion. There is association between hemoptysis and increases in the concentration of atmospheric NO in Badalona (Spain) ...|$|R
5|$|Surgery (by craniotomy, open brain surgery) may {{be offered}} {{based on the}} risks of {{treatment}} {{as determined by the}} Spetzler–Martin scale (grade I-V); this score is higher in larger lesions that are close to important brain structures and have deep venous drainage. High grade lesions (IV and V) have an unacceptably high risk and surgery is not typically offered in those cases. Radiosurgery (using targeted radiation therapy such as by a gamma knife) may be used if the lesion is small but close to vital structures. Finally, <b>embolization</b> may be used on small lesions that have only a single feeding vessel.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but <b>embolization</b> may be used in such instances.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, <b>embolization,</b> or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with a feeding blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is <b>embolization</b> with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E

40|$|The authors report 3 {{observations}} of dural arterio-venous fistula cured by combined neuroradiological and neurosurgical intervention. In the first case, the shunt affected the left lateral sinus. Repeated <b>embolizations</b> failed whilst intracranial hypertension developed, {{as a consequence}} of flux in the opposite lateral sinus and in the sagittal sinus. Surgical intervention, consisting in isolation of the transverse sinus, led to complete cure, after a one month delay. In the second case, the shunt was adjacent to the sagittal sinus, right parietal, and had led to an intracerebral haematoma, by rupture of an arterialized cortical vein. <b>Embolizations</b> alone could not cure the fistula which therefore had to be excised. In the third case, the shunt was located in the falx, at the parieto-occipital junction, and was responsible for arterialization of cerebral veins in the right parieto-occipital region. For this reason, after failure of endovascular treatment, the fistula was coagulated, with subsequent complete cure. These three cases illustrate the different types of drainage of such arterio-venous fistula, and their corresponding neurological symptoms and signs, complications and risks, that required a radical-not only clinical, but also anatomical-cure. This aim was achieved when <b>embolizations</b> were accompanied by direct surgical attack...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to identify independent clinical and pathologic variables that were predictive of lymph node involvement in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in a multicenter series with the intent to select patients who were suitable to undergo immediate inguinal lymphadenectomy. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 175 patients who underwent surgery for penile carcinoma in 11 urologic centers participating in the Gruppo Uro-Oncologico del Nord-Est (Northeast Uro-Oncological Group) Penile Cancer Data Base. Pathologically positive lymph nodes were defined as the presence of histologically confirmed lymph node metastasis in patients who underwent either immediate or delayed inguinal and/or pelvic lymphadenectomy. Patients who had clinically positive lymph nodes with cytologically positive fine-needle aspiration results and who had not undergone lymphadenectomy were censored. RESULTS: Overall, lymph-node involvement was observed in 71 of 175 patients (40. 6 %) included in the analyses. After analyzing the whole group of patients, the following variables were identified as independent predictors of pathologic lymph node metastasis: clinical lymph node status, pathologic stage of the primary tumor, venous and lymphatic <b>embolizations,</b> and histologic grade. In the subgroup of patients with clinically negative lymph nodes, tumor thickness, histologic grade, lymphatic and venous <b>embolizations,</b> infiltration of both corpus spongiosum and urethra, and pathologic stage of the primary tumor (according to the 1997 TNM classification system) were predictive of lymph node involvement on univariate analysis. The generated logistic regression model showed that venous and/or lymphatic <b>embolizations</b> and infiltration of the corpus spongiosum and/or urethra were independent predictors of pathologic lymph node metastasis in patients with clinically negative lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Venous and/or lymphatic <b>embolizations</b> played relevant roles as predictors of pathologic lymph node involvement in patients with penile neoplasia and should be considered important parameters in determining which patients with clinically negative lymph nodes should undergo immediate lymphadenectomy.
