40|$|The {{deflector}} has {{planar light}} inlet and outlet surfaces, with boundary layers which refract and/or reflect the light disposed between the planar surfaces. The inlet and outlet surfaces are surfaces of two respective flat elements (e. g. E 1) which {{each have a}} protruding surface structure (2) on the side opposite to the light entry surface. The surface structures of the two elements are formed such that when the elements are combined the surface structures <b>interengage</b> so that gaps are formed defined by the walls (3, 3 ', 4, 5) of the surface structures of two elements. Preferably the elements are made of material which is transparent to sunlight e. g. acrylic. USE - For providing dazzle-free internal illumination throughout a room. ADVANTAGE - Provides light with almost loss free reflection while not adversely affect see-through properties so that a user can see other side of object without distortion or colour errors, and is manufactured in a simple low-cost manner...|$|E
40|$|DE 1004060197 A UPAB: 20060814 NOVELTY - Method for {{precision}} aligning and/or fitting {{of several}} components (1 a,b) incorporates determined microstructure (2 a,b) {{on at least}} one surface of each component. Alignment of components with each other is carried out by determined microstructures, when <b>interengaged.</b> Preferably, first coarse alignment of components takes place, followed by mutual fine alignment for completion. One surface of each component may carry macroelement (3 a,b) for interengagement of both microstructures and macroelements. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for equipment for precision alignment and/or fitting of several components. USE - For use in precision, micro- and nano-technique. ADVANTAGE - Precision alignment of component of less than 1 micron...|$|R
40|$|An {{actuator}} operated microvalve and {{the method}} of making same is disclosed and claimed. The microvalve comprises a SiC housing which includes a first lower portion and a second upper portion. The lower portion of the SiC housing includes a passageway therethrough, a microvalve seat, and a moveable SiC diaphragm. The SiC diaphragm includes a centrally located boss and radially extending corrugations which may be sinusoidally shaped. The boss of the SiC diaphragm moves and modulates {{in a range of}} positions between a closed position wherein the boss <b>interengages</b> said microvalve seat prohibiting communication of fluid through the passageway and a fully open position when the boss is spaced apart from the seat at its maximum permitting communication of fluid through said passageway. The actuator includes a SiC top plate affixed to the boss of the diaphragm and a first electrode and the second upper portion of the SiC housing further includes a second electrode...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotatable}} socket acts positively on a {{threaded spindle}}. The threaded spindle {{is connected to}} a transport component (2) connectable to a bone segment separated from one fracture end and arranged between two bone parts. The transport component is movable along the longitudinal axis in the sleeve (1) by rotation of the rotatable socket (9). The fixture of the bone segment separated from one fracture end is by a bone screw (E) fitted in a longitudinal guide in the sleeve. The threaded spindle and a threaded socket (3) accommodated and fixed in the sleeve have different threads and are exchangeable. A tooth component (5) which has <b>interengaging</b> teeth (4 a, 4 b) engages on both sides on the sleeve and on a driver (6). USE/ADVANTAGE - The bone marrow nail does not influence the healing process negatively through {{the formation of a}} tissue bulge and the original length of the broken bone, with improved healing conditions, is further producible...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{classical}} {{problem of the}} kinetic theory of gases (the Smoluchowsky' problem about temperature jump in rarefied gas) is considered. The rarefied gas fills half-space over a flat firm surface. logarithmic gradient of temperature is set far from surface. The kinetic equation with modelling integral of collisions {{in the form of}} BGK-model (Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook) is used. The general mirror-diffuse boundary conditions of molecules reflexions of gas from a wall on border of half-space (Maxwell conditions) are considered. Expanding distribution function on two orthogonal directions in space of velocities, the Smoluchowsky' problem to the solution of the homogeneous vector one-dimensional and one-velocity kinetic equation with a matrix kernel is reduced. Then generalization of source-method is used and boundary conditions include in non-homogeneous vector kinetic equation. The solution in the form of Fourier integral is searched. The problem is reduced to the solution of vector Fredholm integral equation of the second sort with matrix kernel. The solution of Fredholm equation in the form of Neumann's polynoms with vector coefficients is searched. The system vector algebraic <b>interengaged</b> equations turns out. The solution of this system is under construction in the form of Neumann's polynoms. Comparison with well-known Barichello - Siewert' high-exact results is made. Zero and the first approach of jumps of temperature and numerical density are received. It is shown, that transition from the zero to the first approach raises 10 times accuracy in calculation coefficients of temperature and concentration jump. Comment: 28 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
