She moved to Deptford, Kent, to be fitted-out and have her hull covered with copper plates between 16July and 25October1782; at her completion she had cost £4,2007s3d to build.|$|E
50|$|From 1937 the {{disposal}} of elderly V and W class vessels ceased, and most survivors were converted to <b>fast</b> <b>escort</b> vessels. The onset of the Second World War {{put a stop to}} lengthy conversions, but many ships were converted for convoy escort duty.|$|E

Greer sailed 26 December with another Casablanca-bound convoy and after an uneventful crossing returned to Boston 9 February 1944. This {{was the final}} transatlantic crossing for the old four-stack destroyer, as {{she and her sister}} ships were replaced by newer and <b>faster</b> <b>escorts.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Iowa-class battleships were a {{class of}} six fast battleships ordered by the United States Navy in 1939 and 1940 to <b>escort</b> the <b>Fast</b> Carrier Task Forces that would operate in the Pacific Theater of World War II. Four were completed; two more were laid down but {{canceled}} in 1945 at war's end, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958. Like other third-generation American battleships, the Iowas followed the design pattern {{set forth in the}} preceding [...] and [...] battleships, which emphasized speed in addition to secondary and anti-aircraft batteries.

50|$|One of a {{new class}} of <b>fast</b> <b>escort</b> vessels {{designed}} for convoy work, Hooper conducted shakedown training out of her home port, San Diego, before deploying with the 7th Fleet. The escort vessel took part in antisubmarine operations and joined the vital Formosa Patrol before returning to the United States 9 April 1959. Through 1961 she continued to operate with the 7th Fleet and in the San Diego area.|$|E

She was frightened to meet Bathyscaphe, but the latter assured her that as a retired ship she is not obligated and will not report Haruna to the alien authorities. In a later episode, Haruna moves in with the proprietor of the beach restaurant and Narue's friends give them a wedding ceremony.|$|E
50|$|Wryneck was {{put into}} Reserve during the {{economic}} crisis of the 1930s and laid up in Gibraltar. In 1938 she was selected for WAIR conversion to a <b>fast</b> <b>escort</b> ship at Gibraltar Dockyard. The work began in September 1939 and was not completed until March 1940. In April 1940, after sea trials, Wryneck was recommissioned for service with the new pennant number L04, and assigned to convoy defence duty based at Alexandria. In December she was detached to support military operations against the Italian army in Egypt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{future of}} the CORB was already in {{question}} after the torpedoing of an evacuation ship, the , by U-60 two weeks earlier. 320 children had been aboard, but all had been rescued by other ships. The directors of the CORB were hopeful that the programme could be continued, and presented a report into the sinking which made recommendations for future operations, which included the use of <b>faster</b> transports and <b>escorts</b> on the North Atlantic routes, and the concentration of the evacuation programme on routes to Australia, India and South Africa, where the weather was better and there were felt to be fewer enemy submarines. The Admiralty {{pointed out that there}} were insufficient <b>fast</b> <b>escorts</b> and ships available, and public opinion was opposed to the continuation of overseas evacuation, fearing further tragedies. Winston Churchill also opposed the scheme, believing evacuations gave aid and comfort to the enemy. [...] The government announced the cancellation of the CORB programme, and all children who were currently preparing to sail were ordered to disembark and return home. Official child evacuation efforts came to a halt {{with the end of the}} CORB, but large-scale private evacuation of a further 14,000 child continued until 1941.|$|R
5|$|Because the Iowas were <b>fast</b> {{enough to}} <b>escort</b> the new s, their orders were retained, making them the last US Navy battleships to be commissioned.|$|R

5000|$|The Speedy {{class was}} {{designed}} in 1781 by the shipbuilder Thomas King, of Dover, a specialist builder of such craft. They were designed with a cutter-type hull, and anticipated {{the development of}} a new concept of the brig in naval warfare, that of small, <b>fast</b> <b>escort</b> vessels, instead of the slower but more seaworthy ship-sloops. Their names were selected to epitomise this approach, , and [...] Small, light craft, they were 207 [...] Tons bm, and measured 78 ft (overall) and 59 ft (keel), with a beam of 25 ft and 10 ft depth in the hold. Armed with fourteen 4-pounders, giving a broadside weight of 28 pounds, and twelve ½pdr swivel guns, they had a crew of 70. This was broken up into 57 officers, seamen and marines; 12 servants and boys; and 1 widow's man.|$|E
50|$|Sickle {{began her}} wartime career {{operating}} in the Mediterranean, where she sank the German submarine U-303, the German auxiliary submarine chaser UJ-2213/Heureux, the Italian auxiliary minesweepers No. 61/ Costante Neri, V 131/Amgiola Maria C. and No. 164/ Rosa Madre, and the German escort vessel SG-10/Felix Henri. The former fruit transport ship Felix Henri had been modified into an auxiliary cruiser by the French in 1940. She was captured by German troops on 14 December 1942 in Marseilles, modified into the <b>fast</b> <b>escort</b> vessel SG-10, commissioned on 1 May 1943 and attached to the 3rd escort flotilla. Sickle also sank ten sailing vessels and the German merchant Reaumur. Sickle also attacked and damaged the Italian merchants Oriani and Giovanni Boccaccio. The Giovanni Boccaccio was later beached to prevent her from sinking. The Italian merchant Mauro Croce, the German submarine U-755, the German auxiliary submarine chaser UJ 2210 and the German transport Lola were also attacked, but unsuccessfully.|$|E

50|$|Destroyers were {{developed}} from the World War II designs as the smallest <b>fast</b> task force <b>escorts.</b> DDs were <b>fast</b> ASW ships; DDGs were AAW ships carrying the short-range Tartar missile.|$|R
2500|$|Empty ships {{travelling}} westbound {{on similar}} routes were designated UC convoys. Seventeen ballasted tankers departed from Liverpool on 15 February 1943 as convoy UC 1 with fifteen <b>fast</b> freighters, <b>escorted</b> by the modern American destroyers , , , and , and the British 42nd Escort Group: sloops [...] and , s [...] and , [...] , and s Gorleston and Totland [...] This {{was the only}} UC convoy successfully attacked by submarines.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the cold war, the British Royal Navy was in urgent need of <b>fast</b> <b>escort</b> ships to counter the large number of Whiskey class {{submarines}} being built by the Soviet Union which were faster than the Royal Navy's existing Sloops and Frigates. Britain had large numbers of War Emergency Programme destroyers, which while relatively new, were poorly equipped for modern fleet purposes, with poor anti-aircraft armament and fire control. It was therefore decided to convert the Emergency Programme destroyers to interim escorts to meet the Royal Navy's requirements until new-build ships (which eventually became the Type 12 and Type 14 frigates) could be designed and built. The initial design was the Type 15 frigate or Rapid class, which was a major rebuild of the ships, with an extended forecastle and new superstructure giving improved accommodation and complete replacement of the ships' armament and sensors. At one time, it was planned to convert 57 destroyers to the Type 15 standard, but the cost of such a large programme proved prohibitive, with only 23 ships becoming Type 15 frigates. Instead, a simpler and cheaper conversion, the Type 16 was ordered.|$|E
500|$|... and [...] {{served for}} the last year of World War II as {{bombardment}} ships and <b>fast</b> carrier <b>escorts.</b> Once the two ships reached Bayonne, New Jersey in late 1945 and early 1946, they never left port again. Numerous plans to convert Hawaii into a guided-missile cruiser or a large command ship in the years after the war were fruitless, and she was sold for scrap in 1959, two years before her sisters.|$|R
50|$|After {{shakedown}} off Bermuda, Raby sailed from Norfolk, Virginia on 10 February 1944 via the Panama Canal for Nouméa, {{arriving on}} 11 March. She then <b>escorted</b> <b>fast</b> convoys from Guadalcanal {{as far as}} Manus Island, in the Admiralties.|$|R
50|$|Through D-Day and {{the summer}} of 1944, Reeves {{continued}} to <b>escort</b> <b>fast</b> convoys. On 23 September she completed her last Atlantic escort mission and entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport.|$|R
500|$|The {{passage of}} the Second Vinson Act in 1938 had {{cleared the way for}} {{construction}} of the four South Dakota-class battleships and the first two Iowa-class fast battleships (those with the hull numbers BB-61 and BB-62). The latter four battleships of the class, those designated with the hull numbers BB-63, BB-64, BB-65, and BB-66 (Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Kentucky, respectively) were not cleared for construction until 12 July 1940,. While BB-63 and BB-64 were originally planned as the final ships in the Iowa-class to serve as <b>fast</b> <b>escorts</b> for the s, BB-65 and BB-66 were intended to be the first ships of the Montana class which was larger and slower while mounting twelve [...] Mark 7 guns. However, the passage of an emergency war building program on 19 July 1940 resulting in Illinois and Kentucky being re-ordered as the fifth and sixth ships, respectively, of the [...] in order to save time on construction, so the first ship of the [...] would be reassigned as BB-67. The orders for BB-65 and BB-66 were placed on 9 September 1940, and the ships were laid down on 6 December 1942, and 7 March 1942, respectively.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November, Stephen Potter {{proceeded}} to Ulithi, via Saipan, where she rendezvoused with the <b>fast</b> carriers and <b>escorted</b> {{them to the}} Philippines. Air strikes were flown against the Visayas area, Manila, and Luzon from 11 to 25 November when the force retired.|$|R
500|$|Unable {{to build}} new ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy also chose to improve its {{existing}} battlecruisers of the Kongō class (initially the , , and —the [...] only later {{as it had been}} disarmed {{under the terms of the}} Washington treaty) in two substantial reconstructions (one for Hiei). During the first of these, elevation of their main guns was increased to +40 degrees, anti-torpedo bulges and [...] of horizontal armour added, and a [...] "pagoda" [...] mast with additional command positions built up. This reduced the ships' speed to [...] The second reconstruction focused on speed as they had been selected as <b>fast</b> <b>escorts</b> for aircraft carrier task forces. Completely new main engines, a reduced number of boilers and an increase in hull length by [...] allowed them to reach up to 30 knots once again. They were reclassified as [...] "fast battleships," [...] although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I–era battleships in the American or the British navies, with dire consequences during the Pacific War, when Hiei and Kirishima were easily crippled by US gunfire during actions off Guadalcanal, forcing their scuttling shortly afterwards. Perhaps most tellingly, Hiei was crippled by medium-caliber gunfire from heavy and light cruisers in a close-range night engagement.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} war years Britain desperately needed <b>fast</b> convoy <b>escorts</b> and lacked {{the number of}} {{warships}} to fulfill this role.

2500|$|It {{was hoped}} that, {{following}} a successful German submarine attack, <b>fast</b> British <b>escorts,</b> such as destroyers, would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British {{in the expected}} locations, good prospects were thought to exist of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. [...] "After the British sortied {{in response to the}} raiding attack force", the Royal Navy's centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.|$|R
5000|$|On 17 September 1941 Euryalus {{joined the}} escort for convoy WS 11X from Glasgow to Gibraltar. From 24 to 30 September 1941 {{she was part}} of Operation Halberd, one of the Malta Convoys.

Two days later the force was spotted by Italian scout planes. Italian air attacks launched from Sardinia began on 27 September. The battleship Nelson was hit by a torpedo north of the Galite Islands. That evening the freighter Imperial Star was sunk north of Cap Bon. On 1 October Euryalus became part of Force W at Gibraltar.|$|R
500|$|The Alaska {{class was}} {{a class of}} six large cruisers ordered before World War II for the United States Navy. They were officially classed as large cruisers (CB), but others have {{regarded}} them as battlecruisers. They were all named after territories or insular areas of the United States, signifying their intermediate status between larger battleships and smaller heavy and light cruisers. Of the six planned, two were completed, the third's construction was suspended on 16 April 1947, and the last three were cancelled. [...] and [...] served with the U.S. Navy {{for the last year}} of World War II as bombardment ships and <b>fast</b> carrier <b>escorts.</b> They were decommissioned in 1947 after spending only 32 and 29 months in service, respectively.|$|R
50|$|A larger {{engagement}} {{took place}} on 29 January 1991.

Two vessels were sunk by Sea Skuas fired by four Lynx helicopters. The remaining vessels were damaged, destroyed or dispersed by American carrier-based aircraft and Royal Navy Sea King helicopters.|$|R
50|$|The Gol GT 1.8 was the BX family's first sports {{version and}} {{an answer to}} the Ford Escort XR3, a {{successful}} sports car in Brazilian market. With a 1.8 liter engine borrowed from Santana (MkII Passat), the Gol GT was much <b>faster</b> than the <b>Escort</b> XR3, but externally did not have the same beauty. The first series still had a four-speed manual gearbox, but soon this was changed to a five-speed unit.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, Crescent {{underwent}} a conversion to destroyer escort. She was modernised for anti-submarine warfare {{and to serve}} as a <b>fast</b> fleet <b>escort,</b> similar to the Type 15 frigate of the Royal Navy, the second Canadian warship to so. The superstructure was extended aft, and the bridge was modified. Half of her gun armament was replaced by sonar, a Mark 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortar and homing torpedoes. The project was considered the largest operation undertaken by a Canadian dockyard to that point. While under refit, Crescent was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron on 1 January 1955. The ship was recommissioned on 31 October 1955, followed by three months of extensive sea trials. In 1959, she was used as a test bed for the new variable depth sonar and was eventually permanently installed.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Ca" [...] {{flotilla}} were reconstructed in {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s to be modernised for anti-submarine warfare and to serve as <b>fast</b> fleet <b>escorts.</b> One bank of torpedo tubes and one 4.5 in gun was removed, allowing two Squid triple-barreled anti-submarine mortars to be fitted, while the ships' obsolete gun Mk I Type K director {{was replaced by a}} modern Mk 6M director as fitted to Royal Navy frigates, and the remaining 4.5 in guns fitted with RPC. Close in anti-aircraft armament was standardised as a single Mk V twin and two single 40 mm Bofors mounts. The ships were also fitted with new bridges; the post-refit bridge differed between the first four conversions (Cavendish, Carron, Cavalier and Carysfort), with open bridges and the later four (Caprice, Cassandra, Caesar and Cambrian) which were given frigate-type enclosed bridges.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 12 or Whitby-class frigates were a six-ship {{class of}} anti-submarine frigates of the British Royal Navy, which entered service {{late in the}} 1950s. [...] They were {{designed}} in the early 1950s as first-rate ocean-going convoy escorts, {{in the light of}} experience gained during World War II. At this time, the Royal Navy were designing single-role escorts and the Whitbys were designed as <b>fast</b> convoy <b>escorts</b> capable of tackling high-speed submarines. However, this made the Whitbys more expensive and sophisticated to produce in large numbers {{in the event of a}} major war, and so the Type 14 [...] "utility" [...] or [...] "second-rate" [...] anti-submarine frigate was developed to complement the Type 12. Although themselves rapidly outdated, the Type 12 proved to be an excellent basis for a series of frigate designs used by the British and Commonwealth navies for the next 20 years.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1944 {{it had been}} {{suggested}} that the 1943 Battle class could be fitted with a long range early warning radar fitted to a mast amidships, albeit {{at the expense of}} some of the torpedo tubes and AA armament. The idea was not taken up at the time but in the early post war years a need was identified for a <b>Fast</b> Air Detection <b>Escort</b> (FADE). These ships would accompany the fleet and detect, identify and track potential targets and direct friendly aircraft to engage them, a role known as Aircraft Direction (A/D).|$|R
