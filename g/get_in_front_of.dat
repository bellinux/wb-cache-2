5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the Mercedes and take third. Hamilton tried to open up a gap in order to cover his position, should the Ferrari drivers attempt a so-called undercut, a strategy in which a car entered the pit lane early in order to use fresher tyres to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> another car without overtaking them on track. Meanwhile, Rosberg took back third from Räikkönen on lap four before doing the same with Vettel on the end of lap nine.|$|E
25|$|Positions with doubled pawns {{are usually}} a draw if the {{defending}} king can <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the pawns. If the defending king cannot <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the pawns, the outcome {{depends on which}} file the pawns are on and where the defending king is cut off. If the defending king is cut off {{by more than one}} file, the pawns win, except if they are rook pawns. If the pawns are on the c through f file then they win if the opposing king is cut off by one file (or more) on the long side, otherwise they draw.|$|E
25|$|If the {{defending}} king {{is in front}} of the pawn and the attacking king and pawn have not yet reached their sixth rank, the Philidor position (or Philidor defense) easily works to secure a draw. If {{the defending}} king cannot <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the pawn but is not cut off, the short side defense can be used. If the pawn is a rook pawn or knight pawn, the back rank defense can be used. The back rank defense can also be used when the pawn is on other files if the attacking king has not reached the sixth rank. If the king is cut off along a file, the frontal defense may work, depending on the file of the pawn and how far advanced it is.|$|E

500|$|Coburn {{generated}} controversy {{after the}} race, {{when he said}} the current Triple Crown system allowed [...] "the coward's way out" [...] because fresh horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs.

[...] Steve Haskin of Blood-Horse magazine summarized the race stating, [...] "when I think back... the one image that will last forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot, his head down and breathing hard, and every vein protruding from his sweat-soaked body.

2500|$|Walrus {{are often}} hunted {{during the winter}} and spring since hunting them in summer is much more dangerous. A walrus is too large to be {{controlled}} by one man, so it cannot be hunted alone.

[...] then tried to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the walrus and it was harpooned while its head was submerged.

2500|$|Over {{the weekend}} of 5 and 6 August, gusty winds made {{firefighting}} a challenge as the crews worked to expand fire lines. [...] The firefighting efforts consisted of hand-cut fire lines and pumper truck crews spraying water on the flames along with retardant drops from the air. [...] As additional firefighting resources arrived from stations throughout the Pacific Northwest and more heavy equipment became available, the fire lines were widened and extended all along the perimeter. [...] While the fire threatened some important archaeological sites, {{the size of the}} fire did not grow much over the weekend. [...] This was due to a shift in the wind that pushed the fire back into burned out areas, allowing firefighters to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the fire and finish their lines. [...] During this period, the number of firefighter on scene grew to over 400. The Bureau of Land Management estimated the fire was 60 percent contained.|$|E

2500|$|The boat's repairs {{took longer}} than {{expected}} {{and instead of}} being completed by 4 April, {{it was not until}} the 10th that the boat was ready to depart on its third patrol. Nevertheless, when she left, she did so with repairs incomplete and a number of dock workers remained on board to finish these off while at sea. Departing Lorient with an armed escort known as a Sperrbrecher and three anti-submarine vessels, U-175 proceeded independently after passing Ile de Groix. In the days that followed, a number of radar contacts sent the boat below the surface. However, by 15 April they had arrived in the Mid-Atlantic air gap where they were out of range of Allied aircraft, allowing them to operate on the surface with less circumspection. The following day, BdU ordered U-175 to join an attack on convoy HX-233, a Liverpool-bound convoy which had departed Halifax and New York City earlier in the month, which had been spotted by [...] while on a clandestine operation to pick up German prisoners-of-war.

2500|$|Bryant {{debuted in}} the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points {{in front of}} a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders {{struggled}} to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris. He scored 36 points in the finale, and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four game. As a rookie in [...] 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by Jermaine O'Neal and former teammate Andrew Bynum), and also became the youngest NBA starter ever (18 years, 158 days). Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time. By the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star weekend, Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion ever at the age of 18. Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with the Utah's Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. [...] Bryant shot four air balls {{at the end of the}} game; the Jazz won 98–93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4–1. He first whiffed a game-winning 2-point jump shot in the fourth quarter, and then misfired three three-point field goals in overtime, including two tying shots in the final minute. O'Neal commented that [...] " [...] was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that." ...|$|E
