50|$|In 1987 the {{original}} band separated due to conflicts especially related to university commitments {{that make it}} increasingly difficult to meet for rehearsals. Drummer Marco Lippe, certainly the most active member for his numerous musical projects (Hide and Seek, Nirnaeth) and collaboration (Nirnaeth Space Lab, Locus, Christoper Lenox-Smith/Seaweed of Ozric Tentacles), meets Nico Colucci, a whimsical artist, fond of painting, graphics and music at the Academy of Fine Arts. He introduced him to a different and younger environment where he met Antonio Paparelli, a guitarist with a dark-wave setting. The strict and rigorous scientific university commitments contrast with the more <b>flexible</b> <b>time</b> and space of their artistic studies. In this scenario Edain Danse took shape, a dark-wave project with Antonio Paparelli on guitar, Nico Colucci on bass and Marco Lippe on drums. This new band clearly resembles Joy Division, Cure and Danse Society (hence the name) and started composing a number of songs that will be presented to the public of Bari in two concerts only. With the help of the “dark philia” of that period, Edain Danse was extraordinarily successful.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S. Ginell states [...] "this enjoyable, offbeat trio album {{featuring}} the unusual combination of Bley's piano, David Eyges' electric cello and Bruce Ditmas' drums {{seems to have}} {{very little to do}} with Gregorian chant per se ... Only [...] "Digitant" [...] seems to breathe some of the ambience of chant in its thematic material. Eyges' cello usually fills in the traditional function of a bass -- albeit a very light-toned bass -- while occasionally forming dissonant arco (bowed) counterlines around the piano. Bley's playing is often brilliantly unpredictable, difficult to categorize, and thus, able to stand out from the pack". In JazzTimes Bill Bennett wrote [...] "Bley is a fountain of ideas, sometimes suggesting divergent harmonic and melodic directions, sometimes reveling in the sound of a lone tone cluster ringing through the pulse. Eyges takes full advantage of the range of his instrument, moving between rhythmic and melodic contributions with grace and ingenuity. Ditmas respects the <b>flexible</b> <b>time</b> sense that Bley brings to bear, contributing texture and color as well as pulse to the proceedings".|$|E
50|$|Building {{upon the}} human capital theory explanation, mothers may also {{sacrifice}} their pay for {{jobs that are}} compatible with motherhood. For example, mothers {{may be willing to}} accept lower pay in return for desirable features, such as flexible work schedules, access to paid leave, and part-time work hours. Lower paying jobs geared towards women may offer greater access to female supervisors, coworkers, and mentors and a more supportive, family-friendly environment. Almost 50% of mothers who are employed full-time would prefer to work part-time, and 80% of mothers who are employed part-time view their situation as ideal. However, part-time work is not a solution to gender inequality, as part-time workers usually experience reduced employment prospects, benefits, and earnings. A study done by Rebecca Glauber, shows that mothers do not get compensated for lower wages with benefits such as <b>flexible</b> <b>time</b> schedules and paid leave. Glauber found that mothers face a larger wage penalty when they work in female-dominated jobs. This larger penalty is not offset by greater job satisfaction, greater access to part-time work schedules, flexible work hours, health insurance, paid sick and vacation time, or job-protected maternity leave.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-study was conducted among 167 German employees from 17 different organizations. Information about in-role and extra-role performance was also obtained via peer evaluations. Findings - The data support a two-factor structure of flexibility. The time restriction factor adds to the degree of exhaustion and the work-nonwork conflict, while time autonomy diminishes these outcome variables.
