25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence policy choices of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to intra-EU politics and the obsession with Byzantine Community method consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public <b>disenchantment</b> <b>with</b> the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union sanctions regime against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the sanctions regime by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel).

Central to this research are questions about professional practice, dislocation/disinterest, research, resonance and reinvention. As disenchantment is common, perhaps pervasive, within professional practice, my account of this research will propose that a more general understanding of practice-led research-highly reflective, self-initiated work-is essential if graphic design is to support and sustain imaginative, innovative, and inventive practitioners. Rather than target graphic design&# 039;s inability to support provocative practices (the studio, or the industry), my research focuses on the potential of the individual practitioner to motivate and design a more generative and engaged practice. As such any observations and/or discoveries are not presented as quantitative &# 039;findings&# 039;, but should be seen rather as generative understandings that promote future possibility and potential for the practice...|$|R
40|$|Interwar Europe was {{enamored of}} myth: adaptations of {{classical}} tales proliferated, anthropological research into so-called “primitive” mythology thrived, and movements ranging from psychoanalysis to surrealism bore myth’s undeniable imprint. But its reputation {{took a turn}} during World War II, {{and by the end}} of the war, myth had become synonymous with irrationality, violence, barbarism, and (most damning of all) fascism. At best, myth was dismissed as anachronistic or escapist; at worst, it was cited it as a serious political threat. Thus, most postwar European writers, especially those claiming to be politically “committed,” eschewed myth in order to avoid the threat of contamination. However, there are exceptions to this rule—writers who strived to maintain connections with past traditions, as myth once had, without falling victim to propaganda or neo-romantic universalization. Taking as my starting point myth’s tremendous capacity to facilitate social cohesion, I argue that it played a vital role in postwar French and Italian fiction, providing readers with the tools needed to process the trauma of the war, combat modern alienation and <b>disenchantment,</b> and engage <b>with</b> the sociopolitical exigencies of the day. This dissertation thus re-inscribes myth in a tradition of political commitment, tracing the (non-fascistic) political consequences of mythically inflected novels. This rehabilitation of myth hinges on four authors—Georges Bataille and Claude Simon in France, and Cesare Pavese and Elsa Morante in Italy—who mobilized myth as an alternative to the dominant literary and political models operative in each country. However, I do not merely demonstrate the persistence of mythological archetypes in the postwar cultural landscape; rather, I articulate the precise ways in which such archetypes interpenetrated the specificity of World War II and subverted traditional historiography. Far from being a form of escapist fantasy, myth allowed writers and readers alike to appropriate longstanding cultural traditions in order to circumscribe the otherwise uncontrollable and unassimilable experiences of war. Though many intellectuals advocated for myth’s outright demise, the authors considered here sought to recover something from contaminated discourses, recognizing that total rupture from the past would only exacerbate existing feelings of alienation, isolation, and despair. ...|$|R

40|$|FOREWORD. When {{one looks}} at the present state of the CSDP, one cannot help but look on <b>with</b> <b>disenchantment</b> at the energy that appears to have {{abandoned}} both institutions and Member States. Commentators increasingly take for granted that nothing much should be expected from this field of EU policy. The reasons for this state of mind are well known: the recent economic and financial strains, which have impacted all EU action since 2008, means that most of the Member States will struggle to keep their defence budgets at their present level in the future, and we may even see reductions. Furthermore, and to put it mildly, most of the recent CSDP operations have also experienced a lack of enthusiasm. Adding to this overall trend, the EU is far from presenting a common vision of what security and defence should really mean. Many of the Member States {{do not want to be}} involved in all of today’s international turmoils, and they rarely share the strategic culture which inspires those Member States who see themselves as having special responsibilities in dealing with these crises. In the end it may be that Member States diverge fundamentally on the simple question of whether it is relevant for the EU to engage in most of the ‘hot’ crises Europe faces; many prefer to see Europe as a soft power, mostly dedicated to intervening on less dramatic fronts and more inclined to mend than to fight. For whatever reason given, it remains that if there is a lack of common understanding on what CSDP should really be about, it should not come as a surprise if this policy is presently in stalemate. As an additional blow, the Ukrainian crisis, which dragged on for the whole of last year, could only add to the downward spiral the EU has been experiencing, with a new Russia aggressively confronting Europe in a manner not too distant from the Cold War days. This attitude has triggered the natural reaction among EU Member States to seek reassurances from NATO about their own national security. Coupled with the return of France a few years ago into the integrated military command, NATO’s renewed relevance has sent a strong message to Europe about the military organisation’s credibility with regard to collective defence. Surprisingly, this overall trend was gathering momentum at the same time as other more positive developments. The European Council of December 2013 dedicated its main session to CSDP: it underlined Europe’s role as a ‘security provider’ while adopting a very ambitious road map for Europe in all possible dimensions of the security sector. Hence the impression of a genuine boost to all EU institutions, which have been invited to join efforts and give CSDP a reinvigorated efficiency. In the same way, the increasing instability in Europe’s neighbourhood has also called for more EU operations: most recently in Iraq, Libya, Northern Nigeria or South Sudan. Pressure for further EU engagement has been one of the most constant features of the discussions taking place around these crises. Moreover, a growing number of EU partners in Asia, Latin America or Eastern Europe have shown a renewed eagerness to join CSDP missions in what sounds like a vote of confidence for EU capacities. What kind of conclusion should be drawn from this contradictory situation? Probably that the EU has much more potential than it can sometimes figure out itself, if only it would be ready to adapt to the new global realities. But, more than anything else, an enhanced CSDP needs from all Member States strong political will and a clear vision of what they want this policy to be. Without this indispensable ingredient CSDP may continue to run its course, as it does today. It may even grow in efficiency but it will keep lacking the one resource that would definitely help it overcome all the present shortcomings that have prevented Europe from finding its true role and mission through the CSDP. Member States remain central to EU security and defence policy. This is why this collection of essays is so valuable for assessing in no uncertain way the long road that lies ahead for any progress to be made.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with explaining why and how - under what practical condition and within what social arrangements - knowledge about society emerged as "social science": a relatively autonomous domain of expertise with its own distinctive arrangement of working practices, institutional arrangements and technologies. Social Science, I argue, originated not as much with Marx and Weber in Germany, or Comte and Durkheim in France, as with the political institution of governmental investigations in Britain {{almost half a century}} before it obtained academic prestige within the disciplinary framework of the universities. Only after social science was well entrenched in the political field, through the work of governmental commissions, and its influence and effects were felt in the public sphere, through legislation and policy, did it migrate into the universities, where it was appropriated by academics in their associations. I suggest that there is much we can learn about the scientificity of social knowledge once we forgo the traditional ways in which the history of social science is told and look at political institutions, political practices and political circumstances as {{the driving force behind the}} emergence not only of social investigations but indeed of social science more in general. It was politics, its discourse, its mechanics of parliamentary and governmental work, its legislative practices and bureaucratic routines, its technologies of recording, compiling, archiving, presenting and transporting information, which provided the condition of possibility for the emergence of social science as a domain of expertise, not least by investing social knowledge with importance, authority and relevance, through the work of governmental social investigations. Social science, I argue, was developed as a creative response to the growing requirement of publicity in the exercise of political authority during the first half of the nineteenth century. I locate the origins of social science within a larger transformation in the organizational culture of the British parliament, which took place at this period, following the increasing publicity of parliamentary debates and proceedings in the national Press. This transformation conditioned specific patterns of investigation and publication that turned social knowledge into a domain of expertise, thus paving the way for the emergence of social science. The first step in this transformation was the <b>disenchantment</b> of politics. <b>With</b> the opening of parliament to the "public gaze," politics became a domain an application for public reportage - a category of knowledge, that was understood to be worthwhile to observe and interpret, and which was constituted through the monitoring of parliamentary debates. Once politics was constructed as a field of application for the Press and identified with public reportage, contemporary political and social events inside and outside parliament became observational and 'experimental' and could now be legitimately monitored, accumulated, archived, combined into chronologies, and then served as a basis for interpretation and commentary. In the second step, the growing coverage of politics in the press, encouraged government officials to take control of the legislation process from parliament by establishing a new policymaking regime, based on empirical explorations of social problems outside parliament by especially assigned governmental commissions. Serving on these commissions, politicians effectively became social experts, turning their gaze onto the public, carefully inspecting and monitoring social problems in their localities, thus making social knowledge a legitimate domain of political expertise. With the growing use of governmental investigations, expert knowledge about society was effectively entrenched into the political field, transforming the organizational culture of parliament, its discourse and practices, from "verbal economy" of oratorical performance to the "visual economy" of writing public reports for policymaking purposes. In this new parliamentary regime, visual knowledge gained a cultural comparative advantage, an "epistemic privilege," over verbal knowledge, not merely because of its physicality but, more importantly, because it "fitted" the new circumstances created by the growing power of the press and the formation of political-print-culture. An "elective affinity" was created between political reportage and social reportage. In the third and final step, government officials attempted to control and manage the variety and partisan and contradictory understandings of politics that were created by the Press and challenged the ability of government to elicit support for its policies inside and outside parliament. They did so by establishing various associations whose goal was to promote an official political discourse through immense public opinion campaigns, accompanied by a massive dissemination of governmental reports about social problems. In these campaigns, expert knowledge about society, produced by governmental investigations, was presented as scientific: useful, relevant, non-partisan, tangible and accessible to others. In this way, expert knowledge about society was grafted onto the practice and discourse of its public consumers, effectively becoming "scientific. ...|$|R
