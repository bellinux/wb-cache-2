50|$|As {{with the}} SPP-1 {{the first stage}} of the work was to develop a {{cartridge}}. A 5.45 mm by 39 mm cartridge was lengthened by about 115 mm to fit the sharp-fronted steel bolt. Another cartridge version was designed that contained a miniature rocket, which when fired makes a visible streak in the water. Next, Vladimir Simonov designed the rifle. The objective was ambitious; nobody had ever before tried to build a functioning automatic underwater firearm. The most important problem was designing a receiver that could work under water. Compared to air, water is relatively incompressible, so the structure had to let water move around easily; as a result, its receiver is open at the rear. Since it operates on the principle of gas discharge, it has a <b>gas</b> <b>controller</b> to let it work both underwater and on land.|$|E

Here, we use reactive sputter <b>gas</b> <b>controller</b> (Lambda sensor) to control oxygen partial pressure in the process, {{so that we can}} achieve the same sputtering plasma state during the process of sputtering aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films. At the same time, we use the intensity of Zn (470 nm) and O (780 nm) plasma emission peak signal to estimate the variation of the sputtering plasma state at different Lambda sensor value. In this experiment, AZO thin films are also prepared by pulse reactive magnetron sputtering on CORNING Eagle 2000 glasses. High purity metallic Zn-Al (Al 2 wt. %) alloy target and oxygen are used as source materials. The microstructure and surface morphology, optical and electrical properties of AZO films with various substrate temperatures are investigated in detail. Sputtering plasma state affects the properties of sputtering AZO thin films.

40|$|The {{composition}} and microstructure of the sensing electrode {{are the key}} parameters that influence the sensing mechanism, and hence key sensor performance parameters: sensitivity, selectivity and response time. During this reporting period we investigated the effect of microstructure and the fundamental heterogeneous gas solid interactions of our NO sensor electrode material. In order to optimize the sensor electrode microstructure, powders were prepared using four different powder synthesis routes, resulting in different particle sizes distributions and BET surface areas. Different electrode processing conditions, e. g. screen-printing slurry composition, sintering schedule, etc. were also applied.

Chemical composition, density, and layer thickness of the layers were determined by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS).

Hydrogen charging for 5 hours under pressure of 1 bar and at temperature of 300 °C results in granulation of the surface. Hydrogen depth profile was determined using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and nuclear Reaction Analysis (N- 15 method), using a 15 N beam at and above the resonance energy of 6. 417 MeV. NRA measurements proved a higher hydrogen concentration in samples with partially covered top layers, than in samples without palladium.

40|$|Abstract—As {{microelectronics}} device feature sizes {{continue to}} shrink and wafers {{continue to increase}} in size, {{it is necessary to}} have tighter tolerances during the fabrication process to maintain high yields. Feedback control has, therefore, become an important issue in plasma processing equipment design. Compre-hensive plasma equipment models linked to control algorithms would greatly aid in the investigation and optimal selection of control strategies. This paper reports on a numerical plasma simulation tool, the Virtual Plasma Equipment Model (VPEM), which addresses this need to test feedback control strategies and algorithms on plasma processing equipment. The VPEM is an extension of the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model which has been augmented by sensors and actuators, linked together through a programmable controller. The sensors emulate experimental measurements of species densities, fluxes, and energies, while the actuators change process parameters such as pressure, inductive power, capacitive power, electrode voltages, and mole fraction of <b>gases.</b> <b>Controllers</b> were designed using a response surface based methodology. Results are presented from studies in which these controllers were used to compensate for a leak of N 2 into an Ar discharge, to stably control drifts in process parameters such as pressure and power in Ar and Ar/Cl 2, and to nullify the effects of long term changes in wall conditions in Cl 2 containing plasmas.

Both valves have electro-hydraulic actuators which are operated via two hardware outputs to the two coils of the electro-hydraulic actuators. Undesirable compressor operation is prevented via the compressor pressure ratio limit controller (also known as π controller). The function of the cool air limit controller is to rule out mode of operations, which leads to inadequate flow of cooling air to the turbine blades. The system exhausted temperature is being controlled by the IGVs by varying the air mass flow into the combustion chamber. Exhausted temperature is measured immediately downstream of the gas turbine via 24 triple-element thermocouples (MBA 26 CT 101 A/B/C to MBA 26 CT 124 A/B/C) placed around the surroundings of the exhaust diffuser.
