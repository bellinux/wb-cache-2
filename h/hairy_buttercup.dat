50|$|Over 300 higher {{plants have}} been found at the site; {{highlights}} include common broomrape(Orobanche minor), <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus sardous) and common spotted orchid(Dactylorhiza fuchsii).|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} an {{important}} wildlife site - owls, yellowhammers, whitethroats, turtle dove, song thrush, nightingales and bullfinches can be seen. There are also many wild plants such as corn mint, <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup,</b> sea aster and ox-eye daisy.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} created by the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) in 1994, after a survey {{identified}} rare and unusual plant species in the area, some presumed carried in by shipping, such as <b>Hairy</b> <b>Buttercup</b> (Ranunculus sardous), Walthamstow Cress, and Unreelâ€™s Wormwood.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} grassland, marsh, scrub and woodland. It has a diverse bird life, such as yellowhammers, whitethroats, song thrushes and short-eared owls. There are also winter {{visitors}} including black-tailed godwits, grey plovers and turnstones. Plants include corn mints and <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercups,</b> {{and there is}} a wide variety of invertebrates. The grassland is grazed to prevent the vegetation from becoming too coarse.|$|R
50|$|Quarries, {{gravel and}} sand pits, roads and railways, field boundaries, walls, waste ground and rubbish tips contain such plant species as common ragwort, {{pineapple}} weed, <b>hairy</b> bindweed, creeping <b>buttercup,</b> common daisy, catsear, coltsfoot, fat hen, nettle, redshank, germander speedwell, ivy-leaved toadflax, rosebay willowherb, great willowherb and wall pennywort.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is mainly}} grazing marshes, {{but there are}} also areas of rough grassland, saltmarsh, seawalls and reedbed. Flowering plants include <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup,</b> knotted hedge-parsley and the nationally rare least lettuce. There are {{breeding}} birds such as Corn buntings and yellow wagtails.|$|E
50|$|Ranunculus sardous is {{a species}} of {{buttercup}} known by the common name <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup.</b> It is native to Europe {{and it can be}} found in many other areas of the world, including parts of the United States and Australia, as an introduced species and a roadside and lawn weed. It grows in many types of disturbed habitat, especially in moist areas. It is an annual or biennial herb producing a mostly erect, hairy stem up to half a meter tall. The hairy leaves are usually divided into three leaflets which are borne on petioles a few centimeters in length. The flower has usually five yellow petals each up to a centimeter long and five reflexed sepals. The fruit is an achene borne in a spherical cluster of up to 35.|$|E
5000|$|Porthloo Beach faces west - {{there are}} two tidal islets called Taylor's Island and Newford Island which are {{to the north and}} south of the beach respectively. At the top of the beach is a small remnant sand dune system with the grassy area behind used for boat {{standing}} and repairs. Due to the disturbance <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus sardous), along with other arable weeds appear here in one of its few sites on Scilly, and the only known site for wall-rue (Asplenium ruta-muraria) in the Isles of Scilly is just to the south. [...] Porthloo is within an Area of Outstanding Beauty, is a Geological Conservation Review site and was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1996. The 0.66 ha site is notified for a succession of Quaternary sediments listed below with youngest {{at the top of the}} list: ...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether converting to organic farming increases weed problems, a trial at Massey University in New Zealand split a dairy farm in half, with one half farmed conventionally for 10 {{years and the}} other half farmed using organic principles. Weed populations in selected paddocks of each farmlet were studied for 8 years to determine how these populations would differ between the two systems. After 10 years, weed problems differed little between the two farmlets. Both still had broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius L.) and <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup</b> (Ranunculus sardous Crantz) as their main weed species. Weeds were most noticeable in pastures in the year following regrassing activities for either farmlet, but being unable to use glyphosate during seed-bed preparation or use selective herbicides after sowing of new swards, meant weeds were sometimes worse in organic pastures after resowing than in conventional pastures. These weed problems were dealt with over the first few years after resowing by good grazing management, and ensuring pastures were dense once the annual species <b>hairy</b> <b>buttercup</b> had flowered and died, thus minimising any further establishment. Re- sults from the trial suggest that weeds need not be an impediment to organic dairying. falseThe full proceedings is available at: [URL]...|$|E
