50|$|He {{represented}} Wales at both under-19 and under-21 levels. Evans {{made his}} Celtic League debut against Munster {{as a replacement}} in September 2005 He also made his Heineken Cup debut against Leicester. He made his debut for Wales in June 2006, playing in two Tests against Argentina, scoring a try in the first game. Evans {{then went on to}} start 3 of Wales' 4 matches in the 2006 Autumn internationals including the match against New Zealand. He was due to make his comeback from long term injury versus the Pumas in a World Cup warm-up game in Cardiff but suffered a further setback, <b>damaging</b> his <b>collar</b> bone.|$|R

The shaft was then carried to 2,250 ft where the lode was intersected, but it was not payable. An {{explosion}} of dynamite of Christmas Day 1896 <b>damaged</b> the shaft <b>collar</b> throwing 30 men out of work. An underlie shaft had been driven to 2,615 ft but no payable ore was found and operations were suspended in 1904 due to difficulty in ventilating the shafts.|$|R
40|$|Identity theft {{occurs when}} key {{personal}} data, such as Social Security, driver’s license, and financial account numbers, are procured by unauthorized parties {{and used to}} impersonate the victim to fraudulently access cash or credit, and purchase goods and/or services. Reports of identity theft are almost doubling every year. It {{is one of the}} most <b>damaging</b> white <b>collar</b> crimes that can be committed, and it can take years for the victim to recover. Hardly a week passes without a news story about theft of personal data from a database on the Internet. These thefts create large losses in goods and services, and major embarrassment due to public knowledge that an organization’s system security was breached. Financial transactions on the Internet are becoming more commonplace. Savvy consumers are learning to look for the closed-lock icon at the bottom of their browser screen as an indication that encryption is in use prior to placing orders on a favorite web site. More services that contain personal data are moving to the Internet. Companies and government agencies are routinely outsourcing payroll, as well as benefits...|$|R
2500|$|Celtic manager Willie Maley {{sent his}} chief scout, Steve Callaghan, {{to watch the}} Denbeath Star goalkeeper but instead {{came back with a}} rave review about Thomson. After playing against Denbeath Star on 20 October 1926, Celtic signed, 17-year-old, Thomson for £10. On 5 February, Celtic beat Brechin City 6–3, Maley was {{concerned}} by the fact his first choice 'keeper, Peter Shevlin, had conceded three soft goals. He then decided to give, 18-year-old, Thomson a chance in the next game, which was against Dundee. He kept his place in the team after this match, and helped Celtic to finish second in the Scottish First Division. He also played in Celtic's 1927 Scottish Cup Final victory, as they beat East Fife 3–1. The following season, after an Old Firm match where Celtic played against their rivals Rangers at Ibrox Park. Thomson received widespread praise from the press following an [...] "immense" [...] performance. On 5 February 1930, Thomson was seriously injured in a game against Airdrieonians. He broke his jaw, fractured several ribs, <b>damaged</b> his <b>collar</b> bone, and lost two teeth when making a diving save. On 11 April 1931, Thomson won the second medal of his career as Celtic beat Motherwell 4–2 in the 1931 Scottish Cup Final. The first match had finished in a 2–2 draw and over 105,000 spectators watched the replay at Hampden Park.|$|R
50|$|Muse's rocket then docks with a 'Cryo Module' that is housing {{hundreds}} {{of people in a}} state of cryogenic suspension, which is revealed in the extended version of the video. It could be speculated that Muse's mission is to populate their destination planet. The spacecraft and its attached module enter a hyperdrive-like wormhole. The ship eventually exits into an asteroid field above an orange planet. The pilot (Bellamy) steers the ship to avoid colliding with the asteroids but ends up failing to completely avoid an especially large one. The cryo module collides with it, <b>damaging</b> the docking <b>collar</b> and sending them somewhat out of control. The cryo module is detached, and the spacecraft gains speed as it enters the orange planet's atmosphere. The brakes on the ship fail, and they crash, sliding a very large distance from the incredible speed. Muse is next seen standing on a cliff, looking out over a large landscape. As the camera zooms out, the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben in London can be seen, completely in ruin buried beneath large collections of dirt and sand. It can be speculated that they are the last remaining survivors on the planet, however, the final shot of the detached Cryo Module drifting in space implies that the last surviving humans are actually those left frozen inside, ending the video on a darkly ironic note.|$|R
40|$|Pruning {{trials in}} young alder stands were sampled to {{evaluate}} response to pruning. Effects of pruning (1) live branches on different dates, and (2) dead branches {{with or without}} <b>damaging</b> the branch <b>collar</b> were assessed on trees pruned in 3 - and 6 -year-old plantations, respectively. Six years after pruning, stem sections were collected and dissected in the longitudinal-radial plane to expose {{the center of the}} stem and branch stub. Ring counts and linear measurements were made for various boundaries or points, including time of pruning, stub length, defect, and beginning of clear wood formation. Pruning during the growing season and, to a lesser extent, late in the growing season when leaf abscission was beginning, resulted in shorter times and distances to formation of clear wood (2. 1 years, 14. 5 mm) than pruning in the dormant season or just prior {{to the beginning of the}} growing season (2. 6 years, 18. 6 mm). Cutting the branch collar on dead branches led to shorter times and distances to clear wood (2. 8 years, 21. 9 mm) than intentionally avoiding such wounding (3. 5 years, 24. 8 mm); these differences were associated with shorter branch stubs as there were no differences in the amount of defect. Epicormic branching was minimal in the two pruning studies, averaging less than one branch per tree in the date of pruning test and only two branches per tree in the branch collar wounding study. Assessments for comparable unpruned trees indicated that times to form clear wood after branch death would be markedly greater and that epicormic branching was equal to or greater than that determined for pruned trees. Although statistically significant differences occurred among different pruning dates and with branch collar wounding, the decision to prune or not prune is of much greater practical importance, regardless of when (date) or how it is done. Such pruning decisions can be made by using this information on time and distance to clear wood in economic analyses developed with available data on tree growth, log volume, lumber recovery, pruning costs, and price differentials for clear vs. knotty wood...|$|R
3000|$|Several {{studies on}} logging damage have {{highlighted}} {{that a number}} of factors affect the susceptibility to and effect of mechanical injury. These include the following: tree species (Bettinger and Kellogg 1993; Vasiliauskas 2001), silvicultural treatment (Bettinger et al. 1998), logging season (Limbeck-Lilienau 2003), logging methods (Bragg et al. 1994; Spinelli et al. 2010; Marchi et al. 2014), harvesting system (Han and Kellogg 2000), site characteristics (Sist et al. 2003), amount of timber removed during harvest (Fjeld and Granhus 1998; [...] Gullison and Hardner 1993), design of the extraction trails (Gullison and Hardner 1993), and skill of the personnel operating the equipment (Wallentin 2007; Nikooy et al. 2010). The effect of damage on tree growth has been also investigated showing contrasting results. Some studies clearly indicated that growth losses occur in damaged trees, and in some cases, these can seriously offset the gains from harvesting (Vasiliauskas 2001). Shea (1961) recorded a reduction in diameter growth in injured Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco). Isomäki and Kallio (1974) verified a decrease by 35 – 40  % in both radial and height growth in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) trees with root <b>collar</b> <b>damage</b> following logging and a 15  % reduced growth due to stem damage. Other studies showed stem wounds in Norway spruce may result in growth rate losses ranging from 14 to 25  % (Baader 1956; Vanek 1957). In contrast, Vasiliauskas and Stenlid (2007) recorded an increase in radial growth in injured stems of ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.). Finally, a number of investigations failed to reveal any significant effect of stem wounds on the increment of Norway spruce (Vasiliauskas 1994), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Srag.) (Shea 1961), oak (Quercus robur L.) (Vasiliauskas 1998) and Corsican pine Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanniivar. corsicana (Loudon) Hylander (as Pinus laricio Poiret) (Picchio et al. 2011). It is difficult, therefore, to make a general conclusion on what effect mechanical stem damage has on tree growth (Vasiliauskas 2001). Also, most of the studies on this topic are quite dated, mainly related to conifer species and, most importantly, approach the effect of damage on tree growth taking into consideration the effect of damage caused by animals rather than logging. Studies on this topic are still limited, especially in broadleaved stands, and the long-term effects of damage are not well known (Mäkinen et al. 2007). In order to improve logging methods, a better knowledge about the long-term impact of forest operations is needed (Whitman et al. 1997; Tavankar and Bonyad 2014).|$|R
