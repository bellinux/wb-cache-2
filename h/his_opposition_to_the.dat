5|$|King {{began to}} speak of the need for {{fundamental}} changes in the political and economic life of the nation, and more frequently expressed <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct racial and economic injustice.|$|E
5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed {{the character of the}} hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E
5|$|Citing the {{potential}} infringements on individual rights, {{former governor of}} California Ronald Reagan voiced <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proposition, as did Governor Jerry Brown and President Jimmy Carter, the latter in an afterthought following a speech he gave in Sacramento. On November 7, 1978, the proposition lost {{by more than a}} million votes, astounding gay activists on election night. In San Francisco, 75 percent voted against it.|$|E

5|$|His {{first major}} task was the {{creation}} of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the matter, with Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams as the Army representatives. Blamey supported the creation of a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Navy's demand that Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble become its first chief.|$|E
5|$|However, Lauderdale was disliked for <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> popular Queen Caroline, {{which became}} a {{significant}} issue in the campaign. His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as too close to Liverpool's Tory ministry to properly represent interests of the borough. After four days of polling, Balfour lost by 9 votes (374—363) to the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake.|$|E
5|$|Momchil {{achieved}} initial successes against Turks and Byzantines alike, setting Turkish ships on {{fire and}} almost managing to kill one of his main opponents at the time, John VI Kantakouzenos. Despite this, he was defeated and killed by a joint Byzantine–Turkish army in 1345. Due to <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Turks, he is remembered in popular South Slavic legend as a fighter against the Turkish invasion of the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in 2001, Bush stated <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kyoto Protocol, an {{amendment}} to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the world's population and would have cost {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|After his {{appearance}} on Jeopardy!, Chu contacted publicists and PR firms {{to ask for}} {{suggestions on how to}} monetize the recognition from his Jeopardy! run. However, he found the proposals unappealing, and did not follow suggestions that he use the 'successful game theorist' image. Instead, he started writing a column for The Daily Beast, and later for Salon. Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture and on being Asian American. He is a vocal critic of racism and online bullying, and is known for <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gamergate movement.|$|E
5|$|Chapman left Portland in 1853 for Fort Umpqua in Southern Oregon. There he {{engaged in}} cattle {{ranching}} while keeping his Portland law practice. He {{served as a}} lieutenant colonel in the militia during the Rogue River War that was fought from 1855 to 1856 against the Native Americans in Southern Oregon. After the war he returned to Corvallis in 1856 before moving to Eugene in 1857. Chapman was appointed as surveyor general of Oregon and served from 1857 to 1861 {{when he returned to}} Portland. He left this federal government position due to <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President. Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state in 1859.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} in the native community, White was portrayed negatively in the English-language press in his lifetime and in the published histories after his death. As a consequence of <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> powers that overthrew the monarchy and later annexed the islands to the United States, White remains obscure in Hawaiian history. Recent research efforts in Hawaiian academia using Hawaiian language sources have shed more light on White and many other early Native Hawaiian resistant leaders like him.|$|E
5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The canons of the {{foundation}} that administered the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} Muslim {{support for}} Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature {{as the political}} leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|Winchelsey further irritated Edward with <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bishop of Lichfield, Walter Langton, {{who was the}} king's treasurer. The {{king was}} not the only one to be upset by the archbishop; the abbot of Oseney, in 1297, was so {{affected}} by a rebuke from him that he suffered a fatal heart attack. In 1299, Winchelsey and the king briefly reconciled, and the archbishop presided at the king's second marriage, to Margaret of France, at Canterbury. Winchelsey vigorously asserted his authority over his suffragan, or subordinant bishops, quarrelled with Pope Boniface VIII over a Sussex living, and was excommunicated by one of the pope's clerks in 1301. He was absolved in 1302.|$|E
5|$|During the West Virginia Democratic Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia Democratic Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the national Democratic Party {{as part of its}} 1888 platform. White had been among the first Democratic Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's Democratic delegation was the first Democratic county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal policies. As the county executive committee chairman, White was the first Democrat in Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies. By 1897, White had participated as a delegate from Hampshire County to most of the Senatorial and Congressional Democratic Party conventions in West Virginia, and every state Gubernatorial convention with the exception of one.|$|E
5|$|Her {{daughter}} Ursula {{married the}} son of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham's fall after arguments with the king over property, and Margaret's open support for Catherine of Aragon and Princess Mary began the Poles' estrangement from the king. Hope of reconciliation was dashed by De unitate, the letter that Margaret's son Reginald Pole wrote to Henry VIII, in which Reginald declared <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal supremacy. In 1538 evidence came to light that Pole family members in England had been in communication with Reginald. Margaret's sons Geoffrey and Henry were arrested for treason along with several friends and associates, including Henry's wife and brother-in-lawEdward Neville. Among those arrested was the king's cousin Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, his wife and 11-year-old son. Courteney's wife was released two years later, but their son spent 15 years in the Tower until Queen Mary released him. Except for the surviving Geoffrey Pole, all the others implicated were beheaded.|$|E
25|$|Cardin {{opposed the}} 2016 sale of {{approximately}} 26,000 assault rifles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national police of <b>the</b> Philippines. <b>His</b> <b>opposition</b> led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. State Department halting the sale.|$|R

5|$|In 1831, Owsley {{returned}} to the state legislature, where he served until Governor Morehead appointed him {{secretary of state in}} 1834. He resumed his legal practice in 1836 and in 1843, retired from that profession. The next year, he was nominated for governor on the Whig ticket and defeated William O. Butler in the general election. Through fiscally conservative policies, he was able to reduce the state's debt. In spite of <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican-American War, large numbers of Kentucky's citizens volunteered for military service. Owsley's popularity declined sharply when he attempted to remove Benjamin Hardin as Secretary of State. Hardin successfully challenged his removal in court, then resigned in protest of Owsley's actions and charged him with practicing nepotism in his appointments. After his term as governor, Owsley never again sought public office. He died December 9, 1862 and was buried in Belleview Cemetery in Danville, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Capuano {{was elected}} to the Somerville Board of Aldermen {{representing}} Ward 5, once served in by his father. Capuano served one term, stepping down in 1979 to run for Mayor of Somerville. In the 1979 mayoral election he faced Eugene Brune, Paul Haley, and incumbent, Thomas August. He lost the nomination to Brune, who went on to defeat August. Capuano ran again in 1981 to challenge Brune, placing second in a three-person runoff election. Capuano promoted <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state ballot question Proposition 2½ and criticized Brune for expanding the mayoral staff in the face of tight city budgets, while Brune touted his prevention of service cuts after the proposition passed. Capuano lost in the general election with 40% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, {{and with}} peace {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, he started assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's {{decision to go to}} war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced by the arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890, Maurras {{approved}} Cardinal Lavigerie's {{call for}} the rallying of Catholics <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic, making <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic in itself but to [...] "sectarian Republicanism".|$|R
50|$|The {{next stage}} in Academic {{skepticism}} was the moderate skepticism of Carneades, {{which he said}} owed its existence <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> Chrysippus, <b>the</b> Stoic. Carneades {{is the most important}} of the Academic skeptics.|$|R
50|$|According <b>to</b> some sources, <b>the</b> {{pressure}} brought <b>to</b> bear on Mikhail Gutseriev by the Russian {{power structure}} {{was a result}} of <b>his</b> financial <b>opposition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current president of Ingushetia, Murat Zyazikov.|$|R
