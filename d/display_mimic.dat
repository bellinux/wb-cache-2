To address these issues, in 2001 Peterson Tuners added a line of non-mechanical electronic strobe tuners that have LCD dot-matrix <b>displays</b> <b>mimicking</b> a mechanical strobe disc display, giving a stroboscopic effect. In 2004 Peterson made a model of LCD strobe in a sturdy floor based [...] "stomp box" [...] for live on-stage use. Virtual strobe tuners are as accurate as standard mechanical disc strobe tuners. However, there are limitations to the virtual system compared to the disc strobes. Virtual strobes display fewer bands to read note information, and do not pick up harmonic partials like a disc strobe. Rather, each band on a virtual strobe represents octaves of the fundamental. A disc strobe provides [...] "one band correspondence"—each band displays a particular frequency of the note being played. On the virtual strobe system, each band combines a few close frequencies for easier reading on the LCD. This is still extremely accurate for intoning and tuning most instruments—but, as of this writing, no virtual strobe tuner provides detailed information on partials.|$|R

40|$|Disruptive {{colouration}} is {{a visual}} camouflage composed of false edges and boundaries. Many disruptively camouflaged animals feature enhanced edges; light patches {{are surrounded by}} a lighter outline and/or a dark patches are surrounded by a darker outline. This camouflage is particularly common in amphibians, reptiles and lepidopterans. We explored the role that this pattern has in creating effective camouflage. In a visual search task utilising an ultra-large <b>display</b> area <b>mimicking</b> search tasks that might be found in nature, edge enhanced disruptive camouflage increases crypsis, even on substrates that do not provide an obvious visual match. Specifically, edge enhanced camouflage is effective on backgrounds both with and without shadows; i. e. this is not solely due to background matching of the dark edge enhancement element with the shadows. Furthermore, when the dark component of the edge enhancement is omitted the camouflage still provided better crypsis than control patterns without edge enhancement. This kind of edge enhancement improved camouflage on all background types. Lastly, we show that edge enhancement can create a perception of multiple surfaces. We conclude that edge enhancement increases the effectiveness of disruptive camouflage through mechanisms that may include the improved disruption of the object outline by implying pictorial relief...|$|R
40|$|The {{feedback}} of biodiversity on individual trait variation is a poorly explored mechanistic pathway in ecological research. We analysed {{the relationship between}} biodiversity and individual performance by focusing on vocal mimicry, a widespread interaction that may serve in intra- and interspecific communication. We studied the songs of two lark species (genus Galerida) that increase the complexity of their song <b>displays</b> by <b>mimicking</b> other birds, and analysed the influence of bird species richness on individual song performance. The diversity of mimicked species and the prevalence of mimicry increased in areas characterized by great α and γ diversity (i. e. where larks experience more diverse encounters with community members, many of them being highly vocal owing to breeding). Conversely, the variability in species-specific song components peaked where larks were abundant, probably matching the complexity of conspecific social milieu. Some trade-offs existed between homo- and heterospecific complexity, suggesting that larks could change from population- to community-driven song variation by tracking {{the composition of the}} auditory environment. Mimicry, which serves communication with conspecifics or predators, may mediate interactions, ultimately cascading to aspects of ecological diversity other than those promoting its complexity.

Current displays echo first-generation hemodynamic monitors dating to the 1970 s and have not kept pace with new insights into physiology or the needs of clinicians who must make progressively more complex decisions about their patients. The effectiveness of any redesign must be tested before deployment. Tools that compare current displays with novel presentations of processed physiologic data are required. Regenerating conventional physiologic displays from archived physiologic data is an essential first step. OBJECTIVES: The purposes {{of the study were}} to (1) describe the SSSI (single sensor single indicator) paradigm that is currently used for physiologic signal displays, (2) identify and discuss possible extensions and enhancements of the SSSI paradigm, and (3) develop a general approach and a software prototype to construct such "extended SSSI displays" from raw data. RESULTS: We present Multi Wave Animator (MWA) framework-a set of open source MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) scripts aimed to create dynamic visualizations (eg, video files in AVI format) of patient vital signs recorded from bedside (intensive care unit or operating room) monitors.

The sporocyst grows into long tubes to form swollen [...] "broodsacs" [...] filled with tens to hundreds of cercariae. These broodsacs invade the snail's tentacles (preferring the left, when available), causing a brilliant transformation of the tentacles into a swollen, pulsating, colorful <b>display</b> that <b>mimics</b> {{the appearance of a}} caterpillar or grub. The broodsacs seem to pulsate in response to light intensity, and in total darkness do not pulse at all. The infection of the tentacles of the eyes seems to inhibit the perception of light intensity. Whereas uninfected snails seek dark areas to prevent predation, infected snails have a deficit in light detection, {{and are more likely to}} become exposed to predators, such as birds. In a study done in Poland, 53% of infected snails stayed in more open places longer, sat on higher vegetation, and stayed in better lit places than uninfected snails. Only 28% of the uninfected snails remained fully exposed for the duration of the observation period. Birds are the definitive hosts where the cercariae develop into adult distomes in the digestive system of the bird. These adult forms sexually reproduce and lay eggs that are released from the host via the bird's excretory system.

Based on its occurrence in plants and chemical characteristics, MLG has primarily {{been associated with}} the regulation of cell wall expansion due to its high and transient accumulation in young, expanding tissues. The Cellulose synthase-like F (CslF) subfamily of glycosyltransferases has previously been implicated in mediating the biosynthesis of this polymer. We confirmed that the rice (Oryza sativa) CslF 6 gene mediates the biosynthesis of MLG by overexpressing it in Nicotiana benthamiana. Rice cslf 6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development. However, cslf 6 mutants display a drastic decrease in MLG content (97 % reduction in coleoptiles and virtually undetectable in other tissues). Immunodetection with an anti-MLG monoclonal antibody revealed that the coleoptiles and leaves retain trace amounts of MLG only in specific cell types such as sclerenchyma fibers. These results correlate with the absence of endogenous MLG synthase activity in mutant seedlings and 4 -week-old sheaths. Mutant cell walls are weaker in mature stems but not seedlings, and more brittle in both stems and seedlings, compared to wild type.

40|$|Advanced display design, such as Ecological Interface Design (EID), makes {{extensive}} use of complex graphical objects. Research has shown that by following EID methodologies, supervisory operators have better performance with the EID displays (Pawlak and Vicente, 1996). However, past research does not consider the visual aspects of the graphical objects used in EID. Of particular interest is how different design decisions of graphical objects affect {{the performance of the}} objects used within that design. This thesis examines the visual sensitivity of dynamic graphical objects by examining features that make certain graphical objects visually superior for certain monitoring tasks. Previous research into the visual aspects of supervisory control with respect to emergent features, psychophysics and attention were considered in the investigation of the visual sensitivities of the dynamic graphical objects used. Research into static graphical objects, combined with prior work on emergent features has been merged to find emergent features that best show changes in dynamic graphical objects for the monitoring tasks investigated. It was found that for simple dynamic objects such as bars and polygon objects, a line changing in angle was the most noticeable emergent feature to show a departure from ?normal? state. For complex graphical objects, those target-indicator <b>displays</b> that <b>mimic</b> a ?bull?s eye? when at the target value should be used for displays that show observers when a target value has been reached. Abrupt changes in shape should be used in trend meters to show when variables or processes have changed direction. Finally, ?solid objects? that make use of vertical lines and shading should be used for comparison meters that compare two values and keep them in a particular ratio. These findings provide guidance for designers of dynamic advanced graphical displays by encouraging the consideration of visual aspects of graphical objects, as well as prescribing graphical objects that should be used in the types of tasks investigated...|$|R

However, any model of the MHC's physiological role in controlling T cell differentiation and function {{must be able to}} explain why the mature animal possesses such a high frequency of lymphocytes reactive to the MHC alloantigens of its own species; this appears to be at least an order of magnitude greater than that of self-MHC-restricted clones specific for any one individual antigen (6 - 8). One possible explanation for these findings is to postulate that MHC alloantigens, either alone (9) or in some form of association with other cell surface components (10, 1 I), <b>display</b> structures that <b>mimic</b> the immunogenic determinants that are presented to the T cell system by certain combinations of foreign antigen and self-MHC molecule. Viewed in this way, an alloreactive response represents the sum of responses of a variety of antigenspecific immune T cells all fortuitously induced through cross-reactive epitope...|$|R
