Before 1806, there was not really a single Prussian state, but a multiplicity of states and provinces, mostly only held together by the single person of the king himself.

This double structure made any coordinated action difficult.

The protests culminated in a march that took place on 25 January 2011. Another march from Ierapetra to Iraklion followed on the same day, where over 2,500 people from and around the town, participated and showed their anger for the decision by the central government to close the hospital. Protests included occupation of the building where the <b>Decentralised</b> <b>Administration</b> is located and an outdoors theatrical play by the protestors.

The future Swedish defence will use multiple systems connected with high-speed networks for information sharing. Within this environment, the issue of administration of authorisation is crucial. SaabTech Systems and SICS have in collaboration developed a model and a prototype for <b>decentralised</b> <b>administration</b> of authorisations. The model is based on delegation of authorisations extended with a component to define constraints on delegations. This enables efficient <b>decentralised</b> <b>administration</b> that reflects the management structure of an organization in a natural way, {{at the same time}} as it maintains centralised control on the distribution of authorisations. All authorisations must fulfil constraints defined by their sources of authority. The source of authority may, for instance, define in advance how a certain authorisation can be distributed and used, in terms of whom and when it can be delegated. The model supports several schemes for revocation of authorization...|$|E

40|$|In {{a highly}} {{distributed}} computing environment, people frequently {{move from one}} place to another where the new system has no previous knowledge of them at all. Traditional access control mechanisms such as access matrix and RBAC depend heavily on central management. However, the identities and privileges of the users are stored and administered in different locations in distributed systems. How to establish trust between these strange entities remains a challenge. Many efforts have been made to solve this problem. In the previous work, the <b>decentralised</b> <b>administration</b> of trust is achieved through delegation which is a very rigid mechanism. The limitation of delegation is that the identities of the delegators and delegatees must be known in advance and the privileges must be definite. In this thesis, we present a new model for <b>decentralised</b> <b>administration</b> of trust: trust empowerment. In trust empowerment, trust is defined as a set of properties. Properties can be owned and/or controlled. Owners of the properties can perform the privileges denoted by the properties. Controllers of the properties can grant the properties to other subjects but cannot gain the privileges of the properties. Each subject has its own policy to define trust empowerment. We design the Mojoy tmst policy language that supports trust empowerment. We give the syntax, semantics and an XML implementation of the language. The Mojoy trust policy language is based on XACML, which is an OASIS standard. We develop a compliance checker for the language. The responsibility of the compliance checker is to examine the certificates and policy, and return a Boolean value to indicate whether the user's request is allowed. We apply our new model, the language and the compliance checker to a case study to show that they are capable of coping with the trust issues met in the distributed systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on horizontal tax interdependence pays limited attention to interactions in administrative policies, although {{they can play}} {{a large role in}} determining the amount of tax revenues collected. We investigate the incentives for sub-central tax authority cooperation in a decentralised context, with the aim of identifying the determinants of that cooperation. Our results are congruent with standard theory; in particular, the existence of reciprocity is essential for sharing tax information, but there is sluggishness in this process, which is partly the result of the short-sighted behaviour of tax authorities influenced by budget constraints. Hence, this is good news for the functioning of a <b>decentralised</b> tax <b>administration</b> as, in the medium to long run, the gains to be made from sharing tax information are achieved...|$|R
40|$|The federal states' (and partly also unitary states' with <b>decentralised</b> <b>administrations)</b> {{advantages}} such {{as additional}} division {{of power and}} the better consideration of regional preferences and fallacies such as the trap of too strong entanglements of all levels of government are well discussed in comparison to unitary states. Since the Brundtland Report sustainable development is strongly advocated as a guiding principle for policy making. The capability of states to deal with this sustainability much depends on whether the appropriate level of state is commissioned to deal with the issues in question. Starting with discussion of the traditional arguments of the assignment of tasks to governmental levels in federal states the paper develops the new demands deriving from sustainability. The paper searches for useful and applicable criteria for the investigation of the appropriate governmental level taking into account the three thematic dimension of economy, ecology and social aspects - and the (fourth) dimension of monitoring and governance. Two dimensions need to be considered in order to identify the most appropriate level for political action: How are social, economic and environmental effects spatially spread? Which existing level and institutions of governance are available to deal with these issues and do these institutions cover the demands referring to the criteria developed {{in the first part of}} the paper? The criteria allow to distinguish better and worse distribution of competences but important are also the following conditions which need to be also evaluated: firstly, representatives of all governmental levels recognise the limits but also the potentials in dealing with specific tasks under the demands of sustainability, secondly, they are able to delegate if limitations are apparent, thirdly, they develop a cooperative attitude and appropriate institutional infrastructure to deal which tasks involving different governmental levels and fourthly, new policy models are taken into consideration which consult stakeholder without conflicting with democratic rules and foundations of states. ...|$|R

The purpose of this paper was to assess the effectiveness of these attempts in 14 Metropolitan and Municipal Assembles.

The analyses revealed that the legal provisions made room for social accountability but the weak capacity of Assembly Members in terms of resources, the understanding of legislative provisions, and the acceptability of the concept challenged its implementation. It is thus recommended that service provision in local communities should have capacity-building components that promote social accountability...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{relationship}} between the Angkorian Empire and its capital is important for understanding how this state was sustained. The empire’s political economy is studied by analysing data from Pre-Angkorian and Angkorian period inscriptions in aggregated form, in contrast to previous studies which relied mainly on detailed reading of the texts. The study is necessarily broad to overcome the constraints of having relatively few inscriptions which relate to a selected range of topics, and are partial in viewpoint. The success of the pre-modern Khmer state depended on: its long-established communication and trade links; mutual support of rulers and regional elites; <b>decentralised</b> <b>administration</b> through regional centres; its ability to produce or acquire a surplus of resources; and a network of temples as an ideological vehicle for state integration. The claim {{that there was a}} centrally controlled command economy or significant redistribution of resources, as for archaic, moneyless societies is difficult to justify. The mode of control varied between the core area and peripheral areas. Even though Angkor did not have money, it used a unit of account. Despite being an inland agrarian polity, the Khmer actively pursued foreign trade. There are indications of a structure, perhaps hierarchical, of linked deities and religious foundations helping to disseminate the state’s ideology. The establishment of these foundations was encouraged by gifts and privileges granted to elite supporters of the rulers. Contrary to some views, Angkor was not excessively rigid or unusually hierarchical and autocratic when compared with contemporary analogous states. Its political economy is marked by three simultaneous cycles indicative of changing power relationships: cycles of royal inscriptions; of non-royal inscriptions; and fluctuating control over peripheral territories. Its processes and strategies were sufficiently flexible for it to endure as an empire for approximately six centuries, despite internal and external disturbances...|$|E
40|$|In 1989 New Zealand {{embarked}} on {{the reform of}} its compulsory education sector. The resulting model, known as Tomorrow's Schools, <b>decentralised</b> <b>administration</b> and gave each individual school its own Board of Trustees responsible for managing the school's finances. Since then, the cost to parents for their children's compulsory education has increased considerably. This thesis examines schools' behaviour when requesting and collecting money from parents and caregivers, compliance of this behaviour with Ministry of Education policy and the changes over time in the amounts of money raised locally by schools. Schools' compliance with Ministry of Education policy is generally poor. Many schools do not tell parents that donations are voluntary and charge parents for items not allowed under Ministry policy, including photocopying, use of information technology equipment and subject fees for subjects which {{do not have a}} take home component. Costs to parents are lowest in small schools and rural schools. Larger primary schools request and collect more in donations from parents {{and are more likely to}} exclude children from participation because of non-payment, and this was consistent across decile groups. Parents with children in large/urban high-decile schools pay most. Secondary education is much more expensive to parents than is primary education and parents expressed concern about this and about children being excluded from curricular and extra-curricular activities because of parental inability to pay. In addition, compliance with Ministry policy appears to be lower in secondary schools. Decile-related funding has caused some higher-decile schools to conclude that government no longer fully funds them and they must raise additional money from parents. Schools turn to parent communities to make up any shortfall in funding, and there are indications of erosion in belief in the ideal of a free compulsory education...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{evaluates the}} design of India's Anti-poverty programmes. In recent years, successive Indian Governments have sought to improve the performance of these programmes by <b>decentralising</b> their <b>administration,</b> vesting village governments with greater responsibility for their monitoring and oversight. An academic literature hypothesises that socioeconomic divisions within villages and the weak political strength of the poor reduces the effectiveness of decentralised programmes since, under these conditions, elites are able to 'capture' funds intended for the poor. This paper argues {{that the effect of}} administrative decentralisation of poverty programmes and local public goods on the magnitude of benefits to the poor depends not just on their political strength but also on the incentives the non-poor have to improve the welfare of the poor. The design of policy pays insufficient attention to such incentive issues. Empirical analysis provides support for this belief. The regression analysis of the paper reveals that welfare receipts affect the labour supply decisions of the poor and that the implementation of welfare programmes under control of village governments takes these effects into account. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, China revised its Criminal Procedure Law (2012 CPL). One of {{the major}} changes is its {{official}} approval {{of the use of}} victim-offender reconciliation, or ‘criminal reconciliation’ in certain public prosecution cases. This change, on the one hand, echoes the Confucian doctrine that favours harmonious inter-personal relationships and mediation, while, on the other hand, it deviates from the direction of legal reforms dating from the 1970 s through the late 1990 s. Questions have emerged concerning not only the cause of this change in legal norms but also the proper position of criminal reconciliation in the current criminal justice system in China. The answers to these questions largely rely on understanding the role of traditional informal dispute resolution as well as its interaction with legal norms. Criminal reconciliation in ancient China functioned as a means to centralise imperial power by decentralizing <b>decentralising</b> its <b>administration.</b> Abolishing or enabling such a mechanism in law is merely {{a small part of the}} government’s strategy to react to political or social crises and to maintain social stability.
