50|$|Almanzor {{made his}} racecourse debut in a 1400-metre contest at La Teste-de-Buch on 28 July 2015. Ridden by Jean-Bernard Eyquem he won {{by one and}} a half lengths from Dream Dy. On 21 August he {{followed}} up with a three length win in a minor race over 1600 metres at Clairefontaine in which he was ridden by Christophe Soumillon. On 8 October the colt was moved up in class for the Listed Grand Criterium de Bordeaux and started odds-on favourite against five opponents. Ridden by Eyquem <b>he</b> <b>wo</b> by three lengths from his stablemate Camp Courage. Almanzor's final appearance of 2015 saw him stepped up to Group One level for the Criterium International over 1400 metres on very soft ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 1 November. He appeared outpaced in the closing stages and finished seventh of the eight runners behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Johannes Vermeer.|$|E

Major topics being studied under that project include problem solving, visual pattern recognit ion, computer represent at ions, quest ion answering, and system integrat ion The problem-solving research thus far has been based largely upon theorem-proving methods in t he first-order predicate calculus. Cont inued work is planned under the cited project on improving the eff iciency of exist ing t heorem-pro. ving techniques and increasing t heir usefulness in automaton problem-solving situat ions. As a by-product of this research, some ideas have recently been developed for a completely new formal mechanical theorem-proving system. This system would be based upon higher order logic and would emphasize the role of semantic information and of flexible control strategies. These ideas are {{beyond the scope of}} the main lines of research under the automaton project at this st age. However, a successful implement at ion of the proposed system would be of tremendous value in several research fields including automaton st udies. Therefore we are here proposing a major independent effort in the development of these new theorem-proving ideas. OBJECT I VE This proposal describes a program of research in the development and applicat ion of advanced formal theorem-proving techniques. The objective of the proposed work is to design and implement a computer program with general, powerful, and extremely flexible capabilities for bot h logical inference and data management. The proposed system would have several important potent ial uses, which can be explored as part of t <b>he</b> <b>wo</b> r k: (1) As a bBsis for &quot;question-answering systems &quot; large fact storage and inferent ial retrieval systems; (2) As a vehicle for research in automat ic problem sol ing in general, wit h special emphas is on the problem of automatically writing, verifying, and debugging computer programs; (3) As a problem-solving framework for use by the mobile automaton system being developed at SRI...|$|E

Volunteerin' is altogether a bad look-out. I know'd a feller, I did--a strappin' young feller he was, too, more betoken--as volunteered himself to death, he did. To be sure, his wos a case o' volunteerin' into the Louth Militia, and <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> shot, <b>he</b> <b>wos,</b> in a pop'lar riot, as the noosepapers said--a scrimmage, I calls it--so don't let any o' us be goin' for to volunteer opinions w'en nobody axes 'em--no, nor wants 'em." ...|$|R

Different times there was other genlmen come down Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin, but they all mostly sed as the t'other 'wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded to be a-talking to theirselves, or a-passing blame on the t'others, and not a-talkin to us.

6000|$|... 'I don't like it, Sam,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'I never know'd {{a respectable}} coachman as wrote poetry, 'cept one, as made an affectin' copy o' werses the night afore he was hung for a highway robbery; and <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> only a Cambervell man, so even that's no rule.' ...|$|R

'Nev'r mind, Sammy,' replied Mr. Weller, 'it'll be a wery agonisin' {{trial to}} me at my time of life, but I'm pretty tough, that's vun consolation, as the wery old turkey remarked wen the farmer said <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> afeerd <b>he</b> should be obliged to kill him for the London market.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Both,' replied Sam; 'easy shavin' was his natur', and cuttin' and curlin' was {{his pride}} and glory. His whole delight wos in his trade. He spent {{all his money}} in bears, and run in debt for 'em besides, and there they wos a {{growling}} avay down in the front cellar all day long, and ineffectooally gnashing their teeth, vile the grease o' their relations and friends wos being re-tailed in gallipots in the shop above, and the first-floor winder wos ornamented vith their heads; not to speak o' the dreadful aggrawation {{it must have been}} to 'em to see a man alvays a walkin' up and down the pavement outside, vith the portrait of a bear in his last agonies, and underneath in large letters, [...] "Another fine animal wos slaughtered yesterday at Jinkinson's!"

You must know, Ruby, that we've {{got what}} they calls an hoccasional light-keeper ashore, who larns the work out 'ere in case any of us reg'lar keepers are took ill, so as 'e can supply our place on short notice. Well, 'e was out 'ere larnin' the dooties one {{tremendous}} stormy night, an' the poor fellow was in a mortial fright for fear the lantern would be blowed right hoff the top o' the stone column, and 'imself along with it. You see, the door that covers the manhole there is usually shut when we're on watch, but Junk (we called 'im Junk 'cause <b>'e</b> <b>wos</b> so like a lump o' fat pork), 'e kep the door open all the time an' sat close beside it, {{so as to be}} ready for a dive. Well, {{it was my turn to}} watch, so I went up, an' just as I puts my fut on the first step o' the lantern-ladder there comes a sea like wot we had a minit ago; the wind at the same time roared in the wentilators like a thousand fiends, and the spray dashed agin the glass. Junk gave a yell, and dived. <b>He</b> thought it <b>wos</b> all over with 'im, and wos in sich a funk that he came down 'ead foremost, and would sartinly 'ave broke 'is neck if 'e 'adn't come slap into my buzzum!

6000|$|... "Ay, that wos {{more like}} it. Well, <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> {{about six feet}} two in his moccasins, an' as thin as a ramrod, an' as blind as a bat--leastways he had weak eyes an wore green spectacles. He had on a grey shootin' coat and {{trousers}} and vest and cap, with rid whiskers an' a long nose as rid at the point as the whiskers wos.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{more you}} did," [...] cried Rokens, who {{had listened to}} the {{narrative}} with suppressed delight; [...] "no more you did. I never see sich a glazed rat as you wos when you comed out o' that hole, in all my life; an' <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> jist like a eel; it wos all {{we could do to}} keep 'old on 'im, marm, he was so slippery." ...|$|R

You know, {{as well as}} I do, that <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> called Redhand by the Injuns in consekence o' the lot o' grislies he's {{killed in}} his day; but nobody never could git at his real name.

'I do mean that, Sammy,' replied his father, 'and I vish {{you could}} ha' seen how tight he held {{on by the}} sides wen he did get up, as if <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> afeerd o' being precipitayted down full six foot, and dashed into a million hatoms.

6000|$|... "Ay, an' seed 'im too," [...] said Burr. [...] "Night before {{yesterday}} I heer'd 'im as plain as I hear myself. <b>He</b> <b>wos</b> groanin', an' it's quite impossible that a tar-barrel, or a cask, or a rat, could groan. The {{only thing that}} puzzled me <b>wos</b> that <b>he</b> seemed to snore; more than that he sneezed once or twice. Now, I never heard it said that a ghost could sleep or catch cold. Did you, Polly?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dick roused {{him out of}} this {{resolute}} sleep, however, somewhat roughly. Meanwhile Joe had rubbed {{and kicked}} himself {{into a state of}} animation, exclaiming that he felt as if <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> walkin' on a thousand needles and pins, and in a few minutes they were ready to accompany their overjoyed deliverer back to the Peigan camp.

6000|$|... "`Now,' says I, `wot for are ye scraggin' {{this old}} man?'

'It must be somethin' wery {{uncommon}} indeed, {{as could}} perduce a letter out o' any friend o' mine,' replied Sam, {{shaking his head}} dubiously; 'nothin' less than a nat'ral conwulsion, as the young gen'l'm'n observed ven <b>he</b> <b>wos</b> took with fits. It can't be from the gov'ner,' said Sam, looking at the direction. 'He always prints, I know, 'cos he learnt writin' from the large bills in the booking-offices.

'Wait till she begins to boom, {{and then you just}} stand round.'
