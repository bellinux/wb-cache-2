40|$|The {{proliferation}} of new “big box ” retail superstores {{throughout the nation}} challenges city and county planning departments {{to find ways to}} mitigate the economic, social, and environmental damage they cause. Displacement of small, locally owned business, downward pressure on wages, increased fiscal burden, lower tax revenues, increased traffic congestion, stormwater runoff, sprawl, waste, and stress on power and water supplies are among the well documented <b>ills</b> associated <b>with</b> <b>big</b> box <b>construction</b> in communities throughout the United States (CLBBS 2005). Many of these impacts can be reduced through careful site selection, limitations on size, and environmental design (Beaumont and Tucker 2002). To demonstrate the effectiveness of such mitigation measures in the context of <b>big</b> box <b>construction</b> permit decisions planners need quantitative information linking these measures with a reduction in the overall impact of a new big box store. Moreover, big box retailers like Wal-Mart are now interested in ways they can offset their impacts and signal to their customer base that they are moving toward sustainable practices (NFWF 2005). Redefining Progress is developing its Big Box Calculator to meet these needs. The Big Box Calculator is a corporate variant of the Ecological Footprint pioneered b...|$|R

40|$|My {{exploratory}} research gave interesting insights about innovations {{and how they}} are influencing and changing human resources in Norwegian construction industry. To answer my research question and sub-questions, I have taken findings from interviews <b>with</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>construction</b> contractors in Norway and technology manufacturers while comparing received information with tendencies in other countries and behavior of innovation processes in other various industries. Research gave aggregated results and overview that the construction industry we are on the cusp of a Fourth industrial revolution. A development process involving of artificial intelligence algorithms, learning machines, robotic technologies in prefabrication factories and on project sites, real examples of 3 D printing promise a new wave of productivity and range of technological advantages in the construction industry. Together socio-economic, technological and demographic developments and changes will generate displacing of jobs and new categories of occupations. At the same time, it will change the skill sets required for old and new human occupations in industry and transform labor employment...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{construction}} in English, exemplified by {{how long a}} bridge, which is so irregular {{that it has been}} named the <b>Big</b> Mess <b>Construction,</b> see Berman (1974). This paper first sketches its main characteristics (section 1) and a treatment of the internal structure of the noun phrase which serves as a background for the analysis (section 2). It then presents three ways in which the <b>Big</b> Mess <b>Construction</b> can be analysed; two of them are lexicalist and are shown to be implausible; the third is constructivist and is argued to be superior (section 3). In a next step, the discussion is extended to two other types of constructions. The first concerns the English adnominal reflexives, as in the children themselves, and is shown to require a constructivist analysis which is similar but not identical to the one for the <b>Big</b> Mess <b>Construction</b> (section 4). The second concerns the combination of such and what with the indefinite article, as in such a pleasure. In spite of its obvious resemblance <b>with</b> the <b>Big</b> Mess <b>Construction</b> this combination does not require a constructivist analysis; instead, it fits the lexicalist mould of {{most of the rest of}} HPS...|$|R

60|$|I walked till dinner-time in the plain, {{keeping to}} the fields; for I instinctively shunned observation, and was racked by many incongruous and {{impatient}} feelings. Here {{was a man}} whose voice I had once heard, whose doings had filled so many {{days of my life}} with interest and distress, whom I had lain awake to dream of like a lover, and now his hand was on the door; now we were to meet; now I was to learn at last the mystery of the substituted crew. The sun went down over the plain of the Angelus, and as the hour approached my courage lessened. I let the laggard peasants pass me on the homeward way. The lamps were lit, the soup was served, the company were all at table, and the room sounded already with multitudinous talk before I entered. I took my place and found I was opposite to Madden. Over six feet high and well set up, the hair dark and streaked with silver, the eyes dark and kindly, the mouth very good-natured, the teeth admirable; linen and hands exquisite; English clothes, an English voice, an English bearing--the man stood out conspicuous from the company. Yet he had made himself at home, and seemed to enjoy a certain quiet popularity among the noisy boys of the table d'hôte. He had an odd silver giggle of a laugh that sounded nervous even when he was really amused, and accorded <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> his <b>big</b> stature and manly, melancholy face. This laugh fell in continually all through dinner like the note of the triangle in a piece of modern French music; and he had at times a kind of pleasantry, rather of manner than of words, with which he started or maintained the merriment. He took his share in these diversions, not so much like a man in high spirits, but like one of an approved good-nature, habitually self-forgetful, accustomed to please and to follow others. I have remarked in old soldiers much the same smiling sadness and sociable self-effacement.|$|R
