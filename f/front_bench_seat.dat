25|$|As in the {{previous}} generation, six passenger seating with a <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and column shifter was optional. Cloth seating was standard on base LX with leather seating optional. Leather was standard on upscale LXi and later Limited models.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} generation, the {{interior}} was not as customizable in the second generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. The second generation now used only a single seat design shared with all models (the first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and a column mounted shifter, or with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter. The console was a carryover from the first generation, although it was redesigned for 1993.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 the car gained {{rear light}} units from the Citroën Ami 6, and also {{standardised}} a third side {{window in the}} rear pillar on 2CV6 (602cc) models. From 1970, only two series were produced: the 2CV 4 (AZKB) with 435 cc and the 2CV 6 (Azka) with 602 cc displacement. All 2CVs from this date can run on unleaded fuel. 1970s cars featured rectangular headlights, except the Spécial model. In 1971 the <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> was replaced with two individual seats. In 1972 2CVs were fitted with standard three-point seat belts. In 1973 new seat covers, a padded single-spoke steering wheel and ashtrays were introduced.|$|E

5000|$|For the 2008 model year, power deployable/retractable {{running boards}} became available, {{along with a}} rear view backup camera system. The camera, which is mounted under the Expedition's center {{liftgate}} appliqué, utilizes the Gentex auto dimming rear view mirror's picture-in-mirror technology to display what it sees. Expedition King Ranch was also reintroduced after being absent from the 2007 model year trim line-up. Expedition XLT models now get body colored lower body work, replacing the previous black plastic trim and was the Last Ford Model Year for the nine-passenger <b>Front</b> <b>Bench</b> <b>seating</b> option in the Ford Full-Size SUV's from Ford Motor Company (Ford discontinued the 9-passenger <b>Front</b> <b>Bench</b> <b>Seating</b> Option for 2009 and Forward on the old Ford Full-Size SUVs 2009-present) ...|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the success}} of the Chrysler K-cars, the Dodge Aries and the Plymouth Reliant, was that by {{retaining}} <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seating</b> rather than adopting bucket seats usually fitted to compacts, they could still function as the six passenger cars they were designed to replace and compete against.|$|R
25|$|The similar Eagle Vision, {{featured}} a smaller split-grill {{with a large}} Eagle badge in the center. The Vision's taillights, although the same shape as the Concorde's were clustered differently and featured European-inspired amber turn signals. The Vision did not share the Concorde's lightbar, instead using the area as space for a trunk-mounted license plate (as opposed to rear bumper-mounted licence plate on the Concorde). On the other hand, the Intrepid incorporated very different headlight and taillight assemblies, and had no grille at all. The interior of the Concorde was also nearly identical to that the Vision, the main difference being the Concorde's faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem; the Intrepid's interior was substantially different from the Concorde and Vision. Concordes and Intrepids could be equipped with a <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and column shifter, bringing total capacity to six. The Vision could only be equipped with front bucket seats. Unlike its Dodge and Eagle siblings, Chrysler Concordes never {{had the option of}} autostick transmission and its special instrument cluster. It was only available with an automatic transmission.|$|E
2500|$|This generation's {{interior}} wasn't as configurable {{as that of}} {{the first}} two generations. The G and GL models (see below) were only available with steering column-mounted shifter, along with a cloth <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] center console. The LX, on the other hand, came standard with bucket seats that could be ordered with either cloth or leather upholstery, along with a center console and floor-mounted shifter. However, a column-mounted shifter and a cloth front bench was available as a no-cost option. In 1999, the interior was again available in three configurations, like that of the first-generation Taurus; a <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with a column-mounted shifter, front bucket seats with a center console and floor-mounted shifter, or front bucket seats with a center console and a column-mounted shifter.

Some models of this generation have the rare feature of a split <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with a column shifter. Another unique feature only found on the Grand Prix is the combination lock for the glove box, rather than a key. Grand Prix was Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 1988.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Oldsmobile {{models were}} {{completely}} redesigned with a rocket motif {{from front to}} rear, as {{the top of the}} front fenders had a chrome rocket, while the body-length fins were shaped as rocket exhausts which culminated in a fin-top taillight (concave on the 98 models while convex on the 88 models).

2500|$|This Taurus' {{interior}} {{was available in}} two configurations; a <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with a column mounted shifter and the Flip-Fold center console, or bucket seats with a traditional console and a floor mounted shifter. The configuration for a steering column mounted shifter and a center console, which made a brief return for 1999, had been dropped. The interior also contained many new safety features; side airbags, tether straps, and a glow in the dark trunk release mounted inside of the trunk. This interior also contained a new system which Ford called the [...] " [...] Advanced Personal Safety System". This system, {{at the time of}} a collision, would detect the driver and passenger's positions as well as seatbelt usage, and would inflate the airbags to match, possibly preventing airbag-related injuries.

2500|$|The Century was {{redesigned}} for {{the last}} time in 1997. The four-door sedan was the only body style offered (the station wagon was dropped due to decreasing sales), and was still a front wheel drive V6-powered configuration. Plainer [...] "Custom" [...] and fancier [...] "Limited" [...] trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. The 1997 redesign moved Centurys to the W-body platform, rejoining its former Regal sibling. In this generation, the Century and Regal were nearly the same car, distinguished only by seating configurations, trim, and engine differences. Since the Century was lower-priced than the Regal, it was also the lower-powered and plainer of the two, offering only a 3.1L V6. In keeping with its traditional image, the 6-passenger Century came equipped with a <b>front</b> <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and column shifter, while the more performance-oriented 5-passenger Regal came standard with front bucket seats and console shifter. After the 1998 discontinuation of the Skylark, the Century for the first time became Buick's entry-level car. Buick tried to position the Century as a lower-priced alternative to Japanese family sedans like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. However, it failed to compete with them and was instead widely viewed as a car designed for a geriatric target audience, an image not helped by the Century's assortment of senior citizen-friendly features like extra-large dashboard buttons and an extremely soft suspension. For 2003, all trim levels were eliminated, leaving one standard model. Additionally, the [...] "Century" [...] nameplate on the front doors was dropped, and only seen on the vehicle's taillights.|$|E
