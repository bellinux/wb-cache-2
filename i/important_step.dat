5|$|Among other innovations, {{the project}} {{developed}} DNA-marking methods which were an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> {{in making the}} Human Genome Project possible. In 1993, the research group isolated the precise causal gene at 4p16.3, making this the first autosomal disease locus found using genetic linkage analysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{automatic}} test pattern generation, finding cliques {{can help to}} bound {{the size of a}} test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller's conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.|$|E

5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in {{protection of minorities}} and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized {{that there are people}} living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Fort Mohave {{began the process}} of military subjugation of the Mohave, and {{the next step was}} the establishment of reservations. In 1863, Charles Debrille Poston, the first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Arizona Territory, called a conference between the Chemehuevi and Irataba's faction of the Mohave, in which he convinced them to form an alliance with the US against the Apache. The treaty was never ratified by the US Congress but formed an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in establishing friendly relations between the Mohave and the US government following the military campaigns and the establishment of Fort Mohave.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban.

5|$|A {{new edition}} of the soundtrack, Final Fantasy IV Original Soundtrack Remaster Version, was {{released}} by Square Enix on July 3, 2013. This version is expanded to two discs, allowing the tracks to play through two loops rather than just one, {{as well as the}} addition of a few short pieces that were left off of the original recording. Despite the name, the album features the original Super NES version of the music, rather than a more modern synthesizer sound. The album has the catalog number SQEX-10373~4, and its 57 tracks have a duration of 1:32:40. Joshua Bateman of RPGFan stated that while the remaster edition wasn't strictly necessary, given that Square Enix still sold the original version online, the new edition was still a superior version and an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in preserving classic video game music.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One <b>important</b> <b>step</b> was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|In 973, Dunstan's statesmanship {{reached its}} zenith when he officiated at the {{coronation}} of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned {{not as the}} initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken {{a great deal of}} preliminary diplomacy). This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle forms the basis of the present-day British coronation ceremony. There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an <b>important</b> <b>step,</b> as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.|$|E
5|$|In August of 14 his {{grandfather}} Augustus died. In his honor, Drusus read a eulogy before the rostra at his funeral. The next month, on 17 September, the senate met to confirm {{his father as}} princeps. Among his first acts as emperor, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of the cult of Augustus which members of the imperial family, such as Drusus, became a member of. This wasn't his first religious post though, {{as he had been}} a pontifex since AD 7/8 - an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> to the prestigious pontifex maximus. Since 14 May AD 14, {{he was a member of}} the Fratres Arvales as well.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{state control}} over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of nationalization, {{starting}} with the expropriation of British Petroleum's share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in December 1971. In September 1973, {{it was announced that}} all foreign oil producers active in Libya were to see 51% of their operation nationalized. For Gaddafi, this was an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> towards socialism. It proved an economic success; while gross domestic product had been $3.8 billion in 1969, it had risen to $13.7 billion in 1974, and $24.5 billion in 1979. In turn, the Libyans' standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of Gaddafi's administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like Italy and the U.K.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{sought to}} run a more {{efficient}} and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later. The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand {{the role of the}} U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the eventual development of the Justice Department. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of alkyl ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E

5|$|The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the {{development}} of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (chhajja), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified dravida outline. Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Malta {{returned}} {{control of the}} central Mediterranean to Britain and was an <b>important</b> <b>step</b> in the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801. An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought {{an end to the}} French Revolutionary War, was that the British leave Malta. Russian Tsar Alexander I had a long standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it be turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger flatly refused, and the Napoleonic Wars with France began soon afterwards, in part due to the failure of Britain to comply with this clause of the treaty. The island subsequently remained in British hands until its independence in 1964.|$|E
