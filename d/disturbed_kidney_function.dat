We describe a 19 -year-old woman who developed membranous glomerulonephritis after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Six months later, she developed soft palate, skin and liver lesions considered to be chronic GVHD. Fifteen months after undergoing BMT, this patient presented with nephrotic syndrome.

In the present study, we assessed levels of retinol, retinyl esters, retinol-binding protein (RBP) and THP in plasma and urine of dogs with a history of urolithiasis (n = 25) compared with clinically healthy controls (n = 18). Plasma retinol concentrations were higher in dogs with uroliths of struvit (P < 0. 01), calcium oxalate (P < 0. 05), urate (P < 0. 01) and cysteine, but there were no differences in the concentrations of plasma RBP and retinyl esters. Excretion of urinary retinol and retinyl esters were tentatively, but not significantly higher in the stone-forming groups, which was accompanied by increased levels of urinary RBP (P < 0. 01) and lower excretions in THP (P < 0. 01). The results show that VA deficiency may be excluded as a potential cause for canine urolithiasis. However, the occurrence of RBP and a concomitant reduction of THP in urine indicates a <b>disturbed</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> as cause or consequence of stone formation in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Background. The Epidemiological Study Air Disaster in Amsterdam (ESADA) {{aimed to}} assess {{long-term}} health effects in professional assistance workers {{involved in the}} 1992 air disaster in Amsterdam. As part of ESADA indications of nephrotoxicity due to exposure to uranium from the balance weights of the crashed aircraft were assessed. Methods. Data of a historically defined cohort of 2499 (exposed and non-exposed) firefighters, police officers and hangar workers were collected 8. 5 years after the disaster. Urinary uranium concentrations were determined by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Urine albumincreatinine ratio and fractional excretion of beta(2) -microglobulin were calculated from a single-spot urine specimen and simultaneous blood sample. Exposed assistance workers were compared with their non-exposed colleagues, and associations between uranium and kidney function parameters were explored. Results. Median uranium concentrations were around 2 ng/g creatinine. Median values of albumincreatinine ratio and fractional excretion of beta(2) -microglobulin were well below the level for microalbuminuria and for tubular damage, respectively. No {{statistically significant differences between}} exposed and non-exposed workers were found in uranium concentrations and kidney function parameters, although exposed hangar workers had lower uranium concentrations. No statistically significant associations were found between uranium concentrations and kidney function parameters in the total cohort. Conclusions. Occupational exposure to the air disaster in Amsterdam was neither significantly associated with higher uranium concentrations, nor with <b>disturbed</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> parameters. In this large cohort of professional assistance workers, urinary uranium concentrations were in the low range compared with previously published reference populations. No indications of nephrotoxicity were found at urinary uranium concentrations around 2 ng/g creatinine...|$|E

The study was performed within the groups, as well as between the groups with patients that had the same gender, age, blood pressure and initial creatinine values. From the long-term study it can be concluded that there is no uniform course of the <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> in any of the groups. The <b>Kidney</b> <b>function</b> deteriorated in 15 patients (Group A 6, Group B 9). Nine patients had to be dialyzed. The remaining 5 patients had either the same (Group A 3, Group B 0) or improved <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> (Group A 1, Group B 1). A positive correlation between the initial and end value of 1 /creatinin could only be concluded for the glomerulonephritis patients and the patients with deteriorated kidney function(p= 0. 0084). A significant correlation between blood pressure and <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> could not be found. A sufficient antihypertensive therapy was only established in 16 patients.

40|$|Background: Doppler {{ultrasonography}} (DU) {{and measurement}} of its indexes, resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI), {{is used to}} investigate transplanted kidney hemodynamic status and function. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the correlation between Doppler indexes in the early phase after transplantation with long-term transplanted kidney function. Materials and Methods : In this cross-sectional study on 38 newly kidney transplant patients, we performed DU with assessment of its indexes within 48 hours, 1 week, and 6 months after kidney transplantation. Serum creatinine after stability and 6 months after kidney transplantation were assessed. Cyclosporine level was measured 1 week after kidney transplantation and compared with DU indexes. Results: About 71 % of kidney transplanted patients reached their normal initial creatinine level(cr< 1. 5 mg/ dl) and 28 % of all patients were involved in kidney dysfunction after 6 months (increase in basic creatinine level more than 25 %). There was no significant difference between mean RI and PI in patients with normal and <b>disturbed</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> based on creatinine level in early posttransplantation period but there was linear correlation between mean RI and PI within 48 hours and 1 week with kidney function after 6 months. Also no association between cyclosporine level and RI and PI was shown. There was a direct association between age and the levels of RI and PI 6 months after transplantation. Conclusion: This study suggests assessment of RI and PI in early period after transplantation and can be used as predictive parameters for long-term function of transplanted kidney and RI more than 0. 80 in early phase after transplantation has an acceptable sensitivity and specificity to predict long-term kidney dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|THE {{correlation}} of the functional {{behavior and the}} structural char-acteristics of the blood vessels with the physiological units of the kid-ney {{is one of the}} most significant advances in the knowledge of kidney diseases during the past two decades. Evidence is accumulating that in the majority of instances of bilateral kid-ney disease of adult life the failure of the kidney function depends on a pri-mary disease of the renal blood vessels. These cases are now variously classi-fied as hypertensive renal disease, be-nign or malignant nephrosclerosis, and arteriosclerotic kidney disease. Con-trariwise, in acute and chronic glomer-ulonephritis an "infectious process" is believed to involve primarily the glomeruli and tubules. The patholog-ical state of the blood vessels in these latter cases, particularly in chronic glomerulonephritis, also plays a signifi-cant role in the mechanism of <b>disturbed</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> In this rather simple but somewhat arbitrary grouping of bilateral kidney diseases, the classification of malignant nephrosclerosis is particularly difficult. Volhard and Fahr, 1 and Lohlein 2 sep-arated this condition from the larger group of glomerulonephritis on the basis of the age of the patients, the rapidly fatal course, certain laboratory findings, and the "acute " histological changes in the glomeruli. The infec-tious character of the glomerular le-sions was emphasized by Volhard and Fahr without sufficient consideration of the vascular lesions. Recently, through the efforts of Fahr, 3 the sig-nificance of the necrotizing arteriolitis, productive endarteritis and periarteritis of the kidneys and other organs has been receiving a new interpretation. He believes that the glomerular changes, which often predominate in the histo-logic picture, represent secondary ef-fects of prolonged ischemia produced by vascular damage.

40|$|Background: Serum {{creatinine}} {{is routinely}} measured to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Long-term cohort studies report {{that death is}} a likelier outcome than progression to kidney failure. However, {{it is unclear how}} short-term changes in estimated GFR (eGFR) over a 1 -year period relate to subsequent mortality risk. Methods: Using a provincial laboratory registry from Alberta, Canada, we identified 598, 397 adults who had >= 2 outpatient eGFR measurements at least 6 months apart during a 1 -year accrual period. Change in <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> was categorized by both changes in eGFR category and percent change >= 25 % into 5 groups: certain drop, uncertain drop, stable (no change in CKD category), uncertain rise, and certain rise. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for baseline covariates, <b>kidney</b> <b>function,</b> and proteinuria were used to estimate the risk of all-cause mortality associated with each group change in <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> in reference to stable <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Results: Among the study participants, 447, 570 (74. 8 %) had stable <b>kidney</b> <b>function,</b> 19, 591 (3. 3 %) had a certain drop, and 22, 171 (3. 7 %) had a certain rise in <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Participants with change in <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> (both drop and rise) were older, more likely to be female, and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities in comparison to those with stable <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> There were 51, 473 (8. 6 %) deaths during a median follow-up of 3. 5 years.

We followed <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> and bone loss for 10 years. Declining <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> was adversely associated with bone loss and mineral homeostasis in old women, though it attenuated with advanced aging. Introduction: Existing studies do not fully address the relationship between <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> and bone metabolism with advanced aging in Caucasian women. This study describes the association between <b>kidney</b> <b>function,</b> BMD, bone loss and bone metabolism in older women and provides {{a review of the}} available literature for context. Methods: We studied participants from the OPRA cohort with follow-up after 5 and 10 years. Using plasma cystatin C (cysC), estimated glomerular function rate (eGFR) was evaluated at age 75 (n = 981), 80 (n = 685) and 85 (n = 365). Women were stratified into “normal” function (CKD stages 1 – 2), “intermediate” (stage 3 a) and “poor” (stages 3 b– 5), and outcome measures—BMD, bone loss and markers of mineral homeostasis—were compared. Results: Femoral neck (FN) BMD positively associated with <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> at 75 years old ((Formula presented.) = 0. 001, p = 0. 028) and 80 years old ((Formula presented.) = 0. 001, p = 0. 001), although with small effect size. Prevalence of osteoporosis (FN T-score ≤ − 2. 5) did not differ with <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Measured at age 75, women with poor <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> had higher annual percentage bone loss over 5 years compared to those with normal function (2. 3 %, 95 % CI 1. 8 – 2. 8 versus 1. 3 %, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 1. 5, p = 0. 007), although not when measured from age 80 or 85.

Setting Primary care registration network with 97 general practitioners working in 55 practices regularly submitting collected patient data. Participants All patients with at least one BP measurement in 2002 and at least four serum creatine measurements after 2002 (n= 8636). A modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (mCCI) at baseline was registered. Change in systolic and diastolic BP (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) from 2002 onwards was calculated. The relation between <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> evolution and baseline BP and change in BP was examined using linear and logistic regression analysis. Main outcome measures The slope of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, MDRD, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) was calculated by the ordinal least square method. A rapid annual decline of <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> was defined as ≥ 3  mL/min/ 1. 73  m 2 /year. Results Rapid annual decline of <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> occurred in 1130 patients (13. 1 %). High baseline systolic BP (SBP) and PP predicted <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> decline in participants aged 60 – 79  years.

Potentially significant associations between <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> and periodontal disease {{have been reported in}} cross-sectional studies. However, no longitudinal study has been performed and no study has been performed in Japan. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the effect of periodontal disease on <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> in community-dwelling Japanese elderly. Study Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting & Participants: Members of this cohort were drawn from a longitudinal interdisciplinary study of aging. Included for this analysis were 317 participants (166 men, 151 women) aged 75 years in 2003. Predictor: The periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA), reflecting the amount of inflamed periodontal tissue, was calculated for each participant. Participants were classified in quartile groups according to PISA, then divided into 2 groups (highest quartile vs the other 3 groups combined). Outcomes: The primary outcome for the analysis was decreased <b>kidney</b> <b>function,</b> defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate at follow-up. Measurements: Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to predict decreased <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> on the basis of periodontal status, risk factors for kidney disease, and other potentially relevant covariates. Results: During the 2 -year follow-up (2003 - 2005), 45 participants (14. 2 %) developed decreased <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> The highest PISA quartile was associated significantly with a greater cumulative incidence of decreased <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> (OR, 2. 24; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 4. 79) than the referent group (the other 3 quartiles) after adjusting for covariates.

RESULTS Lower GFR and hematocrit were associated with a higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In univariate analysis, reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> and lower hematocrit, in men and in women, were risk factors for all-cause mortality (p, 0. 001 fo...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} (IS) regimen {{based on}} sirolimus/low-dose tacrolimus {{is considered a}} major determinant of success of the Edmonton protocol. This regimen is generally considered safe or even protective for the kidney. Herein, we analyzed the impact of the sirolimus/low-dose tacrolimus combination on <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> The medical charts of islet transplant recipients with at least 6 months follow up were reviewed. There were five islet-after-kidney and five islet transplantation alone patients. Serum creatinin, albuminuria, metabolic control markers and graft function were analyzed. Impairment of <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> was observed in six of 10 patients. Neither metabolic markers nor IS drugs levels were significantly associated with the decrease of <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Although a specific etiology was not identified, some subsets of patients presented a higher risk for decline of <b>kidney</b> <b>function.</b> Low creatinin clearance, albuminuria and long-established kidney graft were associated with poorer outcome...|$|R
40|$|Serum cystatin C is an {{alternative}} to serum creatinine for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR), since cystatin C is less influenced by age and muscle mass. Among persons with diabetes, we compared the performance of GFR estimated using cystatin C (eGFRcys) with that using creatinine (eGFRcr) for the identification of reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> and its association with diabetes complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We analyzed data from adult participants from the 1999 – 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with available cystatin C (N = 4, 457). <b>Kidney</b> <b>function</b> was dichotomized as preserved (eGFR ‡ 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) or reduced (eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) using the 2012 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) cystatin C and the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equations. RESULTS Among 778 persons with diabetes, the prevalence of reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> was 16. 5 % using eGFRcr and 22. 0 % using eGFRcys. More persons with diabetes were reclassified from preserved <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> by eGFRcr to reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> by eGFRcys than persons without diabetes (odds ratio 3. 1 [95 % CI 1. 9 – 4. 9], P < 0. 001). The associations between lower eGFR and higher prevalence of albumin-uria, retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary artery disease were robust regardless of filtration marker. Similarly, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with lower eGFRcr and eGFRcys. Only lower eGFRcys {{was significantly associated with}} cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS More persons with diabetes had reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> by eGFRcys than by eGFRcr, and lower eGFRcys was strongly associated with diabetes complications. Whether eGFRcys is superior to eGFRcr in approximating true <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> in a diabetic population requires additional study...|$|R
