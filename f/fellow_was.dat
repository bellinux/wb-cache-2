[...] Seven Honorary Fellows were elected that year, followed by another five in 1999. The first woman to be elected as an Honorary <b>Fellow</b> <b>was</b> the journalist and broadcaster Francine Stock, an Old Member of the college, in 2007. The Honorary Fellows have included two Old Members who later became Prime Minister of their respective countries: Norman Manley, who studied at Jesus College as a Rhodes Scholar and who was Chief Minister of Jamaica from 1955 to 1962, and Harold Wilson, who was twice British Prime Minister (1964–70 and 1974–76).

500|$|The college {{formerly}} had {{a category}} of missionary Fellows, known as Leoline Fellows after their founder, Principal Leoline Jenkins. [...] In his will in 1685, he stated that [...] "It is but too obvious that the persons in Holy Orders employed in his Majesty's fleet at sea and foreign plantations are too few." [...] To address this, he established two Fellowships, whose holders should serve as clergy [...] "in any of his Majesty's fleets or in his Majesty's plantations" [...] {{under the direction of}} the Lord High Admiral and the Bishop of London respectively. The last of these, Frederic de Winton, was appointed in 1876 and held his Fellowship until his death in 1932. This category was abolished in 1877 by the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Commission, without prejudice to the rights of existing holders such as de Winton. [...] Another category of Fellowship that was abolished in the 19th century was that of the King Charles I Fellows, founded by Charles I in 1636 and tenable by natives of the Channel Islands in an attempt by him to [...] "reclaim the Channel Islands from the extreme Calvinism which characterised them." [...] The first such <b>Fellow</b> <b>was</b> Daniel Brevint.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any of her words or deeds…. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting <b>Fellow</b> <b>was</b> a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E

On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this <b>fellow</b> <b>was</b> one of his icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets {{to be a bit}} of a fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter. This happens all the way through this very complicated episode".|$|E

[...] Carter's biographer Douglas Brinkley has observed that Stein and Carter have a [...] "passionate, up-and-down relationship" [...] and that Stein has criticized some of Carter's previous statements about Israel. In response to Professor Stein's current criticism of the book, representatives of its publisher, Simon & Schuster, state: [...] "We haven't seen these allegations, we haven't seen any specifics, and I have no way of assessing anything he [...] has said. ...

2500|$|Zelica {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a buggy horse with her colt running freely alongside until he was weaned at around five or six months. At first, the young horse showed little promise. [...] "The only redeemable feature about the little <b>fellow</b> <b>was</b> that he was friendly and cute" [...] recalled Messner. [...] "I honestly thought the colt's future would be confined to hauling a delivery wagon." [...] However, a close friend named John Wattles, the owner of the livery stable in which Dan Patch was foaled, saw potential in the colt. Wattles received permission from Messner to train Dan Patch and gradually developed the horse's abilities. By late 1898, Messner was able to use Dan Patch as his buggy horse since Zelica was again in foal, and even hooked the horse up to his sleigh over the winter. The locals were increasingly impressed by the almost black colt, who loved to move fast but was biddable enough to pull young boys behind him on the sleigh.|$|E

[...] Garrels had attempted four earlier field goals in the game, all unsuccessful. [...] The Chicago Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Evidently the Wolverines placed all their reliance on Garrels, for the big <b>fellow</b> <b>was</b> constantly trying goal shots." [...] With two minutes remaining, Ohio State's fullback, Gibson, attempted a punt from behind his goal line. [...] Gibson dropped the ball on a poor snap from the sub center, Claggett, and fell on it, resulting in a safety that accounted for Michigan's final two points. [...] On defense, Michigan held Ohio State to four first downs in the game. [...] The Chicago Daily Tribune praised Jack Loell as [...] "a whirlwind at center" [...] who [...] "sustained the heaviest attack of the Ohio backs and drove two of his opponents to the side lines and a third to making the poor pass which gave Michigan the last two points." ...|$|E

[...] Each year, the provost and two fellows travelled to Eton to impartially elect the worthiest boys to fill any vacancies at the college, always maintaining {{the total number of}} scholars and fellows at exactly seventy. [...] Membership of King's was a vocation for life. [...] Scholars were eligible for election to the fellowship after three years of probation, irrespective of whether they had achieved a degree or not. [...] In fact, undergraduates at King's – unlike those from other colleges – did not even have to pass university examinations to achieve their BA degree and instead had only to satisfy the college. [...] Every <b>fellow</b> <b>was</b> to study theology, save for two who were to study astronomy, two civil law, four canon law, and two medicine; all fellows save those studying secular subjects were obliged to take Holy Orders and become priests, on pain of expulsion. [...] In 1445 a Papal Bull from Eugenius IV exempted college members from parish duties, and in 1457 an agreement between the provost and chancellor of the university limited the chancellor's authority and gave the college full jurisdiction over internal matters.|$|E

2500|$|Sean Daly of Rolling Stone commended the show's [...] "Vegas-style glam" [...] and Jackson's [...] "pure showmanship" [...] as {{providing}} [...] "a hellzapoppin' spectacle that featured enough over-the-top special effects to make Armageddon look like Driving Miss Daisy." [...] The concert was considered [...] "a lust-driven fairy tale", featuring [...] "a giant storybook, containing a massive video screen" [...] which {{opened and closed}} the show. Its varied themes were contrasted with psychiatric thrillers A Clockwork Orange and Solid Gold, being [...] "as damn freaky as it sounds", using a color scheme described as [...] "a well-lighted explosion at the Crayola factory." [...] The show's second segment was analyzed as [...] "deranged madness", questioning [...] "Can this really be little Penny from Good Times?" [...] Daly praised Jackson's [...] "breakneck speed" [...] and favorably considered it [...] "summer-entertainment bliss", adding [...] "Janet's still as nasty as she wants to be." [...] Sean Piccoli of The Sun Sentinel applauded the tour as a [...] "birth of {{a new form of}} entertainment", effectively taking [...] "music-video fundamentalism to a new extreme in live performance." [...] Jackson's [...] "athletic, superchoreographed presentation" [...] was considered [...] "sheery sensory thrill", thought to have [...] "made Spice World look like public theater." [...] The show was analyzed to be [...] "as much a broadcast as it was a show", transitioning through [...] "a seamless whirl of songs, costumes and set changes." [...] Jackson's performances were described as a [...] "technicolor barrage", ranging from [...] "punched-up, steely grooves" [...] to [...] "pillowy, whispered ballads." [...] Piccoli declared highlights to include the opening number, [...] "an eerie incantation on the strangeness and isolation of celebrity", and the [...] "explosively colorful" [...] Control medley incorporating themes of [...] "children's theater." [...] The tour's rendition of [...] "Rope Burn", showcasing Jackson as she [...] "coaxed a young man from the audience onstage for a veritable striptease routine – for which the <b>fellow</b> <b>was</b> strapped by wristbands to his seat", was also praised. However, the show's unplugged ballad segment was thought to be [...] "the evening's most unadorned moment." [...] Piccoli added the crowd's [...] "animated cheering" [...] had been the most the arena had mustered in his experience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day began}} well, {{and the weather}} was {{pleasant}} and sunny. Steve Waugh immediately unleashed his pack of fast bowlers, who posed a formidable threat to the Indian pair of Sehwag and Chopra. But the two openers, handled them with ease and looked {{the part of a}} top order pair. Sehwag took advantage of an ordinary bowling spell by Andy Bichel, flicking and driving confidently. He could not, however, negotiate the full and swinging deliveries and was dropped off one such delivery by Nathan Bracken. But the speedster had his revenge as he scalped Sehwag for his first wicket in tests. Sehwag departed for a fast 45 from only 51 balls. The score stood at 61/1. Later, Rahul Dravid batting on one, was tricked by a Jason Gillespie delivery into poking at a delivery that swung and seamed away. This produced a fatal edge that Hayden gleefully accepted. Dravid departed for 1 and the score was 62/2. In the very same over, Sachin Tendulkar came out to bat. After batting out two uneventful balls, Gillespie let loose a quick one. Picking the line of the ball early as the ball seemed like missing the off-stump, Tendulkar shouldered arms and the ball went and thudded onto his pads. Umpire Steve Bucknor looked blank for some time and finally raised his finger. Bucknor had already had a history of bad umpiring earlier in this match, overriding straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen in their first innings, and this decision made things worse for him. His decision did not go too well with Tendulkar's Australian fans. Some of them reportedly made remarks like: [...] ""Didn't he turn down two straightforward appeals against the Australian batsmen on the first day? Don't they call him a batsman's umpire?" [...] and some others said, [...] "Hey mate, we came to watch Tendulkar bat, not Bucknor wag his finger." [...] But Tendulkar took the decision with grace. Robert Craddock, writing in The Australian, commented that, [...] "World cricket does not need electronic help to sort out lbw decisions. It just needs better umpiring. Steve Bucknor shouldn't have needed a camera to give Sachin Tendulkar not out when he was struck high ... Bucknor, a delightful <b>fellow,</b> <b>was</b> a great umpire at his zenith but there have been signs in recent times he is slipping and there is a gap emerging between his still high reputation and his performance." [...] Rajan Bala also wrote in the Asian Age:"In an earlier birth Bucknor might have been one of those Roman emperors who ensured that the crowds at the Coliseum were kept in suspense before he gave the thumbs-down signal to end the life of a gladiator or a Christian." [...] In fact, so annoyed were the fans that during Ganguly's innings, when he was struck in the shoulder, they said aloud: [...] "Give him out now." [...] The comment was noted to be quite sarcastic in nature.|$|E
