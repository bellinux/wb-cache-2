40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The {{natural gas}} {{industry}} has become essential {{in many areas}} in the United States. Currently there is over 37. 5 million miles of natural gas distribution lines. A large majority of these lines are polyethylene pipes. With such {{a large percentage of}} polyethylene lines in use gas companies are continually looking for ways to improve repair procedures. 	The focus of this work was two fold. One of the objectives was to mechanically characterize the squeeze-off of polyethylene pipe, assess damage (if any) to the pipe and use this information in the design of a squeeze-off tool {{that could be used in}} a keyhole (18 inch diameter hole) by a single operator. Equations were developed to predict required squeeze-off forces under different conditions, such as temperature, tool radius, squeeze-rates, and swivel versus <b>fixed</b> <b>jaws.</b> This tool is now in commercial use across the US. The second objective was the development a patch consisting of a solvent swollen polyethylene film that can be applied to a live natural gas line, in a keyhole if necessary. This patch is applied under elevated temperature conditions allowing for a modified solvent weld, effectively repairing pipe lines in a quarter of the time of current repair procedures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} about cost {{reduction}} of <b>fix</b> <b>jaw</b> of rear vice by weight reduction. Rear vice of horizontal band saw machine used for clamping work piece during cutting operation. It has two jaws- <b>Fix</b> <b>jaw</b> and movable jaw. Movable jaw attached to hydraulic cylinder which applies force to hold work piece {{between these two}} jaws. Reduce weight of components help to minimize load on environmental resources. This efforts for reduction of weight by using topology optimization. <b>fix</b> <b>jaws</b> has been modeled using solid works First conducted analysis on existing jaws with calculating the forces acting on jaws {{in order to find}} out Max. Displacement and stress induced. These analyses were carried using Altair Hyperworks and solver used is optistuct. Again conducted topology optimization with applying manufacturing constrain like minimum member size and single type draw direction. Again prepare cad model as per topology result and carried analysis on optimized model. from that analyzed results, Displacement and stress are lower than existing model. From result it was found that current design is safe also save material and cost of component, Finally we reduced cost by 244 /- and total reduced weight by 24 % of current <b>fix</b> <b>jaw</b> model.

50|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> can {{withstand}} bending stress {{far better than}} can the movable jaw, because the latter is supported only by the flat surfaces {{on either side of}} the guide slot, not the full thickness of the tool. The tool is therefore usually angled so that the movable jaw's area of contact is closer to the body of the tool, which means less bending stress.|$|R

The distance between the jaws is then read in different ways for the three types.|$|R
25|$|In {{the double}} toggle jaw crushers, the {{oscillating}} {{motion of the}} swing jaw {{is caused by the}} vertical motion of the pitman. The pitman moves up and down. The swing jaw closes, i.e., it moves towards the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> when the pitman moves upward and opens during the downward motion of the pitman. This type is commonly used in mines due to its ability to crush tough and abrasive materials.|$|R
40|$|Gene {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase (Pol) II {{requires the}} coactivator complex Mediator. Mediator connects transcriptional regulators and Pol II, and {{is linked to}} human disease 1 – 4. Mediator from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a molecular mass of 1. 4 megadaltons and comprises 25 subunits that form the head, middle, tail and kinase modules 5 – 7. The head module constitutes one-half of the essential Mediator core 8, and comprises the conserved 9 subunits Med 6, Med 8, Med 11, Med 17, Med 18, Med 20 and Med 22. Recent X-ray analysis of the S. cerevisiae head module at 4. 3 A˚ resolution led to a partial architectural model with three submodules called neck, <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> and moveable jaw 10. Here we determine de novo the crystal structure of the head module from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3. 4 A˚ resolution. Structure solution was enabled by new structures of Med 6 and the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw,</b> and previous structures of the moveable jaw 11 {{and part of the}} neck 12, and required deletion of Med 20. The S. pombe head module resembles the head of a crocodile with eight distinct elements, of which at least four are mobile. The <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> comprises tooth and nose domains, whereas the neck submodule contains a helical spine and one limb, with shoulder, arm and finger elements. The arm and the essential shoulder contact other parts of Mediator. The jaws and a central joint are implicated in interactions with Pol II and its carboxy-terminal domain, and the joint is required for transcription in vitro. The S. pombe head module structure leads to a revised model of the S. cerevisiae module, reveals a high conservation and flexibility, explains knownmutations, and provides the basis for unravelling a central mechanism of gene regulation...|$|R

The squeeze riveter can only be used close to the edge because of the limited depth of the anvil. Once properly adjusted, the squeeze riveter will produce very uniform rivet bucks. The stationary (<b>fixed)</b> <b>jaw</b> is placed against the head and the buck is compressed by the action of the gun.|$|R

The jaws are closed by a toggle mechanism operating on horizontal links from the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> and vertical hanger links from the floor. The toggle is provided with a long wooden handle which the operator can pull down to secure the broom in the vise.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced chucks which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> and one movable jaw (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a chucking application. Such chucks offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw chucks with the chucking speed and ease of traditional three-jaw self-centering scroll chucks. They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional chucks), but such initial cost pays for itself and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|R
25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> is {{attached}} to the shaft with a pivot pin so that the entire jaw assembly can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the shaft. This permits the jaws to be rotated over the end of the shaft {{so that they can be}} [...] "flipped" [...] over, to allow the tool to be used to either tighten or loosen a fastener. Mechanical stops limit this rotation to 180° so that when the jaws assembly is resting at a stop, the jaws will be perpendicular to the shaft and thus aligned to the fastener. When the shaft is held in a vertical orientation, the jaws are automatically held against the stop by gravity. Basin wrenches are available with both fixed-length and telescopic handles.|$|R

2500|$|A {{jaw crusher}} uses {{compressive}} force for breaking of particle. [...] This mechanical pressure {{is achieved by}} the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. A jaw or toggle crusher consists {{of a set of}} vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.|$|R
50|$|A {{basin wrench}} {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two jaws form an assembly in which the jaws are joined with a pivot pin. One of the <b>jaws</b> is <b>fixed</b> relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the pivot pin, the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely fitting hole in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|R

A 60 year-old man presented with a gradually increasing 6 x 5 cm swelling in {{the left side of his}} jaw. The swelling was fixed, without any apparent sinus or abscess. Fine needle aspiration was diagnostic as it revealed colonies of actinomyces surrounded by polymorphs and chronic inflammatory cells. The histopathological study of the excised specimen confirmed the cytological findings. Fine needle aspiration is an effective tool in the diagnosis of actinomycosis although its documentation is rare. Difficulties in the management can be avoided by early diagnosis using the fine needle aspiration technique...|$|R

An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) {{may be used to}} study junction dose between two megavoltage X-ray fields. In this study, the junction dose was used to determine machine characteristics such as jaw positions and their reproducibility, collimator rotation and the effect of gantry rotation. All measurements were done on Varian linear accelerators with EPID (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The results show reproducibility in jaw positions of approximately 0. 3 mm for repeated jaw placement while EPID readings were reproducible within a standard deviation of 0. 4 % for <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> positions. Junction dose also allowed collimator rotation error of 0. 1 Â° to be observed. Dependence of junction dose on gantry rotation due to gravity was observed; the gravity effect being maximum at 180 Â° gantry angle (beam pointing up).

40|$|Due {{to their}} simple design and easy {{maintainability}} jaw crushers {{are widely used}} as primary size reduction equipments in mechanical and mining industries. As jaw crushers break minerals & ores of high strength and the economy of many industries depends on its performance; {{it is essential to}} improve the efficiency of the present design. The kinematic analysis of single toggle jaw crusher shows that the forces on the moving jaw plate at different crank angle are different and hence power generated varies with crank angle. One way to increase the efficiency is to store the energy in a flywheel when the supply is more than the rate of consumption and to utilize the same when the supply falls down. Hence efforts are made to design a flywheel to minimize the wastage of power and to improvise the performance parameters of single toggle jaw crusher. Jaw plate wear has considerable affect on the life of jaw Crusher which is caused by the slipping motion between the fed material and the jaws. This wear is predominantly serious in the fixed plate and hence the liners of the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> should be properly chosen. In addition to this the toggle bar which acts as a safety lever has to be precisely designed. The design aspects of flywheel, spring of tension bar and toggle bar are discussed in this paper. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{closure of}} the gastrotomy in Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is a {{prerequisite}} for transgastric endoscopic procedures in the abdominal cavity. Different techniques have been proposed and are under experimental or early clinical investigation. We describe the technique of using an over-the-scope-clip system (OTSC), made of super-elastic Nitinol and a specially designed tissue-approximating double jaw endoscopic grasper for gastric closure. The OTSC is a clipping system mounted {{at the tip of the}} endoscope and is used for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding or gastrointestinal organ perforations. An enlarged version of the OTSC is now under investigation for NOTES. The closure procedure consists of two steps. First the margins of the perforation are approximated by means of an endoscopic grasper that has two mobile and one <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw,</b> thus providing two independent tissue grasping areas. Each half of this twin grasper is used to grasp one side of the perforation wound margins. Then the margins are approximated and pulled towards the OTSC cap at the tip of the scope. Then the clip is released and the access hole is closed by compression. The OTSC clip can be applied for organ closure in NOTES in experimental studies. The technique allows closing the access site from inside the gastric cavity without leaving material on the peritoneal surface of the organ...|$|R

Seven tertiary-referral movement disorders centers using a standardized data collection on a computerized database performed a retrospective chart review of psychogenic movement disorders involving the face. Patients with organic forms of facial dystonia or any medical or neurological disorder known to affect facial muscles were excluded. Sixty-one patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for psychogenic facial movement disorders (91. 8 % females; age: 37. 0 ± 11. 3 years). Phasic or tonic muscular spasms resembling dystonia were documented in all patients most commonly involving the lips (60. 7 %), followed by eyelids (50. 8 %), perinasal region (16. 4 %), and forehead (9. 8 %). The most common pattern consisted of tonic, sustained, lateral, and/or downward protrusion of {{one side of the}} lower lip with ipsilateral jaw deviation (84. 3 %). Ipsi- or contralateral blepharospasm and excessive platysma contraction occurred in isolation or combined with fixed lip dystonia (60. 7 %). Spasms were reported as painful in 24. 6 % of cases. Symptom onset was abrupt in most cases (80. 3 %), with at least 1 precipitating psychological stress or trauma identified in 57. 4 %.

The wave broke with a heavy plash that attracted his attention: it was, indeed, that sound that had awakened him. He looked around; there was some object; he started wildly from his resting-place, sprang over the cavern, and bounded on the beach. It was a corpse; he is kneeling by its side. It is the corpse of his cousin! Lord Cadurcis was a fine swimmer, and had evidently made strong efforts for his life, for he was partly undressed. In all the insanity of hope, still wilder than despair, George Cadurcis seized the body and bore it some yards upon the shore. Life had been long extinct. The corpse was cold and stark, the eyes closed, an expression of energy, however, yet lingering in the <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw,</b> and the hair sodden with the sea. Suddenly Captain Cadurcis rushed to the inn and roused the household. With a distracted air, and broken speech and rapid motion, he communicated the catastrophe. Several persons, some bearing torches, others blankets and cordials, followed him instantly to the fatal spot. They hurried to the body, they applied all the rude remedies of the moment, rather from the impulse of nervous excitement than with any practical purpose; for the case had been indeed long hopeless. While Captain Cadurcis leant over the body, chafing the extremities in a hurried frenzy, and gazing intently on the countenance, a shout was heard from one of the stragglers who had recently arrived. The sea had washed on the beach another corpse: the form of Marmion Herbert. It would appear that he had made no struggle to save himself, for his hand was locked in his waistcoat, where, at the moment, he had thrust the Phaedo, showing that he had been reading to the last, and was meditating on immortality when he died.|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpeech {{production}} necessitates a high dexterity. Some {{sounds like}} /i/, /s/ or /l/ require every precise {{positioning of the}} tongue, while tasks constraints can vary widely (inertial perturbations in walking/running, vocal tract perturbations during eating [...] .). Moreover, tongue movements are very rapid, {{on the order of}} some tenth of millisecond, while proprioceptive and auditory feedback latencies are longer. Last, sensory and motor signals have limited precision (they are 'noisy'). For all these reasons, it has been proposed that the central nervous system (CNS) rely on an optimal estimation system ('internal model') in order to adjust the trajectories in real time. Moreover, the CNS also seems to optimize some perceived cost, as suggested by the motor stereotypies observed in eye or arm movements. In particular, the hypothesis of the minimization of an internal measure of effort, or the minimization of the impact of motor noise on endpoint variance account for a large body of experimental observations. Here we test whether an effort optimization controller coupled to an optimal state estimator can account for the trajectories of the tongue when a subject produces the three vowels /i/, /a/ and /u/ from a neutral (schwa) initial posture. In a first step, we ran 20, 000 simulations of a finite element model of the tongue in order to describe the effect of combinations of muscle activations ramps across six muscles of the tongue (3 intrinsic, 3 extrinsic). We then applied model identification techniques to obtain a computationally tractable dynamical model of the tongue in the sagittal plane. Assuming a <b>fixed</b> <b>jaw</b> position and a standard geometry {{for the rest of the}} vocal tract, we obtained a simplified model of the speech production system. We could then derive the first three formants of the voice from the instantaneous tongue position through a harmonic analysis. With the sensorimotor plant thus defined, we applied standard numerical techniques inside a time loop to simulate the function of an optimal estimator/controller subjected to sensory and motor uncertainty, and generated tongue trajectories from the initial posture to the final endpoints defined either in postural space or in acoustic (F 1 -F 2) space. These simulations allow exploring how optimal control hypotheses can explain the average trajectories and the impact of sensorimotor noise on their variability...|$|R

40|$|With smaller incisions, laparoscopic, or {{minimally}} invasive, {{surgery is}} considered safer for patients than open surgery. However, {{the safety of}} current laparoscopic grasping instruments can still be improved. Current devices provide surgeons with limited tactile feedback, and the current alligator-style jaws create pinch points {{that can lead to}} torn or damaged tissue. Additionally, the angled jaws can result in excessive grasping forces, due to the uneven pressure distribution along the jaws, or slippage when grasping larger organs. Tissue trauma, in the form of mechanical injury (crushing), ischemia (cut off blood supply), or perforation, can occur. A new design uses a symmetric, 10 -bar linkage to keep the grasping jaws parallel, creating a uniform pressure distribution {{along the length of the}} jaws. A pressure sensor, located near the trigger in the handle, can detect when the grasper jaws are applying too much force on an object. When the force is above a given threshold, a vibration motor in the handle activates, warning the surgeon. This improved tactile feedback can help surgeons control pressures applied during grasping. The grasper design is further enhanced through an ergonomic pistol-grip handle, which also includes a turning wheel to rotate the grasper and a locking mechanism to <b>fix</b> the <b>jaws</b> in place. A working lx scale prototype was built to verify the feasibility of the design. by Caitlin J. Reyda. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2011.
