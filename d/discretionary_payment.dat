40|$|This {{in-depth}} cross-national {{case study}} questions broad assertions made to date regarding the general similarities {{that can be}} found in exceptional need systems within social assistance schemes in Britain (the Social Fund) and the Netherlands (Bijzondere Bijstand). Based on qualitative documentary analysis and in-depth interviews with those who administer <b>discretionary</b> <b>payments</b> in both countries the research highlights that these nominally similar schemes serve diverse goals and aims in their national contexts. Reflecting the different traditions of cash and care and the administrative structure of the state in the implementation of policy in this area, {{the first part of the}} thesis demonstrates that Bijzondere Bijstand in the Netherlands is firmly situated in an 'activity fare' context whilst the Social Fund remains largely separate from the administration of 'welfare to work' in Britain. The second part of the thesis highlights the empirically observed diversity that follows from these configurations of social assistance. Those who administer these payments have quite different educational and occupational backgrounds that inform the ways they think about poverty and the poor and are related to what they try to do for clients and customers with <b>discretionary</b> <b>payments.</b> The Dutch 'paternalistic' administrator attempts to facilitate paths out of social assistance for clients whilst Social Fund Officers are concerned with 'managerially' processing a large number of applicants in the context of targets and budgets. Organisational contexts are shown to affect the administration of <b>discretionary</b> <b>payments</b> to the 'deserving and undeserving poor', but not the meanings that administrators imbue the forms of payment at their disposal, grants and loans. Configurations of social assistance essentially set the context for the degree to which administrators can award payments in accordance with absolute and relative notions of poverty and human need and the interpretation and construction of needs and wants. In practice, need is a dynamic social construct that is informed by the professionalism of the workers, the ideology of the programme they implement and the structure and constraints of the bureaucracy in which they work.

40|$|I {{model the}} {{determination}} of management compensation through the strategic interaction among outside shareholders, managers, and corporate boards. The board sets both regular incentive compensation and discretionary special compensation unrelated to performance. We show that shareholder value maximising compensation plans may feature incentive compensation that is not monotone in performance and <b>discretionary</b> <b>payments</b> unrelated to performance. Manager oriented boards may transfer wealth to managers using compensation plans that feature a higher pay to performance relation and also exploit the discretionary compensation to enrich management. Full delegation of authority to the board, which insulates the board from shareholder outrage, may be optimal even if the likelihood of managerial control is high. However, in some cases, imposing charter restrictions on discretionary compensation is optimal. Shareholder democracy, by exposing board members to outrage costs, creates additional sources of distortion as it both induces management-oriented boards to distort operating policy to mask wealth transfers and shareholder-oriented boards to forego optimal compensation designs to avoid shareholder suspicion...|$|R

40|$|Typically, {{shareholders}} are {{not sure}} whether boards act in their interest, or have been captured by management. They are also less well informed than boards about firm investment opportunities and operating conditions. We develop a model, consistent with these observations, in which <b>discretionary</b> compensation <b>payments</b> to managers might increase firm value or might simply enrich managers {{at the expense of}} shareholders. After observing the board’s compensation and investment policies, shareholders update the probability that the board is captured using Bayes rule. Shareholders are “outraged” if this updated probability is sufficiently large. Outrage is costly for the board. Shareholder democracy, by enabling outrage to constrain board actions, typically lowers firm value relative either to governance regimes that insulate boards from shareholder outrage, or regimes that ban discretionary compensation altogether...|$|R
50|$|The {{changes in}} housing benefit have been criticised {{for having a}} disproportionate effect on {{disabled}} families. Two-thirds of individuals affected by the under-occupancy penalty are registered as disabled. Historically, most care and support for disabled individuals was provided by local councils, and their predecessors, rather than central government; in consequence there is an expectation from the government that costs arising out of care needs - including extra bedroom space - should be met by local council budgets. However, over the 20th century, central government took over the cost of providing benefits that cover housing costs; therefore, the government provided a new annual grant to councils, {{so that they can}} make <b>discretionary</b> housing <b>payments</b> for disabled people in this situation. The government has recently merged this grant into the general funding provided to councils.|$|R

40|$|Without {{contracting}} or repetition, purely self-regarding agents {{will not}} trade. To what extent can social preferences, such as altruism or {{a concern for}} fairness, generate efficient bilateral exchange? I analyze a simple exchange game: A purely self-regarding first mover transfers some amount of a commodity to a second mover. Then the second mover, who has social preferences defined over material payoffs, transfers a commodity {{back to the first}} mover. I identify key properties of social preferences that matter for bilateral exchange behavior. I find the equilibrium will be efficient if either (1) the second mover’s transfer is monetary (i. e., material payoffs are quasi-linear in the second mover’s commodity), or (2) the second mover’s social preferences cause him to behave in accordance with a “fairness rule ” (such as the 50 - 50 sharing norm). The results may explain why small-scale transactions with <b>discretionary</b> monetary <b>payment</b> are common, and suggest that social norms that prescribe fair allocations promote efficiency in exchange environments...|$|R
40|$|Our paper makes a {{first attempt}} to address the impact of skills and skill use in the {{analysis}} of the gender wage gap using the PIAAC dataset. Using the case of Austria, we show that skill use as well as the skill match play an important role with regard to wage regressions of men as well as women. When we take skills into account in the gender wage gap analysis, the unexplained part of the gender wage gap is reduced by almost 4 percentage points along the whole wage distribution. Our results suggest that skill use and match {{play a crucial role in}} explaining the gender wage gap. Additionally, we show, that the self-selection problem biases the results, in particular in the lower and middle parts of the wage distribution and that we should control for it, although the effect is small. When we additionally consider <b>discretionary</b> bonus <b>payments,</b> we find that the unexplained part in the gender wage gap increases, especially in the upper part of the wage distribution...|$|R
5000|$|Most local {{education}} authorities {{had already been}} paying students' tuition fees and providing maintenance grants since World War II. The Act required both, {{in addition to providing}} for <b>discretionary</b> tuition <b>payments</b> to those entering further (vocational) education instead of universities (it was expected that the industrial training boards would pay the tuition for the majority of further education students, and that few would require maintenance since they usually studied part-time). The requirement that tuition be paid and the introduction of maintenance grants on a means-tested basis led to a great {{increase in the number of}} students attending university and enabled many to attend who would not otherwise have been able to afford it. The provisions of the Act applied to students who were [...] "ordinarily resident" [...] in the local authority area; this was interpreted literally by the courts and in 1983 by the House of Lords, making many immigrants eligible.The Act had a slight effect on the minimum age for leaving school by reducing to two the times during the year when a student was permitted to leave.The Act was repealed in 1999 along with the introduction of tuition fees. State support for student maintenance is now provided by a combination of grants and loans.|$|R
40|$|Social policy {{measures}} {{and the social}} systems markedly mitigated {{the effects of the}} severe financial and economic crisis in 2009 and 2010. The largest contribution to the stabilisation resulted from the automatic stabilisers, whose effects vary between countries.

However, their impact on production and employment has remained limited due to the wide–spread uncertainty and the high share of tax cuts in the overall volume of the measures.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the causes of}} wrongful imprisonment, the nature of losses and the applicability of international approaches and conventions. Definitions of wrongful conviction vary internationally, as do the circumstances and amount of compensation. Australian states and territories can make <b>discretionary</b> ex gratia <b>payments,</b> although determination of compensation amounts is unclear. Compensation levels for wrongful conviction in Australia are not as generous as tortious claims. The current system of ex gratia payments that exists in all Australian jurisdictions (other than the Australian Capital Territory) is arbitrary. The introduction of dedicated legislation or specific guidelines for wrongful conviction would help bring these Australian jurisdictions into line with international human rights best practice. This paper considers the scope of claims made in Australia through some key case studies. However, there is currently no reliable national data on the prevalence of wrongful convictions in Australia; overseas research suggests wrongful convictions may be less rare than we assume...|$|R
50|$|On March 25, 2010, {{he offered}} his {{resignation}} as Chief executive officer to the Supervisory Board of HRE. The Supervisory Board accepted and released {{him from his}} duties. According to a HRE press release, the reasons cited for this were differences in opinion regarding {{the management of the}} company between the CEO and the Financial Market Stabilization Fund (SoFFin, the governmental entity that owns HRE). According to insiders, Wieandt demanded more entrepreneurial freedom from the government, the sole owner of HRE. Whereas according to Wieandt, the bank’s core capital ratio should be kept above ten percent, the SoFFin’s Chief executive Hannes Rehm had promised a “gentle handling” of taxpayers’ money and urged for a lower figure. Another point of contention centred on the question as to whether <b>discretionary</b> compensation <b>payments</b> amounting to € 25 million could be contractually agreed with key personnel relevant for the restructuring of HRE. Wieandt feared an exodus of specialists, which was already the case in HRE’s locations in New York and Dublin, where competitors were recruiting with higher compensation. These gaps later had to be filled by far more expensive consultants. However, SoFFin initially refused the discretionary compensation payments.The third reason for Wieandt’s departure from HRE was connected to SoFFin efforts to push through extensive disclosure obligations within short time intervals. In the case of non-compliance, contractual penalties in the millions were to apply, which the bank could then require its Management Board members to pay. Wieandt opposed such increased liabilities. According to insiders, this was actually the crucial point.|$|R
40|$|A key {{rationale}} {{of welfare}} reform has been to encourage people into work including attempts to activate recipients of out of work benefits, including lone parents and those with a health condition or disability. However, participants {{in both of these}} groups reported they wanted to work, but faced considerable barriers to doing so. ■■The experience of the transition from Incapacity Benefit to Employment and Support Allowance was stressful for some participants, particularly those who subsequently appealed the initial verdict. Sources of stress included: finding the process itself confusing; the waiting time involved; and unpleasant experiences of the medical or tribunal. ■■There was limited support on offer to help recipients of out of work benefits move into work. Even those participating in the Work Programme did not report that it was particularly helpful. Some respondents, including those who had moved into work since the first interview, reported receiving more intensive, personalised and targeted assistance from third sector organisations, which they found more useful. ■■Welfare reform has also aimed to manage public expenditure, through measures such as the ‘bedroom tax’ (also known as the ‘removal of the spare room subsidy’), and through limited or no uprating of benefits. Participants reported struggling to make ends meet, particularly in a context of prices of essential items rising faster than benefits. The bedroom tax created temporary hardship for some participants, although for most this impact was mitigated through <b>Discretionary</b> Housing <b>Payments.</b> ■■The way in which the UK Government has communicated the rationale for welfare reform had a negative impact on participants, who felt unfairly tarnished by stigmatising messages about benefit claimants not wanting to work. ■■Communication of the detail of benefit changes by relevant agencies such as the Department for Work and Pensions was also cited as poor. Official correspondence was described as long, confusing, and sometimes conflicting with previous correspondence. This made it difficult for participants to understand the changes and their potential impact. ■■There was some geographical variation in access to affordable basic items, which was particularly poor in rural areas. However, this was also an issue for those in urban areas who were not within walking distance of larger and cheaper shops, due to the high expense of bus fares relative to benefit income.
