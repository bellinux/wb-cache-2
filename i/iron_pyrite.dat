5|$|A Late Preclassic tomb {{has been}} excavated, {{believed}} to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial1; it was found during excavations of Structure7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure7A. These ceramics date the offering {{to the end of the}} Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring , which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite,</b> one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD100–200.|$|E
25|$|Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, {{especially}} in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present.

30|$|Equation (1) {{indicates}} {{the formation of}} H 2 SO 4 from <b>Iron</b> <b>pyrites.</b> During mining operation of coal <b>iron</b> <b>pyrites</b> is released and mixed with very much available Oxygen and water and finally form H 2 SO 4. Equation (2) indicates why Cu and Fe are much higher in the study area. Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is also released during coal extraction and firstly it reacts with oxygen and forms Copper (I) sulphide, Ferrous oxide and Sulfur di-oxide. Copper (I) sulphide further react with oxygen and remain as Cu metal in the soil. Again, SO 2 reacts with oxygen and produce SO 3 and finally SO 3 reacts with water and produce H 2 SO 4.|$|R
25|$|By 1875, Charlemont's {{industrial}} base {{was limited to}} several sawmills, two scythe snathes (handles) shops and a chair making operation. With the opening and success of the Davis <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> and talc mine in Rowe in the 1880s, a prospecting craze developed in the area. In 1892 the main shaft was 501 feet deep, and production {{was reported to be}} 334,552 tons of pyrite.|$|E
25|$|Galena (lead sulfide) was {{probably}} the most common crystal used in cat's whisker detectors, but various other types of crystals were also used, the most common being <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> (fool's gold, FeS2), silicon, molybdenite (MoS2), silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC), and a zincite-bornite (ZnO-Cu5FeS4) crystal-to-crystal junction trade-named Perikon. Crystal radios have also been improvised from a variety of common objects, such as blue steel razor blades and lead pencils, rusty needles, and pennies In these, a semiconducting layer of oxide or sulfide on the metal surface is usually responsible for the rectifying action.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite,</b> aluminium silicate and various bituminous substances, and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|E

25|$|In 1577 Kranich was {{involved}} in assaying the tons of black ore brought from Baffin Island during Sir Martin Frobisher's voyages to the Canadian Arctic {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage. Between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 another German metallurgist working in England, Christopher Schutz, performed three 'great proofes' of the ore. Kranich and a Venetian metallurgist working in England, Giovanni Battista Agnello, were also brought in to assay the ore. Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Martin Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. Numerous documents survive showing Kranich's involvement in the assaying of the ore, including a letter of 26 November 1577 in which Kranich reported to Sir Francis Walsingham on the amount of gold found in his tests. Amid growing doubts about the value of the ore, Kranich insisted that it contained a significant amount of gold, and asked for £200 and a daily wage of £1 to refine it. He also designed a furnace for smelting the ore. However the ore eventually turned out to be worthless <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite,</b> and it was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found in a deposition to the Privy Council by Michael Lok, one of the principal proponents of the Frobisher expeditions; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand in the presence of Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions.|$|E

500|$|Iron {{reacts with}} {{oxygen in the}} air to form various oxide and {{hydroxide}} compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4), and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all non-stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster. It is not an iron(IV) compound, but is actually an iron(II) polysulfide containing Fe2+ and [...] ions in a distorted sodium chloride structure.|$|E

2500|$|It was in {{the wooded}} hills between the two towns that an <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite</b> outcrop was {{discovered}} and a mine developed by H.J. Davis around 1882.

[...] The Davis Mine supplied a major economic boost to both Rowe and Charlemont.|$|E
2500|$|Until its 1911 cave-in, the Davis mine {{had become}} a {{mainstay}} of Rowe’s economy. It was a lucrative source of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrite.</b> [...] Popularly known as fool's gold, pyrite can be processed to yield substantial quantities of sulfide, which can in turn be used to manufacture sulfuric acid. (The mine also yielded smaller but, nevertheless, financially significant amounts of copper.) [...] The pyrite deposit is located in mica and quartz schists, which includes the presence of chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Average sulfur content {{was reported to be}} 47 percent, and copper content about 1.5 percent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the classical Miller experiments, which depend on external sources of energy (simulated lightning, ultraviolet irradiation), [...] "Wächtershäuser systems" [...] come with a built-in source of energy: sulfides of iron (<b>iron</b> <b>pyrite)</b> and other minerals. The energy released from redox reactions of these metal sulfides is available for the synthesis of organic molecules, and such systems may have evolved into autocatalytic sets constituting self-replicating, metabolically active entities predating the life forms known today. Experiments with such sulfides in an aqueous environment at 100°C produced a relatively small yield of dipeptides (0.4% to 12.4%) and a smaller yield of tripeptides (0.10%) although under the same conditions, dipeptides were quickly broken down.|$|E
