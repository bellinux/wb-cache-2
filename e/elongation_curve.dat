40|$|The <b>elongation</b> <b>curve</b> of RBC as {{determined}} by rheoscopy or ektacytometry (laser diffraction) resembles a rectangular hyperbola. The experimental data obtained so far included too large errors of measurement to allow precise mathematical description. The combination of laser diffraction with image analysis has im-proved ektacytometry considerably, such that the error of measurement is reduced to less than 0. 5 %. In laminar flow RBC of healthy donors are elongated elliptically (p ≤ 0. 001). Using the precise data of elliptical deformation, the <b>elongation</b> <b>curve</b> can be described to be hyperbolic. Hence, the double reciprocal plot gives a linear curve which- {{over a wide range}} of shear stress (15 to 500 dyn/cm 2) - fits well the experimental data (r ≥ 0. 99 : p ≤ 0. 001). The stress strain characteristics (i. e. <b>elongation</b> <b>curve)</b> can be described by two parameters: maximum elongation (Emax) and the shear stress needed for half-maximum elongation (KE). Mechanical stress only slightly reduces Emax but significantly shifts KE to higher values. Hyper-osmolarity decreases Emax and increases KE. Mild hypo-osmolarity (> 225 mOsm.) increases Emax and decreases KE, whereas strong hypo-osmolarity (≤ 225 mOsm.) decreases Emax and further decreases KE Inclusion of elongation data measured at shear stress < 15 dyn/cm 2 detoriates the linear correlation. The elongation coefficients measured for low shear stress are higher than calculated by linear regression. The same holds true for range of shear stress between 15 and 25 dyn/cm 2 if applied to RBC in hypertonic solu-tions or to cells which underwent mechanical stress. Further analysis of the laser diffraction patterns led us to suggest that at low shear stress the RBC become more or less oriented thereby presenting their side aspect (2. 2 µm ⋅ 8 µm) to the laser beam. The diffraction pattern then resemble to those of elongated RBC. At shear stress exceeding 15 dyn/⋅cm 2 the RBC rotate by 90 ° presenting their circular aspects (∅ 8 µm) which then become elliptically deformed by shear. 2...|$|E
40|$|Cylindrical bars made of {{low-carbon}} steel designated as DIN St. 37 {{were subjected to}} various amounts of torsion. The pretwisted bars were then sliced longitudinally and tested in pure tension up to fracture. The combination of a torsion-tension test was sufficient to initiate low-strain statie fractures provided that the twisting angle exceeded a strain limit. This exhaustion limit may correspond to an abrupt reduction of the remaining ductility, which {{may result in a}} brittle fracture of a notched member if it is tested in tension. The experimental study revealed important features of the influence of torsional prestrain on the embrittlement for low carbon steels and yielded the mode of exhaustion of ductility with the increase of twisting angle. The elongation at fracture versus twisting strain curve presents a shape of an equilateral hyperbola indicating that the larger part of ductility of the material is reduced rapidly for small amounts of prestrain, while the remaining part necessitates excessive amounts of pretwisting to be exhausted.

In all tests conducted on this material, creep curves showed only tertiary stage and the surface connected intergranular cracking was found to be dominant in creep fracture. It was shown that γ′ precipitate coarsening occurs in the bulk of the specimens and obeys the LSW kinetics. Metallographic analysis led to the conclusion that creep does not alter oxidation, except at grain boundaries, where oxide spikes can be developed under creep. Therefore grain boundary oxidation was found to be creep strain-assisted. A constitutive model accounting for precipitate coarsening was proposed. The oxidation-assisted intergranular damage and the oxidation embrittlement of the microstructure elements phenomena were successfully described using the continuum damage mechanics and the local ductility exhaustion laws, respectively.

40|$|Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber {{emerges as}} a {{dominant}} elastomer for major engineering applications. The major properties of EPDM are its outstanding heat, ozone and weather resistance ability. It has a good resistance to polar substances and steam condition too. In automobiles EPDM rubber has a common use as seals. This includes door seals, window seals, trunk seals and sometimes hood seals. Frequently these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to the movement of the door versus the car body. This is due to friction between the EPDM rubber parts and the mating surfaces. Thus, the contact iteration between the rubber sealing and the indenting object must be known to optimize the performance of rubber sealing. However, it is need less to mention that the behaviour of any viscoelastic material is very difficult to be predicted. In the present work various tribo-characteristics of EPDM rubber of different hardness have been evaluated utilizing the available laboratory test facilities in the Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. Compression tests have been carried out using ‘Instron’ to determine the flow behaviour of EPDM rubber of different hardness both in dry as well as under different conditions of lubrication. The flow behaviour like load -vs. - <b>elongation</b> <b>curves,</b> true stress -vs. - <b>elongation</b> <b>curves</b> and true stress -vs. - true strain curves have been drawn from the experimental data.

The hardness, again, depends on the proportion of carbon black (CB) content. Thus it can be stated that the flow behaviour can be governed by controlling the CB concentration in the EPDM rubber. Based on the experimental results conclusion has been drawn accordingly. Some of the important tribo-characteristics of EPDM have been highlighted.

However, the increase {{of the speed of}} a paper machine is accompanied by an increased number of web breaks due to internal stresses, which develops in the paper web, especially in the drying section. The drying process is not momentary, so the time-dependent (rheological) properties of the web affect paper behavior, in particular, the stress relaxation. In this work, the influence of loading force and such pulp properties as water content, composition, and degree of beating on the internal stress development and stress relaxation during drying were investigated. The mechanical properties of hand-made and industrially produced paper (kraft- paper and exercise-book paper) were evaluated prior to and during drying in order to optimize the conditions of the relaxation process. Further, the determination of stress dynamics in the structure of paper during relaxation and drying was carried out. It was determined that the web tension in the drying section should be kept below the value of the loading force in the effective point on the load- <b>elongation</b> <b>curve</b> in order to prevent web breakage. It was shown that the highest relaxation and the lowest increase of the internal stress was observed when the loading force was equal to one third of the breaking force (Fb). At loading of 1 / 10 Fb the highest stress development during drying took place in the samples with the highest water content. Relaxation had the highest compensating effect on paper with a dryness of 87 - 90 wt. % when the loading force was equal to one third of the breaking force. Investigation of the influence of beating degree showed that it was more important for the unbleached samples than for the bleached ones. Too fine beating is similar to the chemical effect during bleaching and makes the mechanical properties of unbleached pulp similar to the mechanical properties of bleached pulp.

40|$|The European Laboratory for Structural Assessment {{is able to}} test large {{structures}} on its reaction wall and strong floor. Conventional sensors are used to collect displacement, elongation and strain on particular points of the structures, but they are punctual, or integrate the information along lines. Furthermore, a typical experiment in ELSA involves huge forces applied to the structure, an action in antinomy with a perfect control of the boundary conditions. Beyond {{the fact that it}} permits to have field of observations, photogrammetry allows quick and accurate diagnostic of the setting of experiments, and characterisation of their boundary conditions. Thus, photogrammetry has been introduced in the laboratory complementarily to the traditional techniques. In some case, the structure is driven to a brittle ruin, which could possibly lead to the loss of costly sensors or camera. The study presented here is a first step to evaluate photogrammetry based on low-cost digital consumer camera. On the long term, it could permit {{to increase the number of}} low-cost camera while keeping information at a fair level. The experimental setting was composed of a cylindrical shell (length 6. 7 m, diameter 55 cm) of composite material anchored on the reaction wall and progressively bent by applying a torque at its free extremity. The zone under scrutiny was a joint linking two cylindrical subassemblies of the structure. A net of 13 x 9 targets (squares of side 22 mm) was disposed on the carbon fibre joint with a mesh step of approximately 35 mm. The cameras were two webcams Philips ToUcam Pro with CCD sensor of 640 x 480 pixels on 8 bits. The stereo set-up was calibrated with the method of Bouguet. The targets were identified through morphological image analysis. Their temporal positions on series of 57 images pairs- were measured by fitting ellipse to their internal circle and the 3 dimensional positions of the targets were obtained through usual geometric construction, correcting for distortion of the optics. The mean radius of the joint was found to be 556. 91 mm, in a zone where the joint-radius varies from 550 to 560 mm. At small deflections of the cylinder, we have compared the deflection normalised by the distance to the anchoring. The optical measurements are within 6 % of the reference value given by the deflection sensor positioned on the diametrically opposed side of the target network. The elongation was also measured between targets in line with the cylinder axis, and compared with the sensor disposed in the field of view. The reference <b>elongation</b> <b>curve</b> of extent 0 to 0. 25 mm- was framed by the optical measurements, which had a noise of 0. 02 mm.

40|$|The {{signatures}} of UHE proton propagation through CMB are pair-production dip and GZK cutoff. The visible manifestations of these spectral features are ankle, beginning of GZK cutoff in the differential spectrum and E_ 1 / 2 in integral spectrum. Observed in all experiments, the ankle is usually interpreted as transition from galactic to extra{{galactic cosmic rays}}. Using the mass composition measured by HiRes, Telescope Array (TA) and Auger detectors at energy (1 - 3) EeV, calculated anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays at these energies, and the <b>elongation</b> <b>curves</b> we strongly argue against {{the interpretation of the}} ankle given above. The transition must occur at lower energy, most probably at the second knee as the dip model predicts. The other prediction of this model, the shape of the dip, is well confirmed by HiRes, TA, AGASA and Yakutsk detectors, and, after recalibration of energies, by Auger detector. Predicted beginning of GZK cutoff and E_ 1 / 2 agree well with HiRes and TA data. However, directly measured mass composition remains a puzzle. While HiRes and TA detectors observe the proton-dominated mass composition, as required by the dip model, the data of Auger detector strongly evidence for nuclei mass composition becoming steadily heavier at energy higher than 4 EeV and reaching Iron at energy about 35 EeV. The Auger-based scenario is consistent with another interpretation of the ankle at energy E_a= 4 EeV as transition from extragalactic protons to extragalactic nuclei. The heavy- nuclei dominance at higher energies may be provided by low-energy of acceleration for protons E_max∼ 4 EeV and rigidity-dependent E_max^A =Z E_max for nuclei. The highest energy suppression may be explained as nuclei-destroying cutoff. Comment: Some changes according to the Referee report.

The studies revealed that tip growth angles and branching outgrowth angles could be regarded as normally distributed. Based on these results, a random model for directional growth of hyphal tips as well as directional growth of branches is proposed. This model shows <b>curved</b> <b>elongation</b> of hyphal tips, so that the morphological development of a mycelium up to the formation of a pellet is predicted, similar to that observed in nature...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} cell interactions during induction of skin appendages, {{we studied}} {{the roles of}} adhesion molecules N-CAM, tenascin, integrin, and fibronectin during feather development. Tenascin appeared in a periodic pattern on epithelia and was so far the earliest molecule detected in placodes. Three placode domains were identified: the anterior was positive for tenascin, the distal positive for N-CAM, and the posterior lacking both. Integrin appeared in dermalepidermal junctions of placodes. In feather buds, sagittal sections revealed a transient anterior-posterior asymmetry with tenascin and N-CAM enriched in the anterior mesoderm. Tangential sections revealed a lateral-medial asymmetry with tenascin distributed in a ring shape and N-CAM in an “X ” shape. Integrin was diffusely distributed within buds. Later tenascin and N-CAM were enriched in dermal papilla, the inducer of skin appendages. Perturbation of embryonic skin explant cultures with antibodies showed that anti-integrin fi 1 and anti-fibronectin blocked epithelial-mesenchyma 1 interaction, anti-N-CAM caused uneven segregation of mesenchymal condensation, and anti-tenascin inhibited feather bud <b>elongation.</b> Dose-response <b>curves</b> showed gradual effects by these antibodies. The results indicated that these adhesion molecules are independently regulated and each contributes in different phases during morphogenesis of skin appendages. 0 1992 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Autophagy is {{a process}} that is {{necessary}} during starvation as it replenishes metabolic precursors by eliminating damaged organelles. Autophagy is mediated by more than 35 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins that manifest in the nucleation, <b>elongation,</b> and <b>curving</b> of autophagosome membrane. We isolated a homolog of an ATG 13 gene from the transcriptome database of the larva of the mealworm beetle, Tenebrio molitor (designated as TmATG 13). The sequence analysis showed that TmATG 13 cDNA comprises of 1, 176 bp open reading frame that encodes a protein of 391 amino acids. Analyses of the structure-specific features of TmAtg 13 showed an intrinsically disordered middle and C-terminal region, rich in regulatory phosphorylation sites. The N-terminal Atg 13 domain show a HORMA (Hop 1, Rev 7, and Mad 2) fold containing conserved amino acid residues across the Atg 13 orthologs in insects. qRT-PCR revealed that TmATG 13 was expressed ubiquitously in all the developmental stages of insect. TmATG 13 mRNA expression was high in fat body and gut of the larval and adult stages of the insect. During ovary development and maturation, the TmATG 13 transcripts showed high expression until six days of development, followed by a significant decline. The prospective functions mediated by TmAtg 13 during autophagy will be clarified by further studies in the near future...|$|R

Their crystal structure, FT-IR spectra, thermal expansion were investigated. Additionally for named solid solutions complex thermal analysis was carried out. It was found that all samples were single-phased and had the structure of orthorhombically distorted perovskite and the lattice parameters vary slightly due to the small content of doping ions. There were absorption bands of La(Nd) –O and In(Cr, Mn) –O stretching vibrations on the FT-IR spectra. The frequencies and intensities of the absorption bands were simi-lar for obtained solid solutions. There were no anomalies caused by phase transitions at temperature de-pendences of <b>elongation.</b> The <b>curves</b> obtained by differential scanning calorimetry had no thermal effects.
