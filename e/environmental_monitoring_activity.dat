40|$|The present {{research}} project mainly {{focuses on the}} assessment of the eco-epidemiological role played by two emerging waterborne pathogens, Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium parvum, within the integrated urban water supply & management chain. While in the water environment, both protozoa develop a resistance form that grants them enhanced protection against the most commonly adopted drinking water and wastewater treatments. The two resistance forms are called cyst for Giardia and oocyst for Cryptosporidium, respectively. As water resources contaminants, the two protozoa figure as etiologic agents of two peculiar gastrointestinal parasitic infections, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, that can give rise to outbreaks both within the polluted waterworks served community and among people eventually swimming in contaminated recreational waters. An exhaustive bibliographic research has been carried out in order to fully characterize {{the state of the art}} on the Giardia and Cryptosporidium topic. Integrated data coming from a wide range of studies provided a detailed picture that describes both the national and international background by focusing on the two protozoa relevance, both under environmental and public health aspects. A compilation of reported analytical methods for the detection of Giardia and Cryptosporidium (oo) cysts in water samples was also obtained. Available protocols were mainly derived from clinical parasitology methods and resulted unfit for any <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>activity.</b> The core factor being responsible for this incompatibility was identified as method expensiveness, that proved to be too high for routine sample analysis. Within this theoretical background, the first goal was that of creating a novel analytical protocol for the detection of protozoa (oo) cysts in waters, compliant with target cost-effectiveness, sensibility, specificity, efficiency and versatility criteria. The operative procedure subsequently named Polypropylene-cartridge filtration method (PCF) was then implemented: first validated during a pilot survey of the Alto Vicentino aquifer, it was subsequently adopted for the monitoring program of the integrated urban water chain of Padua city (Italy), selected as main experimental model. The monitoring network is composed by 18 sampling sites and provides full insight of the presence and persistence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium along the whole system. In detail, investigated chain segments were: drinking water supply system (5 sites); sewage system and wastewater treatment plant (6 sites); receiving water body (5 sites) and marine recreational waters flanking the mouth of the river (2 sites). As additional and complementary activity, case-report studies about giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis outbreaks were collected and processed for the creation of the Giardiasis & Cryptosporidiosis Database (GCDB). Data inserted in the GCDB cover the period 1954 - 2012. However, they are not merely catalogued and interactively consultable, but were also used for the implementation of a predictive model for the estimate of an Index for the Water Resources Protozoan Contamination Risk (WRPPCI) ...|$|E

40|$|Near {{field and}} far field <b>environmental</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>activities</b> {{extending}} from the first launch of the Space Shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center have provided a database from which conclusions can now be drawn for short term, acute effects of launch and, to a lesser degree, long term cumulative effects on the natural environment. Data for the first 15 launches of the Space Shuttle from Kennedy Space Center Pad 39 A are analyzed for statistical significance and reduced to graphical presentations of individual and collective disposition isopleths, summarization of observed environmental impacts (e. g., vegetation damage, fish kills), and supporting data from specialized experiments and laboratory analyses. Conclusions are drawn {{with regard to the}} near field environment at Pad A, the effects on the lagoonal complex, and the relationships of these data and conclusions to upcoming operations at Complex 39 Pad B where the environment is significantly different. The paper concludes with a subjective evaluation of the likely impacts at Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 6 for the first Shuttle launch next year...|$|R
