500|$|Brown's {{trial began}} in Naha on May 26 with {{testimony}} from V. N.. Over {{the next three}} days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [...] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been coerced by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese prosecutors told her she could only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, [...] "Because he didn't attempt to rape me. Before, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> at him for throwing away my cell phone. But not now." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos {{became the}} focus of {{controversy}} over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about Blackwater USA employees who were killed and mutilated in Fallujah:"Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave {{men and women in uniform}} make in an entire month. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> that these mercenaries would leave their wives and children behind to enter a war zone on their own violition [...] So I struck back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 2011, Ailes {{was criticized}} for {{referring}} to executives of the public radio network NPR as [...] "Nazis" [...] for firing a news analyst, Juan Williams, after Williams had made remarks considered by NPR to be offensive. Ailes apologized to a Jewish group, but not to NPR, for using the expression, writing to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL): [...] "I was of course ad-libbing and should not have chosen that word, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> at the time because of NPR's willingness to censor Juan Williams for not being liberal enough...

2500|$|Andreas Deja {{declined}} {{to return to}} the film observing his more serious version of Yzma was incompatible with the wackier, comedic tone of the film, and moved to Orlando, Florida, to work on Lilo & Stitch. Animator Dale Baer would replace Deja as the supervising animator for Yzma. Fulmer would inform Sting by telephone that his songs, related to specific scenes and characters that were now gone, had to be dropped. Bitter about the removal of his songs, the pop musician commented that [...] "At first, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>angry</b> and perturbed. Then I wanted some vengeance." [...] Disney eventually agreed to allow three of the six deleted songs as bonus tracks on the soundtrack album such as Yzma's villain song titled [...] "Snuff Out the Light", the love song titled [...] "One Day She'll Love Me", and a dance number called [...] "Walk the Llama Llama". The plot elements such as the romance between the llama herder Pacha and Manco's betrothed Nina, the sun-capturing villain scheme, similarities to The Prince and the Pauper stories, and Inca mythology were dropped. The character of Hucua was also dropped from the story, though he would make a cameo appearance as the candle holder during the dinner scene in the finished film. Kuzco – who was a supporting character in the original story – eventually became the protagonist.|$|E
