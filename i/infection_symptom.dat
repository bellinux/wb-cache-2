40|$|Attempts {{to relieve}} the misery of the common cold have been made since long before current under-standing of its viral origin.

Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment combined with regular dosing until symp-toms subside appears to be the most effective treat-ment strategy to maximize therapeutic outcomes.

40|$|AbstractThe natural {{outcome of}} some plant–virus {{interactions}} is symptom recovery, which {{is characterized by}} the emergence of asymptomatic leaves following a systemic symptomatic <b>infection.</b> <b>Symptom</b> recovery is generally accompanied with reduced virus titers and sequence-specific resistance to secondary infection and has been linked with the induction of antiviral RNA silencing. Recent studies have revealed an unsuspected diversity of silencing mechanisms associated with symptom recovery in various host-virus interactions, including degradation or translation repression of viral RNAs {{and in the case of}} DNA viruses, transcriptional arrest of viral minichromosomes. RNA silencing may also contribute to symptom alleviation by regulating plant gene expression. In this review, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of various RNA silencing mechanisms in symptom recovery. We also discuss how a delicate equilibrium between RNA silencing and virus counter-defense responses in recovered leaves may help maintain virus titers at levels below the threshold required for symptom induction...|$|E

40|$|Several {{epidemiological}} studies using sensitive detection methodologies {{have confirmed that}} the majority of acute asthma exacerbations follow upper respiratory tract infections – common colds. Most of these colds are due to human rhinoviruses (RVs). RVs are able to reach and replicate in epithelial cells of the lower airways and can activate these cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators. Under some circumstances, RVs can also become cytotoxic to the epithelium. Atopic asthmatic individuals produce less interferon-γ and more interleukin- 10 than normal subjects in response to RV <b>infection.</b> <b>Symptom</b> severity as well as viral shedding after experimental RV infection, is inversely correlated with ‘atopic’ status, expressed as the interferon-γ to interleukin- 5 ratio.

40|$|In {{compatible}} {{interactions between}} plants and viruses {{that result in}} systemic <b>infection,</b> <b>symptom</b> development is a major phenotypic trait. However, host determinants governing this trait are mostly unknown, and the mechanisms underlying it are still poorly understood. In a previous study on the Arabidopsis thaliana¿Plum pox virus (PPV) pathosystem, we showed a large degree of variation in symptom development among susceptible accessions. In particular, Cvi- 1 (Cape Verde islands) accumulates viral particules but remains symptomless, Col- 0 (Columbia) sometimes shows weak symptoms compared with Ler (Landsberg erecta), which always shows severe symptoms. Genetic analyses of Col × Ler and Cvi × Ler F 2 and recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations suggested that symptom development as well as viral accumulation traits are polygenic and quantitative. Three of the symptom quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified could be confirmed in near-isogenic lines, including PSI 1 (PPV symptom induction 1), which was identified on the distal part of chromosome 1 in both RIL populations. With respect to viral accumulation, several factors have been detected and, interestingly, in the Col × Ler population, {{two out of three}} viral accumulation QTL colocalized with loci controlling symptom development, although correlation analysis showed weak linearity between symptom severity and virus accumulation.

40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is {{a natural}} defense mechanism against genetic stress factors, including viruses. A mutant hordeivirus (Barley stripe mosaic virus [BSMV]) lacking the γb gene was confined to inoculated leaves in Nicotiana benthamiana, but systemic infection was observed in transgenic N. benthamiana expressing the potyviral silencing suppressor protein HCpro, suggesting that the γb protein may be a long-distance movement factor and have antisilencing activity. This was shown for γb proteins of both BSMV and Poa semilatent virus (PSLV), a related hordeivirus. Besides the functions in RNA silencing suppression, γb and HCpro had analogous effects on symptoms induced by the hordeiviruses. Severe BSMV-induced symptoms were correlated with high HCpro concentrations in the HCpro-transgenic plants, and substitution of the γb cistron of BSMV with that of PSLV led to greatly increased symptom severity and an altered pattern of viral gene expression. The efficient systemic infection with the chimera {{was followed by the}} development of dark green islands (localized recovery from infection) in leaves and exemption of new developing leaves from infection. Recovery and the accumulation of short RNAs diagnostic of RNA silencing in the recovered tissues in wild-type N. benthamiana were suppressed in HCpro-transgenic plants. These results provide evidence that potyviral HCpro and hordeivirus γb proteins contribute to systemic viral <b>infection,</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, and RNA silencing suppression.

We searched electronic da-tabases from inception through May 2011 for any relevant clinical trials or observational studies. Two reviewers working independently extracted study characteristics, quality, and the outcomes of interest. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the relative risks (RRs) and the standardized mean differences (SMDs) across trials. Results. We found 4 eligible trials with varying quality, of which 3 were included in the quantitative analysis. Antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the incidence of infections (relative risk, 0. 76; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 64 to 1. 09), symptoms scores (SMD, – 0. 04; 95 % CI, – 0. 46 to 0. 38), and endoscopic scores (SMD, – 0. 09; 95 % CI, 0. 30 to 0. 13).

40|$|Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are {{considered}} one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract illnesses. An emergent human coronavirus was identified as the causal agent of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002 - 2003. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in worldwide populations. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of São Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001 - 2010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11. 5 %) of 1, 087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002 - 2004 and 2008 - 2009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24. 6 %), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24. 3 %) and renal transplanted patients (20. 2 %).

40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{silencing}} {{has been}} implicated in virus symptom development in plants. One common <b>infection</b> <b>symptom</b> in plants is the formation of chlorotic tissue in leaves. Chlorotic and healthy tissue co-occur on a single leaf and form patterns. It {{has been shown that}} virus levels in chlorotic tissue are high, while they are low in healthy tissue. Additionally, the presence of siRNAs is confined to the chlorotic spots and the boundaries between healthy and infected tissue. These results strongly indicate that the interaction between virus growth and RNA silencing plays a role in the formation of infection patterns on leaves. However, how RNA silencing leads to the intricate patterns is not known. Results Here we elucidate the mechanisms leading to infection patterns and the conditions which lead to the various patterns observed. We present a modeling approach in which we combine intra- and inter-cellular dynamics of RNA silencing and viral growth. We observe that, due to the spread of viruses and the RNA silencing response, parts of the tissue become infected while other parts remain healthy. As is observed in experiments high virus levels coincide with high levels of siRNAs, and siRNAs are also present in the boundaries between infected and healthy tissue. We study how single- and double-stranded cleavage by Dicer and amplification by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase can affect the patterns formed. Conclusion This work shows that RNA silencing and virus growth within a cell, and the local spread of virions and siRNAs between cells can explain the heterogeneous spread of virus in leaf tissue, and therewith the observed infection patterns in plants. </p...|$|E

Data from 3538 patients attending an HIV clinic in Kenya, Tanzania, or Namibia were captured through interview and medical record abstraction. Participants were categorized into three drinking categories: nondrinkers, nonharmful drinkers, and harmful/likely dependent drinkers. A proportional odds model was used to identify correlates associated with categories of alcohol use. Overall, 20 % of participants reported alcohol use in the past 6 months; 15 % were categorized as nonharmful drinkers and 5 % as harmful/likely dependent drinkers. Participants who reported missing a dose of their HIV medications [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) : 2. 04, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 67, 2. 49]; inconsistent condom use (AOR: 1. 49, 95 % CI: 1. 23, 1. 79); exchanging sex for food, money, gifts, or {{a place to stay}} (AOR: 1. 57, 95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 32); and having a sexually transmitted <b>infection</b> <b>symptom</b> (AOR: 1. 40, 95 % CI: 1. 10, 1. 77) {{were more likely to be}} categorized in the higher risk drinking categories.

40|$|Purpose: Objective {{diagnosis}} of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients prone to asymptomatic bacteriuria is compromised by local host responses {{that are already}} present and the positive urine culture. We investigated interleukin- 6 as a biomarker for nonfebrile urinary tract infection severity and diagnostic thresholds for interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils to differentiate between asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infection. Materials and Methods: Patients with residual urine and neurogenic bladders due to spinal lesions included in a long-term Escherichia coli 83972 asymptomatic bacteriuria inoculation trial were monitored for 2 years. Symptom scoring and urine sampling to estimate interleukin- 6 and 8, and neutrophils were performed regularly monthly and at urinary tract infection episodes. Results: Patients were followed in the complete study for a mean of 19 months (range 10 to 27) and those with asymptomatic bacteriuria with E. coli 83972 were followed a mean of 11 months (range 4 to 19). A total of 37 nonfebrile urinary tract infection episodes with complete data on interleukin- 6 and 8, neutrophils and symptom scoring were documented. Interleukin- 6 was the only marker that persistently increased during urinary tract infection compared to asymptomatic bacteriuria in pooled and paired intra-individual comparisons (p < 0. 05). Interleukin- 6 above the threshold (greater than 25 ng/l) correlated to more severe urinary tract infection symptoms (p < 0. 05). The sensitivity and specificity of all biomarkers were poor/moderate when differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria vs all urinary tract infection episodes. However, in urinary tract infections with worse symptoms interleukin- 6 and neutrophils demonstrated equal good/excellent outcomes. Conclusions: Triggered interleukin- 6 correlated to urinary tract <b>infection</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and demonstrated a promising differential diagnostic capacity to discriminate urinary tract infection from asymptomatic bacteriuria. Future studies should explore interleukin- 6 as a biomarker of urinary tract infection severity and assess the treatment indication in nonfebrile urinary tract infections...|$|E

This study aims to assess the effects of home monitoring on hospital admissions, quality of life, antibiotic requirements, exacerbation frequency, lung function, nutritional outcomes, anxiety, depression, costs and health outcomes, as well as the qualitative effects on the patient experience. METHODS This randomised controlled mixed-methods trial aims to recruit 100 adults with CF cared for in one large regional CF centre. Participants are randomly allocated 1 : 1 to the intervention group (twice-weekly home monitoring of symptoms measured by the Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary - Chronic Respiratory <b>Infection</b> <b>Symptom</b> Score (CFRSD-CRISS) and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV 1)) or a control group (routine clinical care) for the 12 -month study period. Measurements are recorded at study visits at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12  months. Spirometry, body weight, co-morbidities, medications, hospital inpatient days, courses of antibiotics (oral and intravenous), pulmonary exacerbations (defined by the modified Fuchs criteria) are recorded at each study visit. Health status, capability and health economics are measured at each study visit by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A), EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ- 5 D- 5 L) questionnaire and an adapted resource use questionnaire.
