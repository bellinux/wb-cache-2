5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} peace, established marriage ties with several rulers; his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun. Adud al-Dawla himself had several wives, which included; the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Bisutun; the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Manadhar, an Justanid king; and the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Siyahgil, an Giilite king. From these wives, Adud al-Dawla had several sons; Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah, from the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Manadhar; Abu Kalijar Marzuban, from the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Siyahgil; and Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, from a Turkic concubine. Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his mother and his uncle Fuladh ibn Manadhar as the heir of the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because of his more prominent descent, was appointed as heir of the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
40|$|Data were {{analyzed}} on 2 to 6 yr old cows to evaluate sire and family effects. Cows were {{produced in the}} McGregor Genomics Project from 13 embryo transfer (ET) full sib families (n = 188, F 2 Nellore-Angus (NA)) and 4 half sib natural service (NS) families (n = 114, out of 1 / 2 Brahman 1 / 2 British dams) from the same 4 F 1 NA sires. The ET and NS cows {{were analyzed}} separately and together as paternal half sibs (PHS). <b>Daughters</b> <b>of</b> bull 437 J had the highest calving rate and weaning rate; <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 551 G were the lowest in ET, and <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 297 J were the lowest in NS. Calves out <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 551 G were the heaviest at birth; those from <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 437 J were the lightest in NS and PHS. Calves out <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 297 J were the heaviest at weaning in ET and PHS, and those from <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 432 H were the lightest. Calves from <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 297 J and 437 J gained the most weight and those from <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 432 H gained the least. <b>Daughters</b> <b>of</b> 297 J and 551 G had longer and larger diameter teats and lower udder support scores (more pendulous) than <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 432 H and 437 J. <b>Daughters</b> <b>of</b> 437 J had the highest body condition score (BCS); <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 551 G were the lowest in ET and NS. Calves from <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 297 J had the highest BCS at weaning. Those out <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 551 G had the lightest WWT, those out <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 437 J were the heaviest in NS and PHS, and those out <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 432 H were the heaviest in ET. <b>Daughters</b> <b>of</b> 437 J and 551 G scored the highest for disposition (least docile) in ET and PHS, and <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> 432 H were lowest. The regression of WWT on weaning age was 0. 82 plus/minus 0. 07 in ET, 0. 71 plus/minus 0. 08 in NS, and 0. 78 plus/minus 0. 05 kg/d in PHS. There appears to be sufficient variation within and between these full sib and half sib families for use in QTL analysis for major genes affecting cow productivity in NA crosses...|$|R

40|$|Objective To compare {{clinical}} signs of puberty onset in <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia and normotensive pregnancies. Design Population based follow-up study. Methods In a cohort <b>of</b> 120 <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia pregnancies and 203 <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> pregnancies without pre-eclampsia, pubic hair growth and breast develop-ment were assessed at 11, 12 and 13 {{years of age}} by Tanner scores and by self-assessment. Results Compared to the normotensive group, pubic hair growth (pubarche) more often preceded breast development (thelarche) (risk ratio (RR) 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 3 to 4. 1) and thelarche less often preceded pubarche (RR 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 7 to 1. 0) in <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia pregnancies. Adjustment for birth weight and body mass index in early adolescence did not substantially infl uence these results, but increasing severity of pre-eclampsia strengthened the differences. Conclusions Pubarche tends to precede thelarche in <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia pregnancies compared to <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> normotensive pregnancies. This may refl ect a stronger androgenic infl uence in <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia pregnan cies {{at the beginning of}} puberty...|$|R

40|$|This {{case-control study}} {{compared}} the caregiving experience <b>of</b> adult <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents {{with and without}} dementia who resided in the community. A synthesis of diverse theoretical perspectives, developed by the researcher, provided direction for this study. The data used in the analysis were drawn from the 1991 - 92 Canadian Study of Health and Aging. A representative sample <b>of</b> 106 <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents with dementia and 45 <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents without dementia provided information regarding the context, stressors, and the level and correlates of depressive symptomatology associated with provision of care to parents. <b>Daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents with dementia tended to be slightly older, single or widowed, co-resided with their parent and used more formal care services when compared to <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents without dementia. Differences between groups were also found regarding the stressors they experienced while providing care. More specifically, <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents with dementia assisted with more personal and instrumental care. Their parent's functional status was more impaired and they contended with more behavioural disturbances and experienced greater burden than <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents without dementia. There were no statistical differences between groups with respect to mean scores on the CES-D scale. However, fully one quarter <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents with dementia and one fifth <b>of</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents without dementia achieved scores indicative {{of at least a}} mild level of depressive symptomatology. Finally, self-reported health, health interferences, the need for additional formal care services and feelings of caregiver burden were associated with depressive symptoms for both groups <b>of</b> <b>daughters.</b> In addition, for <b>daughters</b> <b>of</b> parents with dementia, depressive symptoms were associated with the provision of personal care tasks, behavioural disturbances and the functional status of parents.
