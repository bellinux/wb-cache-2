40|$|This {{appendix}} {{discusses the}} construction of <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> for both youth and parents, and outcome indices and a risk score index for youth. The general exposure and specific <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> are described in Section E. 1. The outcome indices are explained in Section E. 2. Finally, {{the construction of}} the risk score index is described in Section E. 3. E. 1 <b>Exposure</b> <b>Indices</b> The general <b>exposure</b> <b>index,</b> described in Section E. 1. 1, is based on questions that ask about exposure to anti-drug media messages through a variety of channels. The specific <b>exposure</b> <b>index,</b> described in Section E. 1. 2, is based on the specific National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign (Campaign) ads being broadcast during the 60 days prior to the respondent’s interview. Since each respondent was asked about recall of {{only a limited number of}} the ads, responses to the nonsampled ads were imputed for {{the construction of the}} specific <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> if they were eligible for inclusion.

40|$|The <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> is {{currently}} a method by which digital radiography manufacturers provide feedback to the technologist regarding the estimated exposure on the detector, as a surrogate for image signal-to-noise ratio and an indirect indication of digital image quality. Unfortunately, {{there are as many}} <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> values and methods as there are manufacturers, and in an environment with multiple vendors and a need to share data across institutions and dose registry databases, the situation is complicated. Fortunately, a new <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> of digital X-ray imaging systems has been implemented. Developed concurrently by the International Electrotechnical Commission and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine in cooperation with digital radiography system manufacturers, the index has been implemented as an international standard. As explained, the <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> does not indicate patient dose but rather a linearly proportional estimate of the incident radiation exposure to the detector. However, the use of the standardized <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> and its associated target <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> and deviation index values will likely lead to improved technologist performance in terms of uniformity and use of optimized radiographic techniques, leading to safer care of children needing radiographic examinations.

In order to evaluate the relation between ozone exposure and vegetation injury under on-field conditions, suitable ozone monitoring techniques were investi-gated. In {{the framework of a}} 5 -year research project aimed at ozone risk assessment on forests, both continuous analysers and passive samplers were employed during the summer seasons (1994 � 1998) in different sites of a wide mountain region (80 x 40 km 2) on the southern slope of the European Alps. Continuous analysers allowed the recording of ozone hourly concentration means necessary both to calculate specific <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes</b> (such as AOT, SUM, W 126) and to record daily time-courses. Passive samplers, even though supplied only weekly mean concentration values, made it possible to estimate the altitude concentration gradient useful to correct the altitude dependence of ozone concentrations to be inserted into <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes.</b> In-canopy ozone profiles were also determined by placing passive samplers at different heights inside the forest canopy. Vertical ozone soundings by means of tethered balloons (kytoons) allowed the measurement of the vertical concentration gradient above the forest canopy. They also revealed ozone reservoirs aloft and were useful to explain the ozone advection dynamic in mountain slopes where ground measurement proved to be inadequate. An intercomparison between passive (PASSAM, CH) and continuous measurements highlighted the necessity to accurately standardize all the exposure operations, particularly the pre- and postexposure conservation at cold temperature to avoid dye (DPE) activity.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct an {{exposure}} assessment for workers moving through the stray stationary field of common MRI scanners, performed according to the recent International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) Guidelines, which aim at avoiding annoying sensory effects. Theory and Methods: The analysis was performed through numerical simulations, using a high-resolution anatomical model that moved along realistic trajectories in proximity to a tubular and open MRI scanner. Both dosimetric indexes indicated by ICNIRP (maximum variation of the magnetic flux density vector and exposure index for the motion-induced electric field) were computed for three statures of the human model.

40|$|Two pivotal {{problems}} {{in determining whether}} exposure to herbicides has caused disease in Vietnam veterans or their offspring are definition of which troops were exposed and extent of exposure. The DoD HERBS tape is the most complete publicly available record of herbicide spraying in Vietnam. It contains about 17, 000 records consisting of coordinates of spray missions, dates, chemical agent, quantity and area sprayed, and mission purpose. We have developed a set of discrete and continuous indexes of probability of exposure to herbicides for individual veterans. These probability indexes are based on HERBS tape spray data and on locations and dates of service derived from a place-and-date matrix completed by the veteran. They can take into account a conservative estimate of environmental persistence of herbicide by using first-order exponential decay kinetics with an estimated half-life of dioxin. Mean values for the continuous exposure probability indexes were significantly greater among veterans judged to be exposed according to self-reported job titles and specific military experiences than among men judged unlikely to have been exposed. Probabilistic <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes</b> based on HERBS tape for classification of likely exposure to herbicides in South Vietnam during 1965 - 1971 appear to be well suited for comparative classification of veterans and hence for use in epidemiologic studies...|$|E

METHODS: Our study was a retrospective morbidity study based on 2024 subjects occupationally exposed to asbestos. The incidence of digestive cancer was calculated from 1 st January 1978 to 31 st December 2004 and compared with levels among the local general population using Standardized Incidence Ratios. Asbestos exposure was assessed using the company's job exposure matrix. RESULTS: Eighty-five cases of digestive cancer were observed within our cohort, for an expected number of 66. 90 (SIR = 1. 27 [1. 01; 1. 57]). A significantly elevated incidence, particularly notable among women, was observed for peritoneal mesothelioma, independently of exposure levels.

Most human As exposure occurs from consumption of drinking water containing high amounts of inorganic As (iAs). In this paper, epidemiological studies conducted on the dose–response relationships between iAs exposure via the drinking water and related adverse health effects are reviewed. Before the review, the methods for evaluation of the individual As exposure are summarized and classified into two types, that is, the methods depending on As concentration of the drinking water and the methods depending on biological monitoring for As exposure; certain methods may be applied as optimum As <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes</b> to study dose–response relationship based on various As exposure situation. Chronic effects of iAs exposure via drinking water include skin lesions, neurological effects, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, and malignancies including skin cancer.

The {{objective of this}} study was to characterize the exposure-response relationship for TGC against S. aureus in an immunocompromised BALB/c murine pneumonia model. Six S. aureus isolates were studied, and the TGC MICs for those isolates ranged from 0. 125 to 0. 5 mg/liter. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of TGC in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were evaluated, as was the level of protein binding of the compound in this murine species. Administration of TGC at 1. 56 to 150 mg/kg of body weight/day in single or two to three divided doses was used in the efficacy studies. TGC displayed linear PK and had a mean half-life of 10. 9 ± 2. 5 h. Efficacy was highly correlated with the area under the free concentration-time curve (fAUC) /MIC (r 2 = 0. 93). The 80 % and 50 % effective <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes</b> and the stasis exposure index were similar between the isolates (means ± standard deviations, 3. 04 ± 1. 12, 1. 84 ± 1. 3, and 1. 9 ± 1. 5, respectively).

40|$|Abstract The present {{work was}} aimed {{to study in}} {{petrochemical}} industry operators the correlation, if any, between environmental exposure to low levels of benzene and two biological <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes</b> in end-shift urine, i. e. trans, trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) and S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA). Exposure to benzene was assessed in 133 male subjects employed in outdoor operations in a petrochemical plant, using personal passive-diffusive air samplers worn at the breathing zone; adsorbed benzene was determined by GC-FID analysis. S-PMA was determined by a new HPLCMS/MS method, after (quantitative) acidic hydrolysis of the cysteine conjugate precursor. t,t-MA was measured by an HPLC-UV method. Smoking habits were assessed {{by means of a}} self-administered questionnaire. Both environmental and biological monitoring data showed that benzene exposure of petrochemical industry operators was low (mean values were 0. 014 ppm, 101 mug/g creat, and 2. 8 mug/g creat, for benzene, t,t-MA, and S-PMA, respectively) if compared with the ACGIH limits. Cigarette smoking was confirmed to be a strong confounding factor for the urinary excretion of both metabolites: statistically significant increases of t,t-MA and S-PMA levels were recorded in smokers when compared to non-smokers (p< 0. 0001). The best correlation found was that between exposure to benzene and S-PMA levels, particularly in non-smokers. This was partly due to the hydrolysis of the S-PMA precursor N-acetyl-S-(1, 2 -dihydro- 2 -hydroxyphenyl) -l-cysteine, a crucial step of the new analytical method used, which indeed reduced the variability of the results by means of an improved standardization of this critical preanalytical factor. A weaker correlation was found between exposure to benzene and t,t-MA, possibly {{explained by the fact that}} the latter is also a metabolite of sorbic acid, a common diet component. In summary, even at such low levels of exposure, urinary metabolites proved to be a useful tool for assessing individual occupational exposure to benzene, S-PMA appearing to be a more specific biomarker than t,t-MA, particularly in non-smokers...|$|E
40|$|A New Zealand Qualified Health Physicist (QHP) is required, {{under the}} Radiation Protection Act of 1965 and the Radiation Protection Regulations 1982, to perform {{auditing}} compliance tests on x-ray equipment {{at regular intervals}} {{to ensure that this}} equipment conforms to the Code of Safe Practice with the use of x-rays. The protocol for these tests must be approved by the National Radiation Laboratory (NRL). One of these test protocols sets out the requirements for the functionality testing of the x-ray machine Automatic Exposure Control (AEC). The current NRL protocol for AEC testing is based on the radiographic film environment (NRL C 5 1994). This protocol was tested to determine its applicability to the digital computed radiography (CR) imaging systems which are replacing screen-film systems. To begin this process a comparison of the different <b>exposure</b> <b>indexes</b> for each image medium was required. This proved to be achievable using a system of exposure dose comparison. The AEC test process for both image modalities follows identical requirements but differ slightly in the test methods used to achieve these. The most significant finding throughout this stage was not the differences between protocols but was the requirement to achieve consistent exposure index values over the clinical kVp range for each image medium. This requirement, applicable to any x-ray image medium, became the focus of this thesis. The thesis has explored through experimentation, the effect of optimisation of AEC kVp compensation for the variable kVp response of an image medium, on image consistency. At Christchurch Hospital where this investigation took place the work has shown that the performance of AEC devices can be optimised to improve image consistency, indicated by a more consistent exposure index over the clinical kVp range. The optimisation process also achieves a more consistent dose response to the image plate. A dose variation of 8. 3 % from the average was achieved compared to 26 % in the unoptimised version. No clinically significant changes to image quality were apparent in test images. Under these conditions it was found that AEC functionality could be assessed solely by the measurement of AEC dose to the image plate (IP). Use of this test method provides quantifiable time management benefits for the Medical Physicist and for the radiology departments in which they work. Thesis (M. Sc. (Med.

Blood sugar and blood pressure were determined and, the <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> that measures the relative levels of occupational exposure to pesticides was calculated. The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} level of blood adrenaline but no significant change in the noradre-naline level was observed. The activities of serum acetylcholinest-erase and monoamine oxidase were decreased. The systolic blood pressure was apparently increased in pesticide-exposed workers. The fasting blood sugar was significantly increased in people in the exposed compared to the control group. The <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> indi-cated a high chronic exposure level...|$|R

Forty-three urban priority junctions were carefully selected so that other than flow parameters expected to influence accident potential have similar values at the junctions considered. Using traffic accident data for five-year time periods and the corresponding 24 -hour flows, a new <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> is proposed consisting of {{an expression of the}} flows of the junction's interacting traffic streams. The regression of this <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> on the expected number of accidents per year at junctions of the type examined yields a quite satisfactory correlation coefficient, better than those achieved when other proposed indices are used...|$|R
