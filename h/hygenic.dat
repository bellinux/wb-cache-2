5000|$|It was {{not until}} the mid-nineteenth century that the origin of Second Empire {{architecture}} in the United States can be found. A series of major projects and events in French urban planning and design provided the inspiration for Second Empire architecture. Haussmann's renovation of Paris under Napoleon III in the 1850s and the creation of baroque architectural ensembles employing mansard roofs and elaborate ornament provided the impetus for the development and emulation of the style in the US. Haussmann's work was targeted to renovating the decaying Medieval neighborhoods of Paris by wholesale demolition and new construction of streetscapes with uniform cornice lines and stylistic consistency, an urban ensemble that impressed 19th century architects and designers. Additionally, the reconstruction of the Louvre Palace between 1852-1857 by architects Louis Visconti and Hector Lefuel was widely publicized and served to provide a vocabulary of elaborate baroque architectural ornament for the new style. Finally, the Exposition Universelle of 1855 drew tourists and visitors to Paris and displayed the new architecture and urbanism of the city, an event that brought the style to international attention. These developments worked together to excite interest in design under the Second Empire in the US, particularly among francophiles and those interested in French fashion, then under the sway of Empress Eugenie whose tastes influenced clothing, furniture, and interior decoration. Despite the historicism of the ornamentation, Second Empire architecture was generally viewed as [...] "modern" [...] and <b>hygenic</b> as opposed to the revival styles of Italianate and Gothic Revival which hearkened to the Renaissance and Middle Ages.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To compare ex vivo the {{penetration}} of three brands of gutta-percha cones, compacted under a constant force and heated to different temperatures, into artificial lateral canals. METHODOLOGY: Resin blocks with simulated main canals, each having two lateral canals (C at 6. 5 and A at 13 mm {{from the surface}} of the resin block), were selected. A gutta-percha cone, either Mynol MF, <b>Hygenic</b> MF or GT Tulsa 0. 04 was compacted into each main canal for 5 s using a wire rod with a diameter of 0. 7 mm soldered to the bottom of a metal cylinder, with a force of 2. 7 kg at controlled temperatures of 37, 42, 47, 52, 60 degrees C. The {{penetration of}} each brand of gutta-percha into 60 lateral canals (10 at each temperature) was measured using a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA, the Scheff√® test and the t-test. RESULTS: None of the three brands of cones entered up to 0. 1 mm within either lateral canal until a temperature of 47 degrees C was reached; at that temperature only Mynol cones (P < or = 0. 05) penetrated in four of 10 A-level canals (mean 0. 13 +/- 0. 19 mm) and in all 10 C-level canals (mean 0. 43 +/- 0. 12 mm). The A-level lateral canals were penetrated at 52 degrees C by Mynol cones (mean 0. 76 +/- 0. 34 mm) to a significantly greater distance (P < or = 0. 05) than Tulsa cones (mean 0. 31 +/- 0. 12 mm) and <b>Hygenic</b> cones (mean 0. 11 +/- 0. 08 mm). At 60 degrees C the Mynol cones (mean 1. 93 +/- 0. 34 mm) penetrated significantly more (P < or = 0. 05) than the Tulsa cones (mean 0. 86 +/- 0. 22 mm) and <b>Hygenic</b> cones (mean 0. 67 +/- 0. 19 mm). The C-level lateral canals were penetrated at 52 degrees C by Mynol cones (mean 0. 91 +/- 0. 29 mm) to a significantly greater distance (P < or = 0. 05) than Tulsa cones (mean 0. 47 +/- 0. 16 mm) and <b>Hygenic</b> cones (mean 0. 46 +/- 0. 15 mm), whilst no significant difference was found at 60 degrees C.

Among the mechanical methods, daily use of toothbrush is considered {{as the best way}} to achieve oral health. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate clinical and microbiological efficacy of <b>Hygenic</b> toothbrushes in plaque removal. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 40 volunteers were selected. Patients were randomly divided into two groups, one group received toothbrushes with battery and the other group received toothbrushes without the battery. At the beginning of the study plaque score was measured and recorded. Patients brushed for a week and plaque was measured again. Then in both groups the first toothbrush was taken and the second brush was received by the volunteers in a cross over manner. In this regard, the mirobiological samples (colony forming units) were determined before and after brushing. Data was analyzed by means of T- tests using the spss software. Results: The results showed that toothbrushes with and without battery reduced plaque score (respectively 98 / 22 % and 26 / 19 %). Colony forming units was reduced for both toothbrushes with battery (6 / 24 %) and without battery (9 / 5 %). This indicates that toothbrushes with battery significantly reduced plaque compared to the ordinary toothbrushes.

Two studies were conducted to determine the effects on the spinal column, flexibility and the level of discomfort people experience as a result of standing using Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes on six different industrial floor surfaces and four different foot conditions for periods of four hours on four consecutive days. The floor surfaces used included two types of anti-fatigue mats (<b>Hygenic</b> 1, Ergomat), three types of industrial grating (Metal Grating, Clean Room Grating, Standard Clean Room floor) and concrete. The foot conditions on concrete used included Converses All-Star athletic shoes, Dr. Scholl[] shoe inserts inside Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes, Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes with a footrail, and Reebok[] walking shoes. Spinal contour and flexibility was measured before and after each trial, as well as subjective ratings. Although there was no statistical significance for the floor surface or foot condition with regard to flexibility, the greatest loss of flexibility occurred with concrete and the least loss of flexibility occurred with <b>Hygenic</b> 1 for the floor surface study. For foot conditions, the participants lost the most flexibility with Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes with Dr. Scholl[] shoe inserts followed by Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes and then Reebok[] walking shoes. The least loss of flexibility occurred with the Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes with a footrail. Males, overall, lost more flexibility than females. This apparent loss in flexibility and lack of significant change in the other dependent variables suggests the muscles tense to maintain the proper curvature in the spinal column when undergoing stress. In the subjective discomfort analysis, no significant difference was found for either floor surface or foot condition. Across floor surfaces, significance resulted between gender in the neck, shoulders, upper back, lower back, thigh, knees, legs, and feet.

About 20 % of the gene complement shares homologies to other poxvirus proteins. Among the few unique MCV genes with known functions are an apoptosis inhibitor (vFLIP), an IL 18 -binding protein, a soluble IL 8 antagonist, and an Hrs-binding protein. MCV can be readily diagnosed clinically but may be confused with early-stage orthopoxvirus and herpesvirus lesions or other hyperproliferative skin conditions. Other viral agents can be excluded by electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Treatment consists of topical application of salicylic acid or removal by curettage...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{appears as}} arsenate-(III) but mainly as arsenate-(V) in geogene {{contaminated}} groundwaters. Beside the oxidation {{state of the}} arsenate the pH-value, the phosphate concentration {{as well as the}} volume of water which has to be treated plays an important role to choose a reliable treatment process method. To minimize arsenate-(V) coprecipitation on Fe(OH) _ 3, precipitation with Fe" 2 "+-ions or adsorption on activated alumina are useable. The loaded aluminium oxide can be regenerated by using NaOH. In special cases a nanofiltration is suitable for arsenic removal, which leads to <b>hygenic</b> safe solutions especially in individual supplies. The use of the granulated iron oxide in fixed-bed-adsorbers developed during the project is especially advantageous, because this material has much higher adsorptive capacity in comparison with the aluminum oxide. If arsenate-(III) appears in the water, an oxidation to arsenate-(V) is required. For oxidation of arsenate-(III) the oxidation agents Fenton's reagent (H_ 2 O_ 2) and Fe(II)) and potassium permanganate were tested. Furthermore, the following methods were tested: UV-induced oxidation, catalytic oxidation with activated carbon and oxidation with solid #delta#-manganese oxid. (orig.)
