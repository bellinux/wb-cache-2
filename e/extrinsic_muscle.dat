40|$|Diabetic foot {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{debilitating}} complications of diabetes and may lead to plantar ulcers. In the last decade, gait analysis, musculoskeletal modelling (MSM) and finite element modelling (FEM) have shown their ability to contribute to diabetic foot prevention and suggested that the origin of the plantar ulcers is in deeper tissue layers rather than on the plantar surface. Hence the aim of the current work is to develop a methodology that improves FEM-derived foot internal stresses prediction, for diabetic foot prevention applications. A 3 D foot FEM was combined with MSM derived force to predict the sites of excessive internal stresses on the foot. In vivo gait analysis data, and an MRI scan of a foot from a healthy subject were acquired and used to develop a six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) foot MSM and a 3 D subject-specific foot FEM. Ankle kinematics were applied as boundary conditions to the FEM together with: 1. only Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs); 2.

40|$|Hallux varus was {{observed}} in 69 feet among patients from a rural Indian population. This included three types of congenital hallux varus. The congenital "primary " type was the commonest and {{was not associated with}} any other foot deformity.

Hallux varus following chronic arthritis was part of a con-sistent pattern of foot deformities in which the first ray collapsed in a zig-zag manner in two planes. Although the development of hallux varus is often due to intrinsic muscle imbalance, hallux varus secondary to chronic arthritis seems to occur as a result of both intrinsic and <b>extrinsic</b> <b>muscle</b> imbalance associated with midtarsal and subtalar arthritis.

40|$|The {{biomechanics}} of a motor plant {{constrain the}} behavioral strategies that an animal has available to extract information from its environment. We used the rat vibrissa {{system as a}} model for active sensing and determined the pattern of muscle activity that drives rhythmic exploratory whisking. Our approach made use of electromyography to measure the activation of all relevant muscles in both head-fixed and unrestrained rats and two-dimensional imaging tomonitor the position of the vibrissae in head-fixed rats. Our essential finding is that the periodicmotion of the vibrissae andmystacial pad during whisking results from three phases ofmuscle activity. First, the vibrissae are thrust forward as the rostral <b>extrinsic</b> <b>muscle,</b> musculus (m.) nasalis, contracts to pull the pad and initiate protraction. Second, late in protraction, the intrinsicmuscles pivot the vibrissae farther forward. Third, retraction involves the cessation ofm. nasalis and intrinsicmuscle activity and the contraction of the caudal extrinsicmusclesm. nasolabialis andm. maxillolabialis to pull the pad and the vibrissae backward. We developed a biomechanical model of the whisking motor plant that incorporates the measured muscular mechanics along withmovement vectors observed from direct muscle stimulation in anesthetized rats. The results of simulations of the model quantify how the combination of extrinsic and intrinsicmuscle activity leads to an enhanced range of vibrissamotion than would be available from the intrinsic muscles alone.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine phalangeal joints motion of the index finger generated by each <b>extrinsic</b> <b>muscle.</b> Methods Ten (6 female and 4 male) fresh-frozen cadaveric hands (age 55. 2 ± 5. 6 years) were minimally dissected to establish baseball sutures at the musculotendinous junctions of the index finger extrinsic muscles. Each tendon was loaded to 10 % of its force potential and the motion generated at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints was simultaneously recorded using a marker-based motion capture system. Results The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) generated average flexion of 19. 7, 41. 8, and 29. 4 degrees at the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints, respectively. The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) generated average flexion of 24. 8 and 47. 9 degrees at the MCP and PIP joints, respectively, and no motion at the DIP joints. The extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and extensor indicis proprius (EIP) generated average extension of 18. 3, 15. 2, 4. 0 degrees and 15. 4, 13. 2, 3. 7 degrees at the MCP, PIP and DIP joints, respectively. The FDP generated simultaneous motion at the PIP and DIP joints. However, the motion generated by the FDP and FDS, at the MCP joint lagged the motion generated at the PIP joint. The EDC and EIP generated simultaneous motion at the MCP and PIP joints.

40|$|Although partial-hand amputees largely {{retain the}} ability to use their wrist, it is {{difficult}} to preserve wrist motion while using a myoelectric partial-hand prosthesis without severely impacting control performance. Electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition is a well-studied control method; however, EMG from wrist motion can obscure myoelectric finger control signals. Thus, to accommodate wrist motion and to provide high classification accuracy and minimize system latency, we developed a training protocol and a classifier that switches between long and short EMG analysis window lengths. Seventeen non-amputee and two partial-hand amputee subjects participated in a study {{to determine the effects of}} including EMG from different arm and hand locations during static and/or dynamic wrist motion in the classifier training data. We evaluated several real-time classification techniques to determine which control scheme yielded the highest performance in virtual real-time tasks using a 3 -way ANOVA. We found significant interaction between analysis window length and the number of grasps available. Including static and dynamic wrist motion and intrinsic hand muscle EMG with <b>extrinsic</b> <b>muscle</b> EMG significantly reduced pattern recognition classification error by 35 %. Classification delay or majority voting techniques significantly improved real-time task completion rates (17 %), selection (23 %) and completion (11 %) times, and selection attempts (15 %) for non-amputee subjects, and the dual window classifier significantly reduced the time (8 %) and average number of attempts required to complete grasp selections (14 %) made in various wrist positions. Amputee subjects demonstrated improved task timeout rates, and made fewer grasp selection attempts, with classification delay or majority voting techniques. Thus, the proposed techniques show promise for improving control of partial-hand prostheses and more effectively restoring function to individuals using these devices...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging {{plays an important}} yet underutilized {{role in determining the}} natural history and prognosis of oral carcinoma. Depth of tumour invasion is an emergent factor in the oral cancer literature. However, problems exist with the definition of cut-points suitable for inclusion in TNM staging criteria. Statistical methodology represents a possible explanation but is underexplored. In this work, a review of the depth of invasion literature is conducted with emphasis on statistical technique. As well, statistical simulation is used to explore the implications of the of the minimum p-value method. The results demonstrate that the use of continuous variable categorization and multiple testing is widespread, and contributes to cut-point variability and false-positive tests. Depth, as a predictor of OCLNM and survival, must be questioned. The volume of tumour invasion is a promising prognostic factor that has not been fully investigated in the oral carcinoma literature. In this work, the volume of tumour invasion is measured on MRI and compared to thickness and maximum diameter in its capacity to predict 2 -year all-cause, disease-related and disease-free survival, as well as occult cervical lymph node metastasis prediction. As part of a comprehensive approach, morphometric factors are incorporated into multifactor predictive models using regression, artificial neural networks and recursive partitioning. It is evident that MRI-based volume is superior all other linear measurements for both occult cervical lymph node metastasis and survival prediction. Artificial neural networks wee superior to all other techniques for survival prediction. There is a case for a unified artificial neural networks model for survival prediction that uses volume, midline invasion and N-stage to determine prognosis. This model can be used to determine individualized probabilities of 2 -year survival. The lateral extrinsic muscles of the tongue lie just {{beneath the surface of the}} lateral tongue, yet their invasion is a criterion for T 4 classification using the TNM staging system. In this work, the Visible Human Female is used to conduct an anatomic study of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue. Linear measurement is used to quantify the distance from the surface mucosa to the most superficial muscle fibres of the styloglossus and genioglossus. Further, the lateral extrinsic muscles are poorly demonstrated on MRI. An anatomic atlas of the tongue is fused with MRI images of oral carcinoma to demonstrate lateral muscle invasion. The results demonstrate that the styloglossus and hyoglossus lie very close to the surface of the lateral tongue, in some cases passing within 1 mm of the surface mucosa. These extrinsic muscles are readily invaded by even small tumours of the lateral tongue. Strict application of the TNM T 4 a criteria leads to unnecessary upstaging as these carcinomas do not warrant the prognosis and aggressive treatment of Stage IV disease. <b>Extrinsic</b> <b>muscle</b> invasion should be removed as a T 4 a criterion for the oral cavity. A separate category, T 4 a (oral tongue) specifying invasion of the genioglossus is also recommended. This work presented in this thesis is an original contribution to the field of oral cavity cancer research and has determined that there is capacity for improvement in current efforts to determine the natural history and prognosis of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. This thesis is the first to examine the role of statistical methodology in oral carcinoma depth of invasion cut-point variability. Further, this work presents an original approach to the prediction of regional metastasis and survival using advanced multivariate modeling techniques. No other work explored MRI-measured volume using the substantial sample size gathered in this thesis. Finally, this work is the first to demonstrate that lateral <b>extrinsic</b> <b>muscle</b> invasion is an unnecessary component of the T 4 a (oral cavity) classification criteria and should be reconsidered.
