40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for making a}} spring back behaviour of hole <b>expansion</b> in <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> Work is initiated for SAAb automobile and the geometry of model is created by using the software’s called Unigraphics and hyper mesh and secondly the simulation of the model is done in Ls-dyna to know the spring back behaviour of hole with various depth and positions of the punch. The yield strength of the element and stress, strain distribution and different radius of the blank are used to reduce the cracks at the lower edge of the blank. Steel material is used and {{the thickness of the}} material (0. 229 mm). The simulation of the work includes loading of punch and its displacement. This study demonstrates the efficiency of the model to simulate the hole expansion and better understanding of the expansion of radius and spring back angle.

50|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> {{which are}} the most {{prominent}} features of any Gas Works, were {{to be of the}} ‘disappearing type’ that is only visible {{to the extent to which}} they are inflated and moreover they were to be placed upon the lower level of the site, which would be planted to almost completely screen the structures. The idea to make the <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> as inconspicuous as possible seems to have been abandoned later as the other three <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> were added and, though they were also, ‘of the disappearing kind’, they were much higher than the first two and were more visible from the road. The <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> have become part of the skyline of the city and, rather than be an eyesore as the city anticipated in 1927, they are now regarded as a heritage landmark.|$|R

The second inspector summoned a mechanic who, less {{than half an hour}} later, arrived and removed the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> from the car.

5000|$|Flores argued {{he had an}} {{expectation}} of privacy in his <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> But the Court pointed out that a reasonable expectation of privacy is diminished at the international border. [...] "It {{is difficult to imagine}} how the search of a <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> which should be solely a repository for fuel, could be more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment." [...] Flores also pointed to the potential of a search like the one at issue in this case to cause damage to the vehicle. But the Court replied that the searches are not truly destructive, and that {{there was not a single}} accident among the [...] "many thousands of <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> disassemblies that have occurred at the border." [...] A <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> search is a brief procedure that can easily be reversed without damaging the vehicle, and if by chance the vehicle were damaged in the process, the owner could sue for damages.|$|R
5000|$|From 1977 to 1982, Chicano Roy was {{the first}} Hispanic {{motorcycle}} chopper builder to conquer the custom motorcycle magazine world, with his right-hand man, and youngest brother of 10, David Garcia.

Chicano Roy molded all types of motorcycle frame from stock to after-market to complete personal fabricated frames. Chicano Roy and Lil brother David also included in their arsenal of customizing the [...] "Frenched Spoon Seat", where the seat actually sat inside the frame, so you did not see a separation in between the frame and the seat. Laminations between the seat and the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> or recessed in the <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> Plus [...] "The Frenched Axle", where the large ugly back-wheel axle nuts did not protrude outward anymore; rather, they recessed flush with the new body of the frame; extreme front and back leg peaking.|$|R

50|$|Rogue's {{survival}} is ensured through clever {{use of the}} battlefield, which is generally rife with cover. He is able to fire while stationary, on the run, crouching, diving, and {{around the corner of}} any form of cover. Rogue also has the ability to unleash suppressive fire, which consumes a small amount of ammo and fires blindly from cover to intimidate enemies and cause them to find cover of their own. Enemies are highly susceptible to headshots, which will generally down them in a single strike. Another feature of gunplay is the ability to shoot an enemy soldier's <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> Targeting the head displays a skull and crossbones, while targeting the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> shows a rectangular shape.
