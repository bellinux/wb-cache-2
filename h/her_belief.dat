However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares <b>her</b> <b>belief,</b> but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E

Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the theme to be undeveloped.|$|E

5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E

5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she felt she could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E

Club member Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) discovers that his girlfriend Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) still believes in Santa Claus, and encourages the other members to visit a Christmas grotto to help reinforce <b>her</b> <b>belief.</b> To Artie's dismay, Brittany asks the grotto's Santa to restore Artie's ability to walk, which he agrees to do. Hoping to maintain her faith, Artie convinces football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) to go to Brittany's house dressed as Santa and explain that this particular wish cannot be granted. Santa's visit is not a success, and Brittany loses her Christmas spirit, but she later finds a gift for Artie underneath her Christmas tree—a ReWalk mobility device {{that allows him to}} stand and walk with the assistance of forearm crutches—which he demonstrates for the glee club. As Brittany tells the group that it must have come from Santa, Coach Beiste secretly observes the demonstration and smiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the {{publishing}} company Robert Hale brought out Valiente's second book, An ABC of Witchcraft, {{in which she}} provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente's Natural Magic, a discussion of what she {{believed to be the}} magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published Witchcraft for Tomorrow, in which Valiente proclaimed <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of Aquarius and espoused James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. It also explained to the reader how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 she offered a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that there would not be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, The Witch Ball, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the New York Review of Books. Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E

5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. <b>Her</b> <b>belief</b> in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E
5|$|Michael's {{hatred of}} Toby has been {{transferred}} to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly {{falls in love with}} her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's exit interview, which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.|$|E
5|$|The growing family, {{which came}} to include eight children, spent its winters in Berlin and summers in Potsdam; the year also usually {{included}} a stay in the country, {{to the delight of}} the children. In 1863 Vicky and Frederick purchased a run-down property and refurbished it into a farm, allowing the family to periodically experience a simple country life. Frederick was a loving husband, but as an officer in the Prussian army, his duties increasingly pulled him away from the home. Vicky was an intellectually demanding mother who expected her children to exhibit moral and political leadership, and in her husband's absence she carefully supervised their education and upbringing. Shortly after arriving in her new adopted country, Vicky observed the continuous arguments and intrigues within the Prussian royal family. This bolstered <b>her</b> <b>belief</b> in the superiority of English culture; she raised her children in English-style nurseries, and successfully fostered a love of her native country by incorporating aspects of English culture in the home and taking them on frequent trips to England.|$|E
