Taking the Ordos rangelands in China as a case study, this paper explores the potential of remote sensing to assess in dryland areas the impacts of policies on the environment.

On one hand, policies have aroused the enthusiasm of people in agricultural production and sand-control leading to the recovery of about 2618 km 2 of desertified rangeland and sandy land, and economic growth, on the other hand, provoked vegetation degradation with an accumulated area of 2439 km 2 when policies cannot reconcile the conflict between environmental protection and the interest of rural people.

(2) To what extent was there general agreement of perceptions within and between the surveyed groups as to the selected reform recommendations?

A modification of the Delphi Technique was used. Participants rated their perceptions of the desirability, impact, and <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> 22 selected recommendations. ^ Data Analysis. Data were analyzed to determine degree of agreement between groups and among subgroups. Statistical treatment of data utilized the t-ratio and Spearman Rank Difference. ^ Findings. (1) Significant differences in perceptions between participant groups were in degree of agreement, not in disagreement of desirability or impact of recommendations. (2) Participant groups perceived <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> recommendations similarly with one exception.

40|$|Abstract. According to {{research}} to date, sprawl negatively affects {{the lives of}} millions of Americans annually. Fortunately, in the U. S., several states have designed and enacted growth management programs to curb its expansion. But have they been effective? Following up on work by just a handful of other research teams, we control for land area, population, fuel cost, per capita income, passenger-miles of public transportation use, congestion, and crime rates as factors causing change in land area in a 1982 - 2005 panel data of 85 metropolitan areas. We examine so-called “smart growth ” programs by state from their effective <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> rather than their enactment dates. We find that anti-sprawl policies only in the State of Washington seem to curb sprawl. Additions to highway mileage induces sprawl in metropolitan areas regardless of the status of state smart growth programs. In contrast, additions to principal arterials roadways appear to increase sprawl only in states without smart growth programs. So transportation planners in smart growth states may be “damned if they do and damned if they don’t ” since not only does highway building cause sprawl but so does the non-build alternative since it results in greater congestion, which also seem to induce sprawl there. Finally, we find evidence that reducing central-city violent crime rates and increasing fuel costs also appear to most effective in reducing sprawl...|$|R

50|$|Hywel’s name is {{associated}} with the laws of Medieval wales, which are commonly known as the Laws of Hywel Dda (Welsh: Cyfraith Hywel). None of the law manuscripts can be dated to Hywel’s time, but Hywel’s name is mentioned in the prologues to the laws. These describe how Hywel gathered expert lawyers and priests from each commote in Wales together in Tŷ Gwyn ar Daf (which is thought to have been close to Whitland, Carmarthenshire) in order to revise and codify the Laws of Wales. The story in the prologues lengthens with time, with more details in the later versions of the prologue. It seems highly unlikely that this meeting actually took place, with the purpose of the prologues being to emphasize the royal and Christian origin and background to the laws, and that in the face of criticism of the laws from outside Wales especially during John Peckham’s period as Archbishop of Canterbury. Nevertheless, his name continued to be associated with Welsh law which remained in active use throughout Wales until the appointed <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> of the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 of Henry VIII of England who asserted his royal descent by blood-line from Rhodri Mawr via Hywel Dda.|$|E

Later, this lineage led to possibly the most well known of all the medieval kings of Wales, Hywel Dda, who came to rule most of Wales, and became synonymous with the codification of medieval Welsh law which became famed for a reputation of justice and early recognition of women's rights.
