First, coding and scheduling schemes are derived that minimize the number of transmissions needed for each node to broadcast one packet. For stochastically varying traffic, the stable throughput is then compared under both digital and analog network coding schemes. The initial analysis focuses on a network with a single relay. Extensions to arbitrary terminal-relay configurations are then outlined for a general multihop network. Backpressure-like algorithms for jointly achieving throughput optimal scheduling and network coding are given for each network coding scheme...|$|R

In the traditional TWRC setup, one terminal would send its message to the relay in the first time slot, the other terminal would use the second time slot for its message and the relay, after applying network coding, would send in the third time slot, the sum of the previously received signals. As the relay only needs the sum of the messages, by using PLNC, the terminals can transmit their signals simultaneously to the relay, in the same time slot, and the relay would then send this sum of the signals in the following time slot, hence, reducing the total required number of communication stages to only two time slots [19, 36].|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} two-way relay {{communication systems}} in cognitive radio environments. The proposed model includes two subsystems: a primary {{system and a}} secondary system. The primary system consists of a primary transmitter and a primary receiver while the secondary includes two <b>terminals</b> <b>exchanging</b> their data via an intermediate relay node. Each network node {{is equipped with a}} single antenna and operates under a half-duplex mode. The channel state information (CSI) interference from the secondary node to the primary receiver is assumed imperfect. Using analytical methods, this paper derives the interference probability from the secondary system to the primary receiver and an optimal back-off control power coefficient for the secondary transmitter. To evaluate the secondary system quality, an explicit expression for the system outage probability (OP) and its closed form in the high signal-to-noise region (SNR) is presented. Theoretical results are verified using Monte-Carlo simulation.|$|R

Moreover, the schemes are applied in public safety vehicular networks, where Long Term Evolution (LTE) network {{is used for the}} long range link, while IEEE 802. 11 p is considered for inter-vehicle collaboration on the short range links. Finally, relay-based multicasting is applied in high speed trains for energy and delay minimization.

40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{distributed}} and self-organized network, where wireless <b>terminals</b> <b>exchange</b> network information with neighbor terminals and construct a multi-hop network.

In this thesis, we first focus on a commercially available ad hoc wireless network system, the Flexible Radio Network (FRN). This system uses a proprietary protocol that provides multiple-route management and hop-by-hop transmission acknowledgement. We discuss the system performance, which was evaluated through simulations regarding the data-link and routing protocol of the FRN to clarify the system's basic properties, and then explain some FRN problems that degrade the system performance. After that, we describe techniques to improve the performance. These techniques are aimed at improving the system parameter setting adaptively or at remedying the problems statically. Through simulation results, we show how the techniques improve system performance...|$|R

30|$|Motivated by the {{interest}} of two-way relay-assisted system, as our major contribution, we will derive closed-form expressions of the ergodic rate for the proposed relay-assisted strategy, and investigate the effects of noise, the predetermined ratio, the received power of signals including the desired signal, and the interference. Two {{cases in which the}} relaying terminal has the same (symmetric) and different (asymmetric) received power from the two <b>terminals</b> <b>exchanging</b> information are considered. We then study the performance for the weak interference case and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) case. The approximations of ergodic rate for these cases are derived respectively. Based on these approximations, we present closed-form power allocation strategies which involve several key system coefficients and can be easily implemented. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of the analysis results and show the tightness of our approximate results. The improvement of the ergodic rate by using the power allocation strategy also can be found from the numerical results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical result that is applicable for D 2 D communication with two-way DF relaying.|$|R
40|$|Cooperative ad hoc {{networks}} for the efficient distribution of content of common interest are {{studied in the}} case of fast channel variations. Mobiles are grouped into cooperative clusters for the purpose of receiving the content with optimized energy efficiency. Data are sent to mobile terminals on a long range (LR) link, and then, the <b>terminals</b> <b>exchange</b> the content by using an appropriate short range wireless technology. When channel state information is available for the LR links, unicasting is used on the LR. When accurate channel state information is not available, threshold-based multicasting is implemented on the LR. Energy minimization is formulated as an optimization problem for each scenario, and the optimal solutions are determined in closed form in scenarios with fast channel variations. Results show significant energy savings in the proposed schemes compared with the noncooperative case and other previous related work. Furthermore, the energy minimizing solutions are shown to lead to reduced delay in the content distribution process. Practical implementation aspects of the proposed methods are also discussed. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a novel {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{to enhance the}} spectral efficiency of a two-way cooperative relaying system, where two source <b>terminals</b> <b>exchange</b> information directly and via K intermediate relays using the three-phase two-way decode-and-forward (DF) protocol. Signal space diversity (SSD) is incorporated into the two-way cooperative relaying system in the proposed scheme that exploits the inherent diversity in the modulation signal space by rotating and expanding the ordinary constellation. The proposed SSD-based three-phase two-way DF relaying scheme exchanges four symbols in three time slots and thus doubles the spectral efficiency {{as compared to the}} conventional three-phase two-way DF relaying system, where six time slots are required to exchange the same four symbols. This improvement in spectral efficiency is achieved without adding any extra complexity, bandwidth, or transmit power. A comprehensive analysis of the proposed scheme is carried out in this paper, and closed-form expressions for various performance metrics, including error probability, outage probability, and channel capacity, are derived. It is shown that the proposed scheme provides a diversity gain equal to one higher than the number of relays. The paper also studies different schemes for the optimization of relay position and power allocation. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are performed which confirm the validity and accuracy of the analytical framework.|$|R
