40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{acoustic}} foams are good high frequency sound absorbers but poor low frequency sound absorbers. It is also known that active noise control systems do not typically work well at high frequency due to the increasing order of the physical system model and increased computational demands. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to use both passive and active systems in combination. In this thesis, the use of the passive absorber (acoustic foam) as the secondary sound source for an active noise control system is examined. The combination of the passive and active noise control systems should provide space and weight savings. Potential applications include aircraft and automobiles. ^ Simple analytical models are used here to examine several basic 2 ̆ 2 smart 2 ̆ 2 foam configurations {{to determine the effects of}} foam thickness and actuator location. More complicated analytical models using spatial Fourier series representations of the sound fields are then used to model more practical 2 ̆ 2 smart 2 ̆ 2 foam features. Models are presented for <b>foam</b> <b>backed,</b> perforated panels. One of these models has been used to calculate the random incidence absorption coefficients for a <b>foam</b> <b>backed,</b> perforated panel. ^ Two experiments are described [...] one with adaptive control and one without adaptive control. In the adaptive control experiment, a two coefficient adaptive controller was used to achieve a 40 dB reduction in the error signal proportional to the reflected sound pressure. In the other experiment, the control requirements for a 2 ̆ 2 smart 2 ̆ 2 foam were measured and compared with analytical model results. The measured and predicted results agreed with reasonable precision at high frequency, but at low frequency the measured control effort is higher than that predicted. This behavior was attributed to nonlinear specimen behavior. ^ Several methods of 2 ̆ 2 smart 2 ̆ 2 foam control have been examined, including the incorporation of the error microphones into the foam. Actuation methods such as PVDF films, piezo-foam, ferro-foam, ceramic piezoelectrics, electromechanical shakers, and electrostatic drivers were examined. ...|$|R

50|$|Parallel to the US {{development}} of “ice pick” vests, the British police, PSDB, {{was working on}} standards for knife-resistant body armor. Their program adopted a rigorous scientific approach and collected data on human attack capacity. Their ergonomic study suggested three levels of threat: 25, 35 and 45 joules of impact energy. In addition to impact energy attack, velocities were measured and {{were found to be}} 10-20 m/s (much faster than the California test). Two commercial knives were selected for use in this PSDB test method. In order to test at a representative velocity, an air cannon method was developed to propel the knife and sabot at the vest target using compressed air. In this first version, the PSDB ’93 test also used oil/clay materials as the tissue simulant backing. The introduction of knives which cut fiber and a hard-dense test backing required stab vest manufacturers to use metallic components in their vest designs to address this more rigorous standard. The current standard HOSDB Body Armour Standards for UK Police (2007) Part 3: Knife and Spike Resistance is harmonized with the US NIJ OO15 standard, use a drop test method and use a composite <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> as a tissue simulant.

40|$|Using {{sacrificial}} templates {{to create}} 3 D structures is commonly employed in various {{fields such as}} tissue engineering and water remediation to create complex and high surface area scaffolds. Herein, several sacrificial templating techniques are tried, tested, and evaluated and several methods for creating 3 D porous material are discussed, including: solvent casting particulate leaching (SCPL) and simple sugar and salt leaching. The porous material is then integrated with polymer soft lithography patterning to create a single functionally graded adhesive (FGA) material to use in dry adhesive applications. The use of a soft <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> layer helps to improve the compliance and flexibility of the adhesive pad, thus enhancing peel tolerance, buckling, and deflection and vibration resistance. A dry FGA based on film-terminated silicone foam is developed utilizing the polymer foam's capacity to absorb large amounts of energy and so deliver high adhesion and peel resistance. The fabrication technique is based on simple sugar cube templating of common elastomers, followed by film termination of the polymer cubes using the same material. Dependencies of the pull-off adhesive force and energy release rate on preload and foam thickness are systematically investigated {{through a series of}} axisymmetric indentation/de-bonding tests. The contribution of the <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> layer to the overall compliance and adhesion is analysed and discussed. The developed elastic film-terminated structure strongly enhances the pull-off force and work of adhesion, and can be employed in the transport of delicate objects, as demonstrated in the pick and place of a silicon wafer. Furthermore, the proposed foam-based FGAs can be readily detached from the adherent surface by applying shear deformation between the pad and the surface. This research clarifies the role of mechanical graded properties in adhesion and can have technical implications {{in the development of a}} simple but effective dry adhesive material for mounting and transporting objects using automated robotic devices. The film terminated dry adhesive pads were further developed to investigate the feasibility of using a <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> material as a universal platform to improve the adhesive properties of other terminal surface morphologies. Integrating other fast prototyping technologies as an alternative to lithographic templating techniques, scaled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) 3 D printed mushroom capped terminal structures are determined to be comparable to polyacrylate microstructure templated moulds. The effect of the foam is systematically evaluated using a similar axisymmetric indentation/de-bonding test with a probe of a large radius of curvature. Contact splitting through the control of terminal structures in both micro and millimetre scales shows improved contact properties with the addition of <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> material. The mushroom capped adhesive pads are employed to demonstrate shear peel tolerance and cold temperature surface tolerance demonstrations. Lastly, various sugar and salt templating techniques are explored and optimized for consistency and repeatability to select the material most suitable for current research. Statistical analysis is used in the selection process. A linearly approximated model to determine the pull-off force from foam porosity and stiffness parameters are reported as sample candidates. Model estimates find that the density of sugar granules and the applied preload force are the mostly significant contributors to increasing pull-off force...|$|E
30|$|In real situations, the {{observations}} may be censored at a pre-specified level because {{of time and}} cost limitations. Moreover, the variable-competing risk may be considered as well which censors the values of response quality variables. For example, {{it is not possible}} to record the values of bond strength accurately when the tensile strength of adhesive bond between vinyl fabric and PVC <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> is monitored and evaluated. This problem would happen due to the failing of the <b>foam</b> <b>backing</b> sooner. Then, this kind of censoring is introduced as a variable-competing risk which cannot be easily neglected for the sake of proposing optimal monitoring schemes. It is significant that the main assumption of all the above-mentioned researches is that {{the observations}} were recorded with no fixed and variable censoring, even though the location-scale and log-location-scale distributions have been addressed. Censored observations at fixed level are considered for monitoring in Steiner and MacKay (2000). In addition, Steiner and MacKay (2001) proposed exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart based on the conditional expected value to monitor the bond strength values which are censored under the competing risk variable. Moreover, the EWMA control chart is used to monitor the mean of censored lifetimes when censoring occurs at fixed level (Zhang and Chen 2004; Lu and Tsai 2008). Then, some control charts are developed to monitor the time-to-failure data in the presence of right censoring using rank tests (Li et al. 2012; Li and Kong 2015). The base of these control charts is using the rank statistics to derive the generic formula for the operating characteristic functions of the control chart.|$|E
40|$|The organic {{emissions}} from textile floor coverings were studied {{in a test}} chamber (1 m" 3) at 23 C, 45 % r. H. and an air exchange rate of 1 h"-" 1. The gaseous compounds were collected on Tenax. They were analyzed by thermodesorption coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Eight textile floor coverings (four with textile backing and four with styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) <b>foam</b> <b>backing)</b> were investigated. The time dependence of the emissions of eleven dominating organic compounds (toluene, m/p-xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 4 -methylideneheptane, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6 -Pentamethyl- 3 -hepten, 4 -Phenylcyclohexene, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane and limonene) was determined. The decrease of the concentration with time reflects the volatility of the compounds. The concentration of the volatile compounds such as toluene, m/p-xylene, ethylbenzene and styrene decreases within 24 h by more than 90 %, while the concentration of the less volatile compounds, such as 4 -Phenylcyclohexene, decreases within 100 h by only 50 - 70 %.

40|$|A {{computational}} fluid dynamic (CFD) {{model has}} been developed for the simulation of slag foaming on bath smelting slag (CaO–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –FeO) by considering foam as a separate phase. The CFD model {{has been used to}} predict the foam height, bubble number density and the multiphase flow phenomena in the system. The height of foam is dynamically balanced by the formation of foam due to transformation of both gas and liquid into foam and its destruction due to liquid drainage and bursting of bubbles, transforming <b>foam</b> <b>back</b> to liquid and gas. The bubble break-up and coalescence were considered in gas–liquid dispersion whereas in the foam layer, the bubble coalescence due to film rupture was incorporated. A population balance modeling was used to track the number density of different bubble classes and fixed pivot method was used to discretize the population balance equation. The model predicted the foam height of the slag system (CaO–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –FeO). The content of FeO was changed and its effect on the foam height predicted. The foaming index was calculated and the results from the model predict that the foaming index decreases with increase of FeO content in slag. The CFD model also predicts that the foaming index of a slag with Al 2 O 3 is higher than that of slag without Al 2 O 3. Dimensionless analysis was performed based on the model available in the literature to correlate the foaming index with the physical properties of the slag. The predicted results from the present study are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that all the {{discussed}} processes are assumed to have two stages and the outgoing quality characteristic has been censored. However, there exists a real case dealing with cotton spinning in which the three quality characteristics are Fiber Length, Fiber Strength, and Skein Strength. If the fiber length was to change, it would lead to change in the fiber strength. Moreover, a change in any of the two quality variables would affect the skein strength of the spun cotton. Obviously, fiber strength and skein strength are the reliability-related quality characteristics which bring about censored observations for the second and third stages. Considering the mentioned example and the concept of variable-competing risk discussed in the case of adhesive bond between vinyl fabric and <b>foam</b> <b>backing,</b> we address a three-stage process in which the quality characteristics of both the second and third stages evaluate and reflect the reliability of product. Thus, we use the residuals to construct the CSC and monitor the outgoing quality characteristic. It is remarkable that the proposed monitoring schemes are extended when the censoring occurred in these stages. As mentioned before, the lognormal distribution is widely used to model the reliability data. Furthermore, it is assumed that these reliability-related quality characteristics follow the lognormal distribution.|$|E
