40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> {{distribution}} under the fore-foot areas with and without Hallux Valgus deformity. Hallux Valgus (HV) is one of the most common foot deformities. Plantar <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> in HV patients has been widely studied in previous published papers to identify HV condition according to their plantar <b>force</b> <b>pattern.</b> This condition occurs by the ratio of two to one women to men. People with HV have altered pressure pattern. As 23 % of people develop such condition, studying and understanding the plantar <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> is essential. Furthermore, speed of walking has an effect on force changes under the foot. So in order to examine the effect of different walking speeds on plantar <b>force</b> <b>pattern,</b> twenty people ten with and ten without HV took part in the test by walking on the pressure mat. The results showed that the variability in <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> in the same individual was significant from one trial to another which can be concluded that obtaining consistent <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> is an issue to overcome. After getting consistent force readings, it was observed that the higher load was under the 2 nd and 3 rd metatarsal heads in people with HV which was significantly different from non-HV participants. There are contradictory opinions in previous published papers on plantar pressure pattern as a means of identifying HV. Furthermore, analysing <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> is a hurdle to overcome. As walking speed has significant effect on plantar pressure patterns, the study of this issue is badly needed...|$|E

Forces generated via intraspinal microstimulation at different hindlimb positions were recorded and interpolated, generating representations of force patterns at the paw. Electromyographs (EMGs) of hindlimb muscles, medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, and biceps femoris posterior, were also collected to examine relationships between activated muscles and <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> types.

With region foot pain, gait abnormalities may arise and affect the plantar pressure and <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> utilized. Therefore, this study’s purpose was to evaluate plantar pressure and <b>force</b> <b>pattern</b> differences between adults with and without region-specific foot pain. Methods.

Individuals with distal foot (forefoot or toes) pain had similar maximum vertical forces under the pain region, while those with proximal foot (rearfoot or midfoot) pain had different maximum vertical forces compared to those without regional foot pain (referent).

However, very {{few studies have been}} reported on the usage of acoustic <b>force</b> <b>patterning</b> for the rapid arrangement of biological objects, such as cells, in a three-dimensional (3 D) environment. In this study, we report on a bio-acoustic <b>force</b> <b>patterning</b> technique, which uses surface acoustic waves (SAWs) for the rapid arrangement of cells within an extracellular matrix-based hydrogel such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA). A proof-of-principle was achieved through both simulations and experiments based on the in-house fabricated piezoelectric SAW transducers, which enabled us to explore the effects of various parameters on the performance of the built construct. The SAWs were applied in a fashion that generated standing SAWs (SSAWs) on the substrate, the energy of which subsequently was transferred into the gel, creating a rapid, and contactless alignment of the cells (< 10 s, based on the experimental conditions). Following ultraviolet radiation induced photo-crosslinking of the cell encapsulated GelMA pre-polymer solution, the patterned cardiac cells readily spread after alignment in the GelMA hydrogel and demonstrated beating activity in 5 – 7 days. The described acoustic force assembly method can be utilized not only to control the spatial distribution of the cells inside a 3 D construct, but can also preserve the viability and functionality of the patterned cells (e. g. beating rates of cardiac cells). This platform can be potentially employed in a diverse range of applications, whether it is for tissue engineering, in vitro cell studies, or creating 3 D biomimetic tissue structures...|$|R

40|$|The forces induced in tiny wrist joint ligaments must be {{estimated}} {{in order to}} understand their role in the mechanism of the joint. We estimated forces in a number of selected ligaments in seven human wrist joint specimens, using a noninvasive method. The method is based on the rationale that the force generated in a ligament depends on its change of length with the joint under load. In vitro length changes of the ligaments were determined during flexion and deviation movements of the hand, using a roentgenstereophotogrammetric analysis technique. Subsequently, bone-ligament-bone (BLB) preparations were dissected from the specimens. From these BLB preparations the zero-force length and the force-elongation relationship were determined in a material testing machine. The forces generated in the ligaments during flexion and deviation were calculated by combining results on the in vitro ligament length changes, the zero-force length, and the force-elongation relationship. Large interspecimen variations of the <b>force</b> <b>patterns</b> were found. Due to this variability, {{it is not possible to}} obtain quantitative models for the kinetic behavior of the ligaments. However, qualitative trends could be distilled from the strain and <b>force</b> <b>patterns.</b> It is clear that for most ligaments, the zero-force lengths were not equal to the lengths they possessed in the neutral position of the hand. Furthermore, it could be shown which motions of the hand would most likely strain a particular ligament.

The fundamental capacities that distinguish hominin teaching from that of other animals are demonstration and pantomime. A conceptual analysis of the instructional and communicative functions of demonstration and pantomime is presented. Archaeological evidence that demonstration was used for transmitting the Oldowan technology is summarized. It is argued that pantomime develops out of demonstration so that the primary objective of pantomime is that the onlooker learns the motoric patterns shown in the pantomime. The communicative use of pantomime is judged to be secondary. This use of pantomime is also contrasted with other forms of gestures. A key feature of the analysis is that the meaning of a pantomime is characterized by the <b>force</b> <b>patterns</b> of the movements.

40|$|Abstract — The initial {{effect of}} the impact <b>force</b> <b>patterns</b> on the object for {{achieving}} stably grasping is dependent on starting of the movement of a robot hand by taking an optimal preshape. These impact <b>force</b> <b>patterns</b> generated from the changes of the momenta obtained from the fingers lead to motion tendencies of the object. Determining optimal preshape of hand is closely related with the continuum between the initial position of hand preshape and posture of the hand at the contact points on the object. In this paper, we propose a new model for determining continuity momentum of fingers landing on the object based on the fluid dynamics. The commercial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software package program, Fluent, is used to simulate the compressible fluid flows. The kinematic model of robot fingers and object geometry is created as a preprocessing of fluent. Various scenarios of simple hand preshaping have been applied to the simulation. The experimental results give an idea about how different preshape hand effects to detect the region of contacts while approaching onto an object.

Eight-een subjects with LLDs ranging from 4. 8 to 22. 2 mm participated in this study. Subject age range was from 20 to 63 years. A force platform was used to obtain ground reaction force data for four conditions. Data were collected prior to fit-ting of the heel lift and after a three-week break-in period. Data were analyzed by use of a two-factor within-subject analysis of variance for repeated measures. Before heel-lift fitting, maximum lateral force was greater in the short leg than in the long leg. After heel-lift fitting, maximum vertical force was greater within both legs, and maximum medial force was greater in the long leg than in the short leg. The results suggest that although heel lifts are used to achieve pelvic levelness, the use of heel lifts also resulted in increased ground reaction forces, which may cause increased joint stresses within the lower extremities.
