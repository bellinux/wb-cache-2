The {{inhibition}} of ammonia nitrogen and volatile acid on anaerobic methanogenesis during the anaerobic digestion of <b>kitchen</b> <b>wastes</b> {{by way of}} digest fluid backflow was studied. The experiment was conducted at 35 ˚C, and used <b>kitchen</b> <b>wastes</b> as organic carbon source. The results shows that the ammonia nitrogen inhibition concentration is 1400 - 1700 mg/L. When the ammonia nitrogen concentration rises to 2000 mg/L, the anaerobic methanogenesis efficiency decreased obviously, along with the accumulation of volatile acid. At the feeding organic load of 3. 5 - 4. 0 kgVS/(m 3. d), the anaerobic methanogenesis system was stable operation, the higher VS reduction (72. 17 %) and the higher methane production rate were obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Currently, {{much of our}} {{biodegradable}} <b>wastes</b> such as <b>kitchen</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{agricultural wastes}} & animal wastes are used to produce Biogas, a powerful greenhouse gas. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a treatment that composts these wastes {{in the absence of}} oxygen, producing a biogas {{that can be used to}} generate Heat & Power. Producing renewable energy from our biodegradable wastes helps to tackle the energy crisis. It is effectively a controlled and enclosed version of the anaerobic breakdown of organic wastes which releases methane. AD produces a biogas made up of around 60 per cent methane and 40 per cent carbon dioxide (CO). As well as biogas, AD produces a solid and liquid residue called digestate which can be used as a soil conditioner to fertilise land. The amount of biogas and the quality of digestates obtained will vary according to the feedstock used. More gas will be produced if the feedstock is more liable to decompose.

25|$|By using a bio-digester, which {{produces}} the bacteria required for decomposing, cooking gas is generated. The organic garbage like fallen leaves, <b>kitchen</b> <b>waste,</b> food waste etc. are fed into a crusher unit, where {{the mixture is}} conflated {{with a small amount}} of water. The mixture is then fed into the bio-digester, where the bacteria decomposes it to produce cooking gas. This gas is piped to kitchen stove. A 2 cubic meter bio-digester can produce 2 cubic meter of cooking gas. This is equivalent to 1kg of LPG. The notable advantage of using a bio-digester is the sludge which is a rich organic manure.|$|E

40|$|Unbalanced use of {{inorganic}} nutrients is {{the main}} cause for stagnation or declining crop productivity; this also causes health hazards in different forms. Usually huge quantities of vegetables, fishes, meats, and bones remain unutilized or thrown away as wastes in daily household affairs. However, <b>kitchen</b> <b>wastes</b> {{can also be used}} in productive manners. The ways and means of this endeavor has been addressed in this communication. The kitchen-waste based organic fertilizer has been developed by digging pits and placing the wastes on a layer of soil, topped by a layer of plant growth-promoting microbes. Almost 25 % of compost was harvested by this manner in small scale in Sylhet division (North-Eastern Bangladesh) under the auspicious of livelihood enhancement program. The main objectives were achieved by converting waste into resource, finding an alternative nutrient source for agricultural production, improving soil health and converting recycle elements to natural resources. Also, organic agriculture induced significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|Biodegradable <b>wastes</b> such as <b>kitchen</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{agricultural}} wastes & animal wastes {{are used to}} produce Biogas, a powerful greenhouse gas. Biogas derived from <b>kitchen</b> <b>wastes</b> is a potential alternative to the partial substitution of petroleum derived fuels because it is from renewable resources that are widely available. Producing renewable energy from our biodegradable wastes helps to tackle the energy crisis. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a treatment that composts these wastes {{in the absence of}} oxygen, producing a biogas {{that can be used to}} generate Heat & Power. AD produces biogas of around 60 per cent methane, 30 percent carbon dioxide (CO 2), 2 percent hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) and other constituents. For application as a fuel in I. C Engines it is required to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) and hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S), because H 2 S corrodes vital mechanical components of engine and CO 2 reduces heating effect if it is not removed. Therefore Biogas is required to be upgraded through purification by removing H 2 S and CO 2. In this paper, the important parameters of performance characteristics (such as: power output, thermal efficiency & fuel consumption) of biogas-fuelled C. I engine are studied and estimated with change of engine speed and load. The obtained results when operating with biogas are used to compare with that of diesel fuel under the same operating conditions.

Six amylolytic bacteria were isolated and the best two isolates, named as DY and W 1, were selected based on clear zone ratio. The 16 S rDNA sequence analysis identified DY and W 1 isolates as Chryseobacterium sp. and Bacillus sp., respectively. Amylase production was optimized using basal media. The maximum level of amylase production was achieved from Chryseobacterium and Bacillus isolates after 60  h and 48  h of cultivation, respectively. The optimal temperature, initial pH of the media, agitation and inoculum size were determined for the both isolates. Increased amylase production was observed when basal media were substituted with organic carbon and nitrogen sources. The optimum pH and temperature for amylase activity of the crude amylase of Chryseobacterium sp. were 5. 0 and 50  °C, respectively and those of amylase from Bacillus sp. were pH 7. 0 and 50  °C, correspondingly. The crude amylase from the Chryseobacterium sp. was stable at pH 5. 0 – 6. 0 and up to 40  °C but that from Bacillus sp. was stable at pH 7. 0 and up to 30  °C.
