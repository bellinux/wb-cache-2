25|$|Becoming a {{journalist}} after leaving {{politics in the}} eighties, Ã˜grim had a technology column in the Norwegian edition of PC World. He {{was known for his}} distinct writing style, where he rejected standard written Norwegian and, instead, wrote as <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> working class dialect. He also wrote science fiction novels under the pseudonym Eirik Austey.|$|E
25|$|Daines {{spoke in}} a censure debate in December 1945, arguing that workers had shown unity {{during the war and}} would show it in peace if they had a social motive instead of a profit motive. He often contributed to debates on {{insurance}} issues, using his experience as an agent. In July 1946 <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> debate on the introduction of bread rationing, claiming that the Master Bakers' Association was only opposing out of concern for their own profits.|$|E
500|$|After dismissing a {{few more}} {{questions}} as [...] "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he [...] "needed a lawyer". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb [...] "leaping from topic to topic", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said [...] "I don't remember." [...] Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, [...] "I don't remember. Somewhere." [...] When the doctor finally asked directly about {{the night of the}} shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> January 2011, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} on The Meaning of Life about being {{sexually abused by}} priests during his childhood.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{his legal}} battle with Cash Money, Lil Wayne {{claims to have}} {{authority}} over when and how the album gets released. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview, stating: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, pretty well," [...] said Rollo; but <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{indifferent}} and hesitating manner, {{which showed}} {{that he did not}} feel much interest in his mother's proposal.|$|R
500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sincere tone, {{his voice sounded}} clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell {{us that we are}} about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E
2500|$|Abbott {{took the}} stand and testified for four days, testifying in a calm and poised manner. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> soft voice and was steadfast in his denials of any {{knowledge}} of the crime. He said {{it was all a}} [...] "monstrous frame-up". The jury was out seven days before it returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. The judge imposed the death sentence.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1953 Co-operative Party congress, Daines warned delegates against getting {{themselves}} into a [...] "Munich mentality" [...] which was thought to have helped persuade the congress to reject a motion calling for the abolition of national service. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foreign policy debate in May 1953 regretting the tendency to anti-Americanism in the Labour Party, {{and said that the}} death of Stalin had not changed the policy of the Soviet Union. Daines was incensed when a Ministry of Defence booklet was published in February 1955 which revealed that British Communists had visited prisoner of war camps during the Korean War, and attempted to convert British troops to communism. He urged their prosecution, observing that men had been hanged for lesser crimes after the Second World War.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you'll be more {{comfortable}} here by yourself," [...] said the artful Godfrey: [...] "I'll leave you here till your sister can come." [...] <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> indifferent tone.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, {{the grand}} chief of Kanesatake is Serge Simon. Soon after his election, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{interview}} with the Montreal Gazette about events from the Oka Crisis in 1990.|$|R
60|$|But in here {{it seemed}} that neither morning nor weather really existed. This place was timeless. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{occupied}} voice, like an echo. Ursula {{did not know what}} to say. She took off her waterproof.|$|R
60|$|The butler made an apologetic appearance. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hushed whisper.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loud tone; and, as he spoke, {{the deaf}} old gentleman entered.|$|E
60|$|Of course <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dialect {{of ancient}} Greek, {{of which we}} render a free translation.|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt the}} {{pressure}} of Cavor's hand upon my arm. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> undertone, as though he feared to wake some sleeping thing. [...] "Let us keep together," [...] he whispered, [...] "and look for the sphere. We must {{get back to the}} sphere. This is beyond our understanding." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost querulous tone, {{and looked}} inquiringly in his nurse's face. It {{did not occur}} to the youth, {{as he looked at}} her, that the weak-bodied, soft, and gentle {{creature}} herself had been, and still was, doing more good to the world than a hundred young men such as he! ...|$|R
60|$|There was a pause. Then <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{far less}} {{elaborate}} manner.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new, angry voice; but I {{could not}} see his face, his back being to the light.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low voice, {{but with}} great distinctness. Susie was astounded. An abject apology {{was the last}} thing she expected.|$|E
60|$|In {{the silence}} that {{followed}} <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavy voice, letting his eyes rest upon {{the man who had}} struck him down.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> round, full {{voice that}} his {{shortest}} words carried {{a sort of}} polysyllabic weight.|$|R
60|$|Sheen {{kept his}} head. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> quiet, {{pleasant}} voice, fingering the swagger-stick, as <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> absent manner, <b>he</b> requested his young friend to re-make the bed--rapidly and completely. For {{the space of}} five minutes no sound broke the silence except the rustle of sheets and blankets. At {{the end of that}} period the bed looked as good as new.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost natural voice. His {{reflections}} {{had come}} to an end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but it's two Arabs and two country-breds to play now," [...] said Corks. [...] "Faiz-Ullah, remember!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> biting voice.|$|E
6000|$|Kate {{was rather}} frightened; but <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kinder voice. [...] "At home, you say. Do you mean with my sisters, or at Oldburgh?" ...|$|E
60|$|The man in {{the chair}} beat with {{the tips of his}} fingers upon the table by his side. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dull, unemotional tone.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> {{purposely}} <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loud voice, so {{that many}} heard him. At once a murmur arose on all sides.|$|R
60|$|Womble {{stopped a}} moment to steady his voice and control himself. Then <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> slowly, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low, tense voice.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>spoke,</b> too, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quick, crisp, rather high voice, {{pinching}} his consonants a little, sharpening his vowels, {{like a true}} Welshman.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is this place?" [...] said Bes, {{who looked}} frightened, and {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low whisper, our guide overheard him and turning, answered, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] said he. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low voice, almost whispering, {{as though}} he were half scared by the tidings he had heard.|$|E
60|$|Standing {{up in the}} gig {{in which}} he had driven up with Mr. Brook <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loud, clear voice heard easily {{throughout}} the yard.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had time}} to move away <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> changed tone of obstinacy and puffing nervously at his pipe.|$|R
5000|$|His {{maternal}} {{grandmother was}} a Jewish immigrant who escaped Nazi Germany in the 1930s; she later joined the Quakers. Morehouse was raised with a [...] "mixture" [...] of religious traditions. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview before the 2012 Olympics {{about how his}} [...] "sense of being Jewish" [...] {{is based on the}} experiences of his maternal grandmother, and that he plans to participate in the 2013 Maccabiah Games, an international Jewish athletic event held in Israel every four years.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{excited and}} venomous fashion. He {{pointed out that}} we Gentiles had brought all this trouble upon Mur, since before we came the Abati, {{although}} threatened, had lived in peace and glory--he actually used the word glory!--for generations. But now we had stung the Fung, as a hornet stings a bull, and made them mad, so that they wished to toss the Abati. He proposed, therefore, that we should at once be ejected from Mur.|$|R
