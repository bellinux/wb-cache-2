40|$|This {{article will}} discuss the aspects of {{financial}} operation via cash-flow analysis in large-scale dairy farm management that strategically aims to expand its operation further. The conclusions are as follows. First, when trying to analyze management {{in the process of}} dynamic expansion, {{there was a significant difference}} in evaluating between the management analysis method with its emphasis on profitability, versus one with an emphasis on cash flow and stability. It becomes important to diagnose financial stability based on cash flow when evaluating large amounts of investment and dairy farm management in the process of further expansion. Second, the investment timing and priority were deeply related to the increase and decrease in cash amount. In dairy farm management, the production process goes through multiple stages such as feeding, raising and milking, thus decision-making concerning where to place <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> among various sectors becomes highly critical. Especially for the type of large-scale, extensive land use dairy farming seen in Hokkaido, <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> should be placed on milking (including the purchase of new cattle) rather than upgrading the feeding stage in order to stabilize financial operation...|$|E

40|$|Many {{governments are}} seeking to ‘mature’ social science through {{research}} capability. The Building Research Capability in the Social Sciences (BRCSS) experiment gave New Zealand’s social science community a chance to mature itself through capability building. We examine the emergence of BRCSS’s ‘sustainability’ research theme. Selected as one of five key research themes because of its public good <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> {{and the level of}} social science interest, the meanings and purpose of the theme emerged in practice. We present the theme as a series of performances through the life of BRCSS, itself an emergent assemblage of changing theoretical projects, research and policy priorities, and research capability. Reading the experiment reflexively from the inside, we consolidate the experience of performing new research practices into existence to reconceptualise and theorise research capability. We conclude that any fresh engagement in substantive issues must confront how knowledge production might be done differently, and that experimentation around capacities and capabilities for knowledge production begins to open up substantive concerns in fresh and generative ways. ...|$|E
40|$|Coal is {{the major}} primary energy which fuels the {{economic}} growth in China. The Soviet-style institution of the coal sector was adopted after the People's Republic was founded in 1949. But {{since the end of}} 1970 s there have been major changes: the market mechanism was introduced to the coal sector and the Major State Coal mines were transferred from central to local governments. This paper explains these market-oriented and decentralized reforms and explores their implications for the power sector, now the largest single consumer of coal. The argument of this paper is that the market-oriented and decentralized reforms in the coal sector were influenced by the changes in state energy <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> as well as the relationship between the central and local governments in the context of broader reforms within China's economy. However, these market-oriented and decentralized reforms have not equally influenced the power sector. Even though initial coal sector reform spurred power generation, the subsequent fragmented reforms raise concern about electricity shortages.

40|$|Nigeria is over-dependent {{on exports}} of {{petroleum}} products despite enormous efforts in policy {{design and implementation}} to encourage exports of transformed agricultural products. It is necessary to diversify the sources of its foreign exchange earnings. In this connection, this paper examined the trends and constraints of some selected macroeconomic policy instruments on agricultural development. Findings showed that exchange rate, wage rate, interest rate and expenditure in agriculture witnessed high instability which tends to propel high cost of production. High cost of production is exemplified by rising cost of capital in terms of interest rate on agricultural loans. This has almost permanently shut the door against farm loans. Also, expenditure on agriculture represented only a small proportion and its relative share in total expenditure did not show any discernible improvement, reflecting a declining trend in <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> in the sector. Under this condition, high cost of production tends to make locally produced agricultural products less competitive. Policy strategy to enhance agricultural development should focus on maintaining a stable macroeconomic policy environment, providing loans at single digit interest rate, and development of rural infrastructures that will enhance market linkages...|$|E
40|$|In Ethiopia, {{urban water}} supply and {{irrigation}} are competing for water resources. The Millennium Development Goals have spurred large donor investment in water supply resulting in a rapid increase in coverage for health and human development. At the same time, most of Ethiopia’s population is engaged in low-productivity rainfed agriculture {{and the government has}} made smallholder irrigation an <b>investment</b> <b>priority</b> for food security and poverty alleviation. In areas where water is physically scarce, there is fierce competition between {{water supply and}} irrigation resulting in unsustainable abstraction from common pool water resources. In the Haramaya watershed in Eastern Ethiopia, this has resulted in the severe depletion of Haramaya Lake, once an important water source for urban water supply for the historical town of Harar. Unregulated smallholder irrigation has expanded significantly and has displaced the urban water supply to over 72 km away. Water developments have been influenced by land-use change, international, national and local institutions and biophysical changes in the watershed. This chapter employs the nascent concept of the waterscape in order to explore how competition for water resources plays a role in the mediation of land-use change and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Improvement on {{assessment}} {{of air pollution}} exposure will enhance {{assessment of}} health risk-benefit when active travel (cycling and walking). Earlier studies assessed air pollution exposure according to travel time and city-level air pollution. The lack of spatially fine-grained travel data is a barrier to an accurate assessment of air pollution exposure. Due to a high-level spatial granularity, Strava Metro provides an opportunity to assessing air pollution exposure in combination with spatially varying air pollution concentrations. Strava Metro anonymized and aggregated a large volume of users’ traces to streets for each city. In this study, to explore the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in research of active travel and health, we used Strava Metro data and GIS technologies to assess air pollution exposure in Glasgow, UK. Particularly, we incorporated time of the trip to assess average inhaled dose of pollutant during a single cycling or pedestrian trip. Empirical results demonstrate that Strava Metro data provides an opportunity to an assessment of average air pollution exposure during active travel. Additionally, to demonstrate the potential of Strava Metro data in policy-making, we explored the spatial association of air pollution concentration and active travel. As a result, we identified areas that require <b>investment</b> <b>priority,</b> and finally offered implications for policies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the short-term and long-term effects {{that the global}} economic crisis and the <b>investment</b> <b>priorities</b> of the Chinese Government's stimulus package had on Chinese migrant flows between 2008 and 2014. Combining micro-level household survey data and macro-level statistics, the authors have found that in the short run, the regional and sectoral impact of the crisis, combined with the government's <b>investment</b> <b>priorities,</b> caused a reorientation of migration routes from the export-oriented coastal provinces towards the central and western regions, from inter-provincial migration towards intra-provincial migration, and from manufacturing industry towards the construction sector. However, in the longer run, the decreasing attractiveness of the eastern region and the increasing attractiveness of the western region proved to be transitory, although the pre-crisis relative advantage of the eastern region was not fully restored. What proved to be persistent were the attractiveness of the central region and the intra-provincial migration in all three regions, and, in particular, the steady growth of migrants in the construction sector. </p...|$|R
