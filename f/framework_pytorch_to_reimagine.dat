The challenges for moving from ideas to action are particularly difficult for a sector that is often impenetrable to those outside of it.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of cities {{is a challenge}} of global significance that {{will depend on the}} capacity to re-imagine the potential of cities, and thus needs more than standard technocratic urban planning approaches. Deep engagement with the arts provides one avenue for recasting the future of cities. This thesis explores the question of how ‘critical urban art interventions’ develop alternative ways of knowing urban nature, and the opportunities and limitations of using art <b>to</b> <b>reimagine</b> the future of cities. By drawing on urban political ecology and cultural geography, the thesis documents and explores the aims and tactics used in five urban art interventions <b>to</b> <b>reimagine</b> sites of urban nature in Stockholm. Qualitative interviews and participant observation were carried to explore these questions. Findings suggest that tactics used in urban art interventions promote embodied ways of knowing, and simultaneously interacting with the physical and socio- historical constructions of sites of urban natures. ...|$|R

40|$|The Christian churchs {{expansive}} zeal has often, {{throughout its}} history, walked hand-in-hand with the colonial pursuits of empires and nation-states. This cooperative approach {{between church and}} empire, which {{has been described as}} a Christendom or Constantinian paradigm, has not only implicated the church in the oppression and violent exploitation of people, but, because this paradigm has shaped the churchs ecclesial and missiological imagination, such violent and oppressive tendencies are perpetuated. This paper will argue that, in order to break free from such an understanding, we need <b>to</b> <b>reimagine</b> how we understand our ecclesial being and missional purpose. In remembering what it means to be witnesses of Jesus Christ in the early church, an understanding which, because of the lifestyle it required, was intimately connected with the very real possibility of becoming a martyr, we are challenged by this alternative paradigm <b>to</b> <b>reimagine</b> our ecclesial being and missional purpose.
