25|$|Once {{conditioned}} {{fish are}} stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become {{receptive to the}} attentions of the males. Eventually, one male will succeed in courting a female, using his barbels to provide stimulation to the female, usually beginning with caresses of the female's caudal peduncle, followed by caresses of the <b>fontanel</b> and {{the front of the}} head. if the female is receptive, then the male positions himself before the female, so that the female's mouth is in close proximity with one of the male's pectoral fins. The male then clasps the female's barbels between the pectoral fin and the body, and this stimulates the female to press against the male's side. When seen from above, the fishes form a 'T' shape when conjoined thus, hence the term 'T position' has become conventional in aquarium circles when describing the breeding of Corydoras catfishes.|$|E
25|$|Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, {{and when}} {{observed}} under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins {{of the fish}} match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the <b>fontanel,</b> over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally when the fish is at rest, extended {{in a manner similar}} to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above.|$|E
2500|$|A newborn's head is {{very large}} in {{proportion}} to the body, and the cranium is enormous relative to his or her face. While the adult human skull is about one seventh of the total body length, the newborn's is about ¼. Normal head circumference for a full-term infant is 33–36cm at birth. At birth, many regions of the newborn's skull have not yet been converted to bone, leaving [...] "soft spots" [...] known as fontanels. The two largest are the diamond-shaped anterior <b>fontanel,</b> located at the top front portion of the head, and the smaller triangular-shaped posterior <b>fontanel,</b> which lies {{at the back of the}} head. Later in the child's life, these bones will fuse together in a natural process. A protein called noggin is responsible for the delay in an infant's skull fusion.|$|E

This study aimed to identify clinical and ultrasonographic criteria for using ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts in this group of patients. Method A retrospective cohort study, based on established protocol for VP shunt implant in hydrocephalic children with MM. Parameters used to guide the indication of VP shunts included measurement of head circumference (HC), evaluation of <b>fontanels,</b> and measurement of lateral ventricular atrium (LVA) width by transcranial ultrasonography. Results 43 children were included in the analysis, of which 74 % had hydrocephalus and required a VP shunt. These children had LVA width &# 8805; 15 mm, showed increased HC, or had bulging <b>fontanels.</b> Conclusion VP shunt is required in children with increased HC (&# 8805; 2 standard deviation regarding age group), bulging <b>fontanels,</b> or LVA width of &# 8805; 15 mm after the closure of MM...|$|R

50|$|Patients may {{experience}} delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive myopathy. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near {{the ends of}} major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density (osteopenia) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open <b>fontanels</b> on radiographic studies. The illusion of open <b>fontanels</b> results from hypomineralization of {{large areas of the}} calvarium. Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure.|$|R

40|$|A {{realistic}} head {{model is}} needed for source localization methods used {{for the study of}} epilepsy in neonates applying Electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements from the scalp. The earliest models consider the head as a series of concentric spheres, each layer corresponding to a different tissue whose conductivity is assumed to be homogeneous. The results of the source reconstruction depend highly on the electric conductivities of the tissues forming the head. The most used model is constituted of three layers (scalp, skull, and intracranial). Most of the major bones of the neonates’ skull are ossified at birth but can slightly move relative to each other. This is due to the sutures, fibrous membranes that at this stage of development connect the already ossified flat bones of the neurocranium. These weak parts of the neurocranium are called <b>fontanels.</b> Thus it is important to enter the exact geometry of fontaneles and flat bone in a source reconstruction because they show pronounced in conductivity. Computer Tomography (CT) imaging provides an excellent tool for non-invasive investigation of the skull which expresses itself in high contrast to all other tissues while the <b>fontanels</b> only can be identified as absence of bone, gaps in the skull formed by flat bone. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} extract the <b>fontanels</b> from CT images applying a variational level set method. We applied the proposed method to CT-images of five different subjects. The automatically extracted <b>fontanels</b> show good agreement with the manually extracted ones. QC 20120312 </p...|$|R

Where several sutures meet, an irregular space forms, which is enclosed by a membrane and designated as a <b>fontanel.</b> The greater, or anterior <b>fontanel,</b> is a lozenge-shaped space that is situated at the junction of the sagittal and the coronal sutures. The lesser, or posterior <b>fontanel,</b> is represented by a small triangular area {{at the intersection of}} the sagittal and lambdoid sutures.

40|$|Cranio-osteoarthropathy, {{clinically}} {{classified as}} a variant of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, is a very rare autosomal-recessive condition characterized by delayed closure of the cranial sutures and <b>fontanels,</b> digital clubbing, arthropathy, and periostosis. Recently, mutations in the gene HPGD, which encodes the NAD+-dependent 15 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, were reported in four families affected with primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and one family with autosomal-recessive isolated nail clubbing. We report the clinical and molecular findings in four patients from two families affected with cranio-osteoarthropathy and one family with isolated, autosomal dominant digital clubbing. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping identified a locus for cranio-osteoarthropathy harboring the HPGD gene in one affected family. We detected two novel homozygous mutations in HPGD in these families: a missense mutation affecting the NAD+ binding motif and a frameshift mutation. The clinical presentation in our patients was variable. Digital clubbing and hyperhidrosis were present in all cases. Delayed closure of the cranial sutures and <b>fontanels,</b> periostosis, and arthropathy were not consistent clinical features. No HPGD mutation was detected in a familial case of autosomal dominant isolated digital clubbing. The failure to identify any mutation in a family with an autosomal dominant type of isolated digital clubbing suggests that HPGD is not the major gene for this condition...|$|R

40|$|Objective:To {{determine}} whether the combined intervention of 50 000 IU vitamin A administered together with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination at birth {{was associated with a}}dverse events, in particular bulging <b>fontanels</b> and adverse reactions to BCG. Subjects/Methods:From an ongoing trial, 2145 infants randomized to 50 000 IU vitamin A or placebo with BCG vaccination were recruited. Adverse events were monitored in two different ways: (A) daily clinical examinations by a medical doctor during the first 3 days post supplementation; (B) weekly interviews by a trained assistant during the first month post supplementation. Results:In part A, 1271 infants were enrolled, in part B 2078. Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) was associated with a relative risk (RR) of bulging <b>fontanels</b> of 1. 16 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 82 - 1. 65). The rate of health care contacts and various symptoms during the first month were comparable between the groups. VAS was associated with larger peak local reactions to BCG vaccination in boys, but not in girls (P-value for test of interaction between VAS and sex= 0. 02). Conclusion: 50 000 IU vitamin A with BCG was not associated with adverse events. The observed sex-differential effect of VAS on local reaction to BCG is in line with other observations of sex-differential effects of VAS.
