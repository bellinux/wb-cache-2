Memcheck for instance tracks values with bit precision, while AddressSanitizer, part of the clang compiler, is comparatively very fast. Memcheck, as all Valgrind tools, use binary translation and instrumentation to run code manipulating the shadow memory corresponding to program memory use. AddressSanitizer on the other hand is created on compile-time and inserts <b>error-checking</b> <b>code</b> inline into a program during compilation. Its shadow-memory implementation uses a huge reservation of virtual memory for its shadow memory, giving very different performance characteristics.|$|E

In 1990, Gonzales et al. [9] described a technique which predicts a few low frequency AC coefficients. The AC predictor uses the dequantized DC values of a 3 x 3 neighborhood of 8 x 8 blocks to predict the AC values in the center block. Wang [10] proposed a data hiding scheme using the AC prediction technology in 2005. But it is unable to be suitable for the image of all types to predict AC coefficients accurately. We propose a novel watermarking system by using the technique of 4 x 4 integer DCT transform and adaptive AC estimation. We use 4 x 4 INTDCT transform to reduce blocking artifacts caused from 8 x 8 DCT transform and improve Imperceptibility and watermark capacity greatly. Moreover, we utilize AC prediction value as <b>error-checking</b> <b>code</b> to enhance the robustness of watermark.
