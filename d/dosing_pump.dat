40|$|Abstract—Supplying {{good quality}} of {{drinking}} water is a challenging task {{during the rainy season}} and floods. During this period water becomes highly polluted with suspended solids which increase the water turbidity. Alum is used to reduce the turbidity of the water.

The alum dosage is controlled by an intelligent controller which consists of a dosage predictor, an inverse model of the dosage pump and a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller.

The weight of drops dispended under vertical dropping (90 ř) was directly proporcional to the effective orifice diameter of the dropper tip and the surface tension.

A family of Coil Pumps has been developed at Loughborough University over the last 10 years by the author. The coil pump, sometimes known as the 'hydrostatic pump', was known and used in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, since then {{it appears to have}} been forgotten. Laboratory investigations lead to a theory for predicting the behaviour of this little known pump The theory is based on an assessment of the boundary levels of the liquid plugs within the loops. From this work, two types of suction pump were derived and the lift pump theory was developed and adapted to predict their behaviour. One suction pump was based on one helical coil and it required a regulated air supply. The second pump used two helical coils 'back to back' one taking water into the pump and the other (of larger capacity) withdrawing it. Laboratory tests were carried out on a number of versions of both suction pumps and the experimental results agreed well with those produced by the theory.

Bolus doses of voriconazole and amphotericin B were administered to a starting inoculum of C. albicans. Antifungal-containing medium was eliminated and replaced by fresh medium using a peristaltic pump, with the flow-rate adjusted to obtain the desired half-life of the drug with the shorter half-life. A computer-controlled <b>dosing</b> <b>pump</b> compensated for the agent with the longer half-life. Voriconazole and amphotericin B half-lives were set to 6 and 24 h, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters were close to target values when both single doses and sequential doses were simulated.

Simultaneous administration resulted in fungicidal activity, whereas pre-exposure of C. albicans to voriconazole, followed by amphotericin at 8 and 32 h, resulted in fungistatic activity similar to that observed with voriconazole alone. Using this model, which allowed a combination of antifungal agents with different half-lives, it was possible to demonstrate an antagonistic effect of voriconazole on the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{development}} of a technology is described, which enables the continuous modification of polymers by the use of carbon dioxide as a solvent. The technology consists of a twin screw extruder coupled with a high pressure gas unit. Main parts of the gas unit are a gas <b>dosing</b> <b>pump,</b> an autoclave and a gas nozzle for injecting the compressed carbon dioxide into the extruder. Basic investigations are made on the sorption of carbon dioxide into different polymer melts. As a result, the dependence of the sorption capacity on the gas pressure is figured. A valuation of the Flory-Huggins-theory showed the differences between the analyzed and calculated sorption capacities. In first tests of the extruder configuration, the screws were optimized in order to achieve the pressure and throughput requirements for this technology. The residence time of the polymer was detected by near infrared spectroscopy and compared with the calculated residence time for the finally qualified screw design. The solubility of different modification substances in compressed or supercritical carbon dioxide were examined in an optical high pressure cell. Among these substances Bis(tertbutylperoxy) diisopropylbenzol, Vinyltrimethoxysilane and two dyes demonstrated a good solubility behavior. The modification of the polymers was investigated with these substances on the developed technology. Further trials were also made with the monomers methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate as modification substances. Different Polyolefines, polyolefine-copolymers and Polystyrene were selected for the modification tests.

40|$|In early 2006 we {{designed}} and built low energy consumption, pump-operated system, for dosing of the liquid nutrient in the summer 2006 season. This operated successfully, and the system was used again during the 2007 and 2008 seasons for dosing. During the early winter period, 2008, laboratory tests were made of the liquid nutrient pump system, and {{it was noted that}} small amounts of air were being entrained on the suction side of the pump, during conditions when the inlet pressure was low. It was believed that this was the cause of diurnal fluctuations in the flow supplied, characteristic of the 2007 year flow data. Replacement of ' 0 ' rings on the inlet side of the pumps was the solution to this problem, and when tested in the field during the summer season, the flow supplied was found to be stable. A decision was made by the IKERT committee at the meeting of 20 th to 21 st May 2008 (held in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho) to use an injection flow rate of liquid fertilizer (polyammonium phosphate 10 - 34 - 0) to achieve a target phosphorus concentration of 3. 0 {micro}g/L, after complete mixing in the river. This target concentration was the same as that used in 2006 and 2007. The proposed starting date was as early as possible in June 2008. Plans were made to measure the dosing flow in three ways. Two of the three methods of flow measurement (1 and 2 below) are inter-dependent. These were: (1) Direct measurement of flow rate by diverting dosing flow into a 1000 mL volume standard flask. The flow rate was computed by dividing the flask volume by the time required to fill the flask. This was done a few times only during the summer period. (2) Adjusting the flow rate reading of the Gamma <b>dosing</b> <b>pump</b> using the 'calibration' function to achieve agreement with the flow rate computed by method 1 above. (3) Direct measurement by electrical signal from conductive fluid passing through a magnetic field (Seametrics meter, as used in previous years).

Liquid nutrients were delivered to the site in late May, and system testing was done the same day. High concentrations of suspended sediment in the water column, as indicated by shallow Secchi depth readings, were present in the river in the last part of May, into June. A plan was made to delay the start up of nutrient addition to a date later than 1 st June, because the aquatic productivity was almost certainly to be compromised by insufficient light availability.
