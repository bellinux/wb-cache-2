500|$|At {{the time}} of Lyons' first {{interview}} with the gardaí, he was staying at the Salvation Army hostel in Grangegorman. Detective Garda William Mullis and Garda Joseph O'Connor approached {{him as he was}} leaving the hostel. They reported that Lyons said: [...] "I think I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> about". The gardaí brought Lyons to the Bridewell garda station, and interviewed him in the doctor's room. According to the gardaí, at one point during the interview, Lyons burst out crying and said that he had killed the two women. Lyons claimed that he was suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time and that he made the admission so that he could get more drugs. He said that Garda O'Connor had promised that the sooner he confessed, the sooner he would be released from custody and that he [...] "wasn't thinking straight". The gardaí say that he was told that he was not under arrest and that he could leave at any time. As a result of his confession, Dean Lyons was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women at 13:46 on 26 July 1997.|$|E

The same day, Montreal sportswriter Dink Carroll spoke with Gallinger after the game between Boston and Montreal. [...] "You probably <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> about, don't you?" [...] Carroll asks. [...] "Yes, you want to know if I've made any decision about baseball," [...] Gallinger answered. Carroll informed Gallinger that Winchell had just named him as the Boston player involved. [...] "Winchell", said Gallinger. [...] "Do you mean the fellow in New York?" [...] Initially Gallinger appeared too bewildered to comment, but eventually denied the accusations.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] I am {{like a man}} who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
