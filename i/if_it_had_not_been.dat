5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

25|$|His {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the development of Islamic philosophy was his efforts to make Greek thought both accessible and acceptable to a Muslim audience. Al-Kindi carried out this mission from the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), an institute of translation and learning patronized by the Abbasid Caliphs, in Baghdad. As well as translating many important texts, much of what was to become standard Arabic philosophical vocabulary originated with al-Kindi; indeed, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> for him, the work of philosophers like Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and al-Ghazali might not have been possible.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden {{and states}} {{bordering}} the Baltic Sea, the oldest surviving manuscript {{from the first}} Swedish law {{to be put to}} paper is from c. 1345, although earlier versions probably existed. The law was created for the young town Stockholm's customs, but it was also used in Lödöse and probably in a few other towns, as well. No town was allowed to use the law without the formal permission by the Swedish king. Its use may have become more widespread <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> superseded by the new town law by King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1374). The term Bjarkey Laws was however used for a long time for Magnus Eriksson's law in various locations.|$|E
25|$|Although Howe had {{defeated}} the American army, the unexpected resistance {{he had met}} prevented him from destroying it completely. The American morale had not been destroyed; despite losing the battle, the Americans had good spirits hoping to fight the British again another day. But neither commander in the battle had proven themselves. Washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and nearly brought on destruction <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> for Sullivan, Sterling, and Stephen's divisions that fought for time. Howe had waited too long to attack the American right flank, showing again his lack of killer instincts because he was still afraid of sustaining heavy casualties since the costly victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill two years earlier, and thus allowed most of the American army to escape.|$|E

25|$|Jason Lewry {{then took}} six Middlesex wickets for 65 runs, {{reducing}} them to 244, although <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> Jamie Dalrymple's (65) and Paul Weekes' (71) partnership of 140 {{for the sixth}} wicket, things would have looked even nastier for Middlesex. In reply, Sussex were cautious in their chase of 314, but a big partnership between Richard Montgomerie and Murray Goodwin nearly won it for them. However, New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris took four Sussex wickets for 79, and Alan Richardson took four for 38 - including Goodwin and skipper Adams. Sussex lost four wickets for 17 runs to crash to 280 for 6, but Kirtley and Lewry held out as Sussex finished 28 runs short of a victory and Middlesex finished one wicket short of victory in this bottom-fight.|$|E
25|$|Judge Debra Ann Livingston {{wrote for}} a panel that {{took two years}} to decide the case. It found that while that act was constitutionally protected, the {{balancing}} test established by Pickering v. Board of Education actually improved the MTA's case under Mt. Healthy, since although it was speech on {{a matter of public}} concern it was disruptive to the MTA's operations since it breached the confidentiality the plaintiff was required to maintain about security matters and internal investigations as part of his job duties. Even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> so disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his job to be in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times.|$|E
25|$|When Attenborough {{resigned}} from his administrative duties {{to return to}} programme making {{at the start of}} 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> for computerised airline schedules, the series would have probably been impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, Life on Earth drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide.|$|E

25|$|City {{officials}} in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons {{in honor of}} Parks until her funeral. Parks' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, where she lay in repose at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess. A memorial service was held there the following morning. One of the speakers, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> for Parks, she would probably have never become the Secretary of State. In the evening the casket was transported to Washington, D.C. and transported by a bus {{similar to the one}} in which she made her protest, to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.|$|E
25|$|Shares in Eurotunnel {{were issued}} at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price {{had risen to}} £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during {{demonstration}} runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy {{would have been better}} off <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> constructed.|$|E
25|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field in}} southeastern British Columbia consists of numerous small, basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows. Many individual volcanoes {{in the field}} have been active for the last 3 million years during which time the region was covered by thick glacial ice at least twice, prior to the well known Fraser Glaciation (also known as the Wisconsin Glaciation). The origin of the volcanism is yet unknown but is probably related to crustal thinning. The last eruption in the field was at Kostal Cone in 1500. Volcanism within the field has also created the -high Helmcken Falls, which is the fourth highest waterfall in Canada. It owes its foundation to the deposits of volcanic rock that were placed down in the wide valley of the Murtle River. Layer upon layer of fresh lava created flat areas, over which enormous floods flowed during the last ice age. These floods shaped the upright cliff in the lava flows over which the river now flows. The protection of Helmcken Falls {{was one of the}} major causes for the development of Wells Gray Provincial Park. As a result, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> for the volcanic eruptions, it is not likely that such a large wilderness region would have been made.|$|E

25|$|Day two {{began in}} similar fashion, Bangladesh losing only one wicket {{in the morning}} session as Rajin Saleh hit a half-century, but after lunch the team were out for 427 - their second highest total thus far in Test cricket. MacGill picked up a career best of eight for 108 as the last four wickets fell for just 29 runs. Australia took to the wicket with a disheartened spirit, {{conveyed}} by Matthew Hayden being lbw for six runs in the third over and Ricky Ponting was trapped the same way for 21. The {{rest of the team}} fell thick and fast <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> for Adam Gilchrist putting up a fight of 51* as the day closed on 145-6 with the Australians fighting to avoid the follow on. The third day was resumed with Gilchrist and Brett Lee (12) to bat, the latter being the only wicket to fall in the morning. The eighth wicket, aided by Gillespie helped avoid the follow on, with a partnership of 73 in which Gilchrist managed his first Test century for over a year. Stuart Clark came and went for a duck and Gilchrist was caught, leaving the Australians 269 all out and Bangladesh spin bowler Mohammad Rafique with figures of five for 62.|$|E
