50|$|The <b>Dihybrid</b> {{cross is}} easy to {{visualize}} using a Punnett square of dimensions 4 x 4.|$|E
50|$|The {{rules of}} meiosis, as {{they apply to}} the <b>dihybrid,</b> are codified in Mendel's first law and Mendel's second law, which are also called the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Law of Independent Assortment {{states that}} alleles for {{separate}} traits are passed independently {{of one another}} from parents to offspring. That is, the biological selection of an allele for one trait {{has nothing to do with}} the selection of an allele for any other trait. Mendel found support for this law in his <b>dihybrid</b> cross experiments (Fig. 1). In his monohybrid crosses, an idealized 3:1 ratio between dominant and recessive phenotypes resulted. In <b>dihybrid</b> crosses, however, he found a 9:3:3:1 ratios (Fig. 2). This shows that each of the two alleles is inherited independently from the other, with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each.|$|E
50|$|If multifactorial {{inheritance}} {{is indeed}} the case, then the chance of the patient contracting the disease is reduced only if cousins and more distant relatives have the disease. It must be stated that while multifactorially-inherited diseases tend to run in families, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or <b>dihybrid</b> cross.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihybrid</b> {{cross is}} {{a cross between}} two {{different}} lines (varieties, strains) that differ in two observed traits. In the Mendelian sense, between the alleles of both these loci {{there is a relationship}} of complete dominance - recessive.In the example pictured to the right, RRYY/rryy parents result in F1 offspring that are heterozygous for both R and Y (RrYy).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} example {{illustrates a}} <b>dihybrid</b> cross between two double-heterozygote pea plants. R represents the dominant allele for shape (round), while r represents the recessive allele (wrinkled). A represents the dominant allele for color (yellow), while a represents the recessive allele (green). If each plant has the genotype RrAa, {{and since the}} alleles for shape and color genes are independent, then they can produce four types of gametes with all possible combinations: RA, Ra, rA, and ra.|$|E
50|$|The forked-line method (also {{known as}} the tree method and the {{branching}} system) can also solve <b>dihybrid</b> and multihybrid crosses. A problem is converted {{to a series of}} monohybrid crosses, and the results are combined in a tree. However, a tree produces the same result as a Punnett square in less time and with more clarity. The example below assesses another double-heterozygote cross using RrYy x RrYy. As stated above, the phenotypic ratio is expected to be 9:3:3:1 if crossing unlinked genes from two double-heterozygotes. The genotypic ratio was obtained in the diagram below, this diagram will have more branches than if only analyzing for phenotypic ratio.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Figure 2 <b>Dihybrid</b> cross. The phenotypes of two {{independent}} traits show a 9:3:3:1 ratio in the F2 generation. In this example, coat color {{is indicated by}} B (brown, dominant) or b (white), while tail length is indicated by S (short, dominant) or s (long). When parents are homozygous for each trait (SSbb and ssBB), {{their children in the}} F1 generation are heterozygous at both loci and only show the dominant phenotypes (SsbB). If the children mate with each other, in the F2 generation all combinations of coat color and tail length occur: 9 are brown/short (purple boxes), 3 are white/short (pink boxes), 3 are brown/long (blue boxes) and 1 is white/long (green box).|$|E
50|$|Thus, due to {{the nature}} of {{polygenic}} traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or <b>dihybrid</b> cross. Polygenic inheritance can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If n is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)2n will give the frequency of distribution of all n allele combinations. For a sufficiently high values of n, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean.|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} 3 years, the SWCC – RDC {{conducted}} extensive R&D work on Nanofiltration (NF) pretreatment of feed to SWRO and make-up to MSF pilot plants in <b>dihybrid</b> arrangement of NF-SWRO or NF-MSF, also in trihybrid of NF-SWROreject-MSF, where the SWROreject from the <b>dihybrid</b> NF-SWRO {{is used as}} make-up to the MSF unit. In both di/trihybrid the MSF unit was operated successfully at 120 ºC without further acidification, antiscalant or antifoam. The paper summarizes the MSF performance, which was established at Top Brine Temperature (TBT) operating 120 ºC, in the <b>dihybrid</b> NF-MSF and trihybrid NF-SWRO reject – MSF systems. Because of the excellent MSF performance at this TBT of 120 ºC, the paper also addresses the planned operation of MSF at elevated TBT of 120 to 160 ºC and above. These gained advantages in improved performance of MSF when make-up is directly or indirectly from NF (in di or trihybrid, respectively) triggered a review of dual power and water production cycle of boiler turbine generator: BTG & multistage flash: MSF cycle design. Such combination, i. e., dual purpose BTG- MSF process, could lead to simultaneous increases in water and power production. Simulation model results such increased are shown in this paper. The described MSF performance also revived interests in gas turbine generator: GTG, heat recovery steam generator: HRSG and steam turbine generator: STG, (with MSF) thus power & water (dual purpose) combined cycle: PWCC...|$|E
40|$|DivIVA of Bacillus subtilis and FtsZ of Escherichia coli {{were used}} to target {{heterologous}} protein complexes to cell division sites of E. coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. DivIVA and FtsZ that were fused to the dimerizing leucine zipper (LZ) domain of the yeast transcription activator GCN 4 directed the green fluorescent protein (GFP) that was fused to an LZ domain to E. coli division sites, resulting in fluorescence patterns identical to those observed with DivIVA::GFP and FtsZ::GFP. These cell division proteins also targeted the VirE 1 chaperone and VirE 2 secretion substrate complex to division sites of E. coli and A. tumefaciens. Coproduction of the native VirE 1 or VirE 2 proteins inhibited the <b>dihybrid</b> interaction in both species, as judged by loss of GFP targeting to division sites. The VirE 1 chaperone bound independently to N- and C-terminal regions of VirE 2, with a requirement for residues 84 to 147 and 331 to 405 for these interactions, as shown by <b>dihybrid</b> studies with VirE 1 ::GFP and DivIVA fused to N- and C-terminal VirE 2 fragments. DivIVA also targeted homo- and heterotypic complexes of VirB 8 and VirB 10, two bitopic inner membrane subunits of the A. tumefaciens T-DNA transfer system, in E. coli and homotypic complexes of VirB 10 in A. tumefaciens. VirB 10 self-association in bacteria was mediated by the C-terminal periplasmic domain, as shown by <b>dihybrid</b> studies with fusions to VirB 10 truncation derivatives. Together, our findings establish a proof-of-concept {{for the use of}} cell-location-specific proteins for studies of interactions among cytosolic and membrane proteins in diverse bacterial species...|$|E
40|$|Six {{transgenic}} tobacco lines, each homozygous for the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene at {{a different}} locus, and wild type were selfed and intercrossed to evaluate GUS activity in all possible hemizygous, homozygous and <b>dihybrid</b> combinations of GUS alleles. The transgenic lines are characterized by their GUS activity (two low, three intermediate, one high), T-DNA complexity (four single-copy, two more complex single-locus) {{and the presence of}} the chicken lysozyme matrix-associated region (MAR) around the full T-DNA (two lines). Gene action and interaction was analyzed by weighted linear regression with parameters for additivity, dominance and epistasis. The analysis showed that each of the four single-copy lines acted fully additively. In contrast, the two complex single-locus lines showed classical singlelocus overdominance and were epistatic dominant over all other GUS alleles. The latter is manifested in severe suppression of GUS activity in <b>dihybrid</b> lines, irrespective of the presence of MAR elements around the GUS gene. Such elements apparently do not protect against epistatic dominance. The quantitative data suggested that the epistatic dominance and overdominance are based on the same molecular mechanism. Our approach of a genetic analysis of quantitative variation in well-characterized transgenic lines provides a powerful tool to gain insight into complex plant traits. ...|$|E
40|$|Loss-of-function gac 1 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fail to {{accumulate}} normal levels of glycogen {{because of low}} glycogen synthase activity. Increased dosage of GAC 1 results in increased activity of glycogen synthase and a corresponding hyperaccumulation of glycogen. The glycogen accumulation phenotype of gac 1 {{is similar to that}} of glc 7 - 1, a type 1 protein phosphatase mutant. We have partially characterized the GAC 1 gene product (Gac 1 p) and show that levels of Gac 1 p increase during growth with the same kinetics as glycogen accumulation. Gac 1 p is phosphorylated in vivo and is hyperphosphorylated in a glc 7 - 1 mutant. Gac 1 p and the type 1 protein phosphatase directly interact in vitro, as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation, and in vivo, as determined by the <b>dihybrid</b> assay described elsewhere (S. Fields and O. -k. Song, Nature [London] 340 : 245 - 246, 1989). The interaction between Gac 1 p and the glc 7 - 1 -encoded form of the type 1 protein phosphatase is defective, as assayed by either immunoprecipitation or the <b>dihybrid</b> assay. Increased dosage of GAC 1 partially suppresses the glycogen defect of glc 7 - 1. Collectively, our data support the hypotheses that GAC 1 encodes a regulatory subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase and that the glycogen accumulation defect of glc 7 - 1 is due at least in part to the inability of the mutant phosphatase to interact with its regulatory subunit...|$|E
40|$|VARIATIONS in {{the color}} of corn kernels (Zeamays L.) have {{attracted}} geneticists since theearly 1900 s when studies on the inheritance patterns of kernel color helped validate classical genetics. Even now, research scientists investigate the molecular genetics of these characteristics, and students in introductory biology and genetics courses learn more about monohybrid and <b>dihybrid</b> crosses by studying the inheritance of kernel colors. The reasons for introducing corn genetics in the classroom are obvious—a single ear holds {{a large number of}} progeny and a variety of ears are available that represent basic inheritance patterns, such as the monohybrid cross (3 : 1), the <b>dihybrid</b> cross (9 : 3 : 3 : 1), and more complex genetic patterns illustrating gene interactions (12 : 3 : 1; 9 : 3 : 4, 13 : 3; 9 : 7, etc.). In addition, these ears are obtained readily from several biological supply houses and are relatively inexpensive, espe-cially since students can use them for several years. Students usually confirm different phenotypic ratios of the F 2 generation by first counting kernels, then performing chi-square analyses to test their data. However, their experience can be enriched by introducing explanations about the nature of each gene and its mutations, the related metabolic path-ways, and their locations within the kernel. I have included information in this review that would be appropriate at different levels—from high school biol-ogy to introductory genetics at the college level. The purpose is the same. By exploring these areas, stu-dents more fully understand how these simple pheno-typic ratios and variations are derived. Four Kernel Colors, Four Genes Three of the four kernel colors—yellow, red and purple—are produced by pigments synthesized from one of two metabolic pathways, the carotenoid (yel-low pigments) or the anthocyanin (red and purple pigments) pathway. White, the fourth color, results from the lack of pigments produced from either pathway. The synthesis of each pigment require...|$|E

Solubilization of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) in solutions of the pure OPVs {{as well as in}} the metallogels mediated by pi-pi interactions has also been achieved. In situ fabrication of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the SWCNH-doped <b>dihybrid</b> gel leads to the formation of a trihybrid metallogel. The mechanical strength of the metallogels could be increased step- wise in the order: freshly prepared gel <dihybrid gel < trihybrid gel. Microscopic studies of the trihybrid gel indicate the formation of three distinct morphologies, that is, nanoscale metal organic particles (NMOPs), flowerlike aggregates of SWCNHs and AgNPs, and also their integration with each other. Detailed studies suggest lamellar organizations of the linear metal ligand complexes in the NMOPs, which upon association create a three-dimensional network that eventually immobilizes the solvent molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} modern human origins in Australia {{has a long}} history. Throughout much of this history, workers {{interested}} in {{the origins of the}} Australians have often focused on scenarios that invoke multiple founding populations for the modern inhabitants of this continent. These theories have included the Trihybrid model by Birdsell and the <b>Dihybrid</b> model championed by Thorne, with the latter often portrayed as one of the strongest supports for the modern Multiregional hypothesis. "The mark of ancient Java" has long been thought to link populations like the Ngandong fossils to both fossil and modern Australian Aboriginals.

30|$|One {{plant has}} the {{genotype}} WR 1 WR 1 wr 2 wr 2, while another has the genotype wr 1 wr 1 WR 2 WR 2. These two plants also develop wine red and dark wine red colour; since, they have either WR 1 / WR 2 in the homozygous state, which {{is able to}} produce wine red and dark wine red colour. Two plants out of 16 are heterozygous for WR 2 and homozygous for wr 1 and vice versa. These four plants do not develop wine red and dark wine red colour; since, the homozygous recessive state of wr 2 and wr 1, reverses the dominance relationship between WR 1 /wr 1, WR 2 / wr 2, respectively. The remaining one plant is also light yellow/no reaction because it is homozygous recessive for both the genes wr 1 wr 1 wr 2 wr 2. Thus, the typical <b>dihybrid</b> 15 : 1 ratio for duplicate gene action is modified as 11 : 5 due to the reciprocal dominance modification of wr 1 and wr 2.|$|E
40|$|Importins {{are members}} of a family of {{transport}} receptors (karyopherins) that mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein and RNA cargoes. We identified importin- 11 as a potential new human member of this family, on the basis of limited similarity to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein, Lph 2 p, and cloned the complete open reading frame. Importin- 11 interacts with the Ran GTPase, and constitutively shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. A yeast <b>dihybrid</b> screen identified UbcM 2, an E 2 -type ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, as a binding partner and potential transport cargo for importin- 11. Importin- 11 and UbcM 2 interact directly, and the complex is disassembled by Ran:GTP but not by Ran:GDP. UbcM 2 is constitutively nuclear and shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Nuclear import of UbcM 2 requires Ran and importin- 11, and is inhibited by wheatgerm agglutinin, energy depletion or dominant interfering mutants of Ran and importin-β. These data establish importin- 11 as a new member of the karyopherin family of transport receptors, and identify UbcM 2 as a nuclear member of the E 2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the same}} {{features}} of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have made it so useful as a genetics and molecular biology research organism make it equally useful as a teaching organism.

The unique characteristic of yeast as a unicellular, eukaryotic organism with a complete sexual life cycle is ideal for teaching. A simple monohybrid cross to explore dominance and recessiveness, a <b>dihybrid</b> cross to demonstrate independent assortment, pigmented adenine auxotrophs for investigating the fundamentals of gene action, and easily measured responses to ultraviolet readiation provide an array of appropriate laboratory tools that put real science in the hands of students and teachers. Direct collaborations between scientists and science teachers bring together complementing knowledge and experience, providing an effective and efficient way to adapt and simplify techniques and procedures to accommodate time and money constraints. Collaborations quickly identify technical and theoretical problems that must be solved for implementation in classrooms.

40|$|In this study, single crosses {{involving}} four CMS {{lines and}} three known fertility restorers were studied {{to determine the}} genetics of fertility restoration in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.). The F 1 plants of all the four hybrids were selfed to produce F 2 seed and simultaneously crossed to their corresponding A lines to produce BC 1 F 1 seeds during 2007. The parents, F 1, F 2 and BC 1 F 1 populations were planted in 2008 rainy season at the Marathwada Krishi Vidyapeeth, Parbhani, India. The interaction of dominant nuclear genes of ICP 2766 with ICPA 2092 produced 100 % fertile F 1 plant and showed complete dominance for fertility restoration. The restorer ICP 2766 when crossed with ICPA 2092 showed monogenic inheritance (3 : 1), while ICP 2766 crossed with ICPA 2043 revealed digenic inheritance (15 : 1) of fertility restoration. In a cross between ICP 2766 and ICPA 2043, dominant gene of fertility restoration at either of two loci masked the expression of male-sterile recessive alleles at two loci {{in such a way}} that it modified normal <b>dihybrid</b> ratio into 15 : 1 ratio and produced duplicate gene interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} gene flow on Hispanic populations from {{different}} geographic {{regions of the}} United States was analyzed using six autosomal DNA markers (LDLR, GYPA, HBGG, D 7 S 8, GC, and HLA-DQA). By region of sampling, the Hispanic populations showed different ancestry contributions, from a trihybrid structure with European, Native American, and African contributions (California, Nevada, Florida, New Jersey, and Virginia) to a <b>dihybrid</b> structure with European and American contributions (Southwest population) or European and African contributions (Pennsylvania and Southeast population). These findings allowed us to define two regional groups, the West and the East. In the former, Native American contributions ranged from 35. 58 % to 57. 87 %; in the East region the values ranged from 0 % to 21. 27 %. An African influence was similar in both regions, ranging from 0 % to 17. 11 %, with a tendency of increasing in the East region.

40|$|The geminivirus {{replication}} factor AL 1 {{interacts with}} the plant retinoblastoma-related protein (pRBR) to modulate host gene expression. The AL 1 protein of tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) binds to pRBR through an 80 -amino-acid region that contains two highly predicted α-helices designated 3 and 4. Earlier studies suggested that the helix 4 motif, whose amino acid sequence is strongly conserved across geminivirus replication proteins, {{plays a role in}} pRBR binding. We generated a series of alanine substitutions across helix 4 of TGMV AL 1 and examined their impact on pRBR binding using yeast two-hybrid assays. These experiments showed that several helix 4 residues are essential for efficient pRBR binding, with a critical residue being a leucine at position 148 {{in the middle of the}} motif. Various amino acid substitutions at leucine- 148 indicated that both structural and side chain components contribute to pRBR binding. The replication proteins of the geminiviruses tomato yellow leaf curl virus and cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) also bound to pRBR in yeast <b>dihybrid</b> assays. Mutation of the leucine residue in helix 4 of CaLCuV AL 1 reduced binding. Together, these results suggest that helix 4 and the conserved leucine residue are part of a pRBR-binding interface in begomovirus replication proteins...|$|E
40|$|The stable {{inheritance}} of the 2 μm plasmid {{in a growing}} population of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dependent on two plasmid-encoded proteins (Rep 1 p and Rep 2 p), together with the cis-acting locus REP 3 (STB). In this study we demonstrate that short carboxy-terminal deletions of Rep 1 p and Rep 2 p severely diminish their normal capacity to localize to the yeast nucleus. The nuclear targeting, {{as well as their}} functional role in plasmid partitioning, can be restored by the addition of a nuclear localization sequence to the amino or the carboxy terminus of the shortened Rep proteins. Analyses of deletion derivatives of the Rep proteins by using the in vivo <b>dihybrid</b> genetic test in yeast, as well as by glutathione S-transferase fusion trapping assays in vitro demonstrate that the amino-terminal portion of Rep 1 p (ca. 150 amino acids long) is responsible for its interactions with Rep 2 p. In a monohybrid in vivo assay, we have identified Rep 1 p, Rep 2 p, and a host-encoded protein, Shf 1 p, as being capable of interacting with the STB locus. The Shf 1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli can bind with high specificity to the STB sequence in vitro. In a yeast strain deleted for the SHF 1 locus, a 2 μm circle-derived plasmid shows relatively poor stability...|$|E
40|$|The {{three major}} leaf types in {{chickpea}} are normal compound leaf, simple leaf and multipinnate. Simple leaf types are less commonly cultivated worldwide {{and are often}} reputed to be susceptible to ascochyta blight disease, whereas other leaf types range from resistant to susceptible. This study determined the association between host plant resistance to ascochyta blight and different leaf types in segregating populations derived from crosses between disease resistant and susceptible chickpea genotypes. In addition, the inheritance of disease resistance and leaf type was investigated in intraspecific progeny derived from crosses between two resistant genotypes with normal leaf type (ICC 3996 and Almaz), one susceptible simple leaf type (Kimberley Large) and one susceptible multipinnate leaf type (24 B-Isoline). Our results showed that, in these segregating populations, susceptibility to ascochyta blight was not linked to multipinnate or simple leaf types; resistance to ascochyta blight depended more on genetic background than leaf shape; leaf type was controlled by two genes with a <b>dihybrid</b> supplementary gene action; normal leaf type was dominant over other leaf types; and inheritance of ascochyta blight resistance was controlled by two major genes, one dominant and one recessive. Since there was no linkage between ascochyta blight susceptibility and leaf type, breeding various leaf types with ascochyta blight resistance is a clear possibility. These results have significant implications for chickpea improvement, as most current extra large seeded kabuli varieties have a simple leaf type...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{naturally}} occurring dwarf lines of pearl millet [Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke], identified {{from the world}} collection, varied for several morphological and agronomic characters. Extreme dwarfs were characterized by a tufted growth habit which could be distinguished {{from the time of}} germination, while the other dwarf lines could be distinguished only after anthesis. The F 1 hybrids between the tall and dwarf genotypes were tall, indicating that dwarfness is a recessive trait. In 10 out of the 13 crosses, the F 2 segregation ratio was three tall to one dwarf (3 ratio 1) suggesting that the dwarfness is controlled by a single recessive gene, while the height differences in 3 of the dwarfs (IP 8056, IP 8210 and IP 8214) were controlled by more than one gene as they showed continuous variation for plant height in F 2. When the remaining 10 single gene dwarfs were crossed to either d 1 (lsquoTift 238 rsquo) or d 2 (lsquoTift 23 DBrsquo) dwarfs, only 2 crosses produced tall F 2 hybrids and they segregated for height in F 2 indicating that these 2 dwarfs are non-allelic to d 1 and d 2. Reciprocal crosses of these 2 dwarfs produced tall F 1 hybrids and showed a <b>dihybrid</b> segregation of 9 ratio 3 ratio 4 in F 2 indicating that the dwarfing genes of these 2 parents are non-allelic to each other.

We investigated the contribution of a functional SNP in the promoter of the SERPINH 1 gene, enriched among those of African ancestry, to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), the leading identifiable cause of preterm birth. SERPINH 1 encodes heat-shock protein 47, a chaperone essential for collagen synthesis. The SERPINH 1 − 656 minor T allele had a greater frequency in African populations and African Americans than in European Americans (12. 4 % vs. 4. 1 %). The − 656 T allele displayed significantly reduced promoter activity compared to the major − 656 C allele in amnion fibroblasts, which lay down the fibrillar collagen that gives tensile strength to the amnion. An initial case-control study demonstrated that the − 656 T allele is significantly more frequent in African-American neonates (P < 0. 0009) born from pregnancies complicated by PPROM compared with controls (odds ratio of 3. 22, 95 % confidence interval 1. 50, 7. 22). There {{was no significant difference}} in ancestry among cases and controls using a <b>dihybrid</b> model based on 29 ancestry-informative markers. Adjusting the results of the case-control study for admixture still yielded a statistically significant association between the − 656 T allele and PPROM (P < 0. 002). A follow-up case-control study gave similar results. The combined case-control findings showed a highly significant (P < 0. 0000045) association between the − 656 T allele and PPROM.

The variety Akbar resembled these {{characters}} except the auricle colour, {{where it was}} white. On the contrary, the selected line FM- 147 was found with tip sterile, white auricle, and waxy bloom characters. The F 1 s in three different crosses (AG × FM- 147, AN × FM- 147) were found with normal spikes, white auricle, and non-waxy bloom. The F 1 population of three crosses were found to segregate {{in the proportion of}} 3 : 1 with normal and tip sterile plants. Backcross progenies were found to segregate into 1 : 1 ratio with normal and tip sterile plants. These results indicated that a recessive gene controls the tip sterility. The auricle pigmentation in F 2 s of the crosses between AG × FM- 147 and AN × FM- 147 was found to show the ratio 3 : 1 with auricle of pink and white pigmentation. Backcross progenies showed also the ratio 1 : 1. The inheritance of auricle pigmentation was also found to be governed by a single recessive gene. The F 2 s in three crosses showed the ratio 3 : 1 with waxy bloom and non- waxy bloom. Backcross progenies showed also the ratio 1 : 1 for these two characters.

40|$|Mungbean plants {{generally}} {{have a relatively}} close canopy, thus {{a large amount of}} self-shading can reduce yield due to poor light penetration. Modification of leaflet type can affect leaf canopy and could alter seed yield. Two multiple leaflet mutants were obtained from gamma-ray irradiation and used to study the mode of inheritance related to leaflet types and to evaluate their agronom-ic features. The cross between large-heptafoliate leaflet with small-pentafoliate leaflet mutants produce all F 1 plants with normal tri-foliate leaflets. The F 2 plants segregated in leaflet size and leaflet number into a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 ratio of large-trifoliate: large-heptafoliate: small-pentafoliate: small-heptafoliate plants, suggesting that independent loci control leaflet size and leaflet number. Regarding leaflet number, the F 2 population can be classified into normal-trifoliate, small-pentafoliate, large-heptafoliate, and small-heptafoliate at the <b>dihybrid</b> ratio of 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. The gene symbols N 1,n 1 and N 2,n 2 are proposed to represent leaflet number. Since no plant was found with large-pentafoliate leaflets, we hypothesize that the N 2 allele expresses pleiotropic effect on both leaflet number and leaflet size. Another possibility is that an additional locus with S and s alleles controls leaflet size and S is tightly linked with N 2. The effect of multifoliate leaflet on yield and yield components was evaluated in four mungbean families each with four leaflet isolines under three environments. Averaging across the families and environments, the normal-trifoliate and large-heptafoliate lines gave higher yield than small pentafoliate and heptafoliate ones.

An occurrence of this sort has recently been noted in one of my maize cultures and the F 2 numbers are explained here as a trihybrid or tetrahybrid ratio. The crosses in question were made primarily for a study of size inheritance and fairly large numbers have been grown. The varieties concerned are two dwarfs of distinctly different types, Tom Thumb pop and California Rice pop, and a tall type Missouri dent. The facts with reference to aleurone color are these: Tom Thumb pop, a 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 corn (i. e., having non-colored aleurone), was crossed with Missouri dent, also a white corn. Three generations of hybrid plants four generations for aleurone and other endosperm characters- have been grown without the appearance of any but white grains.

Like CLCA 2, EVA 1 is a type I transmembrane protein that is regulated by p 53 and p 63. It is thought to mediate homophilic cell-cell adhesion in diverse epithelial tissues. We found that EVA 1 is frequently downregulated in breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines, especially those of mesenchymal phenotype. Moreover, knockdown of EVA 1 in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) caused EMT, implying that EVA 1 is essential for epithelial differentiation. Both EVA 1 and CLCA 2 co-localized with E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions. The interacting domains were delimited by deletion analysis, revealing the site of interaction to be the transmembrane segment (TMS). The primary sequence of the CLCA 2 TMS {{was found to be}} conserved in CLCA 2 orthologs throughout mammals, suggesting that its interaction with EVA 1 co-evolved with the mammary gland. A screen for other junctional interactors revealed that CLCA 2 was involved in two different complexes, one with EVA 1 and ZO- 1, the other with beta catenin. Overexpression of CLCA 2 caused downregulation of beta catenin and beta catenin-activated genes. Thus, CLCA 2 links a junctional adhesion molecule to cytosolic signaling proteins that modulate proliferation and differentiation. These results may explain how attenuation of CLCA 2 causes EMT and why CLCA 2 and EVA 1 are frequently downregulated in metastatic breast cancer cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Lentils are an {{inexpensive}} source of protein, vitamins and minerals. Lentil seeds contain carotenoids that have antioxidant properties and {{play an important}} nutritional role as precursors of vitamin A. Improving concentration of carotenoids in lentils has potential as component of a bio-fortification program. The understanding of the genetic control of carotenoids in lentil will help breeders develop strategies for developing varieties with higher carotenoid concentration. The objectives of this research program were to evaluate the concentration of carotenoids in mature lentil seeds and to identify genomic regions that possibly influence carotenoid concentration. The experimental program involved: i) 	analyzing the carotenoid concentration in seeds produced from the specific crosses among lentil genotypes with three cotyledon colours using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) ii) 	analyzing an association mapping panel to develop potential single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for genes associated with carotenoid concentration For the first objective, <b>dihybrid</b> crosses were made between lentil cultivars with red, yellow and green cotyledons. Hybridized lentil populations were grown in the greenhouse and phytotron chamber up to the F 3 generation and then seeds were analyzed for carotenoid concentration. As expected, the expression of red cotyledon colour was dominant over yellow, and these two cotyledon colours were inhibited by an epistatic interaction with green cotyledon colour. Lentil seeds with green cotyledon colour had higher carotenoid concentration than red cotyledon types which in turn had higher carotenoid concentration compared to yellow cotyledon lentils. Identifying molecular markers associated with carotenoids {{can be part of}} a crop improvement strategy for both marker-assisted selection and marker-assisted breeding (MAS; MAB). Association mapping using broad genetic materials might result in high resolution. For this purpose an association mapping panel of 143 lentil genotypes was grown at two different locations near Saskatoon, Canada, in 2011 and 2012. Concentration of three carotenoids in lentil seed samples was measured using reverse phase HPLC. Of the 143 genotypes, 60 accessions were common for both years and locations. Concentrations of lutein, zeaxanthin and violaxanthin in seed samples were determined. Genotyping was accomplished using 1536 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers of an Illumina Golden-Gate assay. It was determined that 168 of the SNP markers were significantly associated with carotenoid concentration components using the GLM (generalized linear model) model. These putative SNPs could be used for MAS and MAB to improve selection for carotenoids in lentil to increase the nutritional value of lentil...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{application}} of genetic transformation technique, especially in developing rice variety resistant to brown plant hopper and stem borer, {{will depend on}} transgene being expressed and the gene inherited in a stable and predictable manner. This study aimed to analyse transgene segregation pattern of the progenies and the crosses of transgenic rice cv. Rojolele harboring cry 1 Ab and gna genes. The third generation (T 2) of five transgenic Rojolele events containing gna and/or cry 1 Ab were evaluated for two generations to identify the homozygous lines and to study their inheritance. The homozygous lines were selected based on the result of PCR technique. The segregation patterns of gna and cry 1 Ab were studied in eight F 2 populations derived from Rojolele x transgenic Rojolele homozygous for cry 1 Ab and or gna and their reciprocal crosses. Data  resulted from PCR of F 2 population were analysed using a Chi Square test.  The study obtained six homozygous lines for gna, namely A 22 - 1 - 32, A 22 - 1 - 37, C 72 - 1 - 9, F 11 - 1 - 48, K 21 - 1 - 39, K 21 - 1 - 48, and two homozygous lines for cry 1 Ab, namely K 21 - 1 - 39 and K 21 - 1 - 48. Both cry 1 Ab and gna transgenes had been inherited through selfing and crossing with their wild type as indicated from the F 1 containing gna and cry 1 Ab as many as 48. 4 % and 47. 4 %, respectively. In six of the eight crosses, gna was inherited in a 3 : 1 ratio consistent with Mendelian inheritance of a single dominant locus, while in the remaining two crosses, gna was segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio. The presence of cry 1 Ab in F 2 populations also showed a 3 : 1 segregation ratio in all crosses. In the F 2 population derived from F 1 plant containing cry 1 Ab and gna, both transgenes segregated in a 9 : 3 : 3 : 1 <b>dihybrid</b> segregation ratio. This study will add to the diversity of genetic sources for insect resistance and allow further use of these transgenic lines for pyramiding resistance to brown plant hopper and stem borer or  separately in rice breeding programs whenever the efficacy tests and biosafety requirements have been completed...|$|E
40|$|Cultivar {{progression}} requires {{years of}} development prior to performance trials; reducing development time requirements {{as well as}} introgression of favorable alleles {{is crucial to the}} rapid improvement of cultivars. Multi-parental advance generation intercrossing (MAGIC) can provide improved genetic mapping resolution through increased allelic diversity and higher effective recombination frequencies. The Four Parent Maize (FPM; Zea mays L.) population implements a series of the strategies used in MAGIC and bi-parental populations, creating a mapping population comprised of 1, 149 individuals with 118, 509 markers for comparison of effects on genetic mapping resolution and accuracy of quantitative trait locus (QTL) allelic estimates. Measurements were recorded for plant height (PH), ear height (EH), days to anthesis (DTA) and silking (DTS) in seven environments spanning three years. While increasing the generations of intermating prior to selection does not increase the phenotypic distribution among the <b>dihybrid</b> subpopulations, it does increase the mapping resolution of QTL for EH, DTA and DTS. Using association mapping software we have identified an allele from Tx 903 on chromosome 3 which decreased plant and ear height, by 4. 2 and 3. 7 cm, respectively. Additionally, an allele that decreases flowering time by one day was donated by Tx 903 and Tx 772. The detection of these QTL have previously been reported in the same region, but the allelic effect has yet to be validated. Although a single QTL was found for each quantitative trait, it is expected that many additional QTL are present; but were undiscovered due to the conservative nature of the Bonferroni multiple test correction criteria. Linkage map construction will improve estimates of the effects of multiple founders and advance generation intermating on increased effective recombination and resulting accuracy in QTL estimation and mapping resolution. Cycling of plant cells in vitro could reduce generation times required for new cultivar development. Carrot (Daucus carota) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) species were selected for their extensive tissue culture history and high tolerance toward in vitro manipulation. Isolation of parental protoplasts from cell suspensions was followed by sorting of individual cells through fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACs); expectantly allowing for production of totipotent single cell derived colonies. Supposed colonies could be designated, with marker assisted selection for further in vitro cycling or regeneration and advancement to performance trials. Demonstrating that single cells can be isolated, can divide to form cell colonies, and can be genotyped and regenerated is central to testing the proposed hypothesis of Cycling of Gametes in Vitro (CoGiV) as conceivable. This will warrant further testing towards development of procedures intended for in vitro gametogenesis induction...|$|E
40|$|CLCA 2 is a p 53 -inducible {{transmembrane protein}} that is {{frequently}} downregulated in breast cancer. CLCA 2 is a 943 amino acid type I transmembrane protein that is cleaved near amino acid 700 {{to produce a}} diffusible 100 kD product. The N-terminus contains a hydrolase-like domain with well-conserved HEXXH zinc binding amino acid motif that was proposed to cleave the precursor auto-proteolytically. We investigate the auto-proteolysis of CLCA 2 precursor. Using membrane extracts or purified protein from CLCA 2 -transfected cells, we show here that CLCA 2 cleavage is catalyzed by zinc and inhibited by metal chelator EDTA. Moreover, an E 165 Q mutation in the metal binding site abolished processing without affecting stability or trafficking. The mutant could be cleaved by co-transfected wild type CLCA 2, showing that the mutation had not caused an un-cleavable conformation and suggesting that it occurs in trans. Wild type CLCA 2 was able to cleave CLCA 2 E 165 Q mutant in vitro only after denaturation and renaturation, suggesting that a conformational shift is required for cleavage. The efficiency of cleavage increased steeply with increasing concentration of precursor, consistent with trans proteolysis but not cis or cleavage by another agent. Accordingly, CLCA 2 molecules bearing different epitope tags formed a stable complex that could be co-immunoprecipitated. Cleavage appears to be specific within isoforms; CLCA 1 was unable to neither cleave CLCA 2 nor form a stable complex with it. Furthermore, cleavage causes a conformational shift: an N-terminal antibody that immunoprecipitates the precursor fails to precipitate the N-terminal product unless it is first denatured with ionic detergent. We found that cleavage is enhanced by p 53 induction due to DNA damage, implying that the cleavage has functional consequences for stress response. Moreover, we found that HEK and MCF 10 A cells expressing the E 165 Q mutant had a higher proliferation rate than cells expressing wild type CLCA 2, suggesting that the metalloprotease activity contributes to the anti-proliferative effect of CLCA 2. Physiologically, CLCA 2 plays {{an essential role in}} epithelial differentiation. It is induced during epithelial differentiation in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), and its knockdown causes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). To determine how CLCA 2 promotes epithelial differentiation, we searched for interactors using membrane <b>dihybrid</b> screening. We discovered a strong interaction with Epithelial V-like Antigen 1 (EVA 1) and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Like CLCA 2, EVA 1 is a type I transmembrane protein that is regulated by p 53 family. EVA 1 resembles tight junction proteins called Junctional Adhesion Molecules (JAMs) by structure but we found by confocal analysis that EVA 1 is localized the lateral interface at cell-cell junctions. Analysis of transcriptional profiles revealed that EVA 1 is frequently downregulated in breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines, especially those of mesenchymal phenotype, and upregulated during epithelial differentiation. Like CLCA 2, knockdown of EVA 1 resulted in rapid EMT in immortalized HMEC. The interacting domains were delimited by deletion analysis, revealing that both the proteins interact via their transmembrane segments (TMS). The interaction was specific, as other transmembrane proteins did not interact with CLCA 2 or EVA 1. We also found that CLCA 2 binds to ZO- 1 and beta-catenin at its c-terminus but EVA 1 does not. Interestingly, we found that EVA 1 does interact with ZO- 1 in the presence of CLCA 2, indicating that these three form a complex at the cell-cell junctions that allows stabilization of belt-like adherens junctions (AJ). On the other hand CLCA 2 may also stabilize adherens junctions by sequestering beta-catenin at the cell-cell junctions. These results indicate that CLCA 2 {{plays a key role in}} maintaining epithelial differentiation via multiple ways. Either by binding to beta-catenin or forming a complex with EVA 1 and ZO- 1, it plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial differentiation. This explains the downregulation of both CLCA 2 and EVA 1 during tumor progression...|$|E
