40|$|International audienceThe {{transition}} to a more sustainable society {{is now at the}} top of numerous political agendas. With a view to putting this concept into practice, models based on a <b>functional</b> <b>economy</b> have been developed during recent decades. From the writings of Stahel and Giarini (1990) to the product service system approach (Mont, 2004), much work has therefore focused on decoupling the satisfaction of human needs from pressures on natural capital. This work involves seeking to optimize use value above all, rather than constantly renewing the physical dimension of the capital. Although the model shows promise, certain contradictions should be noted, such as the presence of rebound effects and the difficulty of achieving this decoupling. To overcome this, our approach attempts to strengthen the theoretical framework of the <b>functional</b> <b>economy</b> with contributions from ecological economics. This transposition of the science of ecosystems into a service-based context makes it possible to develop the notion of a service ecosystem (Lauriol, 2007). The latter involves considering new methods of transaction between the actors involved. Our methodology addresses a process in two stages. Contractualizing functionality involves developing an agreement based on a use cost, via consultation, then negotiation. The same item subjected to multiple uses then becomes the subject of shared valorization, i. e. of a collective, but differentiated, internalization of externalities. This process of monetizing functionality makes it possible to ensure that the models developed in this way are sustainable. In the context of new solutions incorporating companies, users and regional or local authorities, some first results from the mobility sector will deal with the switch to a functionality economy. The evolution from a linear and transitive approach to forming value to a socio-economic and ecosystemic approach re-examines notions of capital and transaction costs...|$|E

Examples of each are drawn from a major study on the successes and barriers of eco-services in Europe. The paper concludes that while {{there are a number of}} areas of success, there are considerable barriers to wider development and uptake of such services, and that many of the more successful service applications are not necessarily driven by environmental considerations.

40|$|Abstract Given {{the failing}} Zimbabwean state, it is {{imperative}} to understand the role of the government of Robert Mugabe in its failure to provide democratic freedom and a <b>functional</b> <b>economy.</b> According to Mugabe, the economy is failing due to the enforcement of trade sanctions and the reduction in development aid. However, given that the international community is only willing to remove these impediments to economic development once Robert Mugabe leaves power, the President still maintains his grip on power. Even though the vast majority of Zimbabwe’s population is suffering under an economic meltdown, a rapidly declining life expectancy, and oppressive government actions limiting free speech and political participation, Robert Mugabe has managed to not only retain his grip on power but justify his continued leadership to members of the African community. How a leader like this manages to avoid pressures to resolve such a dehumanizing crisis for so many years is perplexing. This report looks at the key tactics used by President Mugabe to remain in power by circumventing the democratic electoral process in Zimbabwe when the stakes became higher in 2000. The report looks at the Zimbabwe situation until the second round of elections in 2008 and does not cover the events of 2009. Through the close examination of The Logic of Political Survival (Bueno de Mesquita, Smith, Siverson and Morrow, 2003) and its selectorate theory, the paper concludes that the basis for longevity in power is not only based on oppression and loyalty but on the mentality of entitlement. After dealing with the question of how an authoritarian leader remains in power despite the social and economic devastation he or she may have caused, one is left with the question of how a society can reverse this notion of entitlement in order to free itself from oppression and economic devastation often brought on by such leaders...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{notions of}} <b>functional</b> <b>economy</b> in {{the designs of}} workplaces for agricultural cooperatives in Israel between 1940 and 1976. In particular, it analyzes the work of architects Arieh Sharon and Emmanuel Yalan in shaping an aesthetic and practical design approach to standard and optimal programmatic envelopes. These two men played primary roles in mediating between the pre-state cooperative culture and the discourse of a workers’ state. The dissertation also introduces a number of architects who played more minor roles. Through case studies and analyses of these architects’ writings, the dissertation argues that the designs for cooperative institutions, and for agricultural cooperatives more particularly, shed significant light on the architectural discourse of progress and development in post-independence Israel. It also clarifies the ways this discourse functioned both locally and globally. Agricultural cooperatives were {{key players in the}} promotion of Jewish sovereignty in Palestine prior to independence and under conditions of resource scarcity. As such, they defined both architectural standards and their differentiated system of representation, which technical and civic design tasks adopted. Despite the centrality of industrialization and the standardization of building practices in the first two decades after independence, pre-independence influences—most relevantly in this dissertation, interwar Modernism and cooperative history—continued to define and inflect architectural culture after independence. ^ The dissertation chronicles how the shift after 1948 to a discourse of regional cooperation and comprehensive planning and development has reconfigured two issues of functional economy: the optimum standard and a differentiated system of rural-urban representation. By examining the designs devised for rural production facilities for the Jewish Agency and a range of co-op administrative headquarters, this dissertation shows how architects, through ongoing references to local institutional networks originating in the cooperative experience, posited architecture’s civic impact on nation-building. ...|$|E

40|$|Compared regionally, Republic of Macedonia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} levels of grey economy activity. According to some estimations, it {{accounts}} for about 40 % of GDP. This high level of grey economy has a direct influence to the main economic indicators, categories and instruments for macroeconomic regulation: GDP value cannot be precisely measured, there are problems in formulating and realization of macroeconomic policy instruments (fiscal policy, monetary policy, social policy, foreign-trade policy), etc. Because of its high value, grey economy is challenging and serious danger for macroeconomic planning and regulation. By using qualitative, descriptive, statistic and comparative methodologies, this research attempts to locate causes, consequences and the scope of grey economy in Republic of Macedonia. It also presents different ways for measurement of the size of grey economy in the Republic of Macedonia and understands the basic characteristics of the Macedonian case in order to present well‐grounded policy recommendations. The main finding (conclusion) of the paper is the fact that the grey economy in The Republic of Macedonia is a multifaceted phenomenon and the most efficient manner to remove the causes for the occurrence and presence of the grey economy is the improvement of the institutional frame in the country. There is a need for directly focused Government measures that would precipitate the integration of the grey economy in the formal sector, once the right conditions are put in place. The recommendations that this paper promotes will head exactly in that direction. The main recommendation is directed towards activities and measures of the authorities for preventing and removing the reasons of grey economy appearance and punishment of the consequences of this national economy “evil”. Another recommendation is for the Government to increase the speed for redefining (changing) its role on the market. Although there are noticeable signs that the situation has been changing, there is a need for widening the awareness of all business players for the necessity of playing by the rules as well as for enforcing the institutional framework, legal order, moral values and the motivators of the country’s <b>functional</b> <b>economy.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The Construction of National Identity in Estonian Daily Newspapers in the 1920 s” The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse how {{different}} forms of national identity were produced by Estonian printed press during the 1920 s and what were the distinctive features characterising these forms of identity. Articles published in Postimees ja Päevaleht in 1921 - 1929 were taken under closer examination. Newspapers had {{an important role to}} play in the construction of Estonian national identity in the 19 th century and {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th century. Figuratively it can be said that Estonian national identity was created by the printed word. The theoretical framework of the thesis derives from the constructivist view on reality believing that national identity is a product of social construction and thereby it could be produced and changed. National identity is discursively produced, reproduced, transformed and destructed by means of language and other semiotic systems. Media is one of these discursive means. Newspapers participate in the construction of national identity by creating messages, stereotypes and context. The production of national identity is especially intense in a state where conditions are favorable for the appearance of “hot nationalism”. Articles published under these conditions are the main object of research in this thesis. The thesis also relies on the political-cultural model of nationalism. According to this dualistic model there are two types of nationalism – western political or civic nationalism and eastern cultural or ethnic nationalism. These two concepts are not considered to be exclusive but instead the thesis relies on an assumption that national identity includes both political and cultural element. The importance and relations between different forms of identity change due to social situational settings. The changes in social setting have also changed Estonian nationalism/national identity. In the beginning cultural elements were prevailing but in the beginning of the 20 th century when Estonia had became an independent state, where nation- and state-building occurred, political elements were the most prominent in shaping the construction of national identity. Arising from the theoretical framework the thesis is trying to answer the following questions: - Did the articles published in Estonian newspaper during the 1920 s produce political national identity or cultural national identity or both? - Where there any changes visible in the construction of national identity in 1921 - 1929 and if there were, is it possible to associate these changes with social circumstances? - What were the characteristic features of different forms of national identity produced in the 1920 s? In order to find answers to these questions LCA-method (Latent Class Analysis) was used. This method produced a solution according to which four different classes or forms of national identity appeared. These classes were analysed by quantitative and qualitative means in order to describe the nature and relations between different forms of identity. Identity forms were also analysed from the historical viewpoint, which made it possible to connect the changes in national identity with the developments in the social situation in Estonia during the 1920 s. The four different forms of identity that appeared in the articles were named the production of political identity, the production of past-oriented identity, the production of cultural identity and the production of political-historical identity. The most commonly produced identity form in the articles was political identity, followed by past-oriented and cultural identity. Political-historical identity was most rarely constructed in the articles. The production of political identity was mainly oriented towards the appreciation of democratic and economic values. It was conveyed that democratic state system and <b>functional</b> <b>economy</b> are the main groundsels that ensure the future of Estonian nation. The production of cultural identity was associated with stressing the importance of culture, language, education and science. Achievements in the intellectual sphere are as significant to the development of Estonia as democratic state and good economy. Political-historical identity valued democracy and economic indicators but also emphasised the importance of common national factors and historical past. In the centre of the past-oriented identity were history and the antagonism with the foreign nations that had oppressed Estonia over many centuries. The results of the analysis indicated that during the 1920 s political national identity was most commonly produced by the two major Estonian newspapers. It was also concluded that generally the political-cultural model of nationalism could be implemented to describe the developments of Estonian national identity. But political identity could not be considered as the only and dominant identity form because the production on past-oriented, cultural and political-historical identity also appeared. Postimees and Päevaleht constructed different patterns of identity on their pages and these identity patters also changed during the time period under examination. The most notable change that appeared was the increasing importance of the past-oriented identity. After the analysis of these developments it was concluded that changes in the construction of identity could be explained by the conditions prevailing in the Estonian society during the years 1921 - 1929...|$|E

Primarily, document analysis of the Grade 10 - 12 Life Sciences Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) was conducted to determine whether green economy content was prescribed in the CAPS document and to what degree. Secondly, Grade 10 Life Sciences teachers completed questionnaires and participated in interviews to reveal their opinions on the integration of green economy content in the Life Sciences curriculum, their understanding of green economy and its implementation, as well as their opinions on the relevance of the current Life Sciences curriculum’s content for afterschool use. 	 The research findings revealed that the Life Sciences curriculum can serve the purpose of introducing students to green economy aspects, however changes must be made to the curriculum so that <b>functional</b> green <b>economy</b> content is integrated. Currently, the curriculum does not provide guidelines for teachers on how to educate learners in such a manner that they will be able to participate in a green economy. Much of the content related to green economy topics is prescribed as extra content without the inclusion of student investigations or skill development activities. Furthermore, content on plants and human anatomy are prescribed and assessed in much greater detail than the environmental studies strand, resulting in the exclusion of much green economy related content. Findings indicate that socioscientific issues such as green economy are not linked to the environmental studies subject content, which means that daily-life application of content remains unclear to students. In addition to this, teachers revealed that they have knowledge of environmentally green practices but are unsure of how these relate to the economy. The researcher proposes that curriculum designers completely integrate green economy content into the Life Sciences CAPS document, including not only content for discussion purposes but also investigations and activities which will lead to skills development, compelling learners to modify their behaviour and seek solutions to the urgent problems faced by humanity in terms of environmental degradation and economic collapse.

In this paper the authors maintain that such an infrastructure must be developed for the new digital economy and society, one which provides trust and confidence for all those who operate in or are affected by it. An infrastructure that is an amalgam based on hardware, software, networks and a way of doing business which offers predictability, dispute resolution, legal recourse, policing powers against fraud,authentication, etc. The building of such an infrastructure is a necessary condition for the development and efficient functioning of a global, digital economy...|$|R

Heute gilt es die 'implizite Ethik' des ökonomischen Ansatzes aufzudecken, um einem reflektierten Umgang mit den Spannungen zwischen der 'eigensinnigen' Sachlogik des marktwirtschaftlichen Systems und den ethischen Prinzipien einer wohlgeordneten Gesellschaft freier Bürger zuzuarbeiten. Ausgehend von den konzeptionellen und methodologischen Ideen Adam Smiths und John St. Mills wird ein dualistisches Konzept Politischer Ökonomie entworfen, das funktionale Systemökonomie systematisch in praktische Sozialökonomie integriert. " (Autorenreferat) "Political {{economy has}} lost its classic {{self-awareness}} of being an ethical and political discipline. Rather it works as a methodical reduction of politics to 'pure' economics today. But this reduction itself is normatively based, of course. It is the task of economic ethics to elucidate the 'implicit ethics' of the economic approach and to advance a reflected treatment of the factual tensions between 'free' market economy and the principles of a well-ordered society of free citizens. The author goes back to Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, taking up their conceptual and methodological ideas of an ethically (re-) integrated market economy, and proposes a dual approach of a timely political <b>economy</b> that 'embeds' <b>functional</b> systems <b>economy</b> into a critically normative social economy.
