40|$|An initial {{reclamation}} of the Young Dong {{coal mine}} site, located in northeastern South Korea, {{was completed in}} 1995. Despite the filling of the adit with limestone, acid rock drainage (ARD) enters Young Dong tributary and is then discharged to Imgok Creek. This ARD carries an average of 500 mg CaCO 3 /l of <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity,</b> primarily as Fe(II) and Al. Before spring runoff, the flow of Imgok Creek is 3. 3 - 4 times {{greater than that of}} the tributary and has an alkalinity of 100 mg CaCO 3 /l, which is sufficient to eliminate the <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity</b> and raise the pH to about 6. 5. From April through September 2008, there were at least two periods of high surface flow that affects the flow of ARD from the adit. Flow of ARD reaches 2. 8 m 3 /min during spring runoff. This raised the concentrations of Fe and Al in the confluence with Imgok Creek. However, by 2 km downstream the pH of the Imgok Creek is 6. 5 and only dissolved Fe is above the Korean drinking water criteria (0. 30 mg/l). This suggests only a minor impact of Young Dong Creek water on Imgok Creek. Acid digestion of the sediments in Imgok Creek and Young Dong Tributary reveals considerable abundances of heavy metals, which could have a long-term impact on water quality. However, several water-based leaching tests, which better simulate the bioavailable metals pool, released only Al, Fe, Mn, and Zn at concentrations exceeding the criteria for drinking water or aquatic life.

Consequently, we have coined a new phrase “mining influenced waters ” to include all the types of water that can be encountered. These waters can be divided into four categories. For acid rock drainage (ARD) the primary treatment problem is the elimination of <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity</b> in the form of soluble iron and aluminum. For mineral processing waters, the water is usually basic and the primary treatment problem is usually the elimination of cyanide, arsenic and selenium. For marginal waters, the water is circum-neutral but contains contaminants slightly above aquatic standards. For these waters, the treatment problem is often reducing small concentrations of contaminants in high flows of water. Finally, for residual waters, the primary treatment problem is the removal of high levels of total dissolved solids. For residual waters, there are few treatment options and these waters are becoming a serious environmental problem in some mining operations.

40|$|A {{series of}} tracer tests {{has been carried}} out in the compost and {{limestone}} Tan-y-Garn Reducing and Alkalinity-Producing System (RAPS), designed to treat iron-rich net acidic mine water (mean pH 6. 18, Fe = 47 mg L- 1, alkalinity 1. 70 meq L- 1 and <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity</b> 1. 82 meq L- 1) in South Wales, UK. Conservative tracer breakthrough time in the RAPS basal effluent is approximately inversely related to throughflow rate. Repeat tracer tests indicate a long term decrease in hydraulic conductivity, but not in total porosity. A specific sodium chloride tracer test from June 2008 is reported, when 15 kg salt was added to a raw mine water inflow rate of 0. 87 L s- 1. Electrical conductivity and major ion chemistry were monitored for a 170 hour period. Sodium exhibited a retardation of 1. 15 to 1. 2 in the RAPS medium relative to chloride, due to cation exchange. Simple 1 -D advection-diffusion analytical modelling succeeded in simulating the early portion of tracer breakthrough in the RAPS effluent. More complex analytical modelling, accounting for (i) mixing and dilution effects in the supernatant water input signature and (ii) matrix diffusion effects, was found to be required to adequately simulate the later-stage tail of the breakthrough curve in the RAPS effluent...|$|R

For an average non-marine sulphate decrease of 30 μeq l− 1 over 15 years from 1988 – 2003, we estimate that around 28 % was counterbalanced by rising strong organic acids, 20 % by rising alkalinity (partly attributable to an increase in weak organic acids), 11 % by falling inorganic aluminium and 41 % by falling non-marine base cations. The situation is complicated by a concurrent decrease in marine ion concentrations, and the impact this may have had on both DOC and acidity, but results clearly demonstrate that organic acid increases have substantially limited the amount of recovery from acidification (in terms of rising alkalinity and falling aluminium) that have resulted from reducing sulphur emissions. The consistency and magnitude of sulphate and organic acid changes are consistent with a causal link between the two, possibly due to the effects of changing acidity, ionic strength and aluminium concentrations on organic matter solubility. If this is the case, then organic acids can be considered effective but partial buffers to acidity change in organic soils, and this mechanism needs to be considered in assessing and modelling recovery from acidification, and in defining realistic reference conditions. However, large spatial variations in the relative magnitude of organic acid and sulphate changes, notably for low-deposition sites in northwestern areas where organic acid increases apparently exceed non-marine sulphate decreases, suggest that additional factors, such as changes in sea-salt deposition and climatic factors, may be required to explain the full magnitude of DOC increases in UK surface waters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{two-stage}} passive treatment {{approach was}} assessed at a bench-scale level using two Colorado Mining Influenced Waters (MIWs). The first-stage was a limestone drain {{with the purpose}} of removing iron and aluminum and mitigating the potential effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity.</b> The second stage was a sulfate reducing bioreactor composed solely of 50 % corn stover and 50 % walnut shells by volume. The primary difference in the two MIWs was the concentration of zinc 5 - 7 mg/L for the National Tunnel Adit drainage (NTA) vs. 65 - 75 mg/L for the Silver Cycle Adit drainage (SCA). The limestone pretreatment columns reduced the zinc in the NTA MIW to 1 - 2 mg/L and the SCA MIW to 38 - 56 mg/L. The two SCA biocolumns had similar zinc removal but different sulfate removal with time. The sulfate reduction rate (SRR) for the SCA columns peaked at day 50 but at 0. 5 mol S/m 3 /d for column 1 and 0. 3 mol S/m 3 /d for column 2. Average SRR after day 50 was 0. 24 and 0. 13 mol S/m 3 /d for columns 1 and 2, respectively. The NTA columns (3 and 4) sustained an averaged SRR of 0. 3 mol S/m 3 /d for days 30 - 130.

40|$|Hydrologic response, vegetation, {{nutrient}} cycling, {{and soil}} structure {{are some of}} the ecosystem properties affected when a watershed is strip-mined for coal and subsequently reclaimed. The present study sought to quantify the impacts of strip-mining and reclamation on the base cation pools and cycling within a watershed. To that end, a paired watershed study was conducted comparing a strip-mined watershed (TMat 1) to a second-growth forested watershed (TNef 1). Base cation input-output budgets were constructed for two watersheds using precipitation collection and stream sampling techniques. Soil base cation pools and cation exchange capacities were measured, and lysimeter samples were analyzed for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. In-stream silica concentrations were also measured to help discern whether base cation export was due to a silicate mineral weathering source or from the soil exchange complex. Although it was difficult to determine the source of base cations, TMat 1 was exporting vastly greater quantities of all four base cations than was TNef 1. Mineral soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Na were significantly greater at TMat 1, due to mining and exposure of mineral surfaces such as limestone and other bedrock. Mineral soil CEC was not significantly different between the two sites. Similarly, 15 cm deep lysimeters also had significantly higher levels of Ca, Mg, and Na at TMat 1 than TNef 1. From this research, it is clear that reclamation has not restored TMat 1 to its original condition {{and that there is a}} large amount of base cation export to the stream in this watershed. Prolonged cation export could cause long-term nutrient depletion, but could also serve to neutralize <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity</b> associated with acid mine drainage and acid rain at TMat 1...|$|R

Even though the adit was filled with limestone, there is still significant acid rock drainage (ARD) flowing from the site. An assessment that was started in March 2008 revealed that there were three types of water flowing from various sources on the site. ARD still flowed from the adit; which carried an average of 500 mg CaCO 3 / L of <b>mineral</b> <b>acidity</b> primarily {{in the form of}} Fe(II) with a flow that reached 2. 8 m 3 / min in spring runoff.

The water issuing from the adit is from a diffuse aquifer where concentrations increase when flow increases. In addition, the terrain is quite steep with few level spots. One other factor in the assessment of treatment is that a limestone quarry is only a few kilometers from the site. All of these factors have led to the conclusion that none of the traditional methods of passive treatment can be applied to this site. Instead, it is proposed to use an upgrade of a diversion well that is called a pulsed passive limestone reactor (PPLR). With maximizing all of the parameters that can be changed on a PPLR, it is anticipated that a one stage PPLR system could generate up to 250 mg CaCO 3 / L and so there would be a set of reactors needed to treat the complete flow...|$|R
