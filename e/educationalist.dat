40|$|Abstract In 1998 the Swedish {{legislation}} was sharpened, and active <b>educationalists</b> were legally bound to report any suspicion of child maltreatment. Nevertheless, {{there are a}} number of unrecorded cases of maltreated children, and research reveals that less than half of these children are reported to social services (Olsson, 2001). The purpose of the present study was to illustrate the problems with the mandatory reports in schools, as well as to study how <b>educationalists</b> proceed when they suspect that a child is maltreated. The method consisted of semi-structured interviews with five <b>educationalists.</b> The results revealed complex problems regarding <b>educationalists</b> mandatory reports. The procedures and routines varied and seem to be dependent on the <b>educationalists,</b> schools, and situations. The results also exposed the lack of official support in form of policy procedure manuals. Conclusion was that <b>educationalists</b> defined maltreated children in different ways, and in addition <b>educationalists</b> were not aware of the full significance of the mandatory reporting, even though they were aware of that they had a duty to report...|$|R

The <b>educationalists</b> in my study are employed in two different municipalities whereof {{one of them has}} invested in dance since 2011 for all <b>educationalists</b> working there. In the other has no general investments at dance for the preschool been made. My purpose of choosing <b>educationalists</b> working in different municipalities is to determine if their approach to dance as an educational tool in preschool differs in relation to the investments in dance. I have chosen three questions to get the answers on my purpose with this thesis. How does personal experience and interests in dance affect <b>educationalists</b> approach to dance activities in preschool? How do my informants narrative about their work with dance in preschool where they work? How does the municipalities’ investment in dance affect the <b>educationalists</b> approach and work with dance? This thesis is based on qualitative interviews with six <b>educationalists.</b> The developments educational theory of how children learn and develop in the framework of preschool is the basis for my understanding and analysis of my gathered empirical data. Some of the conclusions I have found are that the <b>educationalists</b> who are working in the municipality which has investment in dance are working with dance aesthetical and uses dance interdisciplinary...|$|R
