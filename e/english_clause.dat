This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire <b>English</b> <b>clause</b> with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E

For example, the Latin verb , meaning [...] "I will lead", includes the suffix , expressing person (first), number (singular), and tense (future). The use of this suffix is an inflection.

2500|$|Like the <b>English</b> <b>clause,</b> {{the nominal}} {{group is a}} {{combination}} of three distinct functional components, or metafunctions, which express three largely independent sets of semantic choice: the ideational (what the clause or nominal group is about); the interpersonal (what the clause is doing as a verbal exchange between speaker and listener, or writer and reader); and the textual (how the message is organised—how it relates to the surrounding text and the context in which it is occurring/ it occurs). In a clause, each metafunction is a virtually complete structure, and the three structures combine into one in interpretation. However, beneath the clause—in phrases and in groups, such as the nominal group—the three structures are incomplete of themselves and need to be interpreted separately, [...] "as partial contributions to a single structural line". In nominal groups, the ideational structure {{is by far the most}} significant in premodifying the head. To interpret premodification, it is necessary to split the ideational metafunction into two dimensions: the experiential and the logical.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 51) This thesis {{discusses the}} similarities and differences between Korean and <b>English</b> relative <b>clauses</b> on the basis of Ross???s NP-S analysis of relative <b>clauses.</b> Korean and <b>English</b> are unrelated languages. Korean is a SOV language whereas English is a SVO language. Thus, the order of <b>English</b> relative <b>clause</b> constituent structure is S-NP in Korean. Most previous contrastive studies of relative clauses in Korean and English were confined to superficial differences and problem points. This study broadens the scope of investigation and includes an explanation for most syntactic distinctions between Korean and <b>English</b> relative <b>clauses.</b> Although on the surface, Korean clausal modifiers lack relative pronouns, their underlying structures share similarities with <b>English</b> relative <b>clauses.</b> Both languages produce relative clauses by embedding the subordinate sentences into head NP's. The language specific transformational rules in relative <b>clause</b> formation for <b>English</b> are Pronominalization, Relative Pronoun Deletion, Modifier Shifting. For Korean the language specific rules are Modality Adjustment and Case Marker Deletion. Relative <b>Clause</b> Reduction in <b>English</b> and Copular and Existential Verb Deletion in Korean are similar rules. Constraints such as the Pied Piping Constraint, the Complex NP Constraint, the Sentential Subject Constraint, and the Coordinate Constraint are applied on relative clause formation in both languages. Although pseudo-relative clauses have similar semantic clues, they are derived from different underlying structures...|$|R

The main focus {{of this study is}} concentrated on the errors of the radio broadcasters and the participants based on the theory of The Surface Strategy Taxonomy. To get the sources of data, the writer uses a tape recorder so that she can transcribe them accurately. From the transcription, the writer then finds out the errors which become the data. After getting the data, the writer groups and analyzes them based on the Surface Strategy Taxonomy. The results reveal that the tendencies of errors that are produced by her subjects of the study that happen most are the Skeleton of <b>English</b> <b>Clauses,</b> the Auxiliary System, Prepositions, Parts of Speech, Miscellaneous Parts, Sentential Complements, Passive Sentences, and Temporal Conjunctions. The highest frequency of errors that the subjects have is the Skeleton of <b>English</b> <b>Clauses.</b> This part constitutes two categories; those are Missing Parts and Misinformation among Tenses. Missing Parts happen many times because the learners only combine one word with another without considering the importance of the existence of other function words. While Misinformation among Tenses happens because the learners pay more attention on the content than on the form. Besides, they also do not acquire some of the basic tenses well...|$|R

5000|$|Most of {{what are}} often {{referred}} to as verb tenses (or sometimes aspects) in English are formed using auxiliary verbs. Apart from what are called the simple present (write, writes) and simple past (wrote), there are also continuous (progressive) forms (am/is/are/was/were writing), perfect forms (have/has/had written, and the perfect continuous have/has/had been writing), future forms (will write, will be writing, will have written, will have been writing), and conditionals (also called [...] "future in the past") with would in place of will.

In most types of Modern <b>English</b> <b>clause,</b> there are two verb forms, but the verbs are considered to belong to different syntactic classes. The verbs which participated in inversion have evolved to form a class of auxiliary verbs which may mark tense, aspect and mood; the remaining majority of verbs with full semantic value are said to constitute the class of lexical verbs. The exceptional type of clause is that of declarative clause with a lexical verb in a Present simple or Past simple form.|$|E
