5|$|Between 1936–1955 the City of Denver {{used the}} Chicago and North Western Railway between Chicago and Omaha. After 1955 it used the Milwaukee Road. The train's Union Pacific route west of Omaha {{remained}} unchanged for the duration. The train followed the Overland Route from Omaha to Julesburg, where it diverged southwest for Denver. In March 1950 <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> following stops west of Omaha: Columbus, Grand Island, Kearney, and North Platte in Nebraska and Julesburg in Colorado. On the C <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> following stops west of Chicago, all in Iowa: Cedar Rapids, Ames, Boone, and Council Bluffs. The westbound train departed Chicago's Chicago and North Western Terminal at 5:00 PM {{and arrived at}} Denver's Union Station at 8:30 AM the following morning.|$|E

Six years after an amendment was made in the Indian Constitution, the union cabinet cleared the Right to Education Bill in 2008.|$|E
5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn blue shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton blue, which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Preckwinkle pursued {{disclosure}} of Chicago Police Department officers who used excessive force. The United States District Court had {{ruled that the}} records be unsealed and {{made available to the}} public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order. When the city argued in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to against disclosure, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> point that aldermen would have access to the information. Preckwinkle's August 23, 2007, request for disclosure was denied.|$|E
5|$|Late on June21, Celia turned due west as {{it moved}} around {{the south side of}} the ridge {{previously}} steering the hurricane to the west-southwest. A secondary eyewall was noted as <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> turn, indicating that the storm would further intensify once this feature further developed. Several hours later, the storm intensified into a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After briefly developing a prominent central dense overcast, the storm's structure began to degrade for unknown reasons. By the evening of June22, Celia was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane and the eye was no longer apparent on satellite imagery, mainly due to cirrus clouds over the system. The following morning, the eye reformed and the storm became more vertically aligned, allowing Celia to re-attain Category2 status. Throughout the day, Celia became increasingly organized and intensified, nearly attaining major hurricane status during the afternoon. Operationally, the hurricane was thought to have reached this intensity but post-storm analysis indicated that winds did not exceed 110mph (175km/h).|$|E

5|$|The {{evening of}} April 6 was a dispiriting {{end to the}} first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The cries of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps {{throughout}} the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> night a miserable experience for both sides.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} {{manager of}} Bristol Rovers was Albert Prince-Cox, who introduced blue-and-white quarters as the team's kit {{because he believed}} <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> players look larger and more intimidating. He also became the first manager {{to win a major}} cup competition with the club when they won the Division 3 (South) Cup in 1935. More success followed in the 1952–53 season when Bristol Rovers' longest serving post-war manager, Bert Tann, won a league title {{for the first time since}} 1905 and won promotion for the first time ever when the club won Division 3 (South). Tann remained in charge for eighteen years from 1950 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall. Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, but still a hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.|$|E

5|$|The 1999–00 {{season was}} the club's final {{year at the}} Ice Stadium {{before moving to the}} National Ice Centre. The budget for players was limited by the club {{chairman}} so that the Panthers would be able to break even the following season. Players were asked to take a wage cut, leading to the departure of Trevor Robins, Mike Bishop, Mark Kolesar, Eric Dubios and record goalscorer Paul Adey. This frustrated Mike Blaisdell who left the club in November to become head coach of the Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by former coach Alex Dampier. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals, Nottingham finished sixth in the eight team league. The club fared better in the Challenge Cup where <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2–1 at London Arena by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. On 22 March 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium. Jamie Leach scored Nottingham's last goal at their home of 54 years but the club was defeated 2–1 in overtime.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} trend ended {{early on}} September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection re-established itself. Bonnie continued its change in direction, {{turning to the}} southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a high-shear environment. It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm, and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28. During that period, Bonnie actually strengthened back into a high-end tropical storm. Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charley's path towards the Azores thereafter. The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear, although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast. The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph (100km/h) winds. After that, Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon, {{just east of the}} Azores. The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop, actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating. It dissipated on October2.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Aphrodite was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics, many of whom complimented it as a return to form for Minogue. However, critics were divided on its production; many felt Price's production helped make the album cohesive, while some felt <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> album sound too similar to Minogue's previous work and lacked innovation. Commercially, Aphrodite was a success. In Minogue's native country Australia, it peaked at number two on the Australian Albums chart, and was later certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums chart, a feat accomplished by Minogue's debut studio album Kylie (1988) during the same week 22 years prior. Aphrodite was the fourth studio album by Minogue to peak atop the UK albums chart and made her the first solo artist to have a number one album in four different decades in the region, achieving this in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. She also became a Guinness World Record-holder for achieving the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry certified Aphrodite platinum. The album also achieved strong charting internationally, reaching the top-five in countries like Belgium, France, Greece, Spain and Switzerland. It became Minogue's second highest-charting album in the United States by peaking at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart.|$|E
