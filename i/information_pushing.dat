40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>push</b> and <b>information</b> pull have {{recently}} emerged as useful concepts {{to describe the}} operation of distributed <b>information</b> resources. <b>Information</b> <b>push,</b> in particular, is becoming closely associated with intelligent agent functionality. Loosely speaking, if a user requests and receives a very speci c piece of information, this is information pull. If information is sent {{in anticipation of the}} user's need, or the agent's response includes information not directly solicited, then the situation is characterized as <b>information</b> <b>push.</b> Intuitively, junk mail (electronic or paper), television newscasts and wirefeeds are examples of <b>information</b> <b>push.</b> New web services such asPointcast and Informant are examples of more selective push technologies. Web browsing, library searches, and telephone white pages are traditional examples of information pull. Clearly, these categorizations can be ambiguous and are easily lost in semantics.

Speci cally, we develop a stochastic framework based on Markov models to describe an ambientenvironment and an agent system. Depending on the relationships between the environment, the agent and the user's performance criterion, a continuum of possible <b>information</b> <b>push</b> and pull scenarios can be described.

The status of a peer is represented in six levels: UNKNOWN, ONLINE, AWAY, BUSY, INVISIBLE, and OFFLINE, which can be assigned by relevant applications automatically or by the user manually. Recommendation services are also based on a user’s status.

30|$|Rumor {{spreading}} {{in complex}} social networks has recently attracted an increasing {{amount of attention}} from researchers [9 – 12]. They describe {{the dynamics of the}} models by deriving corresponding mean-field equations to formulate the characteristics and analyze the critical threshold of rumor spreading in the complex networks. In 1965, Daley and Kendall put forward the first classical DK rumor spreading model [13]. Some researchers applied a mathematical model to study the rumors and developed another classical model [14 – 17]. Early classical representations of rumor spreading dynamics assumed that all individuals have the homogeneous probability of connection [18 – 20]. Obviously, these simple models can not completely reflect the realistic feature of the spread of rumor, which is subsequently extended in ways to make them more realistic in recent years. Such extensions are combining with spreading mode that the online networks platform could affect the topology of rumor spreading network. Another direction to research rumor spreading model is to focus on the complex topology of social interactions. In the field of social network, the scale-free property is the fundamental characteristic, and the nodes stand for individuals and the edges stand for various interactions of people. Therefore, it makes more sense to study spreading dynamics on scale-free networks [21 – 26]. For further understanding of the rumor spreading dynamic in the real world, the counterattack and self-resistance mechanisms, trust mechanism, latent mechanism, rumor-killer mechanism, and <b>information</b> <b>pushing</b> mechanism [27 – 33] have been taken into account. These models more accurately reflect the spread of rumors and also give a lot of control strategies for rumors.|$|E

The functional definition of single components and the complete system were developed and tested within three workpackages with a total number of nine experiments. The test method is based on standardized and 'free driving' tasks in real traffic. The integral of the difference between actual and desired distance was brought in as the main objective evaluation criterion of the quality of control. A non scaled and coloured (red, yellow, green) display based on the distance in seconds is preferred for distance <b>information.</b> <b>Pushing</b> back the gas pedal completely is preferred in contrast to the single kick as tactile warning. The driver should be able to deactivate the intervention system in certain situations, the force of pushing back the pedal should be adjustable and approximate 60 N. An early intervention with moderate deceleration is preferrd at the Active Brake System. Here, the sum-concept is recommended, where system's and driver's brake pressure are added, in contrast to the min-max-concept, which uses the maximum of driver's and system's brake pressure. A positive effect of the driver support system for distance control and with that for traffic safety was proved in different experiments.

40|$|Indoor positioning, also {{referred}} to as indoor localization, shall be defined as the process of providing accurate people or objects coordinates inside a covered structure, such as an airport, an hospital,and any other building. The applications and services which are enabled by indoor localization are various, and their number is constantly growing. Industrial monitoring and control, home automation and safety, security, logistics, information services, ubiquitous computing, health care, and ambient assisted living (AAL) {{are just a few of}} the domains that indoor positioning technology can benefit. A significant example is offered by local <b>information</b> <b>pushing.</b> In this case, a positioning system sends information to a user based on her/his location. For instance, a processing plant may push workflow information to employees regarding operating and safety procedures relevant to their locations in the plant. The positioning system tracks each employee, and has knowledge of the floor plan of the facility as well as the procedures. When an employee walks inside a defined perimeter of a particular area, such as packaging department, the positioning systems displays on the user’s personal device assistant (PDA) information regarding the work expected to be done in that area This significantly increases efficiency and safety by ensuring that employees follow carefully designed guidelines. Location-enabled applications like this are becoming commonplace and will play important roles in our everyday life. The design of a positioning system for indoor applications is to be regarded as a challenging task. In fact, the global positioning system (GPS) is a great solution for outdoor uses, but its applicability is strongly limited indoors because the signals coming from GPS satellites cannot penetrate the structure of most buildings. For this reason, considerable research interest for alternative non-satellite-based indoor positioning solutions has arisen in the last years. Actually, the positioning problem is strictly related with the measurement of the distance between the object to be located and a number of landmarks with known coordinates. Then, the position of the target is commonly determined by means of appropriate statistical or geometrical algorithms. Several approaches have been proposed, and various are the fundamental technologies that have been used so far. Today, distance measurement between two objects can be easily obtained by using laser-, optical- and ultrasounds-based devices. However, evident drawbacks of these systems are their sensitivity to line-of-sight (LOS) constraint, and the strict object-to-object bearing requirement. The latter becomes an even worse downside when the topology of the system dynamically changes due to mobility of the target. On the other hand, wireless-based ranging solutions are more insensitive to obstacles and non-alignment condition of devices. In addition, they may take advantage of existing radio modules and infrastructures used for communications. Accordingly, the ever grow- ing popularity of mobile and portable embedded devices provided with wireless connectivity has encouraged the study and the development of radio-frequency (RF) -based positioning techniques. The core of such systems is the measurement of distance-related parameters of the wireless signal. The two most common approaches for wireless ranging are based on received-signal-strength (RSS) and message time-of-flight (ToF) measurements, respectively. In particular: • the RSS-based method relies on the relationship between the measured received signal power and the transmitter-receiver distance, assuming that the signal propagation model and the transmitted power are known; • the ToF-based technique leans on the measured signal propagation time and the light speed, owing to the fundamental law that relates distance to time. The work presented in this dissertation is aimed at investigating and defining novel techniques for positioning in indoor environment based on wireless distance measurements. In particular, this study is devoted to the analysis and in depth evaluation of the use of RSS and ToF measurements for different indoor positioning applications. State of the art techniques relying on RSS- and ToF-based ranging methods have already proven to be effective for the localization of objects inside buildings. Nevertheless, several limitations exist (e. g., on the accuracy of the ranging, its impact on localization algorithms, etc.). The work presented in this dissertation attempts to: 1. investigate the main sources of uncertainty affecting RSS- and ToF-based indoor distance measurement; 2. analyze the impact of ranging error on the accuracy of positioning; 3. propose, on the basis of the understanding gained from 1. and 2., novel and effective systems in order to overcome the above-mentioned limitations and improve localization performance. The novel contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows: • In-depth analysis of both RSS- and ToF-based distance measurement techniques, in order to assess advantages and disadvantages of each of them. • Guidelines for using different ranging methods in different conditions and applications. • Implementation and field testing of a novel data fusion algorithm combining both RSS and ToF techniques to improve ranging accuracy. • Theoretical and simulation-based analysis of chirp spread spectrum (CSS) signals for low-level timestamping. • Experimental assessment of CSS-based timestamping as key enabler for high accuracy ToF-based ranging and time synchronization...|$|E

With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of communication {{technology and the}} growth of mobile devices, the development of intelligent district network will be centered on IP multimedia which integrates the whole business. Meanwhile, information overload becomes a new problem. A reasonable network structure with low cost and stable performance, providing accurate information access for intelligent district users, becomes the focus of current research. This paper proposes a network topology for mobile intelligent district based on JXTA, designing and implementing <b>information</b> <b>push</b> service platform, which not only satisfies the network demand of intelligent district, but also satisfies users with a real time, accurate and stable information access...|$|R
