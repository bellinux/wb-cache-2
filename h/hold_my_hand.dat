25|$|Movie {{versions}} of camp TV shows {{in recent years}} have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In Grizzly Man (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of George Kuchar and his brother Mike Kuchar, ASS Studios, launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and Jen Miller, began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film Satan, <b>Hold</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hand</b> (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E

6000|$|My mother, {{when she}} had taken in the fact, {{actually}} shed tears of joy. Emily stood by me, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>My</b> father said, 'It is all owing to you, Castleford, and the helping hand you gave the poor boy.' ...|$|R
50|$|Her biography, <b>Holding</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hand</b> Through Hell, {{released}} by Ice Cube Press in October 2012, details her life of abuse, murder, and domestic violence.|$|R
60|$|But the trusting face {{beside me}} nerved me. As reward in lonely places I {{would let her}} <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Less than a mile," [...] Kate answered. [...] "Trust to me. I {{will see}} that nothing happens to you. <b>Hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> tightly, like that. Now come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fool that I was to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> And you, Watson, {{see what}} comes of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened, we'll avenge him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you talk}} like a wise man," [...] she laughed; then, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> she {{led me to}} the tree and sat down by my side on the poncho.|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure," [...] added her sister. [...] "Come, {{you must}} be obedient." [...] And still <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.|$|R
6000|$|... "You foolish boy!" [...] she cried. [...] "Can't you {{see that}} I am dying? <b>Hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> tightly and watch--watch! Here is one more thing you can see--that you cannot understand." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes; he {{is taking}} a long breath or two. You need not <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> so tight. His head is from us; and when he goes down he will go right away.|$|E
6000|$|Georgina said nothing, for a moment. [...] "Well, that, for instance, {{you should}} n't <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> quite so tight!" [...] And she {{disengaged}} this conscious member from the pressure of his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be put {{upon our}} trial before the queen, I think. <b>Hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and walk close beside me, {{but do not}} stare at me so hard. Is aught wrong with my dress?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps, Dr. Melville,' he said, 'it {{will be more}} {{reassuring to}} you if I at once <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> up,' and he sat there and smiled, holding up his neatly gloved hands.|$|R
60|$|He sat down, {{and made}} me sit beside him. <b>Holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in both his own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary look.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he took a}} quick {{step towards}} me, and before I could prevent it he had thrown himself at my feet on the cold stone floor, and was <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> tightly in his.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look up, Ruth dear," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{want you}} to look now--look along the lighted way and <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> very tightly. Don't you think that, after all, one of your ships has come home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am ready, Dick," [...] {{she said}} faintly, still with closed eyes. [...] "I {{want to make}} my sleepy, sleepy noise. Is the doctor ready? Come closer. <b>Hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> like you did before in the little death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} to listen, my lord," [...] she answered, without veiling a repugnance that he lacked the wit to see. [...] "But it is not {{necessary}} that you should <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> nor fitting that you should kneel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are just}} holding hands," [...] said the child, {{with an easy}} {{satisfaction}} in the explanation, which perhaps the old lady did not share. [...] "He always <b>holds</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> when he is with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} telling him," [...] Mary asked, [...] "that I {{would come to}} see him at once, but <b>my</b> father is <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> so tight that I could not draw it away without rousing him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{rushed to}} the window and {{recognized}} the Solivet colours. No doubt the baron had come to announce the arrival of my mother and the rest, and I hastened down to meet him at the door, full of delight, with <b>my</b> son <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
60|$|BLANCO. You do me good. Feemy. Stay by {{me to the}} end, wont you? <b>Hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> to the last; and I'll die game. [He {{puts out}} his hand: she strikes savagely at it; but he withdraws it in time and laughs at her discomfiture].|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} shan't <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> when I can {{get anything}} in it by reaching it out, {{for the sake}} of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe," [...] returned the woman coolly. [...] "Don't drop that oil upon the blankets, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|I had hoped, good reader, to have {{jotted down}} {{some more of}} my {{personal}} reminiscences of travel--in Algiers, the [...] "Pirate City," [...] at the Cape of Good Hope, and elsewhere--but bad health {{is not to be}} denied, and I find that I must <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Like 'is mother, wonderfully like 'is mother, ain't 'e?" [...] he observed, still <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "And that," [...] {{he added}} with a wink {{of one of his}} small eyes towards my father, [...] "is about the 'ighest {{compliment}} I can pay 'im, eh?" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Right, no beating {{about the}} bush, I have to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> up - I cost Manchester City the 1972 league championship." [...] Marsh {{agreed with the}} critics in his 2001 autobiography, saying that he regretted the move to Manchester City and he felt he let the {{supporters}} down.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} drew himself proudly up. [...] "Ere I answer such a question, father Abbot, {{do you answer}} one from me, {{and tell me what}} the monks of Waverley have ever done for me that I should <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> when I could injure them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry," [...] she said, [...] "do you {{remember}} all our contrivances? How {{you used to}} <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in the garden under the table, while I talked brazenly to Mr. Mason? And how jealous Jack Temple used to get?" [...] She laughed again, softly, always looking at the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to read you a few letters, but, of course, I shall not send them unless you approve. In fact"--with {{a smile and a}} blush--"there are several things which I want to do; but I <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> and my tongue till I have your approval." ...|$|E
5000|$|Oh Lord, if {{you hear}} me, please <b>hold</b> to <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> oh please understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{we shall}} be set up like two brazen images in a box for all the first-nighters to stare at and the society reporters to describe.
