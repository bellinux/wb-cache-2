40|$|Bob Siemann came to SLAC from Cornell in 1991. With {{the support}} from Burton Richter, then Director of SLAC, {{he took on}} a {{leadership}} role to formulate an academic program in accelerator physics at SLAC {{and the development of}} its accelerator faculty. Throughout his career he championed accelerator physics as an independent academic discipline, a vision that he fought so hard for and never retreated from. He convinced Stanford University and SLAC to create a line of tenured accelerator physics faculty and over the years he also regularly taught classes at Stanford and the U. S. Particle Accelerator School. After the shutdown of the SSC Laboratory, I returned to SLAC in 1993 to join the accelerator faculty he was forming. He had always visualized a need to have a professional academic journal for the accelerator field, and played a pivotal role in creating the journal Physical Review Special Topics - Accelerators and Beams, now the community standard for accelerator physics after nine years of his editorship. Today, Bob's legacy of accelerator physics as an independent academic discipline continues at SLAC {{as well as in the}} community, from which we all benefit. Bob was a great experimentalist. He specialized in experimental techniques and instrumentation, but what he wanted to learn is physics. If he had to learn theory - heaven forbid - to reach that goal, he would not hesitate one second to do so. In fact, he had written several theoretical papers as results of these efforts. Now this is what I call a true experimentalist! Ultimately, however, I think it was experimental instruments that he loved most. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> when he talked about his instruments. Prompted by a question, he would proceed to a nearby blackboard, with a satisfying grin, and draw his experimental device in a careful thinking manner, then describe his experiment and educate the questioner with some insightful physics. These moments were most enjoyable, to him and the questioner alike. When I think of Bob today, it is these moments that first come to mind, and it is these moments I will miss the most. I should like to mention another curious thing about Bob, namely he had a special talent of finding persuasive arguments that went his way. It was difficult to argue with Bob because it was so difficult to win. Generally quiet otherwise, he was too good and too methodical a debater. I had never seen him losing a debate on a policy issue or in a committee setting. However, when it comes to physics, his soft spot, he occasionally let go some weakness. When so doing, he would lose the debate, but his grin revealed that the loss was more than compensated by the physics he gained together with his debater. It is hard to believe that the office around the corner is now empty. The dear colleague we have come to know, to talk to, and to seek advice from, together with the feet-on-the-desk posture and the familiar grin, are no longer there. I wonder, who will now occupy that office next? And who will continue to carry on Bob Siemann's legacy? Many of us are waiting...|$|E

Marketing in Argentina was focused, much {{like in the}} U.K, around healthy lifestyles. [...] "Parents" [...] is a humorous commercial featuring a young married couple receiving news about their first pregnancy. The commercial shows the parents going through common hardships of young parenthood, such as getting little sleep, having a toddler make a mess in the house, etc. Toward {{the end of the}} commercial, the father closes <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and takes a long drink from a Coca-Cola Life bottle.

60|$|Sinister beauty! Dorn soon {{lost sight}} of that. There came a gnawing at his vitals. The far scene of action could not hold his gaze. That dark, uneven, hummocky break in the earth, which was a goodly number of rods distant, yet now seemed close, drew a startling attention. Dorn felt <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and pop. Spots and dots, shiny, illusive, bobbed along that break, behind the mounds, beyond the farther banks. A yell as from one lusty throat ran {{along the line of}} which Dorn's squad held the center. Dorn's sight had a {{piercing}} intensity. All was hard under his grip--his rifle, the boards and bags against which he leaned. Corporal Owens rose beside him, bareheaded, to call low and fiercely to his men.|$|R
50|$|Eddie gets {{involved}} with a struggling bar band, and his passion for music—along with his desperate anger—resurface. He decides to confront Eddie's talents once and for all. Eddie ("Joe West") challenges the bar band's talent, accepts an invitation to play and quickly dazzles the audience and the band's members. Eddie abruptly leaves the stage, disturbed by memories of Wendall Newton while Hilton plays a brief sax solo. Guitarist Rick Diesel pursues Eddie and badgers him about joining the band. Eddie finally begins to play again and the two circulate through Montreal's music scene, hand-picking musicians for a new band, Rock Solid. One of the recruits, saxophone player Hilton Overstreet, remarks at his audition that you can always identify a guitarist {{by the way he}} plays. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> when he hears Eddie on guitar, but he says nothing about his suspicions.|$|R
5000|$|Peter arrives safely at the {{monorail}} with Walter and Olivia, {{without telling}} them how he escaped. Walter worries {{that he sees}} Cecil's death as an acceptable loss, an attitude that his former self used to have and worries that he is reverting to this colder personality, as a side-effect of having the previously removed portions of his brain restored (as occurred in [...] "Letters of Transit"). Peter gently reassures him {{that he will not}} let that happen, as he holds Walter's hands between his. Olivia, seated further down the aisle, looks at them and smiles tenderly; Peter gives a slight smile then returns his attention to Walter. A few seconds later, he looks back up down the aisle and sees the world the way the Observers see it, machine-like and devoid of most colors. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> in surprise as the episode ends.|$|R
5000|$|Historians Caro and Dallek {{consider}} Lyndon Johnson {{the most}} effective Senate majority leader in history. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was [...] "the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known", discovering exactly where every Senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses and {{what it took to}} get his vote. Robert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes. Central to Johnson's control was [...] "The Treatment", described by two journalists: The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson's offices, in the Senate cloakroom, {{on the floor of the}} Senate itself—wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach.Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint, and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking, and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from <b>his</b> target, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> and narrowing, <b>his</b> eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mimicry, humor, and the genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless.|$|R
60|$|Children had {{stared at}} her like that before now, {{and for the first}} time in her life she asked herself what the look might mean. She had never really been fond of them: she had never, indeed, been brought much in contact with them. But now, without warning, a sudden fierce yearning took {{possession}} of her: surprised and almost frightened, she stopped irresistibly and looked back at the thin little figure crouched beside the water, to discover that <b>his</b> <b>widened</b> <b>eyes</b> were still upon her. Her own lingered on him shyly, and thus for a moment she hung in doubt whether to flee or stay, her heart throbbing as though she were on the brink of some unknown and momentous adventure. She took a timid step.|$|R

Subtly flattering her by including her among the very few who could understand his ideals, he seemed to draw her apart to his side--appealing to her for support against the coarse and foolish hosts represented by the Mosses, while Marshall Haney sat in a kind of stupor, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> alone speaking, as if to ask: [...] "What the divil is the little man with the cough so hot about?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Flagg’s {{character}} has its detractors. In his essay [...] "The Glass-Eyed Dragon", author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon, {{saying that he}} is one of the least-believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible. According to de Camp, absolute evil is hard to envision; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world, Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos. De Camp notes that Flagg fails to see that there is no advantage to <b>his</b> actions. Walter's <b>eyes</b> <b>widen,</b> and for a moment he looks deeply hurt. This may be absurd, but Callahan is looking into the man's deep eyes and feels sure that the emotion is nonetheless genuine. And the surety robs him of any last hope that all this might be a dream, or a final brilliant interval before true death. In dreams—his, at least—the bad guys, the scary guys, never have complex emotions. Stephen King, Wolves of the Calla Flagg's embodiment of evil is not the only characteristic seen by critics. Author Joseph Reino commented that the character's presence in The Stand was [...] "Stephen King's version of a pestilential Big Brother". Tony Magistrale revisits the character in a second book, this time comparing him to Norman Mailer. Here, Magistrale states that in The Stand Flagg gives the reader an [...] "illustration of King’s jaundiced perspective of modern America” as he presents the consequences of technology-worship and the sacrifice of [...] "moral integrity to the quest for synthetic productivity".|$|R
