40|$|Simulated syngas {{produced}} from biomass gasification was evaluated in a compression ignition (CI) engine under a <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> mode. Syngas is an economical solution with a carbon-neutral {{system that could}} replace petroleum diesel fuel. Syngas can be introduced into CI engines through a <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> process. However, syngas <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> combustion is very complicated because it consists of several combustion phases. In addition, CI engines operating under the syngas <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> mode suffer from low performance. Therefore, {{this study examined the}} performance of syngas <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> in a CI engine with blended biodiesel as pilot fuel. Two types of simulated syngas, namely typical syngas and high hydrogen syngas, were considered. The simulated high hydrogen syngas was assumed to be the product of biomass gasification with introduction of a carbon dioxide adsorption. The effect of carbon dioxide removal from syngas on the performance of syngas <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> in a CI engine at constant engine speed, half load, and different pilot fuel substitution rates was investigated. The combustion characteristics showed a maximum pilot fuel substitution of up to 47 % with simulated syngas. Better engine performance was achieved with the simulated typical syngas in terms of brake specific energy consumption and brake thermal efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study {{carried out to}} {{investigate}} the feasibility of utilizing gaseous fuels as an alternative engine fuel without much modification of a direct injection type diesel engine. Tests were conducted on a two-cylinder MAN DO 22 M direct diesel engine with various proportions of propane, using the liquid fuel, which is injected through the conventional diesel injection equipment, as ignition source. During <b>dual</b> <b>fueling,</b> up to 90 % of the diesel fuel energy input was replaced with propane gas while the engine thermal conversion efficiency was at higher levels to those obtained straight diesel fueling. However, at full load the thermal efficiency obtained for <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> was slightly lower or similar to that for pure diesel operation. At constant speed the maximum engine power output was increased about 20 % by <b>dual</b> <b>fueling.</b> The CO concentrations were considerably higher at all loads using <b>dual</b> <b>fuels,</b> but for higher loads and 30 % of propane a reduction of 70 % on the CO emissions were observed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance and}} emissions contours of a hydrogen <b>dual</b> <b>fueled</b> compression ignition (CI) engine with two pilot fuels (diesel and rapeseed methyl ester), and compares the performance and emissions iso-contours of diesel and rapeseed methyl ester (RME) single fueling with diesel and RME piloted hydrogen <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> throughout the engines operating speed and power range. The collected data {{have been used to}} produce iso-contours of thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, specific oxides of nitrogen (NOX), specific hydrocarbons (HC) and specific carbon dioxide (CO 2) on a power-speed plane. The performance and emission maps are experimentally investigated, compared, and critically discussed. Apart from medium loads at lower and medium speeds with diesel piloted hydrogen combustion, <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> produced lower thermal efficiency everywhere across the map. For diesel and RME single fueling the maximum specific NOX emissions are centered at the mid speed, mid power region. Hydrogen <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> produced higher specific NOX with both pilot fuels as compared to their respective single fueling operations. The range, location and trends of specific NOX varied significantly when compared to single fueling cases.

25|$|Urea {{is used in}} SNCR and SCR {{reactions}} to reduce the NOx pollutants in exhaust gases from combustion from Diesel, <b>dual</b> <b>fuel,</b> and lean-burn natural gas engines. The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the hydrolysis of the urea reacts with the nitrogen oxide emissions and is converted into nitrogen and water within the catalytic converter. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF, also known as AdBlue), a mixture of urea and water.|$|E
25|$|Several {{members of}} the United States Congress have called for {{mandatory}} production of flexible fuel vehicles. Also the E85 and Biodiesel Access Act proposed to modify current IRS limits on the tax credit which today only allows for the amount a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> dispenser exceeds {{the cost of a}} conventional dispenser. The E85 and Biodiesel Access Act would increase the credit from 30 {{percent of the cost of}} clean fueling property to 50 percent and increase the maximum credit to $100,000. This law would also extend the existing credit which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2009.|$|E
40|$|When {{natural gas}} is port/manifold {{injected}} into a compression ignition engine, the mixture of air and the {{natural gas is}} compressed during the compression stroke of the engine. Due to {{the difference in the}} values of specific heat capacity ratio between air and natural gas, the temperature and pressure at the time of pilot fuel injection are different when compared to a case where only air is compressed. Also, the presence of natural gas affects the peak in-cylinder (adiabatic flame) temperature. This significantly affects the performance as well as emissions characteristics of natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> in CI engine. Natural gas has been extensively tested in a single cylinder compression ignition engine to obtain performance and emissions maps. Two pilot fuels, diesel and RME, have been used to pilot natural gas combustion. The performance of the two liquid fuels used as pilots has also been assessed and compared. Tests were conducted at 48 different operating conditions (six different speeds and eight different power output conditions for each speed) for single fueling cases. Both the diesel and RME based single fueling cases were used as baselines to compare the natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> where data was collected at 36 operating conditions (six different speeds and six different power output conditions for each speed). Performance and emissions characteristics were mapped on speed vs brake power plots. The thermal efficiency values of the natural gas <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> were lower when compared to the respective pilot fuel based single fueling apart from the highest powers. The effect of engine speed on volumetric efficiency in case of the natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> was significantly different from what was observed with the single fueling. Contours of specific NOX for diesel and RME based single fueling differ significantly when these fuels were used to pilot natural gas combustion. For both of the single fueling cases, maximum specific NOX were centered at the intersection of medium speeds and medium powers and they decrease in all directions from this region of maximum values. On the other hand, an opposite trend was observed with <b>dual</b> <b>fueling</b> cases where minimum specific NOX were observed {{at the center of the}} map and they increase in all direction from this region of minimum NOX. RME piloted specific NOX at the highest speeds were the only exception to this trend. Higher specific HC and lower specific CO 2 emissions were observed in case of natural gas based <b>dual</b> <b>fueling.</b> The emissions were measured in g/MJ of engine power...|$|R

25|$|From June 2002 a factory-approved <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> petrol-liquid {{petroleum}} gas conversion {{was available in}} the UK on 1.8 and 2.5 litre models. The LPG conversion was an after-market undertaking approved by MG Rover. Developed by EcoGas Systems Ltd and Landi Renzo S.R.L. in conjunction with MG Rover Powertrain Limited, the conversion was ordered from Rover dealerships, the cars retaining the three-year factory warranty. The retail price of the conversion was £2,195, but {{in an effort to}} encourage LPG use for transport for ecological reasons the UK Government offered a Powershift Rebate of some 60% of the conversion cost. When running on LPG the Rover 75 suffers only a slight reduction in performance compared to running on petrol; LPG fuel consumption is also slightly higher than when running on petrol but this is more than offset by the greatly reduced cost of the fuel.|$|E
25|$|Ford has {{expanded}} its lineup of flexible-fuel vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, and dual-fuel vehicles. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate {{on a range of}} fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative fuel vehicles operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. <b>Dual</b> <b>fuel</b> vehicles generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. Vehicles using these fueling alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and flexible fuel vehicles – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.|$|E

In {{order to}} burning LPG and {{gasoline}} and <b>dual</b> <b>fueled</b> (LPG and gasoline) {{in the same}} engine, a new multi-function engine was refitted and designed based on 188 F gasoline, mutative effects on the power and emission performance when burning those three kind fuel were investigated by the engine operated with the US EPA Phase- II. Three schemes for the carburetor throat were designed. Balanced of the power and economy performance, when {{the diameter of the}} carburetor throat is 23 mm, the performance was the best. By carrying engine performance test and the combustion process analysis, the results showed that: when the throttle was full opened, the power of burning only gasoline was 7. 97 kW, 0. 5 kW and 0. 28 kW higher than burning LPG and dual –fuel. Burning gasoline pressure curve with the crank Angle siege area is the largest. As the emission test shows, when separately burning LPG and gasoline and <b>dual</b> <b>fueled,</b> the tendency of the excess air coefficient and the emission characteristics with the load change are same.

40|$|The current {{technology}} within {{combustion engines}} {{have the possibility}} of handling the more stringent legislative demands on combustion engines. However the required solutions are getting more expensive and technically challenging. One possible way towards a more simple exhaust aftertreatment system {{is the use of}} the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine cycle. The main advantage of the HCCI engine is its low output of NOx exhaust emissions. Because of its indirect combustion initiation the main disadvantage is that it requires closed loop control of its combustion process. Two methods for engine timing control were used, <b>dual</b> <b>fuels</b> or variable valve actuation(VVA). With <b>dual</b> <b>fuels</b> the timing change was achieved by changing the autoignition properties of the homogeneous charge and with VVA, timing control was achieved by changing the effective compression ratio. This thesis focuses on the control of the HCCI engine. For the purpose of studying control of the HCCI engine, special engine control software was developed. This software aimed towards engine cycle-to-cycle control and actuation. Another aid in the development was the use of Matlab/Simulink for the design of powerful control algorithms. Successful system identification control design has been shown. Different control strategies were tested, amongst the most successful was the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC), which is a control strategy that can take care of the nonlinear behavior of the dynamic engine system and its actuators. It was concluded that low order models were sufficient for capturing the important HCCI engine dynamics. The use of ion current for detection and control of the HCCI combustion was also shown. A method for obtaining combustion timing from the ion current was defined and investigated. Closed-loop control using ion currents on an HCCI engine was demonstrated...|$|R
