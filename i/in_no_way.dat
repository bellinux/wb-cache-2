Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E

5|$|An Australian naval vessel, HMAS Swan, {{under the}} command of Commander Arthur Bond (RN), {{conducted}} a reconnaissance and intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea and territory of the Don Cossacks in December 1918, in conjunction with the French destroyer Bisson. The mission, conducted on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian forces under General Denikin, was detailed to report to the true state of the Cossack forces and was carefully circumscribed by the British Foreign Office. Indeed, although the Cossacks fÃªted Commander Bond as a comrade-in-arms he had to explain to them that they were purely on an information gathering mission with the Australian vessel <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> intended to render military or naval aid to the Cossacks. After inspecting anti-Bolshevik forces in the area, as well as numerous military facilities and factories, Swan subsequently carried out anti-Bolshevik guard duties in Sevastopol, with the ship's guns helped protect the railway station {{at the head of the}} Inkerman valley. These duties were completed without incident and Swan subsequently sailed for Plymouth on 3 January 1919.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> {{be construed as}} a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders a very quick verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E

5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is in the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E

After Steiger's performance in The Pawnbroker in 1964, in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City, he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965). In the Heat of the Night (1967) won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger, who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African-American officer (Poitier) as they search for a killer. The following year, he played a serial killer of many guises <b>in</b> <b>No</b> <b>Way</b> to Treat a Lady.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver is <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must {{also be able to}} sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some MahÄyÄna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second â 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
