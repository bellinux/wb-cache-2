25|$|By 1938, {{the only}} use the Germans {{had for the}} {{agreement}} was to threaten to renounce {{it as a way}} of pressuring London to accept Continental Europe as Germany's rightful sphere of influence. At a meeting on 16 April 1938 between Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, and Hermann Göring, the latter stated it had never been valued in England, and he bitterly regretted that Herr Hitler had ever consented to it at the time without getting anything in exchange. It had been a mistake, but Germany was nevertheless not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in a state of inferiority in this respect vis-à-vis a hostile Britain, and would build up to a 100 per cent. basis.|$|E

[...] In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be [...] "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history." [...] Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her gay fans. [...] "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with Out magazine, [...] "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay.

500|$|Writing for The A.V.

In this wildly expensive failure, it’s possible to see so many of NBC's flaws, all in the same package." [...] However, she was pleased the show's production for featuring contestants who were [...] "friendly" [...] and [...] "relatable," [...] rather than [...] "chosen for their reprehensibility." [...] Digital Spys Catriona Wightman doubted the series would be able to retain viewership: [...] "Even while I sort of enjoyed the first episode despite myself, I can't imagine becoming obsessed with it to that extent - is there really enough there to sustain that kind of interest?" ...|$|E

Forbes, meanwhile, received a report that most of Lobengula's force, commanded by inDuna Mjaan, had separated from the king and was moving to attack the laager the same night (this was actually an exaggeration; only about 300 riflemen had split from the main Matabele force, though they were indeed south of the river, undetected by Forbes). Visibility was poor by now, and rain periodically fell. The laager received no word from Wilson until about 21:00, when Sergeant-Major Judge and Corporal Ebbage arrived from across the river to tell Forbes that Wilson had found Lobengula's tracks, and followed him for [...] Wilson regarded the chances of taking the king alive as so good that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> {{north of the}} river overnight.

500|$|Home's {{attention}} was mainly {{concentrated on the}} Cold War, where his forcefully expressed anti-communist beliefs were tempered by a pragmatic {{approach to dealing with}} the Soviet Union. His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall was erected to stop East Germans escaping to West Germany via West Berlin. Home wrote to his American counterpart, Dean Rusk, [...] "The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin has never been a casus belli for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin {{and that is what we}} must maintain." [...] The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade President de Gaulle of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed [...] "all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth". An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory.|$|E

Further releases have since been made. This includes the DVD releases of Live! Tonight! Sold Out!! in 2006, and the full, uncut version of MTV Unplugged in New York in 2007. The band's performance at the 1992 Reading Festival was released on both CD and DVD as Live at Reading in November 2009.

500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In candid {{remarks to}} high-value donors at a {{secretly}} recorded May 2012 private fundraiser, Romney {{said of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [...] "I look [...] at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political [...] purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and [...] these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.' And so what you do [...] is you say, 'You move things along the best way you can.' You hope for some degree [...] of stability, but you recognize that this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> an unsolved [...] problem. We live with that in China and Taiwan.

The video was a success and received a lot of air time play on music channels and was even played internationally on the Dubai based sports channel Ten Sports. Due to the success of the single, [...] "Izhar" [...] was nominated for the [...] "Best Rock Song" [...] and [...] "Best Alternative Track" [...] award at the Indus Music Awards 2003. After the release of [...] "Izhar", Khalid Khan also left the band due to playing bass for two bands at one time, Mizraab and Aaroh. Aaroh had already broken into the mainstream and Mizraab was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> underground much longer. Realizing that it was difficult for him to continue with both these demanding acts, the band decided that Khalid should limit himself to one of these. So, Khalid ended up parting ways with the band and became a full-time band member of Aaroh. Faraz Arshad, an ex-student of Faraz Awar, replaced Khalid Khan on bass guitars. And following the success of Faraz Anwar's solo album, his side-project, Dusk went on to release their second studio album Jahilia by a Czech label known as Epidemie Records later that year.|$|E
