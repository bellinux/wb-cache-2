40|$|The {{gelatinisation}} {{process of}} waxy starch was studied using both {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC) It was revealed that {{the results from the}} two techniques, especially the onset gelatinisation temperature, were slightly different, which {{may be due to the}} MTDSC principle and the mechanism of starch gelatinisation Thus, it is suggested to avoid using MTDSC alone in the characterisation of starch thermal transitions especially in a quantitative way. However, MTDSC has the advantage in understanding the gelatinisation mechanism since it can separate the capacity change (reversible thermal event) from kinetic components (irreversible event) The stepwise change on reversible heat flow measured by MTDSC during gelatinisation was considered due to the phase transition of highly constrained starch polymer chains in granular packing. On the other hand, the glass transition of <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (also thermoplastic starch) could not necessarily be detected by conventional DSC or MTDSC. However, by using a high-speed DSC method, the extremely weak glass transition of the <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> with low moisture content could be enlarged and detected, which confirms the existence of glass transition of the <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> with low moisture content This knowledge is helpful in the processing of starch-based foods and polymeric material...|$|E

40|$|Background:Starch is a {{main source}} of glucose and energy in the human diet. The {{extent to which it}} is digested in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{plays a major role in}} variations in postprandial blood glucose levels. Interactions with other biopolymers, such as dairy proteins, during processing can influence both the duration and extent of this postprandial surge. Objective:To evaluate the effect of the addition of bovine &#x 03 B 1;- or &#x 03 B 2;-casein to waxy maize starch on changes in postprandial blood glucose, insulin, and incretin hormones [glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) ] in 30 kg pigs used as an animal model for humans. Design:Gelatinised <b>starch,</b> Results:starch <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 1;-casein, and <b>starch</b> <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 2;-casein were orally administered to trained pigs (n = 8) at a level of 60 g of available carbohydrate. Pre- and postprandial glucose measurements were taken every 15 min for the first hour and every 30 min thereafter up to 180 min. Insulin, GIP, and GLP- 1 levels were measured in plasma samples up to 90 min postprandial. <b>Starch</b> <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 1;-casein had a significantly (p &# 60; 0. 05) lower peak viscosity on pasting and resulted in significantly lower glucose release at 15, 30, and 90 min postprandial compared to <b>starch</b> <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 2;-casein. During the first 45 -min postprandial, the area under the glucose curve (AUC) for <b>starch</b> <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 1;-casein was significantly (p &# 60; 0. 05) lower than that for <b>starch</b> <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 2;-casein. There was also a significant (p &# 60; 0. 05) difference at T 30 in GIP levels in response to the control compared to <b>starch</b> <b>gelatinised</b> with &#x 03 B 1;- or &#x 03 B 2;-casein. Significant (p &# 60; 0. 05) increases in several free amino acid concentrations were observed on ingestion of either &#x 03 B 1;- or &#x 03 B 2;-casein <b>gelatinised</b> with <b>starch</b> at 30 and 90 min postprandial compared to starch alone.

40|$|Cooking makes foods more {{palatable}} and digestible, less toxic and suitable for longer-term storage. Starch granules usually undergo gelatinisation during cooking, {{resulting in the}} loss of native structure and morphology. Once fully <b>gelatinised,</b> <b>starch</b> is very difficult to recognise microscopically and to classify taxonomically, impeding identification of cooked starch in archaeological food residues. Gelatinisation involves a complex interplay between temperature, moisture content and the presence of solutes, lipids and proteins, as well as species-specific starch physicochemical properties. Understanding the influence of these factors, particularly moisture, on the degree and extent of starch conversion during heat treatment enables predictive models of native starch survival in archaeological samples based on cooking method and food type.

30|$|It {{was thought}} that glucose and {{hydrolysed}} sago starch (HSS) could promote {{the growth of the}} cells better than raw sago starch (RSS) and gelatinized sago starch (GSS). However, the trends obtained in all cases were similar, although it was observed that in the log phase the uptake of the GSS and RSS forms was slightly faster than that of the glucose and HSS. Similar observation was reported by Shibata et al. ([2007]). They found that the performance of E. faecium using RSS was better than with corn, potato and wheat starches. It could be desirable to have RSS as the most appropriate form of starch to be used as direct substrate for the fermentation process; however, it is problematic to manage the RSS slurry at high concentration. Although Shibata et al. ([2007]) did not reported how they prepared the raw sago starch, and if they sterilized the sago slurry, then; the form of starch used perhaps was the <b>gelatinised</b> sago <b>starch.</b> The <b>gelatinised</b> sago <b>starch</b> can be used as substrate but a very low concentration because when the concentration of starch is increased the viscosity of the media is very high. The viscosity of the slurry increases proportionally with the concentration of the starch. In general, when the starch concentration increased, sedimentation occurred due to saturation or insolubility. This situation was visualized by[Zhang and Cheryan (1994]); therefore, these researchers used liquefied starch to avoid these problems and they improved the process by using the amylolytic Lactobacillus amylovorus strain. Shibata et al. used E. faecium No. 78 cultivated in RSS at a concentration no higher than 20 g/l, which is very low for an industrial application. Therefore, it could be reasoned that using batch and its extension RBF might be advantageous to produce higher LA concentration at a similar production rate.|$|R

The highest solvent concentration in outflow (9. 10 g/L) was obtained at pH 4. 5 and dilution rate of 0. 05 h^ 1, which corresponds to overall productivity of 0. 46 g/L. h. However, the highest total solvent productivity (0. 85 g/L. h) was obtained at dilution rate of 0. 11 h- 1 and pH 4. 5, which gave a total solvent yield of 0. 29 g solvent/g sago starch.

40|$|The {{effects of}} octenylsuccinic {{anhydride}} (OSA) modification of waxy {{maize and sorghum}} starches on subsequent β-amylolysis are examined. Hydrolysis with β-amylase is a method by which OSA starches may be structurally modified for industrial purposes. The hydrolysis of both granular and gelatinised forms of both starches follows first-order kinetics regardless of the OSA used {{as a percent of}} starch mass (0 - 24 %). The highest hydrolysis rate coefficients for granular starches are at modification with 6 % OSA/starch. The largest molecular sizes of β-amylase hydrolysed OSA-modified gelatinised starches are found at modification with 24 % OSA/starch. The results suggest that octenylsuccinyl groups have an action-blocking effect on β-amylolysis of <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch,</b> but the effect of semi-crystalline granular structure is more pronounced than that of OSA modification. Hence β-amylolysis can be used under appropriate conditions to modify the structure of gelatinised OSA-modified starches...|$|E
40|$|Retrograded starch {{is known}} to be {{resistant}} to digestion. We used enzyme kinetic experiments to examine how retrogradation of starch affects amylolysis catalysed by porcine pancreatic amylase. Parallel studies employing differential scanning calorimetry, infra red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy were performed to monitor changes in supramolecular structure of <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> as it becomes retrograded. The total digestible starch and the catalytic efficiency of amylase were both decreased with increasing evidence of retrogradation. A purified sample of retrograded high amylose starch inhibited amylase directly. These new findings demonstrate that amylase binds to retrograded starch. Therefore consumption of retrograded starch may not only be beneficial to health through depletion of total digestible starch, and therefore the metabolisable energy, but may also slow the rate of intestinal digestion through direct inhibition of α-amylase. Such physiological effects have important implications for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|Autogenerative high {{pressure}} digestion (AHPD) provides an integrated biogas upgrading technology, {{capable of producing}} biogas with a CH 4 content exceeding 95 % at pressures up to 90 bar. Hydrolysis is generally regarded as the rate-limiting step in the anaerobic digestion of complex organic matter, governing the volatile fatty acid (VFA) production rate for subsequent conversion to methane. Starch hydrolysis rates in AHPD systems were studied and the potential risk for VFA accumulation was assessed. Under the anticipated practical moderate pressure conditions at 30 °C, experimental CH 4 -content of the biogas improved from 49 to 73 ± 2 % at atmospheric and elevated pressure, respectively. Furthermore, no significant effect {{of pressure on the}} hydrolysis was found. Like under atmospheric pressure, gelatinisation was the rate-limiting step for particulate starch (0. 05 d- 1) and saccharification for <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (0. 1 d- 1).

40|$|Ageing of gelatinised {{and partly}} <b>gelatinised</b> potato <b>starch</b> and wheat starch were {{investigated}} {{in the presence}} of plasticisers with increasing size and number of OH groups (ethylene glycol, glycerol, threitol, xylitol, glucose, and for potato starch also maltose). The influences of these plasticisers and of granular remnants (ghosts) on recrystallisation were determined by using X-ray diffraction. Recrystallisation of potato starch samples {{in the presence of}} plasticisers resulted in crystallinity indices of 0. 5. The largest reduction in potato starch recrystallisation is found for threitol (4 OH) and xylitol (5 OH). In the plasticiser range examined, the crystallisation inducing effect of granular potato starch remnants is reduced better when the plasticiser contains more OH groups. Wheat starch recrystallises to a lesser extent than potato starch, resulting in crystallinity indices of 0. 4. The results for wheat starch do not show clear trends for the influences of plasticiser size and of ghosts. The difference in behaviour of the two starches is probably caused by wheat starch having shorter amylopectin chains. Resulting from these shorter amylopectin chains, the remaining structure in wheat starch ghosts may resemble A-type crystallinity, making it more difficult to form B-type crystals. Alternatively, the trends as found for potato starch may occur, but are less manifest for wheat starch, due to the lower total extent of recrystallisation. Solid state CP/MAS NMR spectra of the wheat starch samples containing ethylene glycol were obtained, in order to compare completely and partly gelatinised systems. The spectra were identical, confirming that the ghost structures do not influence wheat starch recrystallisation. Apparently, wheat starch ghosts do not act as nuclei for crystallisation. Similarly, the influence of various malto-oligosaccharides in combination with granular remnants (ghosts) was investigated on wheat <b>starch</b> ageing. <b>Gelatinised</b> and partly <b>gelatinised</b> wheat <b>starch</b> were plasticised with maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose or maltohexaose. This resulted in crystallinity indices of 0. 2, with the largest reduction in recrystallisation for maltotriose and maltotetraose. No trend was found for the influence of ghosts. The presence of ghosts did not influence the 13 C solid state HP/DEC NMR spectra. Less recrystallisation took place than with the previously mentioned smaller plasticisers that resulted in crystallinity indices of 0. 4. The finding that maltose was able to reduce retrogradation better than glucose could be of practical importance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gelatinised</b> wheat <b>starch,</b> {{freeze dried}} and equilibrated at {{different}} RH, was aged at different temperatures and for different times. The Tool–Narayanaswamy–Moynihan (TNM) model {{was used to}} describe the ageing for all samples under all conditions. Three TNM parameters: x, Dh⁄ and A were determined experimentally using, respectively, the peak shift method (x) and the dependency of T 0 f (the limiting value of Tf) on the cooling rate (Dh⁄ and A). The non-linearity parameter x and the non exponential parameter b were also estimated by optimising a fit of the experimental normalised specific heat at different ageing times and temperatures to curves generated using the TNM model. The TNM model successfully described the normalised experimental data. It was found that the intermolecular forces were strong and the relaxation times depended more strongly on the glass structure than the glass temperature. The hydration level of the starch had a direct impact of the breadth of the relaxation time distribution. A dependency of the non-linearity parameter x on ageing temperature (peak shift method) was observed. This suggests that physical ageing is more complex than is described by TNM formalism...|$|R

The DRS and TSDC results for hydrogels and hydrated powders with starch/modified fumed silica show that the beta- and gamma-relaxations of starch are strongly affected by water and functionalised silica nanoparticles which slow down both low- and high-frequency and low- and high-temperature relaxations.

Starch was extracted from cassava tubers and soy-tapioca was produced by incorporation of full-fat soy flour into moist starch at four levels of substitution; 15 : 85, 25 : 75, 50 : 50 before granulation and gelatinization. Functional properties of soy-tapioca samples: water absorption, bulk density, swelling capacity, oil absorption capacity, dispersibility, gelation capacity, syneresis, transmittance and pasting characteristics were determined and compared with that of tapioca. Results show that functional properties of soy-tapioca differ from each other as the ratio of soy substitution increases. Gelation, oil absorption, dispersibility, swelling, viscosity and transmittance, decreased as soy-substitution increased while water absorption capacity increased. Functional properties of soy-tapioca (15 : 85) suggest that it can compare favourably with that of tapioca. Enrichment of tapioca with soy flour to enhance its nutritional value is feasible however; increase in the level of soy substitution beyond 15 % will alter the functional properties and affect the gelatinous nature of the tapioca meal.

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} {{structure}} {{formation of a}} series of food gels was studied using a patented U-tube rheometer of novel design. The instrument has been especially designed and developed to determine the shear moduli of very weak and syneresing gels, particle contained gels and foams. The rheometer is fully automatic and operates in both static and oscillating modes. The performance of the instrument was assessed by monitoring the development of the shear modulus in relation to time of <b>gelatinised</b> maize <b>starch</b> aqueous dispersions ranging in starch concentration from 6 % to 12 % (dry basis), gelatine gels with gelatine concentrations ranging from 2 % to 12 %(dry basis) as well as of native set yogurt and kefir gels. An important asset of the design is that it allows measurements to be performed on liquids as thin as water yet having the maximum strain within the limit of linear viscoelasticity. This allows a gel formation process to be monitored right from the start when the sample is still in the state of a liquid up to the point of the formation of a true gel.

40|$|The enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} of starch is usually {{carried out with}} 30 ¿ 35 w/w% starch in water. Higher substrate concentrations (50 ¿ 70 w/w%) were reached by using a twin-screw extruder for gelatinisation and for mixing enzyme with <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> prior to {{enzymatic hydrolysis}} in a batch reactor. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine which parameters are important for gelatinisation of wheat starch and to investigate the effects of different extrusion conditions on the enzymatic hydrolysis. After extrusion, the degree of gelatinisation was measured. During hydrolysis, the carbohydrate composition, the dextrose equivalent (DE) and the alpha-amylase activity were measured. Gelatinisation measurements showed that mechanical forces lowered the temperature required for complete gelatinisation. During hydrolysis experiments, high DEs were observed even if starch was not completely gelatinised during extrusion. Due to high substrate concentrations, the residual alpha-amylase activity remained high throughout enzymatic hydrolysis, although high temperatures were used. Increased substrate concentrations did not affect the carbohydrate composition of the product. Furthermore, the time required for the batch hydrolysis step could be varied by choosing a different enzyme-to-substrate ratio. This article provides a basis for detailed optimisation of this process to develop an industrial-scale process at high substrate concentrations...|$|E
40|$|A widely adopted {{procedure}} to characterise the degradation in the rumen and its dynamics is the in situ incubation technique that assumes the washable fraction of feeds (W) {{to be equal}} to the soluble (S) fraction and that both are rapidly and completely degraded {{which may not be}} the case. Because W fraction is washed out of nylon bags, their behaviour cannot directly be measured. This thesis, therefore, aimed to characterise the degradative behaviour of some important unprocessed and processed concentrate (barley, maize, milo, peas, lupins and faba beans) ingredients and their fractions, using a methodology that fractionates feed samples into its inherent constituents (non-washable, NWF; insoluble washable, ISWF and soluble washable fraction, SWF) in combination with an in vitro gas production technique. The results show that the size of the W fraction obtained in nylon bag studies differs from that of the soluble fraction. Except in lupins, ISWF of the concentrate ingredients was very rich in starch. SWF was relatively rich in ash, crude protein, soluble sugars, and a residual fraction (chemically not determined) but contained only a negligible quantity of starch. The degradative behaviour of this difference (ISWF), measured with in vitro gas production, is very {{similar to that of the}} non-washable fraction. The nature of the VFA profile resulting from the fermentation of the different fractions differs between fractions and changes with time of fermentation. Except in lupins, expander processing decreases the contribution of the truly soluble fraction (SWF) in concentrate ingredients. In maize, milo, peas and faba beans, <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> serves as a binding agent reducing the size of ISWF. However, the pelleting after expander processing disturbs the binding effect of <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> to some extent, and increases the size of ISWF. In all cereal grains, faba beans and lupins, thermo-mechanical processing (expander processing and ensuing pelleting) shows a tendency to increase the fractional rate of substrate degradation and rate of gas production at the early stage of fermentation, thereby shifting the pattern of fermentation towards a more glucogenic fermentation. Moreover, it appears that the expander processing and the ensuing pelleting process provides a certain level of protection to dietary protein as represented by a lowered NH 3 -N production. Our data show that grinding the samples of technological processing changes the particle size distribution in the samples of processed material. As a consequence, the kinetics of gas production change. When monitoring the effects of feed processing by using an in vitro gas production technique, no grinding prior to in vitro incubation should be applied...|$|E

While swelling of wtps occurred in two phases, amfps showed {{a very fast}} swelling and no gel of swollen granules was observed at higher temperatures (> 90 °C). Haps underwent only restricted swelling. SP of cassava starches were {{lower than those of}} potato starches. Wtps leached mainly amylose (AM) during heating at low temperatures. Molecules of higher molecular weight (MW) leached out at higher temperatures. Longer amylopectin (AP) chains [degree of polymerisation (DP) > 18] inhibited swelling while short chains (DP 18) depressed peak viscosity, while short chains (DP < 14) increased peak viscosity for both concentrations. At 8. 0 %, peak viscosity increased with starch granule size. After 1 day of storage of <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> suspensions, wtps and especially amfps showed only limited AP retrogradation. In contrast, the high enthalpies of retrograded AP (¿Hretro) and peak and conclusion temperatures of retrogradation (Tp,retro and Tc,retro) of haps suggested partial cocrystallisation between AM and AP. Chains with DP 18 – 25 seemed to be more liable to AP retrogradation. Wtcs and amfcs did not retrograde at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|The time-course of starch {{digestion}} in twin-screw extruded milled sorghum grain {{was investigated}} using an in-vitro procedure based on glucometry. The sorghum grains were hammer-milled, and extruded at three levels each of moisture and screw speed. Irrespective of the extrusion conditions, extruded and non-extruded milled sorghum grain exhibited monophasic digestograms, and the modified first-order kinetic and Peleg models adequately described the digestograms. Extrusion increased {{the rate of}} digestion by about ten times compared with non-extrudates. Starch gelatinisation varied in the extrudates, and microscopy revealed a mixture of raw, <b>gelatinised</b> and destructured <b>starch</b> and protein components in the extrudates. Starch digestion parameters significantly (p < 0. 05) correlated with extruder response and various functional properties of the extrudates. Extrusion conditions for maximum starch gelatinisation in milled sorghum grain for fastest digestion as an efficient animal feed were interpolated, {{as well as the}} conditions for directly-expanded extrudates with potential for human food, where minimum starch digestion is desired.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of some high-solid mixed dispersions of partially hydrolysed waxy maize starch (HWS), {{in the presence}} of whey protein concentrate (WPC) and urea, was followed by small-amplitude oscillatory measurements in the linear domain, under heating to 80 °C and cooling to 25 °C, at pH 7. 5. The non-gelling HWS sample was obtained by sonication of previously <b>gelatinised</b> waxy maize <b>starch.</b> Steady-shear flow and microstructure were investigated after cooling to 25 °C. Dispersions were prepared at 1 : 1 (m/m) WPC/urea ratio, with increasing HWS concentrations. Typical solid- and liquid-like {{rheological behaviour}}s were observed after quenching the mixtures to low temperature, depending on HWS/WPC ratio. At the lowest HWS/WPC ratio, a thixotropic structure was characterised under steady-shear flow, and visualised by light microscopy at low magnification as a continuous network. With increasing HWS/WPC ratio within a certain range, gelling and non-gelling mixtures resulted in phase-separated structures, which hindered viscous flow. At the highest HWS/WPC ratio, a shear-thinning dispersion was formed, consistent with the liquid-like small deformation properties and the homogeneous image obtained by light microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{the level}} of starch that is not digested {{by the end of}} the small {{intestine}} and therefore enters the colon (‘resistant starch’) is a major opportunity for improving the nutritional profile of foods. One mechanism that has been shown to be successful is entrapment of starch within an intact plant tissue structure. However, {{the level of}} tissue intactness required for resistance to amylase digestion has not been defined. In this study, intact cells were isolated from a range of legumes after thermal treatment at 60 °C (<b>starch</b> not <b>gelatinised)</b> or 95 °C (<b>starch</b> <b>gelatinised)</b> followed by hydrolysis using pancreatic alpha amylase. It was found that intact cells, isolated at either temperature, were impervious to amylase. However, application of mechanical force damaged the cell wall and made starch accessible to digestive enzymes. This shows that the access of enzymes to the entrapped swollen starch is the rate limiting step controlling hydrolysis of starch in cooked legumes. The results suggest that a single cell wall could be sufficient to provide an effective delivery of starch to the large intestine with consequent nutritional benefits, provided that mechanical damage during digestion is avoided...|$|R
40|$|Despite much research, {{bread crumb}} firming during storage and amylase anti-staling {{properties}} are still ill understood. We present a coherent {{view on the}} topic based on literature, experimental data, and food polymer science-related concepts. During bread storage, the <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (amylopectin) network, present in soft, fresh bread, is gradually transformed into an extensive, partially crystalline, permanent amylopectin network, with amylopectin crystallites acting as junction zones. This network increasingly accounts for the bulk theological behaviour of aging bread crumb. Furthermore, as amylopectin retrogradation proceeds, moisture migration within the crumb structure occurs, {{and more and more}} water is immobilised within amylopectin crystallites. The crystalline hydrate water can no longer plasticise the different networks, which {{goes hand in hand with}} increased crumb firmness and decreased crumb resilience, due to a less flexible gluten network. The efficiency of anti-staling amylases can be related to the extent they limit the formation and the strength of the permanent amylopectin network, and the water immobilisation. Conventional alpha-amylases weaken the amylopectin network by cutting the long polymer chains connecting the crystalline regions, but have little effect on amylopectin recrystallisation. In contrast, maltogenic alpha-amylase primarily shortens the amylopectin side chains, thus hindering amylopectin recrystallisation, and the concomitant network formation and water immobilisation.

40|$|In {{the present}} study the effect of iodine on the {{structural}} characteristics (by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray) of films made from kidney bean starch was evaluated. The pasting properties as affected by iodine and glycerol were also evaluated. Kidney bean starch showed C-type (mixture of A- and B-type) crystalline structure, the conversion of starch into films resulted into reduction in intensity of diffractograms. The starch powder FTIR spectra had peaks centered at 1020 and 995 cm- 1 with a higher intensity at 1020 cm- 1, {{which is consistent with}} a partially crystalline material since fully crystalline material show similar intensity peaks centered around 1020 and 1006 cm- 1. Films without iodine showed one main peak centered around 1000 cm- 1 consistent with a disordered state similar to that in <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch.</b> Iodine addition gradually increased the intensity of the bands around 1020 cm- 1 consistent with the formation of more ordered conformation similar to that in the crystalline material. Iodine encourages the formation of helical structures, however, the formation of crystalline material cannot be inferred. The increasing amounts of iodine up to 0. 33 % level progressively increased the peak-, through- and breakdown-viscosity. Iodine beyond 0. 33 % level gradually decreased peak-, trough-, breakdown- and setback-viscosity. Pasting temperature gradually increased with the increase in iodine...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} is a {{world wide}} problem, centred on the lower income population, though not restricted to it. Food supplementation with magnesium is also considered of interest for correcting deficiencies in this oligoelement. High-pressure partially <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> is proposed {{as a vehicle for}} inclusion of these metals in food products. While high-pressure levels (and/or temperature) give rise to total gelatinisation, lower pressures, at temperatures close to ambient, yield partially-gelatinised products, where only a portion of the intramolecular bonds in the amylopectin double helix has been substituted by intermolecular bonds between the unfolded amylopectin and water, as it can be deduced by differential scanning calorimetry, while the resultant granular microstructure is strongly altered (observed by low temperature scanning electron microscopy). Production of this modified starch implies lower energy expense, compared to thermal gelatinisation, and it guarantees higher homogeneity in the final degree of gelatinisation. The effect of moderated high-pressure treatments (400 MPa, 25 °C, 35 min) on potato and corn starches has been studied. The effect of pressure treatment, after alkaline treatment or the addition of another hydrocolloid (guar gum) has also been considered. The observed preferential binding of zinc and magnesium salts to these modified starches (after determination of metal content by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) is favourable to the use of these products as metal carriers.

40|$|Amylopectin fine {{structures}} were studied following limited hydrolysis of <b>gelatinised</b> waxy maize <b>starch</b> by amylases {{with a different}} level of inner chain attack (LICA). This was done by size exclusion chromatography {{as well as by}} debranching the (partially hydrolysed) amylopectin samples and studying the size distributions of the released chains. alpha-Amylases from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Aspergillus oryzae, with a relatively high LICA, drastically altered amylopectin chain length distribution and reduced the amylopectin molecular size (MS) significantly even at a low to moderate degree of hydrolysis (DH). Porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA), with a rather low LICA but a high multiple attack action on amylose, reduced the amylopectin MS much slower. Following hydrolysis by PPA to a DH of 10 % and enzymic debranching of the amylopectin residue, several subpopulations of chains consisting of 2 - 12 glucose units were detected, indicating a multiple attack action on the amylopectin side chains. During the early stages of hydrolysis, the maltogenic Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase (BStA) preferentially hydrolysed the exterior chains of amylopectin. However, during the later phases, BStA also hydrolysed inner chains, presumably with a high multiple attack action. The present results clearly show that different enzymes can be used for (limited) conversion of amylopectin into structures differing in molecular weight and chain length distributions.

40|$|Starches from 3 common wheats and 10 durum wheats were {{isolated}} using a method causing little starch damage and annealing. Durum wheat starches contained 0. 21 - 0. 29 % ash, 0. 44 - 0. 57 % protein, 0. 39 - 0. 54 % lipid, and 26. 2 - 28. 5 % amylose. Wide angle X-ray diffraction measurements revealed A-type diffraction patterns. Durum wheat <b>starches</b> <b>gelatinised</b> over a broad temperature range (12. 5 degrees C) around 55. 5 degrees C (peak temperature), as measured with Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) (starch/water = 1 / 2; heating rate = 4 degrees C/min). Under the experimental conditions, swelling power was typically 11. 3 g/g and amylose leaching during gelatinisation was ca. 17. 2 %. The granule size distributions showed a large heterogeneity within the starches of the durum wheat family. Clear {{differences were found}} in the gelatinisation behaviour of durum and common wheat starches. Earlier swelling of the common wheat starches during gelatinisation and the larger enthalpy of amylose-lipid endothermic transition (ca. 1. 3 mJ/mg) in the DSC for durum wheat starches can be explained in terms of true lipid contents and levels of amylose-lipid inclusion complexes. Other findings, such as the earlier gelatinisation behaviour of durum wheat starches revealed by DSC, cannot be explained in that way. Differences in starch double helix content between the two wheat families were found. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of dietary carbohydrates on metabolism, with special focus on fatty acid bioconversion and flesh lipid composition in two rainbow trout lines divergently selected for muscle lipid content and fed with vegetable oils. These lines were chosen based on previously demonstrated potential differences in LC-PUFA synthesis and carbohydrate utilization. Applying a factorial study design, juvenile trout from the lean (L) and the fat (F) line were fed vegetable oil based diets with or without <b>gelatinised</b> <b>starch</b> (17. 1 %) for 12 weeks. Blood, liver, muscle, intestine and adipose tissue were sampled after the last meal. Feed intake and growth was higher in the L line than the F line, irrespective of the diet. Moderate postprandial hyperglycemia, strong induction of hepatic glucokinase and repressed glucose- 6 -phosphatase transcripts confirmed the metabolic response of both lines to carbohydrate intake. Further at the transcriptional level, dietary carbohydrate {{in the presence of}} n- 3 LC-PUFA deficient vegetable oils enhanced intestinal chylomicron assembly, disturbed hepatic lipid metabolism and importantly elicited a higher response of key desaturase and elongase enzymes in the liver and intestine that endorsed our hypothesis. PPARc was identified as the factor mediating this dietary regulation of fatty acid bioconversion enzymes in the liver. However, these molecular changes were not sufficient to modify the fatty acid composition of muscle or liver. Concerning the genotype effect, {{there was no evidence of}} substantial genotypic difference in lipid metabolism, LC-PUFA synthesis and flesh fatty acid profile when fed with vegetable oils.
