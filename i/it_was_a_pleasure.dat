500|$|On 7 May, Benfica {{played their}} final match {{of the season}} at Estádio da Mata Real. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although I admit, that in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. We could have done better. But I say, <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> being here, now my career will continue elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears {{spoke to}} V about the {{sessions}} for Femme Fatale, commenting {{that she had}} been recording the album for two years. On February 8, 2011, Spears tweeted she was in the studio with will.i.am, recording a song for the album. Later, the producer described the collaboration as [...] "a monster. It's mean, pretty, edgy, next level. [...] She's singing fresh over it. It's something that today needs," [...] and unveilead a teaser of the song through a blog message on February 28, 2011. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears commented that she is a fan of The Black Eyed Peas, due the fact that the band [...] "make incredibly catchy, fun pop/dance records and I LOVE will.i.am's style. I have always wanted to do a song with him and would love to work with him more in the future. He is so interesting." [...] will.i.am also praised Spears for the song, saying, [...] "Thank you Britney for collaborating <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> working with you. Thank you for trusting my instincts. You're a doll." [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] was written and produced by will.i.am, and Spears recorded her vocals for the song at Ethernet Studios in Los Angeles, California and at The Record Plant in Hollywood, California.|$|E

2500|$|Ray Lindwall: Like Trueman Lindwall's {{action was}} a text book model, {{but he was}} known for his heavy drag, and Rorke was {{described}} as having [...] "an even more phenomenal drag than Lindwall".

2500|$|Walt Simonson {{took over}} both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). His stories placed a greater {{emphasis}} on the character's mythological origins. [...] Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson's run, which introduced the character Beta Ray Bill, was regarded as a popular and critical success. Simonson's later stories were drawn by Sal Buscema, who describes Simonson's stories as [...] "very stimulating. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> working on his plots, because they were {{a lot of fun to}} illustrate. He had a lot of great ideas, and he took Thor in a totally new direction." [...] Asked why he was leaving Thor, Simonson said that he felt the series was due for a change in creative direction, and that he wanted to reduce his work load for a time. After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, Tom DeFalco, became the writer. Working primarily with artist Ron Frenz, DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).|$|E
