5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low <b>grunting,</b> mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering display {{is made with}} the bill raised high and {{differs from that of}} the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards.|$|E
5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and <b>grunting</b> calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and {{the skin of the}} {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or <b>grunting</b> sounds only heard when very close.|$|E

40|$|Despite their ubiquity {{in human}} behaviour, the {{communicative}} functions of nonverbal vocalisations remain poorly understood. Here, we analysed the acoustic structure of tennis <b>grunts,</b> nonverbal vocalisations produced {{in a competitive}} context. We predicted that tennis <b>grunts</b> convey information about vocalizer and context, similar to nonhuman vocal displays. Specifically, we tested whether the fundamental frequency (F 0) of tennis <b>grunts</b> conveys static cues to a player’s sex, height, weight, and age, and covaries dynamically with tennis shot type (a proxy of body posture) and the progress and outcome {{of male and female}} professional tennis contests. We also performed playback experiments (using natural and resynthesised stimuli) to assess the perceptual relevance of tennis <b>grunts.</b> The F 0 of tennis <b>grunts</b> predicted player sex, but not age or body size. Serve <b>grunts</b> had higher F 0 than forehand and backhand <b>grunts,</b> <b>grunts</b> produced later in contests had higher F 0 than those produced earlier, and <b>grunts</b> produced during contests that players won had a lower F 0 than those produced during lost contests. This difference in F 0 between losses and wins emerged early in matches, and did not change in magnitude as the match progressed, suggesting a possible role of physiological and/or psychological factors manifesting early or even before matches. Playbacks revealed that listeners use <b>grunt</b> F 0 to infer sex and contest outcome. These findings indicate that tennis <b>grunts</b> communicate information about both vocalizer and contest, consistent with nonhuman mammal vocalisations...|$|R

5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, <b>grunting</b> or {{chuffing}} many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and <b>grunting</b> sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E

The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E

40|$|As in insects, {{frogs and}} birds, vocal {{activity}} in fishes {{tends to be}} more developed in males than in females, and sonic swimbladder muscles may be sexually dimorphic, i. e., either larger in males or present only in males. Male oyster toadfish Opsanus tau L produce a long duration, tonal boatwhistle advertisement call, and both sexes <b>grunt,</b> a short duration more pulsatile agonistic call. Sonic muscles are present in both sexes but larger in males. We tested the hypothesis that males would call more than females by inducing <b>grunts</b> in toadfish of various sizes held in a net and determined incidence of calling and developmental changes in <b>grunt</b> parameters. A small number of fish were recorded twice to examine call repeatability. Both sexes were equally likely to <b>grunt,</b> and <b>grunt</b> parameters (sound pressure level (SPL), individual range in SPL, number of <b>grunts,</b> and fundamental frequency) were similar in both sexes. SPL increased with fish size before leveling off in fish > 200 g, and fundamental frequency and other parameters did not change with fish size. Number of <b>grunts</b> in a train, <b>grunt</b> duration and inter-grunt interval were highly variable in fish recorded twice suggesting that <b>grunt</b> parameters reflect internal motivation rather than different messages. <b>Grunt</b> production may explain the presence of well-developed sonic muscles in females and suggests that females have an active but unexplored vocal life...|$|R

5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and <b>grunting),</b> as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, <b>grunting,</b> {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud <b>grunting</b> noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness. A rapid respiratory rate {{is defined as}} greater than 60 breaths per minute in children under 2 months old, greater than 50 breaths per minute in children 2 months to 1 year old, or greater than 40 breaths per minute in children 1 to 5 years old. In children, low oxygen levels and lower chest indrawing are more sensitive than hearing chest crackles with a stethoscope or increased respiratory rate. <b>Grunting</b> and nasal flaring may be other useful signs in children {{less than five years}} old.|$|E
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the {{tawny nurse shark}} is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making <b>grunting</b> noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|E

40|$|In the spawing season, sound {{production}} of captive walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma (Pallas) was {{examined by the}} <b>grunt</b> call projection method. The pollock emitted four patterns of <b>grunt</b> calls, namely threatening call, aggressive-attacking call, courting call, and mating call. The sound frequency of these <b>grunt</b> calls is less than 800 Hz. The characteristics of walleye pollock behaviour matching each <b>grunt</b> call are as follows: (1) Only one threatening <b>grunt</b> call was emitted by the superior male to threaten other males encountered. (2) Aggressive-attacking <b>grunt</b> calls were emitted from two to five times in order to drive out other males from the male's occupied space. Behaviour included chasing, dorsal mounting and lateral mounting. (3) Courting calls were emitted from six to twelve times in order to court other males and females which are characterized by swimming faster than usual. The behaviour included chasing, dorsal mounting and lateral mounting. (4) Mating <b>grunt</b> calls were made more than thirteen times in order to mate with mature females. Behaviour included chasing, and dorsal, lateral and ventral mounting...|$|R
