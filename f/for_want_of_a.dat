The Rondeau M378 was introduced in 1978 and the M379 was unveiled the following year.

500|$|The Act was not {{effectively}} enforced, and did {{not address}} the working conditions of 'free children' (children working in mills who were not apprentices) who rapidly came to heavily outnumber the apprentices. [...] Regulating the way masters treated their apprentices was a recognised responsibility of Parliament and hence the Act itself was non-contentious, but coming between employer and employee to specify on what terms a man might sell his labour (or that of his child) was highly contentious. [...] Hence it was not until 1819 that an Act to limit the hours of work (and set a minimum age) for 'free children' working in cotton mills was piloted through Parliament by Peel and his son Robert (the future Prime Minister). [...] Strictly speaking, it is Peel's Cotton Mills and Factories Act of 1819 which (although also ineffective <b>for</b> <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> means of proper enforcement) paved the way for subsequent Factory Acts that would regulate the industry and set up effective means of regulation; but it is Peel's Act of 1802 which first recognised by legislation the evils of child labour in cotton mills that the Factory Acts addressed.|$|E

500|$|The thing must be movable, {{if it is}} to be stolen. Whilst an {{immovable}} thing {{cannot be}} carried away, the pre-classical extension to other types of interference with property means that immovable were not by their nature excluded. Gaius indicates that certain veteres ("ancients") believed that land could be stolen. This was also the view of Sabinus, but it was rejected by other classical jurists. A thing separated from the land could be stolen, however. Usucapio was particularly important with regard to land, and therefore the exclusion may have been retained to help the good faith possessor of land to usucapt. Res sanctae and religiosia were covered by separate delicts; and one could not steal a res nullius. [...] One can commit furtum of one's own property, for example by taking back a thing pledged to a creditor, or by secretly reclaiming one's own thing from a good faith possessor. Free persons could also be stolen, for example, children; a wife in manu; indicati and auctorati. This was probably a hang-over from a time when dominium (ownership), manus and potestas were indistinct and not formally separate. Res hereditariae could not be stolen, perhaps <b>for</b> <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable plaintiff with a sufficient interest.|$|E
500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under {{a secret}} trust predeceases the testator, {{his or her}} personal representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part {{of his or her}} residuary estate by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate secret trust that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a secret trust predeceases the testator, or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the testator, the position of the secret trust in unclear. In the case of a half-secret trust, the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail <b>for</b> <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trustee". Of a fully secret trust, it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a personal obligation as thus fails if renounced or if the trustee predeceases the testator.|$|E
