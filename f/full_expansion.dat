500|$|The {{construction}} of the A8 motorway and the Istrian Y {{can be traced back}} to 1968 when the Croatian Parliament decided to build a modern road linking Istria with the rest of Croatia. Subsequently, a bond to fund the construction was issued. The construction work started in 1976; in 1981 the Učka Tunnel was finished and a [...] section of the route between Matulji and Lupoglav was completed as a single-carriageway, two-lane expressway. The Lupoglav-Cerovlje portion was the next one to be completed, in 1988. The route was extended to the Rogovići interchange between 1992 and 1998, and the remaining section to Kanfanar was completed in 1999 as a two-lane road. In 2011, the expressway route started to be expanded gradually with the addition of a new carriageway and emergency lanes, eventually making most of it a controlled-access highway; the expansion of the route's first section, between Kanfanar and Rogovići, was completed in October 2011. The route's <b>full</b> <b>expansion</b> to motorway standards– including six lanes and grade separation of all its interchanges– is scheduled by 2015, when a second tube for the Učka Tunnel and a new route connecting the tunnel to the A7 motorway are planned. Construction slowed down in the 1990s due to a lack of funding; therefore, a build-operate-transfer concession for the Istrian Y was granted to the BINA Istra corporation for a period of 32 years.|$|E

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the functional relationship between intra-annual variations in vessel diameter and leaf emergence pattern of ring-porous and diffuse-porous deciduous trees in temperate forests, we determined the temporal relationships between leaf phenology and vessel formation. Cylindrical stem cores were periodically collected {{from each of}} five ring- and diffuse-porous species, and the leaf and vessel formation were observed simultaneously. In the ring-porous species, vessel formation began within 2 weeks of leaf appearance, and most wide vessels were formed within 2 weeks of <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion.</b> More of the trees with intermediate-type formed medium-sized vessels or sparse wide vessels than trees with the flush-type leaf emergence, especially between <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> {{and the end of}} shoot elongation. Narrow vessel formation began 2 – 8 weeks after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> in all specimens. The transition between the pore- and non-pore zones was abrupt in the flush-type species, and gradual in the intermediate-type species. In contrast, diffuse-porous species formed vessels 0 – 8 weeks after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion.</b> Our findings suggest that ring-porous species form leaves and vessels synchronously to accommodate water-transport requirements, whereas diffuse-porous species form these tissues asynchronously; thus, unlike the latter type, the former species change vessel diameters according to leaf formation...|$|R

500|$|Gas Powered Games' {{release of}} the Siege Editor did spark {{the rise of a}} modding {{community}} around the game; even before release several modding groups announced intentions to use the engine to create large-scale mods remaking games from the Ultima series of role playing games.

Gas Powered Games released one mod of their own in July 2002 titled [...] "Yesterhaven", created by six designers over six weeks, which provided a short multiplayer storyline for low-level characters wherein they defended a town from three thematic plagues of monsters. It was followed up by Legends of Aranna, a <b>full</b> <b>expansion</b> pack developed by Mad Doc Software and released on November 11, 2003 for Windows and MacOS by Microsoft. The expansion pack added little new gameplay besides new terrains, creatures, and items, but featured an entirely separate story from the original game. In Legends, the player controls another unnamed farmer; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by a creature called the Shadowjumper, they set off to retrieve it. After fighting their way through monsters in icy hills, jungles, and islands, the player arrives at the mystical Great Clock, a giant artifact which controls Aranna's seasons. There they defeat the Shadowjumper and retrieve the Staff of Stars. It received generally less positive reviews than the original, with critics praising the amount of content but criticizing the lack of changes to the base gameplay.|$|E

Leaf optical properties, pigment changes, expansion characteristics, stomatal development, and photosynthetic rates were studied. In both S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii photosynthetic development was delayed until after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion.</b> Rates of O evolution were negative during expansion of S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii leaves and stomatal conductance was 10 - 20 mmol m s lower than for corresponding leaves of S. moorei. Stomatal conductance data and {{scanning electron microscopy}} showed {{that the development of}} functional stomata was delayed until after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> in S. luehmannii and S. wilsonii, however, low stomatal conductance was not responsible for the lack of photosynthetic potential during leaf expansion in these species.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} coordination of transcript and/or protein abundances of stromal enzymes during leaf senescence. First trifolioliate leaves of Phaseolus vulgaris L. plants were sampled beginning at the time of full leaf expansion; at this same time, half of the plants were switched to a nutrient solution lacking N. Total RNA and soluble protein abundances decreased after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> whereas chlorophyll abundance remained constant; N stress enhanced the decline in these traits. Abundances of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisposphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4. 1. 1. 39), Rubisco activase and phosphoribulokinase (Ru 5 P kinase; EC 2. 7. 1. 19) decreased after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> in a coordinated manner for both treatments. In contrast, adenosine diphosphate glucose (ADPGlc) pyrophosphorylase (EC 2. 7. 7. 27) abundance was relatively constant during natural senescence but did decline similar to the other enzymes under N stress. Northern analyses indicated that transcript abundances for all enzymes declined markedly on a fresh-weight basis just after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion.</b> This rapid decline was particularly strong for the Rubisco small subunit (rbcS) transcript. The decline was enhanced by N stress for rbcS and Rubisco activase (rca), but not for Ru 5 P kinase (prk) and ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase (agp). Transcripts of the Clp protease subunits clpC and clpP declined in abundance just after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion,</b> similar to the other mRNA species. When Northern blots were analyzed using equal RNA loads, rbcS transcripts still declined markedly just after <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion</b> whereas rca and clpC transcripts increased over time. The results indicated that senescence was initiated near the time of <b>full</b> leaf <b>expansion,</b> was accelerated by N stress, and was characterized by large decline in transcripts of stromal enzymes. The decreased mRNA abundances were in general associated with steadily declining stromal protein abundances, with ADPGlc pyrophosphorylase being the notable exception. Transcript analyses for the Clp subunits supported a recent report (Shanklin et al., 1995, Plant Cell 7 : 1713 [...] 1722) indicating that the Clp protease subunits were constitutive throughout development and suggested that ClpC and ClpP do not function as a senescence-specific proteolytic system in Phaseolus...|$|R

60|$|After {{traversing}} the Park, we {{come into}} the neighborhood of Greenwich Hospital, and will pass through one of its spacious gateways {{for the sake of}} glancing at an establishment which does more honor to the heart of England than anything else that I am acquainted with, of a public nature. It is very seldom that we can be sensible of anything like kindliness in the acts or relations of such an artificial thing as a National Government. Our own government, I should conceive, is too much an abstraction ever to feel any sympathy for its maimed sailors and soldiers, though it will doubtless do then a severe kind of justice, as chilling as the touch of steel. But {{it seemed to me that}} the Greenwich pensioners are the petted children of the nation, and that the government is their dry-nurse, and that the old men themselves have a childlike consciousness of their position. Very likely, a better sort of life might have been arranged, and a wiser care bestowed on them; but, such as it is, it enables them to spend a sluggish, careless, comfortable old age, grumbling, growling, gruff, as if all the foul weather of their past years were pent up within them, yet not much more discontented than such weather-beaten and battle-battered fragments of human kind must inevitably be. Their home, in its outward form, is on a very magnificent plan. Its germ was a royal palace, the <b>full</b> <b>expansion</b> of which has resulted in a series of edifices externally more beautiful than any English palace that I have seen, consisting of several quadrangles of stately architecture, united by colonnades and gravel-walks, and enclosing grassy squares, with statues in the centre, the whole extending along the Thames. It is built of marble, or very light-colored stone, in the classic style, with pillars and porticos, which (to my own taste, and, I fancy, to that of the old sailors) produce but a cold and shivery effect in the English climate. Had I been the architect, I would have studied the characters, habits, and predilections of nautical people in Wapping, Hotherhithe, and the neighborhood of the Tower (places which I visited in affectionate remembrance of Captain Lemuel Gulliver, and other actual or mythological navigators), and would have built the hospital in a kind of ethereal similitude to the narrow, dark, ugly, and inconvenient, but snug and cosey homeliness of the sailor boarding-houses there. There can be no question that all the above attributes, or enough of then to satisfy an old sailor's heart, might be reconciled with architectural beauty and the wholesome contrivances of modern dwellings, and thus a novel and genuine style of building be given to the world.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century there were {{numerous}} writers who declared the right of subjects to depose a bad sovereign, but this position is to be distinguished from Rousseau's doctrine. Thus, if {{we turn to the}} great historic event of 1581, the rejection of the yoke of Spain by the Dutch, we find the Declaration of Independence running, [...] "that if a prince is appointed by God over the land, it is to protect them from harm, even as a shepherd to the guardianship of his flock. The subjects are not appointed by God for the behoof of the prince, but the prince for his subjects, without whom he is no prince." [...] This is obviously divine right, fundamentally modified by a popular principle, accepted to meet the exigencies of the occasion, and to justify after the event a measure which was dictated by urgent need for practical relief. Such a notion of the social compact was still emphatically in the semi-patriarchal stage, and is distinct as can be from the dogma of popular sovereignty as Rousseau understood it. But it plainly marked a step on the way. It was the development of Protestant principles which produced and necessarily involved the extreme democratic conclusion. Time was needed for their <b>full</b> <b>expansion</b> in this sense, but the result could only have been avoided by a suppression of the Reformation, and we therefore count it inevitable. Bodin (1577) had defined sovereignty as residing in the supreme legislative authority, without further inquiry as to the source or seat of that authority, though he admits the vague position which even Lewis XIV. did not deny, that the object of political society is the greatest good of every citizen or the whole state. In 1603 a Protestant professor of law in Germany, Althusen by name, published a treatise of Politics, in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of peoples was clearly formulated, to the profound indignation both of Jesuits and of Protestant jurists.[214] Rousseau mentions his name;[215] it does not appear that he read Althusen's rather uncommon treatise, but its teaching would probably have a place in the traditions of political theorising current at Geneva, to the spirit of whose government it was so congenial. Hooker, vindicating episcopacy against the democratic principles of the Puritans, had still been led, apparently by way of the ever dominant idea of a law natural, to base civil government on the assent of the governed, and had laid down such propositions as these: [...] "Laws they are not, which public approbation hath not made so. Laws therefore human, of what kind soever, are available by consent," [...] and so on.[216] The views of the Ecclesiastical Polity were adopted by Locke, and became the foundation of the famous essay on Civil Government, from which popular leaders in our own country drew all their weapons down to the outbreak of the French Revolution. Grotius (1625) starting from the principle that the law of nature enjoins that we should stand by our agreements, then proceeded to assume either an express, or at any rate a tacit and implied, promise on the part of all who become members of a community, to obey the majority of the body, or a majority of those to whom authority has been delegated.[217] This is a unilateral view of the social contract, and omits the element of reciprocity which in Rousseau's idea was cardinal.|$|E
