5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The <b>eyebrow,</b> lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though <b>eyebrow</b> piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, <b>eyebrow,</b> ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of body piercing {{is subject to}} trends and fashions. Belly button and <b>eyebrow</b> piercings were popular during the 1990s when the piercing trend entered the mainstream. In recent years, the septum piercing and nipple piercing are considered highly fashionable. Additionally, the {{practice of}} ear lobe gauging or stretching has become popular with {{the turn of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (<b>eyebrow)</b> in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eyebrows</b> {{also have}} an {{important}} facilitative function in communication, strengthening expressions, such as surprise, anger or sexiness.Many makeup artists view <b>eyebrows</b> as a major feature in defining the face. The <b>eyebrows</b> shape the human face and give definition to one's eyes and forehead. Depending on {{the shape of the}} <b>eyebrows,</b> it sometimes can cause what is known as a false facial expression (such as a person's <b>eyebrows</b> shaped to seem as if the person was angry, but really isn't). Some people can also move their <b>eyebrows</b> up and down alternately.|$|R
50|$|Men tend to {{have lower}} <b>eyebrows</b> {{relative}} {{to the position of}} their brow ridges when compared to women. Men's <b>eyebrows</b> tend to be below their brow ridges while women's <b>eyebrows</b> tend to be above their brow ridges. Accordingly, FFS to raise the <b>eyebrows</b> results in a face with a more womanly appearance.|$|R

It is generally accepted that dense, wide, dark-colored <b>eyebrows</b> make the face look charming and attractive in men. The shape and hair {{direction of the}} <b>eyebrows</b> in Asian {{men and women are}} not much different. Men appear to have wider <b>eyebrows</b> than women. In fact, most women often pluck or shave the lower border especially at the lateral third of their <b>eyebrows</b> to make them narrow and appear more aesthetically pleasing. In Chinese and Japanese male culture, bushy <b>eyebrows</b> are believed to be a sign of strength, power, prosperity, and charm.

5|$|Eight centimeters {{wide and}} five tall, the Gevninge {{eyepiece}} was molded from bronze and then gilded. An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted <b>eyebrow</b> with grooves forming individual hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The {{top and the}} bottom of the fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three to some form of face protection such as a facemask or camail.|$|E

Tests had been developed for counterfeit coins and proved very popular with the victims, mostly ordinary people. He deals with the liquid metal mercury, also found in silver mines. He records that it is toxic, and amalgamates with gold, so is used for refining and extracting that metal. He says mercury is used for gilding copper, while antimony is found in silver mines and is used as an <b>eyebrow</b> cosmetic.|$|E
5|$|Ivall's Cottage, a Grade II listed {{building}} since 1985, is located opposite the post box {{near the village}} green. The cottage was originally built during the 16th century, with late 18th century and early 19th century additions with contemporary extensions at the sides. The cottage is built from red brick and flint in Flemish bond, with cambered openings {{on the ground floor}} with a part-thatched, part-tiled roof. The roof is hipped at the west end, with lower eaves at the rear intercepted by <b>eyebrow</b> dormers.|$|E

5|$|The Gengshi Emperor (r.23–25 AD), a {{descendant}} of Emperor Jing (r.157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital. However, he was overwhelmed by the Red <b>Eyebrow</b> rebels who deposed, assassinated, and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu Penzi. Emperor Gengshi's brother Liu Xiu, known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57 AD), after distinguishing himself at the Battle of Kunyang in 23 AD, was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor.|$|E
5|$|The Gevninge helmet {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish helmet from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised <b>eyebrow</b> above an oval with eyelashes, and originally formed the right eyepiece of the helmet.

5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru reed warbler is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed warbler, which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting <b>eyebrow.</b> The nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger, and the Oriental reed warbler has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the <b>eyebrow</b> ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, <b>eyebrow,</b> throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E

Short <b>eyebrows</b> are for the young and long <b>eyebrows</b> display maturity.|$|R

Liu Penzi and his two brothers were forced into the Red <b>Eyebrows</b> as child soldiers. When the Red <b>Eyebrows</b> submitted to the new Emperor Gengshi of Han, his older brother Liu Gong fled to support the new emperor. Later, the Red <b>Eyebrows</b> rose again in rebellion and chose Liu Penzi as emperor. When they took Chang'an, Liu Penzi was officially Emperor of China, but he never had actual powers. When Liu Xiu definitively defeated the Red <b>Eyebrows,</b> he spared the 17 year old puppet emperor.|$|R
60|$|With {{several species}} of baboons the ridge of the {{forehead}} projects much over the eyes, and is studded with a few long hairs, representing our <b>eyebrows.</b> These animals are always looking about them, {{and in order to}} look upwards they raise their <b>eyebrows.</b> They have thus, as it would appear, acquired the habit of frequently moving their <b>eyebrows.</b> However this may be, many kinds of monkeys, especially the baboons, when angered or in any way excited, rapidly and incessantly move their <b>eyebrows</b> up and down, as well as the hairy skin of their foreheads.[15] As we associate in the case of man the raising and lowering of the <b>eyebrows</b> with definite states of the mind, the almost incessant movement of the <b>eyebrows</b> by monkeys gives them a senseless expression. I once observed a man who had a trick of continually raising his <b>eyebrows</b> without any corresponding emotion, and this gave to him a foolish appearance; so it is with some persons who keep the corners of their mouths a little drawn backwards and upwards, as if by an incipient smile, though at the time they are not amused or pleased.|$|R
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of <b>eyebrow</b> movements and simply mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E
5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more prominent pale <b>eyebrow</b> and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|E
5|$|Kentikian was {{discovered}} {{as a professional}} boxer at an exhibition fight during qualifications for the World Amateur Boxing Championships. At the beginning of 2005, she signed a three-year contract with the Hamburg boxing promoter Spotlight Boxing, a joint venture of Universum Box-Promotion, focusing on young athletes. Since then, she has been coached by Universum trainer Magomed Schaburow. Kentikian started her professional career on January 15, 2005, with a win by unanimous decision over Iliana Boneva of Bulgaria on the undercard of German female boxing star Regina Halmich. Over the next 14months, Kentikian won nine of her eleven fights by knockout. Her unusually high knockout percentage, rarely seen in lower female weight classes, began to draw attention. On July 25, 2006, she won her first belt, the International German flyweight title, against Daniela Graf by unanimous decision. In her first international title fight on September 9, 2006, Kentikian beat Maribel Zurita from the United States with a fourth round technical knockout for the WIBF InterContinental Flyweight title; the fight was stopped when Zurita was cut over the left <b>eyebrow.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on {{the hand}} with a short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it difficult to}} position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied <b>eyebrow</b> with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (<b>eyebrow)</b> and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous <b>eyebrow</b> at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E

The corrugator supercilii muscles can pull the <b>eyebrows</b> inwards and down, forming a frown. The procerus muscles can pull down the centre portions of the <b>eyebrows.</b>|$|R
