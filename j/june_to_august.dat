5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} {{to drive out}} the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August</b> 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E
5|$|This list {{presents}} {{the following information}} for each species: common and scientific name of each species, preferred habitat, breeding status in Vieques and frequency of occurrence for each season (winter spans from December to February, spring from March to May, summer from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August,</b> fall from September to November). Tags (described below) are used to describe this information for each species.|$|E
5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August</b> in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the weather is influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August,</b> frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and {{a large proportion of the}} annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at that time of year. Average rainfall is 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August</b> having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills. The {{average annual}} sunshine totals around 1,600hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and a large proportion of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 35–60inch (900–1500mm). About 10–20days of snowfall is typical.

5|$|McLeod did {{not make}} another {{appearance}} for the national team until 2006. She was invited to the first training camp of 2006 in mid-January. It was the first training camp she took part in since July 2004. McLeod was named to a 17-women roster for two matches against the Netherlands in March 2006. She started in goal for the March 4 match, allowing one goal in the 90 minutes played. In April, she made the 18-women roster for the four-city, five-match tour of the United States, where the Canadian team played various college teams. Following the tour, McLeod appeared and started in seven friendlies for Canada from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August,</b> allowing eight goals total and recording two shutouts.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August</b> in India) but can vary. Laboratory {{studies have found that}} long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E

5|$|The three ships saw {{significant}} action {{during the}} Italo-Turkish War of 191112, primarily conducting operations {{in support of}} Italian troops fighting in Libya. From October to December 1911, the ships were stationed off Tripoli, where they bombarded Ottoman defenses {{to prepare for the}} initial landing and then provided fire support to Italian forces after they had seized the city. After returning to Italy for resupply, the ships were tasked with escorting troop convoys to attack other ports in Libya from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August</b> 1912.|$|E
5|$|While {{the estate}} remains in private hands, the National Trust owns {{the house and}} gardens, the park, the village of West Wycombe, and the hill on which the Dashwood {{mausoleum}} sits. The hill was {{the first part of}} the property given to the Trust by Sir John Dashwood in 1925. The village was bought by the Royal Society of Arts from Sir John in 1929 and given to the Trust five years later. The grounds are open to the public in the afternoon only from April to August annually, and the house is open from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 1902, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{went into}} dock at Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul. In mid-March, Wilhelm II and his wife, Augusta Victoria, came aboard {{the ship and}} waited {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe for Wilhelm's brother Prince Heinrich, who was {{returning}} from the United States. The I Squadron then went on a short cruise in the western Baltic before embarking on a major cruise around the British Isles, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August,</b> interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. During these maneuvers, three of Kaiser Wilhelm IIs boiler tubes burst, but the damage was repaired by the start of the autumn maneuvers in August. These exercises began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade. Kaiser Wilhelm II took no active part in the exercises; she instead served as an observation ship for the commander of the fleet, as well as her namesake, Kaiser Wilhelm II. The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December.|$|E

5|$|The female {{is similar}} in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Kronan lie {{at a depth}} of 26m (85ft), 6km (3.7mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions {{to the site of the}} wreck from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August.</b> By Baltic Sea standards, the {{conditions}} are good for underwater archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile sand that reflects much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted so far and Kronan has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Valiant {{was under}} construction, Westwood, Baillie went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and their shipyard {{was taken over}} by the Thames Ironworks. This delayed her launching by {{about a year and a}} shortage of muzzle-loading guns delayed her completion by nearly five years. Hector, in contrast, served with the Channel Fleet from commissioning until 1867, when she was paid off to be re-armed and to refit. She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886 much like Valiants service as the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland after her commissioning, where she remained until 1885. Both ships did little of significance until they were assigned to the Particular Service Squadron, commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby, from <b>June</b> <b>to</b> <b>August</b> 1878 during the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E
