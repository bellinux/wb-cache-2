A SECS, based on a constant-area ejector flow model and using R- 123, was considered. The cooling season and period were taken into account for the 6 months (May-October) and the hours 8 : 00 - 17 : 00, respectively. It {{was found that the}} <b>evacuated-tube</b> <b>collector</b> efficiency depending upon the ambient temperature and solar radiation within the day was remarkably varied. However, for all the cities, the cooling capacities of the SECS were very similar. When generator, condenser, and evaporator temperatures were taken, namely, 85 Â Â°C, 30 Â Â°C and 12 Â Â°C, the maximum overall coefficient of performance and the cooling capacity were obtained as 0. 197 and 178. 26 Â W/m 2, respectively, at 12 : 00 in August for Aydin.

In {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) or cogeneration systems, the thermodynamic and economic ‘value’ of the electrical output is usually considered to be greater than that of (an equivalent) thermal output, and therefore the prioritisation of the electrical output in terms of system-level optimisation has been driving much of the research, innovation and technology development in this area. In this work, the potential of a solar CHP technology based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine is investigated. We present thermodynamic models developed for different collectors, including flat-plate <b>collectors</b> (FPC) and <b>evacuated-tube</b> <b>collectors</b> (ETC) coupled with a non-recuperative sub-critical ORC architecture to deliver power and hot water by using thermal energy rejected from the engine. Results from dynamic 3 -D simulations of the solar collectors together with a thermal energy storage (TES) tank are presented. TES offers an important buffering capability during periods of intermittent solar radiation, as well as the potential for demand-side management (DSM). Results are presented of an optimisation analysis to identify the most suitable working fluids for the ORC unit, in which the configuration and operational constraints of the collector array are taken into account. The most suitable working fluids (R 245 fa and R 1233 zd) are then chosen for a whole-system optimisation performed in a southern European climate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a solar-assisted direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system with novel energy recovery concepts for a continuous 24 -h-a-day operation. A temperature modulating scheme is {{introduced to the}} solar-thermal system that supplies feed seawater to the DCMD modules. This scheme attenuates extreme temperature fluctuations of the feed water by storing the collected energy during solar-peak hours and reutilizing it throughout the day. Thus, the energy savings is realized yet the feed seawater temperature is maintained within the desired range. Additionally, the system employs heat recovery from the permeate and brine streams to the feed seawater. The simulations for such a system with a shell-and-tube type DCMD modules are carried out to examine the spatial property variations and the sensitivity of system performance (i. e., transmembrane pressure, permeate flux and performance ratio) to the operating conditions (inlet temperature and flow rate) and the fiber dimensions (fiber length and packing density). It is found that there are trade-offs between mean permeate flux and performance ratio with respect to permeate inlet temperature and flow rate and between total distillate production and performance ratio with respect to packing density. For the solar-assisted DCMD system having <b>evacuated-tube</b> <b>collectors</b> of 3360 m 2 with 160 m 3 seawater storage tanks and 50 DCMD modules, the annual solar fraction and the collector efficiency {{are found to be}} 77 % and 53 %, respectively, whilst the overall permeate production capacity is 31 m 3 /day.

The performance of SHWP at Changi International Airport Services (CIASs), Singapore, is studied for better payback period using the monthly average hourly diffuse and beam radiations and ambient temperature data. The data input for solar radiation model is obtained from the Singapore Meteorological Service (SMS), and these data have been compared with long-term average data of NASA (surface meteorology and solar energy or SSE).

40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} modeling, TRNSYS simulation, and {{parametric}} {{analysis of a}} solar water distillation system based on a humidification-dehumidification cycle. The thermal processes that constitute the cycle are carried out in devices designed for maximum individual efficiency. In order to achieve this, {{it is necessary for}} the evaporative process (in which an air current is humidified) to happen at the highest temperature attainable without boiling. This maximizes the amount of vapor that can be carried by the air current. This process is performed in a vertical packed column, where a stream of hot water falls as a current of hot air ascends in countercurrent and directly contacts the water. The air at the exit of the tower is saturated with vapor at the same temperature as the entering water, thus maximizing the amount of moisture carried. The hot and humid air then passes through a condenser that releases heat to the atmosphere, bringing air to nearly ambient temperature and maximizing distillate condensation. In order to achieve the previous, it is necessary for the thermal capture and storage system to work with thermal oil, an insulated storage tank, and <b>evacuated-tube</b> solar <b>collectors.</b> The system must maintain a steady oil temperature of 110 °C. We propose a condenser based on heat pipes and with excess heat transfer area for dumping heat to the atmosphere, in order for the condensation temperature to be {{as close as possible to}} atmospheric. The efficiency of the distiller is substantially increased by forcing the process to occur between the described temperature limits, not unlike what happens in the power cycles of heat engines. The thermal oil transfers energy to the air and water currents through two heat exchangers, and the insulated storage tank makes it possible to operate the system at night for as long as sufficiently hot oil is still available. A flow control system regulates the temperature reached by the water that flows to the evaporation tower. We used the simulation platform TRNSYS to model this system, including the evaporation tower and condenser. Using the climatic conditions of the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, we performed a parametric study of the system and determined the effect of varying the number of solar collectors, volume of the thermal tank, and flow rate of water. We simulated the behavior of the system over a year of continued operation, measuring the amount of condensate produced during that period. The objective of this analysis was to determine the variation of distillate production, in kilograms of water distilled per year per square meter of solar collector, and per cubic meter of thermal tank. This was used to determine the optimal characteristics of the proposed distillation system...|$|R
