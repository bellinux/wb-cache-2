5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{the polar}} vortex formed over Antarctica is very tight and the {{reaction}} occurring {{on the surface of}} the cloud crystals is <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> when it occurs in atmosphere. These conditions have led to ozone hole formation in Antarctica.

25|$|The {{establishment}} of Israel and {{the flood of}} Jewish refugees from Europe and the Arab world presented challenges and opportunities for kibbutzim. The immigrant tide offered kibbutzim a chance to expand through new members and inexpensive labour, but it also meant that Ashkenazi kibbutzim would have to adapt to Jews whose background was <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their own. Until the 1950s, nearly all kibbutzniks were from Eastern Europe, culturally different from the Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Iraq. Many kibbutzim hired Mizrahi Jews as labourers but were less inclined to grant them membership.|$|E
25|$|During that conflict, France {{had been}} pinned down in Europe {{fighting}} Continental powers while Britain defeated the French navy and won victories in India, the West Indies and North America. However, Britain's strategic {{position at the}} beginning of 1778 was <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the one she enjoyed in 1756. Gone was the alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia: in 1778 Britain was diplomatically isolated and without European allies. In the first months of this year, Britain attempted, without success, to find a Continental ally to engage the power of France. This failure produced the central strategic fact of the War of 1778: there would be no competing European campaigns to absorb France's strength. European isolation didn't matter in peacetime, but Britain was at serious disadvantage without European allies in war against France.|$|E

25|$|Nineteen {{years after}} Voldemort's downfall, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, {{whom they are}} sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo. Though the {{epilogue}} does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married, news articles and other sources treat it as a fact. Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief {{that he could not}} do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the one that existed previously. Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.|$|E
25|$|The main {{trial of}} the ringleaders of the {{rebellion}} (the 19 surviving officers, Isobe, Muranaka and two other civilians) began on April 28. The trial was held in secret, and the defendants did not have rights to legal representation, call witnesses or appeal. The judges {{were not interested in}} hearing about the defendants' motives and intentions and forced them to concentrate on their actions in their testimony. The trial was therefore <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the ordinary court martial that Aizawa had faced a few months earlier. Charged with , the rebel officers argued that their actions had been approved by the Minister of War's Proclamation and their incorporation into the martial law forces, and that they had never been formally presented with the imperial command. The verdicts were handed down on June 4 and the sentences on July 5: all were found guilty and 17 were sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} planes {{belong to the}} subtle sphere, the fourth is on the {{threshold}} between the subtle and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the mental sphere. The first plane starts from {{the threshold of the}} gross and the subtle sphere. The soul here starts experiencing subtle phenomena simultaneously through its gross and subtle senses. It starts hearing subtle sounds and smelling subtle scents, although their nature is <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving the subtle world through its subtle body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to subtle impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of the subtle world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|E
5000|$|For 1984, the Continental Mark VI was {{replaced}} by the Continental Mark VII. Nearly a full yard shorter than the Continental Mark V of 1979, the Continental Mark VII took on a <b>far</b> <b>different</b> role <b>from</b> previous Marks; to include a greater degree of performance, the Continental Mark VII was benchmarked against large European coupes, sharing its powertrain with the Ford Mustang. In 1986, to eliminate confusion, [...] "Continental" [...] was dropped from the model name and it became simply the Lincoln Mark VII.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed over}} from Manar to Negapatan; but there he found all {{things in a}} <b>far</b> <b>different</b> {{condition}} <b>from</b> what he hoped. The Portuguese navy diminished daily; and the commanders, who at the beginning had been so zealous for the Holy War, were now the first to condemn it. It was in vain for him to set before their eyes the honour of their nation, and that of God: interest did so blind their understanding, that they forgot they were either Portuguese or Christians: behold, in short, what overthrew so glorious an expedition.|$|R

By 2000, Takara—which was dealing with financial issues—reduced their new LED Powers series {{to just a few}} dozen of toys and canceled the Microman anime series as well as the manga in Comic BomBom magazine. Soon afterwards Takara would put all of their new Microman properties on an indefinite hiatus.|$|R

Louis C.K. left the show to devote more time to his own upcoming series, Louie, which was to air in early 2010. Louis C.K. was widely praised for his brief stint on the show, where he adopts a deadpan, technical tone of voice <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> his usual comedy persona. Matt Fowler of IGN said, [...] "Louis C.K., known for being a raucous, raunchy comic, is almost frightening in his ability to play against his stage persona and give us a wonderfully caring, and deadpan, character".|$|E
50|$|Menendez had an {{approval}} rating of 38%, which {{was thought to}} be a sign of vulnerability for the incumbent, especially since his disapproval was at 50%. Although incumbents {{approval rating}}s below 50% are generally considered vulnerable, this standard perhaps did not apply to Menendez as he had just been appointed at the start of 2006 and was not well known statewide, a <b>far</b> <b>different</b> situation <b>from</b> most incumbents. President George W. Bush was highly unpopular in the state, but Governor Corzine's early performance in office met with widespread disapproval, contributing to the large number of undecided voters. The campaign became increasingly aggressive, with Menendez calling Kean a Bush lackey while Kean repeatedly attacked Menendez as corrupt.|$|R

Adams adopted a [...] "Japanese sympathizer" [...] gimmick to go with his new attitude, including growing a beard, using face paint (albeit a design <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> his Demolition days), and wearing darker colors. At Survivor Series, Crush headlined the event as part of Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, Ludvig Borga and Quebecer Jacques) against All-Americans (Lex Luger, The Undertaker and Steiner Brothers).

Boitani sees the two World Wars and the 20th century's engagement [...] "in the recovery of all sorts of past myths" [...] as contributing to a rekindling of interest in Troilus as a human being destroyed by events beyond his control. Similarly Foakes sees the aftermath of one World War and the threat of a second as key elements for the successful revival of Shakespeare's Troilus in two productions in the first half of the 20th century, and one of the authors discussed below names Barbara Tuchman's [...] as the trigger for his wish to retell the Trojan war.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong became disillusioned {{and left}} Scientology {{at the start}} of 1982. He was {{declared}} a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] (an enemy of Scientology) by the Church.

The Manila bay was exposed during this time and the sealine would be located outside Corregidor Island. The Pasig River would be a cutting channel through the bay area, depositing sediments onto the coastal plain, gradually increasing the area of the delta. The last period of glacial age also entails the man to be defined as a tool making being. From merely tool users to toolmaker and user, man had been used to drafting, manufacturing and using what is available in the environment.|$|R

500|$|Kvinneakt was {{designed}} and created by Norman J. Taylor, a Seattle-based artist and professor of sculpture at the University of Washington, between 1973 and 1975. The piece is an abstract bronze sculpture depicting a full-length nude woman measuring 71" [...] x 38" [...] x 25". Kvinneakt was one of 11 sculptures selected for the Portland Transit Mall from more than 500 entries entered in a juried competition. The works were purchased through a budget of $250,000; Kvinneakt was commissioned {{at a cost of}} $6,500. Funding sources for the project included Tri-Met (20percent) and the United States Department of Transportation (80percent). Of the 11 sculptures, only Kvinneakt and Kathleen McCullough's (née Conchuratt) Cat in Repose were considered [...] "figurative".

[...] According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, Taylor intended the piece to be [...] "confrontational"; he admitted, [...] "the worst reaction you could give my work is no reaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Campbell's {{plans for}} Unknown {{were laid out}} in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the {{announcement}} of the new magazine. He argued that [...] "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... will offer fantasy of a quality so <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as [...] "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell [...] "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". [...] The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's [...] "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, [...] "Trouble with Water" [...] was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take. [...] Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, [...] "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.|$|E
500|$|Of more {{importance}} to the science fiction and fantasy genres were several other magazines that debuted in 1939. [...] The first to appear, from Standard Magazines, were Startling Stories and Strange Stories, launched in January and February respectively as companions to Thrilling Wonder Stories; Mort Weisinger edited all three. [...] Startling included a lead novel and a [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] reprint section in every issue; the latter was possible because the publisher, Standard Magazines, owned the back catalog of Wonder Stories. [...] At that time no other sf pulp was including novels; readers approved, and Startling quickly {{became one of the}} most popular sf magazines. [...] Strange Stories was launched as a direct competitor to Weird Tales, and the first issue featured many of Weird Tales most popular authors, including Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Henry Kuttner and Manly Wade Wellman. Bloch, Derleth, and Kuttner were all frequent contributors over the magazine's life, but Ashley regards it as a poor imitation of Weird Tales, fewer of its stories having been anthologized since. [...] At the end of 1938 Weird Tales owner, B. Cornelius, sold his interest in the magazine to William J. Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, a general fiction magazine. [...] Delaney's offices were in New York, and Weird Tales editor, Farnsworth Wright, moved there from Chicago. [...] Delaney made several changes to page count and frequency to try to increase circulation, but none were successful. [...] While this took place, another competitor to Weird Tales was launched, this time by Street & Smith. [...] The new magazine, titled Unknown, was a companion to Astounding and was also edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Campbell's declared policy for the magazine was to [...] "offer fantasy of a quality so <b>far</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term"; the goal was to bring [...] "the science fiction rationale to fantasy", in Ashley's words. [...] Unknowns first issue was dated March 1939, with L. Ron Hubbard and L. Sprague de Camp soon among the most frequent contributors.|$|E
60|$|Another {{considerable}} {{innovation is}} the proposition {{to divide the}} class Pisces into the four groups of Leptocardia, Cyclostomata, Pisces, and Dipneusta.

And there is much to be said in favour of the same promotion of the Cyclostomata, or Lampreys and Hags. But considering the close relation of the Mudfish with the Ganoidei, and the wide differences between the Elasmobranchii and the Teleostei, I greatly doubt the propriety of separating the Dipneusta, as a class, from the other Pisces.|$|R
25|$|In contrast, the dorsal {{auditory}} pathway, {{projecting from}} the temporal lobe is largely concerned with processing spatial information, and contains receptive fields that are topographically organized. Fibers from this region project directly to neurons governing corresponding receptive fields in V1. The perceptual {{consequences of this}} {{have not yet been}} empirically acknowledged. However, it can be hypothesized that these projections may be the precursors of increased acuity and emphasis of visual stimuli in relevant areas of perceptual space. Consequently, this finding rejects Jones and Powell's (1970) hypothesis and thus is in conflict with Sadato et al.s (2004) findings. A resolution to this discrepancy includes the possibility that primary sensory areas can not be classified as a single group, and thus may be <b>far</b> more <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what was previously thought.|$|R
