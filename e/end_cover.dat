50|$|Eating {{meat and}} poultry {{on a daily basis}} was {{historically}} a privilege of the upper classes. Pork and beef are the most common meats in the country. Meat was a staple at the nobleman's table during the Middle Ages. A Portuguese Renaissance chronicler, Garcia de Resende, describes how an entrée at a royal banquet was composed of a whole roasted ox garnished with a circle of chickens. A common Portuguese dish, mainly eaten in winter, is cozido à portuguesa, which somewhat parallels the French pot au feu or the New England boiled dinner. Its composition depends on the cook's imagination and budget. A really lavish cozido may include beef, pork, salt pork, several types of enchidos (such as cured chouriço, morcela e chouriço de sangue, linguiça, farinheira, etc.), pig's feet, cured ham, potatoes, carrots, turnips, chickpeas, cabbage and rice. This would originally have been a favourite food of the affluent farmer, which later reached the tables of the urban bourgeoisie and typical restaurants. Tripas à moda do Porto (tripe with white beans) is said to have originated in the 14th century, when the Castilians laid siege to Lisbon and blockaded the Tagus entrance. The Portuguese chronicler Fernão Lopes dramatically recounts how starvation spread all over the city. Food prices rose astronomically, and small boys would go to the former wheat market place in search of a few grains on the ground, which they would eagerly put in their mouths when found. Old and sick people, as well as prostitutes, or in short anybody who {{would not be able to}} aid in the city's defence, were sent out to the Castilian camp, only to be returned to Lisbon by the invaders. It was at this point that the citizens of Porto decided to organize a supply fleet that managed to slip through the river blockade. Apparently, since all available meat was sent to the capital for a while, Porto residents were limited to tripe and other organs. Others claim that it was only in 1415 that Porto deprived itself of meat to supply the expedition that conquered the city of Ceuta, in North Africa. Whatever the truth may be, since at least the 17th century, people from Porto have been known as tripeiros or tripe eaters. Another Portuguese dish with tripe is Dobrada. Nowadays, the Porto region is equally known for the toasted sandwich known as a francesinha (little French). In Alto Alentejo (North Alentejo), there is a very typical dish made with lungs, blood and liver, of either pork or lamb. It's an Easter dish, but can be seen in every season of the year. Basically, the blood is boiled and cut into little pieces as the other parts, then the secret ingredients are added. In the <b>end,</b> <b>cover</b> the plate with bread that will soak with the liquid, some people also put mint and a slice of orange as decoration.Many other meat dishes feature in Portuguese cuisine. In the Bairrada area, a famous dish is Leitão à Bairrada (roasted suckling pig). Nearby, another dish, chanfana (goat slowly cooked in wine) is claimed by two towns, Miranda do Corvo ("Capital da Chanfana") and Vila Nova de Poiares ("Capital Universal da Chanfana").Carne de porco à alentejana, fried pork with clams, is a popular dish with a misleading name as it originated in the Algarve, not in Alentejo.Alcatra, beef marinated in red wine and garlic, then roasted, is a tradition of Terceira Island in the Azores.|$|E
40|$|<b>End</b> <b>cover</b> {{separation}} and shear crack debond {{are the two}} most critical debonding modes in beams retrofitted with fibre reinforced polymer composites due the brittle nature of the failures. However, these failures are still not fully understood.

Testing shows that <b>end</b> <b>cover</b> separation starts from FRP ends and fails in the form of shear failure at steel reinforcement level {{at the root of the}} concrete teeth between shear cracks.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to externally bonded FRP reinforcement, near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP reinforcement {{can be used to}} effectively improve the flexural performance of RC beams. In such FRP-strengthened RC beams, <b>end</b> <b>cover</b> separation failure is one of the common failure modes. This failure mode involves the detachment of the NSM FRP reinforcement together with the concrete cover along the level of the tension steel reinforcement. This paper presents a new strength model for <b>end</b> <b>cover</b> separation failure in RC beams strengthened in flexure with NSM FRP strips (i. e. rectangular FRP bars with a sectional height-to-thickness ratio not less than 5), which was formulated on the basis of extensive numerical results from a parametric study undertaken using an efficient finite element approach. The proposed strength model consists of an approximate equation for the debonding strain of the FRP reinforcement at the critical cracked section and a conventional section analysis to relate this debonding strain to the moment acting on the same section (i. e. the debonding strain). Once the debonding strain is known, the load level at <b>end</b> <b>cover</b> separation of an FRP-strengthened RC beam can be easily determined for a given load distribution. Predictions from the proposed strength model are compared with those of two existing strength models of the same type and available test results, which shows that the proposed strength model is in close agreement with test results and is far more accurate than the existing strength models.
