This primary enriched culture {{was used to}} examine the effect of acidophilic iron-oxidising bacteria on the stability of soluble gold (I) thiosulphate. Stationary phase cultures and separate components of the cultures (i. e., aqueous ferric iron, iron oxyhydroxide precipitates and non-mineralised bacterial cells) were exposed to gold (I) thiosulphate solutions forming different experimental-gold systems. These experimental systems rapidly removed gold from solutions containing 0. 002 mM– 20 mM gold thiosulphate. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the different culture fractions immobilised gold differently: the entire bacterial culture-gold systems precipitated 100 nm-size gold colloids; aqueous ferric iron–gold systems precipitated colloidal <b>gold</b> <b>sulphide</b> that ranged in diameter from 200 nm to 2 μm; iron oxyhydroxide-gold systems precipitated 5 nm-size <b>gold</b> <b>sulphide</b> colloids; and the bacteria-gold systems precipitated gold colloids ~ 2 nm in size along the bacterial cell envelope. Aqueous and solid ferric iron was critical in the destabilisation of the gold (I) thiosulphate complex. Analysis of the entire bacterial culture-, aqueous ferric iron- and iron oxyhydroxide-gold systems exposed to 2 mM gold using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy demonstrated that Au+ was immobilised from solution as <b>gold</b> <b>sulphide</b> (Au 2 S). The reaction between iron-oxidising bacteria and their ferric iron by-products with gold (I) thiosulphate demonstrated that thiosulphate ions would be an unstable gold complexing ligand in nature. Gold (I) thiosulphate is intuitively transformed into nanometer-scale <b>gold</b> <b>sulphide</b> or elemental gold within natural, acidic weathering environments with the potential to precipitate gold in jarosite that can subsequently be preserved in gossans over geological time...|$|E
40|$|Although {{bacterial}} leaching of sulphidic minerals {{is a well-known}} phenomenon, {{it is only in}} the last ten years that full-scale {{bacterial leaching}} plants have been commissioned for gold processing. In order for bacterial leaching to compete successfully with other pretreatment processes for refractory ores, particularly with established technologies such as roasting and pressure leaching, it needs to be efficient. This requires the optimization of the parameters affecting the leaching reaction and the growth of bacteria. The entire biotreatment process is agitation leaching, carried out in stirred reactors or Pachuca type reactors. The bacterial oxidation is a complex reaction involving gaseous, liquid and solid phases. The interactions are highly complex, and analysis is complicated by the presence of solids in the leaching medium. Inspite of the amount of research that has been performed, kinetic and process models are underdeveloped. Since kinetic data varies widely with the type and source of concentrate, experimental data should be generated before doing the full-scale reactor design. In sizing reactors for a commercial scale process, it would be useful to have a mathematical model that one could use to predict the amount and rate of release of metal, as a function of the various operating parameters of the system. G. R. Halli arsenical <b>gold</b> <b>sulphide</b> concentrate obtained from Hutti Gold Mines Ltd., Karnataka, was chosen for our study, because of its high refractoriness. An indegenous strain of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was used for biooxidation. The experiments were conducted in a well-agitated stirred tank reactor under controlled conditions. Sparged air was supplemented with carbon-dioxide for optimized growth. In this work, more than 90 % gold and 95 % silver could be recovered from the sulphidic gold concentrate when bioleaching was used ahead of cyanidation, compared to 40 % and 50 % by direct cyanidation. A generalized model, which accounts for both direct bacterial attack and indirect chemical leaching, has been proposed for the biooxidation of refractory gold concentrates. The bacterial balance, therefore, accounts for its growth both on solid substrate and in solution, and for the attachment to and detachment from the surface. The overall process is considered to consist of several sub-processes, each of which can be described in terms of a mechanism and related rate expressions. These sub-processes were studied seperately under kinetically controlled conditions. The key parameters appearing in the rate equations were evaluated using the experimental data. Since the refractory concentrate contains pyrite and arsenopyrite as the major leachable entities, leaching studies have been done on pure pyrite and arsenopyrite as test minerals and the key parameters in the rate equations are evaluated using this data. The model so developed is tested with the leaching kinetics of the concentrate. The growth of bacteria is dependent on the availability of the substrate, ferrous iron, and the dependence is modelled by the widely accepted Monod equation. The effect of carbon dioxide supplementation on the bacterial activity was studied and the optimal concentration for growth was found to be l%(v/v). Studies on indirect chemical leaching showed that the rate is sensitive to surface area of concentrate. Indirect rate constant of arsenopyrite was found to be greater than that of pyrite, since pyrite is more nobler than arsenopyrite. Conditions of direct leaching alone was obtained at high pulp density and using substrate adapted bacteria. The rate constant of arsenopyrite was found to be greater than that of pyrite. The parameters obtained were tested with the overall batch leaching data of the concentrate and favourable comparision was obtained. Thus, it has been possible to isolate the various simultaneous sub-processes occurring during the leaching and propose useful models to describe these processes in some detail. The model has been extended successfully to predict the continuous leaching behaviour using the parameters obtained from the batch data. Studies on the effect of residence time and pulp density on steady state behaviour showed that there is a critical residence time and pulp density below which washout conditions occur. The critical residence time at 10 % pulp density was found to be 11 hrs. Operation at pulp densities lower than 5 % and residence times lower than 72 hrs is not favourable for efficient leaching. Studies on the effect of initial ferric iron concentration showed that there exists an optimum concentration of ferric iron at which the time required to reach steady state is minimum...|$|E

These include iron formations, mixed chemical and clastic sediments, tuffaceous exhalites, and disseminated or massive sulphides in both volcanic-and sediment-dominated sequences. Gold-bearing iron formations and interflow metalliferous sediments associated with seafloor hydrothermal activity also have been implicated as potential source rocks for some nonstratabound gold deposits in ancient greenstone belts (Foster and Wilson, 1984; Keays, 1984). Recent studies of gold in volcanogenic massive sulphides indicate a strong genetic relationship between <b>gold</b> and <b>sulphide</b> mineralization in seafloor hydrothermal systems (Hannington and Scott, 1989; Large et al., 1989; Huston and Large, 1989).

40|$|Many gold {{treatment}} plants have sulphides and coarse particle gangue components that contain gold in their tailings (cyanide leach residues and flotation tailings).

The liberation characteristics of the <b>gold</b> in the <b>sulphide</b> and coarse gangue (gold liberation versus grind size) is {{the first and most}} important of the two.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Oberon {{is a relatively}} recently discovered gold prospect in the Tanami district approximately 600 km NW of Alice Springs, N. T. Petrographic, mineralogical and mineral chemical analysis of the gold-bearing horizons in drillhole TID 0065 has characterized the mineralisation with particular emphasis on gold distribution. Two mineralised horizons are identified. The ‘Upper’ zone contains semi-massive pyrite within a characteristic ‘Boudin Chert’ lithology and adjacent graphite schists. The ‘main’ mineralisation, towards {{the bottom of the}} drillhole, occurs within relatively low-sulphide calcareous turbidites of the ‘Puck’ sequence. The mineralogy of the gold mineralisation is simple. Arsenopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite are the dominant sulphides and occur both within multiple generations of quartz-carbonate veins and as disseminations in adjacent wallrock. There is widespread evidence for late <b>sulphide</b> recrystallization. <b>Gold</b> occurs as native gold. A population of fine-grained gold (1 - 10 microns) is seen within arsenopyrite, and more rarely in pyrite. ‘Exotic’ Au-bearing minerals such as Au-(Ag) -tellurides are not present. Laser-Ablation ICPMS analysis has established that invisible <b>gold</b> in <b>sulphides</b> plays a negligible role in terms of overall gold balance. ‘Residual’ gold concentrations in the central parts of arsenopyrite grains are {{no more than a few}} ppm; Au concentrations in pyrite are an order of magnitude lower still. There is, however, a marked enrichment in Au concentrations around the margins of arsenopyrite and in areas of intense fracturing and brecciation, with individual LA-ICPMS spot analyses giving up to several thousand ppm. This enrichment can be readily linked to grain-scale gold remobilization and reconcentration of lattice-bound <b>gold</b> during <b>sulphide</b> recrystallization. Using high-resolution Focussed Ion Beam-SEM imaging, this gold is revealed to occur as microfracture fillings and as fine particles and nanoparticles. This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of gold nanoparticles in an orogenic gold deposit. The Oberon deposit is metamorphosed at middle greenschist facies and displays both lithological and structural control. Mineralisation at Oberon shows broad similarities with that at Callie, but also a number of differences. Pyrite chemistry in the ‘Upper’ mineralisation is subtly different to that in the ‘Main’ mineralised level, leading to the conclusion that the former may represent authigenic (bacterially-mediated?) pyrite that formed in a euxenic or oxygen-starved environment. Such carbon- and iron-rich horizons provide a ready mechanism for gold precipitation from fluid via redox reaction. This contrasts with the clearly hydrothermal sulphide assemblage and associated chlorite alteration in the ‘main’ mineralised zone. Thesis (B. Sc.

Bacterial oxidative leaching may be an interesting alternative - low cost and environmentally friendly - to liberate <b>gold</b> from the <b>sulphide</b> matrix and then make it amenable to cyanidation. Bioleaching with Thiobacillus ferrooxidans has been investigated at 30 -degrees-C at bench scale on a gold-bearing arsenopyrite (2 g/t Au) ore coming from Golcuck Mine in Turkey. The study was concerned with {{the influence of the}} age of the inoculum, pH, pulp density and time of the bacterial leaching at 30 -degrees-C on the recovery of gold during the subsequent standard cyanide attack. Direct cyanide leaching of the arsenopyrite ground to - 74 mum showed no gold dissolution at all, but with fine grinding to - 30 mum, gold recovery increased to about 55. 3 % after 48 hours of cyanidation. On the contrary, cyanidation performed for 2 days on a bioleached arsenopyrite allowed 90 % of gold to be solubilized in 2 hours...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} defining a route for recovering precious metals {{from a very}} heterogeneous <b>gold</b> bearing <b>sulphide</b> and arsenide concentrate that was partially roasted and dumped by the 1960 s when Santo António mine closed. Gold occurs in this concentrate as free particles {{in the range of}} 10 - 100 µm, most of them still enclosed in the pyrite and arsenopyrite matrix. Its content varies from 20 to 150 g of Au/ton, being higher at the dump upper levels and in the finer concentrate fractions. Preliminary tests demonstrated the refractoriness of this product, since the leaching with conventional cyanide solutions and with other leaching solutions gave very low recoveries. How-ever, high concentrated cyanide solutions recover more than 60 % of Au, although with high NaCN and lime consumptions and poor settling characteristics. Iron was shown to be highly dissolved in these solutions. Some prior treatments clearly favoured the cyanidation process, in particular a roasting step. Thus, a large number of roasting experiments was carried out to define the most favourable conditions for recovering gold. However, no clear relationship between roasting conditions and gold dissolution was found due to the heterogeneity of the product and high variance of gold experimental recoveries. These recoveries were calculated considering gold contained in both the leaching residues and leachates, and uncertainties of these results are relatively high. Roasting the product at 450 - 700 °C for 1 h guarantees a high probability to dissolve at least 74 % Au in a highly concentrated NaCN solution stirred for 24 h. The 600 - 700 °C roasting range is clearly preferable for consuming less cyanide and lime. Pre-washing the roasted product seems not to reduce the cyanide consumption. Regarding the silver recovery, the NaCN and lime consumption are higher while using the products roasted at the lowest tested temperatures. Products roasted at higher temperatures have better settling performance...|$|R
40|$|The geodynamic {{evolution}} of the Central America {{is the result of}} complex interactions between the North American and South American plates, the Cocos plate and the evolving Caribbean plates, including minor crustal fragments as the Chortis block. The plates are delimited by important suture zones with continental transform faults. The central part of the Chortis block, is crossed, for more than 300 km, by the right lateral strike-slip Guayape fault. This structure is orientated NE-SW and present a strong morphological evidence of neotectonic activity. In the Canaan and Juticalpa valleys in Central Honduras, several intermountain basins bounded by extensional faults, are located along the fault strand. The region is characterized by ore deposits related to the Cenozoic magmatic activity which produced the volcanic arc extending from Guatemala to Costa Rica. In the studied area the <b>gold</b> and <b>sulphide</b> mineralizations are hosted within quartz veins of few decimetres thick, occurring in low grade metamorphic rocks, mainly well foliated graphitic and sericitic schists and quartzites. The veins are arranged in extensional meshes oriented NNW interlinked with the main strike-slip semi-brittle shear zones. The mineralization were produced by hydrothermal fluids probably related to shallow granitoid to granodiorite intrusions. Moreover these fluids are responsible for the strong alteration of the quartz veins host rocks. Foliation, fracturing and shearing of the host rocks are connected to the strike-slip faults which are the main factors controlling both the vein-formation and alteration phenomena, and providing favourable channel ways for fluid flows. The fluid inclusions of the quartz crystals are mainly constituted, at room temperature, by four types of acqueous and non-acqueous phases. The mineralizing fluids are constituted by H 2 O-NaCl-KCl- CO 2 with small amount of CH 4 (and S) and their temperatures are in the range of 300 - 400 °C. These data indicate an epigenetic gold deposits associated to an orogenic context where the strike slip faults, rooted in the crust, play an important role...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The uraninite-albite v ins of the Mistamisk area {{occur in}} the {{argillite}} member of the Dunphy Formation, which is near {{the base of the}} slightly meta-morphosed Lower Proterozoic sequence of the central Labrador Trough. The vein minerals are albite, uraninite, dolomite, and chlorite, and minor quantities of quartz, tellurides, <b>sulphides,</b> <b>gold,</b> and organic material. Pitch-blende and calcite are related to late remobilization. The veins were deposited in fractures by hydrothermal solutions, and metasomatism caused albitization of wall rocks. Fluid inclusions have an unusual composition, described {{here for the first time}} in connection with soda-metasomatism; the aqueous olution of the inclu-sions is oversaturated in NaC 1 and contains Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and the gas phase mostly consists of N 2, CO and CO 2. The presence of hematite and absence of hydro-carbons indicates that the vein-forming solution was oxidizing. The temperature and pressure of vein formation, esti-mated from fluid inclusion data, was 300 ~ ~ and 2. 5 kbar respectively consistent with the composition of the phengite which is a common metamorphic mineral of the host rock. Vein emplacement occurred in the waning stages of the Hudsonian Orogeny, the hydro-thermal solution possibly originating by metamorphism of sodic schists of the Mistamisk area, which are possibly of evaporitic origin...|$|R
40|$|Glauconite occurs {{either as}} {{unaltered}} greenish or as altered brownish variety in Upper Cretaceous-Palaeocene sediments {{in the southeastern}} corner of Western Siberia. Studied section within the Bakchar iron-ore deposit includes Ipatovo, Slavgorod, Gan'kino and Lyulinvor formations, which are represented by sandstones, siltstones, claystones and oolitic ironstones of coastal-marine fades. The origin of unaltered glauconite is explained by the "verdissement theory". Transgressions during Lower Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian favored the formation of unaltered glauconites in dysoxic to anoxic conditions. Subaerial exposure of glauconite resulted in leaching of potassium, oxidation of iron and formation of iron hydroxides in Upper Coniacian, Maastrichtian and Palaeocene. Glauconite ultimately converts to leptochlorite and hydrogoethite by this alteration. Abundant microscopic <b>gold</b> inclusions, besides <b>sulphides,</b> sulphates, oxides and silicates characterize this glauconite. Mineral inclusions include precious, rare metals and non-ferrous metals. The concentration of gold in glauconite may {{be as high as}} 42. 9 ppb. Abundant inclusions of various compositions in glauconites indicate enrichment of marine sediments in precious and non-precious metals. While major element composition of glauconites is affected by subaerial exposure, the broadly similar micro-inclusions in both altered and unaltered varieties are possibly related to the comparatively immobile nature of REE and trace elements.
