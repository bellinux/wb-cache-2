The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|Jalaja {{reveals the}} love story of Malliswari and Nagaraju to Tirumaladevi. She also reveals that Malliswari denied {{any help from}} her and instead chose to die along with Nagaraju. The next morning, the hanging nooses are kept ready and the duo meet Krishnadevaraya before killing them. When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends his action and reminds Nagaraju that {{it was he who}} <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> send Malliswari to Rani Vasam. Krishnadevaraya forgives both Nagaraju and Malliswari, and their {{marriage}} is conducted in a grand manner at the palace.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted {{by most of the}} princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also {{believed that}} he would {{be in a position to}} ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E

Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, {{on the basis of}} his alleged 1968 discussions with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party's leaders who <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay away.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Lombard's death, Gable, who was inconsolable and {{devastated by}} his loss, joined the United States Army Air Forces. Lombard <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do that {{numerous}} times after the United States had entered World War II. After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit {{attached to a}} B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself. In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named after Carole Lombard would be launched. Gable attended {{the launch of the}} SS Carole Lombard on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of Lombard's record-breaking war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety.|$|E

25|$|Belu Zilber {{claimed that}} having himself {{been subject to}} {{suspicion}} and marginalisation, he had attempted to warn Pătrășcanu {{of the change in}} climate, and <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> consider fleeing the Eastern Bloc, only to be stiffly rebuffed. Zilber was eventually arrested in February 1948, on suspicion that he had been a Siguranța Statului agent infiltrating the party.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 {{he volunteered}} {{to serve in}} the First World War. Paul Kruchen, his mentor from his time in Berlin, <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> assist in a {{reconstruction}} program for East Prussia. In 1919, after the war, Scharoun assumed responsibility for its office as a freelance architect in Breslau (Wrocław). There and in Insterburg (Chernyakhovsk), he realised numerous projects and organised art exhibitions, such as the first exhibition of the expressionist group of artists, Die Brücke, in East Prussia.|$|E
25|$|Hanam Sunim {{was in the}} Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922, {{and later}} just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926. He left then and, perhaps {{intending}} {{to return to the}} Diamond Mountains, wound up staying in the Odae Mountains, at Sangwon Temple. (This would have been on his path to the Diamond Mountains.) As he was a very well known teacher, {{it seems likely that the}} monks at the nearby large temple, Woljeong Temple, <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay and teach.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad was {{eventually}} killed on 12 March 2015, {{when he was}} either ambushed and shot by a rival or killed during another dispute. After his death, his followers reportedly brought his body to the frontline at Doreen in northern Latakia {{and went on to}} claim that he had died fighting rebels. A Free Syrian Army senior commander however denied that rebel forces had killed Muhammad. According to a Syrian Army soldier Muhammad had been killed just after the government <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> form a paramilitary unit.|$|E
25|$|Chappell's first {{overseas}} tour as {{the coach}} of the Indian team was to Zimbabwe in September 2005. Sourav Ganguly, the Indian captain, scored a century in the first Test match and later alleged that the coach Chappell <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> step down as captain {{on the eve of the}} game. This was widely covered by the Indian media. Ganguly was later dropped from the Indian cricket team by the selectors on the grounds of poor form, but many in the media suggested his omission was influenced by the previous row with Chappell.|$|E

25|$|Sulla left Rome and {{travelled}} to {{the army}} waiting in Nola, the army that the Senate <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> lead against Mithridates. Sulla urged his legions to defy the assembly's orders and accept him as their rightful leader. Sulla was successful and the legions stoned the representatives from the assembly. Sulla then commanded six legions to march with him to Rome and institute a civil war. This was a momentous event, and was unforeseen by Marius, as no Roman army had ever marched upon Rome—it was forbidden by law and ancient tradition.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal {{began in}} 1766, and when its {{engineer}} James Brindley died in 1772, Henshall {{was given the}} post.

He did not immediately take up engineering, even though the Chester Canal <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work for them in 1776, but instead became a partner with Henshall in a canal carrying business, running boats on the Trent and Mersey Canal. The date of his second marriage to Margaret is not known, but is thought to be around this time.|$|E
