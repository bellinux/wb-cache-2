5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on <b>enclosed</b> <b>pastures,</b> the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{deposition}} of radiocaesium from the Chernobyl accident {{the movement and}} slaughter of sheep in upland areas of west Cumbria, Scotland and Wales was restricted. Studies on the radioecology of Cs- 137 and Cs- 134 have been conducted at a farm within the affected area of west Cumbria since July 1986. The radiocaesium activity of uplandsheep was found to decline when they were brought on to the farms' <b>enclosed</b> <b>pastures</b> and rise when they were returned to the open fell, where the radiocaesium content of vegetation has remained higher than on the pastures. The Cs- 137 activity concentration of mixed grassland vegetation samples from the fell has declined over the study period, whereas the Cs- 137 activity of ewes whilst grazing on the fell was higher in summer of 1987 than in autumn 1986. A number of factors which {{may have contributed to}} this discrepancy were investigated and are discussed.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a new non-disturbance policy on Schiermonnikoog (Dutch Wadden Sea islands) provided an experiment to test ideas concerning the switch between habitats by spring-staging Dark-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla and Barnacle Geese B. leucopsis. In the experimental years (2000 and 2001) the farmers desisted from all scaring activities in the <b>enclosed</b> <b>pasture</b> area (290 ha) with grasslands intensively managed for dairy farms. The adjoining salt marsh (1635 ha) already was afforded complete protection, and traditionally provided the main goose feeding area in spring. A traditional habitat switch to the marsh coincides with the spring increase of forage production in the marsh habitat, suggesting that forage availability on the marsh is limiting in early spring. Compared to three control years (1997, 98 and 99 with scaring in the pastures) both species of geese extended their usage of the agricultural habitat in the two non-scaring years, where they remained until migratory departure (Apr for the Barnacle Geese, late May for the Dark-bellied Brent). Numbers of geese on the salt marsh did not change, hence non-disturbance triggered an increase of capacity for spring feeding geese at this staging site. The change was most dramatic for the Dark-bellied Brent Goose with a doubling of numbers on the island in the years without scaring, and identification of ringed individuals showed that the birds recruiting to this new spring tradition had in previous seasons utilised other sites in the Dutch Wadden Sea...|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} re-evaluate {{the history and}} {{importance}} {{of one of the}} most important processes to have shaped the English cultural landscape in the last one thousand years. It emphasises the diversity of the enclosure experience through space and time, and attempts to identify some general ‘rules’ which help explain what happened. It also challenges some recent scholars who view enclosure as a unified, structuring process. The article begins by describing the different forms of enclosure; the distinction between piecemeal and general enclosure, and the various forms that general enclosure could take. It challenges the over-sharp distinction drawn in the past between ‘champion’ and ‘ancient’ countryside. It identifies two main phases of agricultural change – from late medieval times until 1700, and from 1700 to 1900 – and links these to the enclosure history of different regions, pointing out, for instance, the great early modern shift from arable to <b>enclosed</b> <b>pasture</b> in the Midlands that produced the familiar ridge and furrow earthworks which were, until recently, a ubiquitous feature of the region. The article establishes two general principles: firstly, the ease with which enclosure was achieved was closely connected to the nature of existing landholding patterns, and secondly, that before 1700 most enclosure was associated with a conversion to permanent pasture. It also proposes a modified chronology for enclosure. Finally the article explores the social and ideological causes and implications of the enclosed landscape: its expression of paternalistic social concerns, the landed elite’s desire for prestige, and order – a landscape that was diametrically opposed to the commons, the democratic abode of ‘undesirable elements’ and the poor. It takes issue however, with the view that enclosure caused the decline in the fortunes of the rural poor and the small farmers. The article concludes by setting out a new agenda for landscape historians, one based on the analysis of the enclosure history of ecologically distinct regions and areas...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{welfare in}} Sweden {{has gone through}} major changes during the later years. In 2004, Swedish Animal Welfare Agency took over the central {{responsibility}} for the animal welfare from the Swedish Board of Agriculture, and in 2007 the board again became the central authority for animal welfare in Sweden. Even the practical supervision has changed, from the 1 of January 2009 the supervision is to be performed by the county administrative boards, instead of by the individual municipalities. Since 2006 every horse in the European Union has to have an identification card, in Sweden called a “horse passport” which describes the color and markings of the horse {{as well as any}} veterinary treatments. The ELOF-project, a collaborative project between the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the county administrative boards, intends to make the animal welfare supervision effective, standardised, fair and risk-based. Because of the takeover of the supervision and of the ELOF-project the Örebro County Administrative Board has began to make an inventory of the number of horses and horsefarms in the county. Another Ethology and Animal Welfare-student and I did, in collaboration with the county administrative board created a checklist that in connection with the inventory will lead to a risk-based animal welfare supervision. Apart from number of horses at each farm, the checklist brings up subjects as number of horses per enclosure, condition of the horses, lameness or other injuries, type and condition of fences, use of barbed wire in fences, pasture surface condition, access to shelter from wind and the general impressions of the farm according to risk factors as for example garbage outside the <b>enclosed</b> <b>pasture.</b> Two paragraphs soon to be enforced, the horse´s right to perform its social behaviour, preferably through contacts with other horses (applied fromAugust 1, 2009) and the ban of barbed wire in pasture enclosures for horses (applied from January 1, 2010) make these issues important to consider in the checklist. The inventory was performed in the munincipality of Degerfors, one of several munincipalities where the county administrative board felt it had insufficient knowledge of the number of horses. Using control list, car, maps and GPS-navigator the inventory took place during a few weeks weeks in March and April 2009. During the inventory we also had access to a property register, the map system Kartogis and an already existing animal keeper register...|$|E

The crown, and Lord Chancellors like Sir Thomas More, had opposed this to some extent, with a series of Anti-Enclosure Acts from 1489. These required that any houses destroyed be rebuilt, but if not half the additional profits would go to the Crown. The Crown itself claimed an inherent right to any valuable metals found on land in 1568, and people who had less than four acres of land were prohibited from building homes by the Erection of Cottages Act 1588. The final, formal end of feudal land tenure in England came only after the English Civil War. When the monarchy was restored Parliament ensured with the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 that landlords' obligations of service and military provision were replaced by monetary payments and an annual payment financed by taxation.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on what impact stall {{confinement}} has on a horse’s mental and physical welfare. It was {{of great interest to}} get a gathered picture of how Swedish horseowners had experienced having their horses in stall confinement. A survey study was conducted to achieve this. The survey included twelve questions which for example investigated the horses’ age at the time of stall confinement, the length of stall confinement and their sexes. Furthermore the type of stabling, type of bedding, feeding regimes, amount of stimulance and the development of issues among the horses during their stall confinements were topics also investigated in the essay. A majority of the horses did not develop or suffered from any issues according to the owners, but there were still those who did. The most common issues were those classified as “others” in the essay. Aggression, apathy/depression, anxiety and scraping with front hooves inside the stable were examples of these types of issues. The results also showed {{that a majority of the}} horses did not receive any type of stimulation (for example toys, haynet and tricktraining) during their stall confinement. Another result showed that a third of the horses were not accompanied by another horse during their stall confinements. Many horses were alone during the day when the other horses in the stable were turned out in <b>enclosed</b> <b>pastures.</b> The main conclusion drawn from the compilation of this thesis is that nursing care surrounding horses in stall confinement is essential for their physical and mental welfare. A recognition concerning this being a specific task for veterinary nurses also grew and matured during the writing of the thesis. It was also established that further research is required. Such research should focus on investigation and evaluation of different treatment measures that can be used with the purpose to increase the welfare of horses in stall confinement. The long term aim of such research is to develop nursingprotocols specifically for horses in stall confinement, wich have a scientific base and could be used in equine health care...|$|R
