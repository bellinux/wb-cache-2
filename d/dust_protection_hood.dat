40|$|Lunar dust is pervasive, and {{requirements}} for <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> will affect both hardware design and operations planning for lunar surface systems. On Earth, mechanical {{problems caused by}} particulates include erosive and abrasive effects, clogging of mechanical equipment, and impairment of seals and bonds. In addition, dust tends to degrade the heat rejection properties of contaminated surfaces. All these effects have been observed on the lunar surface as well. This paper discusses the potential applicability of current <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> methods {{to the problem of}} <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> for the environmental control and life support (ECLS) systems of a lunar base, and highlights areas where development may be necessary. A review of dust problems experienced during the Apollo missions and of additional, ground-based experience with lunar dust provides a baseline for identifying operations and areas where dust may be expected to affect the ECLS systems. Current Earth-based methods of <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> are identified and the impact of differences between the Earth and lunar environments on these methods is evaluated. Finally, integration of <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> equipment with ECLS systems equipment is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Another {{operational}} area is fire protection, {{for instance in}} chemical industry or rescue in the mining industry, where need for a long use duration forbids use of compressed air sets. Advancements in rebreather design include special more-or-less complex gas proportioning and control devices, allowing use even deeper and even longer, for work divers, than emergency breathing sets {{and the type of}} sport diving called technical diving. Today's escape sets are combined with lifejackets and <b>protection</b> <b>hoods</b> to protect the head and breathing organs from being overpowered by water. They are used with thermal protection suits similar to the well-known scuba diving drysuits. Use is nevertheless limited to comparatively small depths; escape capsules and rescue submarines and emergency lift devices and droppable ballast provide safety in deeper water.|$|R

50|$|Special {{attention}} {{needs to}} be given to safety as related to fire sprinklers when <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> is installed as a ceiling. A sprinkler impairment plan or solution {{needs to be}} discussed with the safety officer, the building insurance company and the local Fire Marshall prior to any interior protection system installation. Installing the interior protection above the sprinklers is not a solution as a fire could cause a localized hole directly above the fire and this hole would act as a vent trapping the heat above the fire sprinklers or the heat could cause the protection to droop onto sprinkler head thus covering the spray head reducing the effectiveness of the water spray.|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{cooperated with}} 3 M Company {{in the design}} and testing of a new {{environmentally}} controlled primary crusher operator booth at the company's Wausau granite quarry near Wausau, WI. This quarry had an older crusher booth without a central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and without an air filtration and pressurization system. A new replacement operator booth was designed and installed by 3 M based on design considerations from past NIOSH research on enclosed cab filtration systems. NIOSH conducted pre-testing of the old booth and post-testing of the new booth to assess the new filtration and pressurization system's effectiveness in controlling airborne dusts and particulates. The booth's dust and particulate control effectiveness is described by its protection factor, expressed as a ratio of the outside to inside concentrations measured during testing. Results indicate that the old booth provided negligible airborne respirable <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> and low particulate protection from the outside environment. The newly installed booth provided average respirable <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> factors from 2 to 25 over five shifts of dust sampling with occasional worker ingress and egress from the booth, allowing some unfiltered contaminants to enter the enclosure. Shorter-term particle count testing outside and inside the booth under near-steady-state conditions, with no workers entering or exiting the booth, resulted in protection factors from 35 to 127 on 0. 3 - to 1. 0 - respirable size particulates under various HVAC airflow operating conditions.

Static and dynamic tests using tracer gas were conducted in a full-scale model and under-ground to measure the effectiveness of exhaust face ventilation for various deep-cutting mine and spray configurations. When compared to a lO-ft primary ventilation brattice, the extended-cut spray system consistently provided better face ventilation at all configurations up to and including a 40 -ft brattice setback.

5|$|In May 1793, Nelson sailed {{as part of}} a {{division}} under the command of Vice Admiral William Hotham, joined later in the month by the rest of Lord Hood's fleet. The force initially sailed to Gibraltar and, with the intention of establishing naval superiority in the Mediterranean, made their way to Toulon, anchoring off the port in July. Toulon was largely under the control of moderate republicans and royalists, but was threatened by the forces of the National Convention, which were marching on the city. Short of supplies and doubting their ability to defend themselves, the city authorities requested that Hood take it under his <b>protection.</b> <b>Hood</b> readily acquiesced and sent Nelson to carry dispatches to Sardinia and Naples requesting reinforcements. After delivering the dispatches to Sardinia, Agamemnon arrived at Naples in early September. There Nelson met Ferdinand IV, King of Naples, followed by the British ambassador to the kingdom, William Hamilton. At some point during the negotiations for reinforcements, Nelson was introduced to Hamilton's new wife, Emma Hamilton. The negotiations were successful, and 2,000 men and several ships were mustered by mid-September. Nelson put to sea in pursuit of a French frigate, but on failing to catch her, sailed for Leghorn, and then to Corsica. He arrived at Toulon on 5 October, where he found that a large French army had occupied the hills surrounding the city and was bombarding it. Hood still hoped the city could be held if more reinforcements arrived, and sent Nelson to join a squadron operating off Cagliari.|$|R

40|$|Miners at noncoal {{surface mining}} {{operations}} are often exposed {{to high levels}} of respirable dust. In an effort to lower the respirable dust exposure of these surface miners, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been conducting research to address this problem in a practical and economically viable manner. One successful effort deals with lowering the dust exposure of equipment operators in enclosed cabs. Many types of surface mining equipment utilize enclosed cabs to protect equipment operators from dust exposure. Normally when the equipment is new, the cabs are fairly airtight. These tightly sealed cabs, combined with good filtration systems, generally provide the operator with good <b>dust</b> <b>protection.</b> However, most mining equipment is older, and as aging occurs, many components of the enclosure deteriorate. The structural integrity of the cab diminishes and the effectiveness of the air filtration system fails. NIOSH has been successfully researching costs-effective methods to improve both filtration effectiveness and cab integrity of these older cabs in order to provide a healthier work environment for equipment operators. Dust sampling records indicate that drill operators and helpers have the highest dust exposure of all workers at surface mining operations. Since much of the overburden contains a high percentage of silica, the health hazard associated with this dust can be even more serious. NIOSH research is addressing techniques to lower respirable dust levels at surface drilling operations.
