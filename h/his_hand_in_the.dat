5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|France won {{the bronze}} {{medal in the}} 2005 FIBA EuroBasket, by {{defeating}} the Spanish national team 98–68 in the bronze medal game. As {{the captain of the}} French national team since 2003, Parker was slated to lead France at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but he was unable to play after breaking a finger when he caught <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jersey of a Brazilian national team player in France's final warm up for the tournament. During the EuroBasket 2007, Parker averaged 20.1 points per game and 2.8 assists per game in nine tournament games, but France was defeated in the quarter-finals by the Russian national team. He passed the 2010 FIBA World Championship to recover fully from some injuries he had during the 2009–10 NBA season. Parker returned to the team in 2011, and France reached the finals of the 2011 EuroBasket, losing to Spain. Parker also joined the team for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In 2013, Parker and the French national team won the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket tournament.|$|E

5|$|When Thorpe {{broke the}} 200m {{freestyle}} Olympic {{record in the}} heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, van den Hoogenband showed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1min 45.35s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100m mark just 0.04s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1min 45.83s, {{the first time that}} he had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe though would never again lose to Van Den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4×200m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7min 07.05s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4×100m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine.|$|E

25|$|Cutolo overplayed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cirillo affair. His former {{political}} protectors {{turned and}} provided their support to his main rival Carmine Alfieri. When his main 'military' chief, Vincenzo Casillo {{was killed in}} January 1983 by the allies of Alfieri, it was clear Cutolo had lost the war. His power declined considerably. Not only Cutolo but many other Camorra gangs understood the shift {{in the balance of}} power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri. His sister who ran the business was arrested in 1993. He was moved to a prison on the island Asinara, far away from Naples and his ability to communicate with the outside was severely restricted when the harsh 41-bis prison regime was imposed upon him.|$|E
25|$|Duanne Olivier {{was added}} to South Africa's squad {{following}} the second Test to replace Kyle Abbott, who earlier had quit international cricket to sign for the English team Hampshire as a Kolpak player. Nuwan Pradeep fractured <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first T20I match and was ruled out {{of the rest of}} the tour. Following the second T20I, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Pradeep and Danushka Gunathilaka all left Sri Lanka's squad. Pradeep and Gunathilaka suffered injuries, while Mathews left on personal grounds. Dinesh Chandimal was named the captain of the side in Mathews' absence. Lungi Ngidi was ruled out of the ODI series because of an abdominal injury. On the day before the first ODI, Sri Lanka dropped Isuru Udana, Thikshila de Silva and Seekkuge Prasanna replacing them with Lahiru Kumara, Vikum Sanjaya and Jeffrey Vandersay. David Miller was ruled out of the final three ODI matches after suffering a finger injury.|$|E

25|$|Hugh's {{power in}} Italy was damaged but not {{destroyed}} by these events. To strengthen <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affairs of Milan, he tonsured his younger illegitimate son, Tebald, to groom {{him for the}} position of Archbishop of Milan; however, the ancient cleric, Arderic, whom he installed pro tem lived another twenty-two years. He continued to organise {{the fight against the}} Magyars and the Andalusian pirates based at Fraxinet in Provence. Active, if sometimes dubious, diplomacy paid off. He concluded a treaty with Rudolph in 933 by which Rudolf abandoned his claims to Italy in return for being handed Provence over the heads of Louis the Blind's heirs and the marriage of Rudolph's daughter Adelaide to Hugh's son Lothair. Friendly relations were maintained with the Byzantine Empire and, in 942, Hugh even came to terms with Alberic, who married one of Hugh's daughters.|$|E
25|$|Scourby kept <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theater {{by doing}} summer stock {{and a wide}} variety of other {{seasonal}} productions. In Maurice Evans' production of Hamlet, which opened at the St. James Theatre in New York on October 12, 1938 and ran for ninety-six performances, Scourby played Rosencrantz. Later in the same season he appeared with Evans in Henry IV, Part 1 as the Earl of Westmoreland. The following year, he toured with Evans in Richard II as one of the hirelings of the king. He returned to Broadway years later in late 1946, replacing Ruth Chatterton as the narrator in Ben Hecht's A Flag Is Born, a one-act, dramatic pageant in which Marlon Brando had one of his early stage roles. The play was produced by the American League for a Free Palestine, at the Alvin Theatre. On December 22, 1947, he opened with John Gielgud in Rodney Ackland's dramatization of Crime and Punishment at the National Theatre in New York. He was a co-founder of New Stages, a drama company that went into operation in a small theater on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village during the 1947-48 season. During its two-year existence, the company presented works by such artists as Federico García Lorca (Blood Wedding), Edward Caulfield (Bruno and Sidney) and two plays by Jean-Paul Sartre.|$|E

Bhuvneshwar Kumar was added to India's squad {{for the last three}} Tests, while Gautam Gambhir was dropped. Due to thigh strain Wriddhiman Saha missed the third Test. Parthiv Patel was called up as his replacement. K. L. Rahul and Hardik Pandya got injured while training in the nets at the PCA Stadium. Pandya was released from the squad, however, Rahul is expected to be fit for the fourth Test. England's Haseeb Hameed injured <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third Test and went home to undergo surgery on it. Keaton Jennings was named as Hameed's replacement and Liam Dawson replaced Zafar Ansari, who injured his back. Ishant Sharma was released from the squad for the fourth Test for his wedding and rejoined the squad for the last Test. Saha also missed the last two Tests as he has not recovered fully from injury. Ajinkya Rahane missed the final two Tests of the series due to a finger injury. He was replaced by Manish Pandey. Shardul Thakur was added to India's squad as cover for Mohammed Shami who had a sore knee. Alex Hales was ruled out of the remaining limited-overs fixtures after he fractured his hand during the second ODI. Jonny Bairstow was named as Hales' replacement for the T20I fixtures. Ahead of the T20I series, India rested Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, replacing them with Amit Mishra and Parvez Rasool.|$|E

500|$|Zakaria Mohieddin, who was Nasser's vice president, {{said that}} Nasser {{gradually}} changed during his reign.

Although Nasser repeatedly said [...] that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game [...] "but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent could see <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces" [...] and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. [...] "All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967".|$|E
500|$|During a {{match with}} Garrison Cade on Heat, Benjamin punched Cade's knee brace, [...] {{breaking}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process and briefly taking {{him out of}} action.

Benjamin won the match, giving him his first singles title in the company. During his reign as Intercontinental Champion, Benjamin retained the title against challengers such as Christian at Survivor Series, Maven at New Year's Revolution, and Chris Jericho at Backlash. Benjamin lost the title to Carlito when he debuted on Raw (Carlito used the ropes during the pinfall.) during the June 20, 2005 episode, ending the longest Intercontinental Championship reign of the decade at 244 days.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} against Liverpool, {{played at the}} Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Arsenal began the {{brighter}} of the two teams, before being denied two penalty shouts – one involving Stéphane Henchoz, who cleared Henry's shot with <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 72nd minute, Arsenal took a [...] "deserved" [...] lead, when Pirès played Ljungberg clean through to round goalkeeper Sander Westerveld and shoot. Liverpool equalised nine minutes after, through a Gary McAllister free-kick, which was not cleared properly by Arsenal; Michael Owen [...] "waited for the loose ball to come down before drilling a rebound into Seaman's bottom right corner". Owen scored in the 88th minute, outpacing both Adams and Dixon to shoot {{the ball into the}} bottom right corner of the goalnet.

Finally, the set is completely dismantled, and still in his chair, Shatner, as Captain Kirk, makes a final entry into his log recalling his previous three years of space exploration, concluding: [...] "And except for one television network, we have found intelligence everywhere in the galaxy."

500|$|...

Hemingway's use of counterpoint is evident when, for example, at the end, Nick trails his hand in lake water that [...] "felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning". Paul Strong believes the deleted section may have provided context and additional counterpoint to the plot, with Nick's aloneness in the [...] "stillness of the night" [...] juxtaposed against the middle scene, crowded with people. Paul Smith writes that by cutting the piece, Hemingway focuses on the story's central point: the life and death initiation rituals, familiar to the residents of the Indian camp but alien to young Nick.
