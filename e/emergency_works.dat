Roosevelt, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), converged on what had formerly been Chickasaw Nation property in 1933, to begin construction on Lake Murray State Park. It was the first state park built in Oklahoma and is still the largest. At the same time, workers began construction on the castle-looking building later to be called Tucker Tower. During construction, almost 17,000 men worked on the park project for $1.25 a day in wages. The lake was completed in 1937 and opened to the public in 1938. But work on the tower ceased in 1935, reportedly because federal officials decided the project was taking too long to complete and costing too much. And so without windows, doors, floors, or ceilings, the tower was left open to the public and elements. It had been built based on photographs of a European castle taken during World War I by veteran Sen. Fred Tucker, a local legislator for whom the tower is named. Fishing, boating and all water sports are allowed at Lake Murray. Lake Murray Lodge offers guest rooms and suites, cabins, meeting space, The Apple Bin restaurant, and the Parlor. Other activities include boating, swimming, fishing, golfing, picnics, camping, horseback riding, hayrides, hiking, biking, rollerblading, miniature golf and paddle boating.

40|$|Subject of Research. The {{processes}} of live migration without shared storage with pre-copy approach and move migration are researched. Migration of virtual machines {{is an important}} opportunity of virtualization technology. It enables applications to move transparently with their runtime environments between physical machines. Live migration becomes noticeable technology for efficient load balancing and optimizing the deployment of virtual machines to physical hosts in data centres. Before the advent of live migration, only network migration (the so-called, «Move»), has been used, that entails stopping the virtual machine execution while copying to another physical server, and, consequently, unavailability of the service. Method. Algorithms of live migration without shared storage with pre-copy approach and move migration of virtual machines are reviewed {{from the perspective of}} research of migration time and unavailability of services at migrating of virtual machines. Main Results. Analytical models are proposed predicting migration time of virtual machines and unavailability of services at migrating with such technologies as live migration with pre-copy approach without shared storage and move migration. In the latest works on the time assessment of unavailability of services and migration time using live migration without shared storage experimental results are described, that are applicable to draw general conclusions about the changes of time for unavailability of services and migration time, but not to predict their values. Practical Significance. The proposed models can be used for predicting the migration time and time of unavailability of services, for example, at implementation of preventive and <b>emergency</b> <b>works</b> on the physical nodes in data centres...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{surveying}} and recording the cultural property is increasing {{every day and}} is demanding proper answers from experts and scientists. The answer to such a problem must be based {{in the use of}} photogrammetry and other new technologies whose use must be widely extended. Experts in such technics are not enough in number for solving the problem. This means that they can’t take on their shoulders the responsibility of the complete task. The real problem today for the developing of the use of photogrammetry lies in training the people able to operate those systems: Architects, archeologists, art historians, curators, draftsmen and technicians in general. Photogrammetry should be promoted and taught to these professionals, not as a sophisticated and complex systems requiring costly instruments and specialized technicians, but as a methodology that is accessible today to most of professionals and which is not as costly as it was before. Photogrammetry can contribute not only with precision, but specially with speed and efficiency regarding to documentation; It is an ideal system for producing 3 D models, for creating data bases, and offering efficient solutions in emergency cases, etc. There are here some examples of the use of digital photogrammetry based on systems and methods which make possible to operate reducing the working time in the site, and operating very light and inexpensive equipment.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the current fitness of an area ambulance service based in Belfast and to quantify the physiological demands of accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>work.</b> From a total staff of 230, 105 (46 %) volunteered to undergo a series of fitness tests subject to health state. Results based on body mass indices showed that 52 % of subjects could be classified as overweight and 10 % of subjects as obese. Fitness levels were similar to other comparable samples and showed the expected but not inevitable decrease with age. A simple work related task (walking at 6 km/h) performed in the laboratory showed that 54 % of men over 40 years of age and 24 % under 40 found it taxing. This would favour selection for accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>work</b> on the basis of functional capacity rather than chronological age. Accident and <b>emergency</b> <b>work</b> consisted of long periods of inactivity interspersed with shorter periods of relatively intense activity, often above the anaerobic threshold.
