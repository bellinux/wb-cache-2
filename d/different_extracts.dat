40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} <b>different</b> <b>extracting</b> solutions {{for the removal of}} phenanthrene, lead and zinc from a contaminated soil obtained from a former manufactured gas plant site. The field soil contained 50 %– 88 % sand, 11 %– 35 % fines, 2. 7 %– 3. 7 % organic matter and high concentrations of phenanthrene (260 mg/kg), lead (50. 6 mg/kg) and zinc (84. 4 mg/kg). A series of batch extraction experiments were conducted using the field soil with <b>different</b> <b>extracting</b> solutions at various concentrations to investigate the removal efficiency and to optimize the concentration of each extractant. The results showed that removal efficiencies of different flushing systems were significantly influenced by their affinity and selectivity for the contaminants in the soil matrix. Non-ionic surfactants (Igepal CA 720 and Tween 80) were found to be effective in removing phenanthrene, but they were ineffective in removing lead and zinc. Chelating agents (ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid, EDTA and diethylene triamine penta acetic acid, DTPA) and selected acids were effective in removing lead and zinc, but they were ineffective for the phenanthrene removal. Co-solvents and cyclodextrins were not effective for removal of any of the contaminants. A sequential use of the 0. 2 M EDTA followed by 5 % Tween 80 or 5 % Tween 80 followed by 1 M citric acid was found to be effective for the removal of lead, zinc, and phenanthrene. Overall, it can be concluded that sequential use of <b>different</b> <b>extracting</b> solutions is required for the removal of both heavy metals and organics from field contaminated silty sand soils...|$|R
