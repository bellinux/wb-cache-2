5000|$|The Hot Rod Deluxe is an all tube combo amp {{rated at}} 40 watts. It {{utilizes}} a single 12-inch speaker, typically a Special Design Eminence Legend 125 Speaker. The Hot Rod Deluxe is a mono-channel amplifier featuring 3 switchable gain levels: [...] "Clean", [...] "Drive", and [...] "More Drive" [...] selectable {{on either the}} control panel or footswitch (if plugged in). Other features include a Bass, Middle, and Treble EQ, Master Volume, Presence, Normal/Bright, and spring reverb (solid state for both the driver and the recovery circuits). Footswitch and <b>External</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>jacks</b> are also built in.|$|E
5000|$|Controls - Physical {{controls}} (specifically on the Minitor III) {{include an}} [...] "A,B,C,D" [...] function knob, a power/volume knob, reset button, voice playback button, <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>jack,</b> and an amber and red LED. Depending on the model, the selection on the function knobs may do different things.|$|R
5000|$|Both the 212 and 410 feature three {{channels}}: normal, drive, {{and more}} drive. These channels are selectable via the [...] "Channel Select" [...] and [...] "More Drive" [...] buttons {{on either the}} control panel or footswitch (included), and they share EQ. Other features include a Bass, Middle, and Treble EQ, Master Volume, Presence, Normal/Bright switch, standby switch, preamp out and return for an effects loop configuration, and a Fender long-spring reverb (solid state for both the driver and the recovery circuits). An <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>jack</b> is located next to the output tubes {{in the back and}} allows the signal to be heard out of both the amplifier itself and the speakers to which it is connected (which must have a 4- or 8-Ohm impedance).|$|R
50|$|This {{version is}} very similar in {{cosmetics}} with the previous one but it introduces, for the first time, a full tube tremolo in a modern twin amp. The front panel contains (left to right): a single input, clean channel controls (volume, bright switch, treble, middle, bass), distorted channel controls (volume, treble, middle, bass, master volume, channel select), and shared controls (reverb, tremolo speed and intensity, presence). The rear panel contains power and stand by switches, output power switch (100W or 25W), effect send level, effect loop switch, return level, preamp out, power amp in, footswitch jack, tube bias adjustment and balancing, <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>jack,</b> main <b>speaker</b> <b>jack.</b> The footswitch has four buttons that allow to select the channel, bypass or engage the effect loop, switch the tremolo on/off, switch the reverb on/off. The tremolo is a tube bias tremolo. Curiously, it can be switched on through the footswitch only. The amplifier features two 12 inch Eminence special design loudspeakers in parallel (8ohms each, 4 ohms total load). There is no output impedance switch and the total impedance of the main plus <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> has to be 4 ohms.|$|R
5000|$|The Tweed Deluxe {{is almost}} always used in {{conjunction}} with a late-1950s Magnatone 280 (similar to the amplifier used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>jack</b> from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on [...] "See the Sky About to Rain". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an effects pedal. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.|$|R
5000|$|Lower-priced amps {{may have}} a preamp out. While this signal can be plugged into a mixing board, it is {{preferable}} to use a DI output for this purpose because a preamp out is a 1/4" [...] unbalanced signal. Unbalanced signals {{are more prone to}} unwanted hum and noise. Bass amps intended for use by professional players {{may have a}}n XLR DI output so that the amp can be connected directly to a mixing board of a PA system or recording set-up. Some bass amps have a 1/4" [...] headphone out jack, so that the bass amp can be used for silent practice. When the headphone is plugged in, the amplifier to the speaker is normally automatically turned off. Higher-priced amps designed for professionals often have [...] "preamp out" [...] and [...] "power amp in" [...] jacks, which {{can be used to make}} an effects loop. The power amp in jack can also be used to plug in an external preamplifier pedal, which would then bypass the amp's onboard preamp and EQ section.Some bass amps have two inputs. One some amps, one is a high gain input and the other is a low gain input. On other amps, the two inputs may be intended so that two basses can be plugged in at the same time. On these amps, there may be a separate volume control for each input; this is done to enable a bass player to switch between two instruments on different songs (e.g., a fretted and fretless bass) without having to unplug and plug in jacks. For example, the vintage Traynor Bass Master tube head has two inputs, each with its own volume control. Some bass amps have an auxiliary in jack, for plugging in a drum machine, keyboard bass or synthesizer. Some bass amps also have an <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> out <b>jack.</b> While this jack is also 1/4", a speaker cable must be used with this jack, rather than a patch cord, because it sends a powered signal out to an <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> cabinet. Higher-powered and more expensive amps may have Speakon output jacks.|$|R
