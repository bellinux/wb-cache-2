Measuring 4ft x 10ft x 6ft (1.22m x 3.05m x 1.83m), its 56 neon panels required 168,000 volts of electricity to operate, with a separate table to support the transformers; the <b>final</b> <b>price</b> for the dock setup was $200,000.|$|E

5|$|Crusader {{was built}} by the Melbourne Harbour Trust at Williamstown Dockyard. She was the largest {{all-welded}} steel vessel to have been constructed in Australia at the time, and her <b>final</b> <b>price</b> of £124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to move a bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along {{with the type of}} cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the <b>final</b> <b>price.</b> Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' <b>final</b> <b>price</b> and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
5|$|Accenture {{estimated}} that the World Cup opening would bring R$30.75Billion over 10 years to the city's economy; the study's results encouraged Brazil to site the opening match in São Paulo. A study from Fundação Getúlio Vargas estimated R$1Billion in revenue during the World Cup, as 290 thousand tourists were expected for the event. After Morumbi Stadium was deemed unsuitable by FIFA, the Local World Cup Committee looked for alternatives and set on offering Arena Corinthians to host the opening game; FIFA accepted the suggestion and confirmed the decision on 10 October 2011. Hosting the opening game required modifications to the project that raised the cost from the original R$335million to R$1.07billion to accommodate FIFA's requirements. Cuts in equipment, furniture and construction costs reduced the cost. Because of FIFA's agreements with Brazil, none of the construction work related to the World Cup was taxed by the Federal Government; the <b>final</b> <b>price</b> agreed upon was R$820million.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{calculate}} {{the change in}} <b>final</b> consumer <b>prices</b> due to minimum efficiency standards, focusing on a standard economic model of the air-conditioning and heating equipment (ACHE) wholesale industry. The model examines {{the relationship between the}} marginal cost to distribute and sell equipment and the <b>final</b> consumer <b>price</b> in this industry. The model predicts that the impact of a standard on the <b>final</b> consumer <b>price</b> is conditioned by its impact on marginal distribution costs. For example, if a standard raises the marginal cost to distribute and sell equipment a small amount, the model predicts that the standard will raise the <b>final</b> consumer <b>price</b> a small amount as well. Statistical analysis suggest that standards do not increase the amount of labor needed to distribute equipment the same employees needed to sell lower efficiency equipment can sell high efficiency equipment. Labor is a large component of the total marginal cost to distribute and sell air-conditioning and heating equipment. We infer from this that standards have a relatively small impact on ACHE marginal distribution and sale costs. Thus, our model predicts that a standard will have a relatively small impact on <b>final</b> ACHE consumer <b>prices.</b> Our statistical analysis of U. S. Census Bureau wholesale revenue tends to confirm this model prediction. Generalizing, we find that the ratio of manufacturer <b>price</b> to <b>final</b> consumer <b>price</b> prior to a standard tends to exceed the ratio of the change in manufacturer price to the change in <b>final</b> consumer <b>price</b> resulting from a standard. The appendix expands our analysis through a typical distribution chain for commercial and residential air-conditioning and heating equipment...|$|R
