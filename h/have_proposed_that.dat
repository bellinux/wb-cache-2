5|$|Scholars <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Sif's hair may {{represent}} fields of golden wheat, {{that she may}} be associated with fertility, family, wedlock and/or that she is connected to rowan, and that there may be an allusion to her role or possibly her name in the Old English poem Beowulf.|$|E
5|$|Scholars <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Sól, as a goddess, may {{represent}} {{an extension of}} an earlier Proto-Indo-European deity due to Indo-European linguistic connections between Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Common Brittonic Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, Latin Sol, and Slavic Tsar Solnitse.|$|E

5|$|Some {{other studies}} <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> {{issues with the}} spinal venous {{drainage}} system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the epidural space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein.|$|E
5|$|Some {{speculative}} theories <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> our Universe {{is but one}} of a set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse, challenging or enhancing {{more limited}} definitions of the Universe. Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as alternate planes of consciousness and simulated reality.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other mammals, {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic. The few families and genera of reptile that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species, including the smallest known, and researchers <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.|$|E

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> instead of {{rebuilding}} the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|According to the Prose Edda, {{the bridge}} ends in heaven at Himinbjörg, the {{residence}} of the god Heimdallr, who guards it from the jötnar. The bridge's destruction during Ragnarök {{by the forces of}} Muspell is foretold. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, Gjallarbrú.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat {{may have}} died without a male heir, which {{could explain why}} he was succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV may have been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no {{evidence}} currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System and was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant encounter with another star.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> this might be an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, {{but it has been}} shown that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company but also the auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant {{would most likely}} require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Scientists <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> {{carbonate}} globules {{found in}} meteorite ALH84001, which {{is thought to}} have originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has {{proposed}} that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV, whom he and Verner {{see as a}} wife of Djedkare. Seipel contends that Meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after she fell into disgrace. Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> she was a wife of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs {{has not been}} without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs. However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, {{to the point that the}} scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} this {{gathering}} agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested {{that it was an}} important step in the gaelicisation of the lands east of Druim Alban. Others <b>have</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone. Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, {{it may be that the}} gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.|$|E
