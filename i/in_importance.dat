5|$|A {{maximum of}} three Nobel laureates and two {{different}} works may be {{selected for the}} Nobel Prize in Physics. Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> {{over the years to}} become the most important prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Aldimir rose <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> {{with the}} {{accession}} of {{his older brother}} George (r. 1280–1292) to the Bulgarian throne in 1280. He must have been conferred the high noble title of despot during George's reign, and American historian John Fine believes Aldimir was granted his appanage at that time. Pavlov, however, conjectures that Aldimir's domain dates to 1298, long after George's reign.|$|E
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years {{in light of his}} anti-communist leanings.|$|E

5|$|Commerce {{continued}} to be {{an essential part of}} the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow <b>in</b> <b>importance.</b> Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of their own rules Sheffield {{remained}} the centre of the footballing world until the onset of professionalism. The association matches versus London were considered only equalled <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> to the England v Scotland international and FA Cup Final. Sheffield born Charles Clegg became chairman of the Football Association in 1890 leading it until his death in 1937. In the process he became the longest serving FA chairman and earned the nickname The Napoleon of Football.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian dualism that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1819, the Romney Literary Society was {{the first}} {{literary}} organization {{of its kind in}} the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the Romney Classical Institute and its library. The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> and influence until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western {{began to}} phase out steam {{locomotives}} in favor of diesel locomotives, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle faded <b>in</b> <b>importance.</b> Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{increase}} in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> of silk in the garments of the bourgeoisie in the 19th century caused the decline of the silk industry in Europe. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the silk shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk, particularly from China and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Reading Minster, or the Minster Church of St Mary the Virgin {{as it is}} more {{properly}} known, is Reading's oldest ecclesiastical foundation, {{known to have been}} founded by the 9th century and possibly earlier.

5|$|Second <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> {{after the}} supreme deity, were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans. Palmyra had unique deities, such as the god of justice and Efqa's {{guardian}} Yarhibol, the sun god Malakbel, and the moon god Aglibol. Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities, including the greater Levantine gods Astarte, Baal-hamon, Baalshamin and Atargatis; the Babylonian gods Nabu and Nergal, and the Arab Azizos, Arsu, Šams and Al-lāt.|$|E

5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers did not start to give their daughters in marriage to Ottoman princes until the fifteenth century, when they were seen to have grown <b>in</b> <b>importance.</b> This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men were free to marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E
5|$|The Kowoj {{were the}} second <b>in</b> <b>importance,</b> {{and they were}} hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located {{to the east of}} the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab. Other groups are less well known, and their precise {{territorial}} extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Mopan, the Manche Ch'ol and the Yalain.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Games {{reached their}} zenith in the 6th and 5thcenturiesBC, but then {{gradually}} declined <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> as the Romans gained {{power and influence}} in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date commonly cited is 426AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.|$|E
5|$|The Sino-Soviet split {{was one of}} the {{key events}} of the Cold War, equal <b>in</b> <b>importance</b> to the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement.

5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow <b>in</b> <b>importance.</b> Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E
