25|$|The couple's third child, Flora Amelia, {{was born}} on April 6, 1852. She married {{shipping}} and iron mining magnate Samuel Mather on October 19, 1881. Flora not only was a rich woman because of the many <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> and securities her father gave her during her lifetime, {{but also because of}} her husband's extremely large fortune. After Amasa Stone's death, Flora received not only a large inheritance from him but also helped administer his many devises. Flora became one of the great philanthropists in Ohio history. She made major donations to Case Western Reserve University and the Goodrich House social settlement, and supported the Temperance League, Consumer's League, Day Nursery and Kindergarten Association, Children's Aid Society, and Home for Aged Women.|$|E
2500|$|Moses Boyd was the [...] "well-known and gentlemanly" [...] {{conductor}} of the Dedham branch of the Providence Railroad. [...] At a party for his 25th wedding anniversary his passengers presented him with <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> that totaled between $600 and $700. [...] In addition to the passengers from Dedham, West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, the President and Superintendent of the railroad attended the party at his home and presented him with a silver plate.|$|E
2500|$|Bar or bat mitzvah {{celebrations}} {{have become}} an occasion to give the celebrant a commemorative gift. Traditionally, common gifts include books with religious or educational value, religious items, writing implements, savings bonds (to {{be used for the}} child's college education), gift certificates, or money. <b>Gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> have become commonplace in recent times. As with charity and all other gifts, it has become common to give in multiples of 18, since the gematria, or numerical equivalent of the Hebrew word for [...] "life", ("chai"), is the number 18. Monetary gifts in multiples of 18 are considered to be particularly auspicious and have become very common for the bar and bat mitzvah. Many b'nai mitzvah also receive their first tallit from their parents to be used for the occasion and tefillin where this is appropriate. Jewelry is a common gift for girls at a bat mitzvah celebration. Another gift for the bat mitzvah girl are Shabbat candlesticks because it is the duty and honour of the woman to light the candles.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> a <b>gift</b> card, {{maybe in}} an {{attractive}} wrapper, {{may be seen}} as more socially acceptable than a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> It also prevents the gift being spent on something the giver views as undesirable (or used as savings).|$|R

50|$|A Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust, is a Planned Giving {{vehicle that}} entails a donor placing a major <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> or {{property}} into a trust. The trust then pays {{a fixed amount}} of income each year to the donor or the donor's specified beneficiary. When the donor dies, {{the remainder of the}} trust is transferred to the charity.|$|R

50|$|General bequests {{or general}} gifts - <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> amounts - are never adeemed. If the {{cash in the}} testator's estate is not {{sufficient}} to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the residuary estate will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash.|$|E
50|$|When {{his daughters}} {{got married in}} 2008 and then in 2009, he {{publicly}} broke with Korean wedding traditions by refusing <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> {{out of concern for}} the propriety of a person in his official position accepting such gifts from people in the sector he was supposed to regulate, and held comparatively simple weddings.|$|E

50|$|Alone again, Cheviot prides {{himself on}} winning Maggie, for she is not only pretty, but he feels certain she will never be extravagant. As he is singing her praises, Belinda walks by. Fickle as always, Cheviot is drawn to her obvious charms. He asks why she is sad and {{suggests}} a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> if this would cheer her. When she declines to accept it, he is infatuated by her well-bred modesty. In a gush of emotion, Cheviot proposes to Belinda, but she is already promised to his friend Belvawney. This enrages Cheviot. He vows to cut off Belvawney's annual income by marrying Minnie Symperson. Belinda implores him, for her sake, to remain forever single.|$|R
2500|$|In 1928, Drew Theological Seminary {{accepted}} a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> $1.5 million from brothers Arthur J. Baldwin (1868–1939) and Leonard D. Baldwin (1866–1933) {{to establish an}} undergraduate liberal arts college. The Baldwins were successful attorneys who were raised {{on a farm in}} Cortland, New York. [...] Both brothers attended Cornell University. They established a law firm with former New Jersey governor John Griggs spanning [...] "varied interests in lumbering, manufacturing, transportation, and other enterprises that ranged from owning the Grosvenor Hotel in New York City to Arthur's legal counseling for the rising McGraw-Hill publishing empire." [...] The Baldwins became acquainted with the seminary's president, Ezra Squier Tipple, who [...] "welcomed the brothers to his prominent New York City Methodist Church when they came to Manhattan." [...] Leonard Baldwin eventually became a trustee of the seminary in 1919. The donation originally consisted of $500,000 to build a college building, and $1,000,000 in the form of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (A) stock. However, the Baldwins exchanged the stock with a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> in October 1928.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2014, Shen was {{expelled}} from the Communist Party of China. The party investigation concluded that Shen [...] "abused his power for the illicit gain of others, took massive bribes, received <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash,</b> and committed adultery." [...] His case was forwarded to judicial authorities for prosecution. Shen was sentenced for {{life in prison for}} bribery on October 11, 2016.|$|E
50|$|The sisters then offer Sagan {{to their}} {{brothers}} {{which consists of}} auspicious food items. The five items wine, meat, fish, lentil cake and egg symbolize the five Tantric concepts of light, earth, water, air and sky respectively. The brothers give <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> and clothes in return. They are then treated to a lavish feast. The ceremony may {{be held at the}} sister's home or at the brother's home as per family tradition.|$|E
5000|$|Fully 50% of {{its annual}} {{operating}} budget comes from generous private benefactors through financial contributions {{from around the world}} or from special event fund raisers and annual mailings. Donors can provide outright <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> and stock, remember Guest House in their wills, or establish annuities or trusts for [...] "planned" [...] gifts. Guest House also has a memorial gift program as well as a program for arranging Mass for donors' special intentions.|$|E
5000|$|Cal {{decides to}} [...] "buy his father's love" [...] by going into {{business}} with Samuel's son Will, {{who is now}} a successful automobile dealer. Cal's plan is to make his father's money back, capitalizing on World War I by selling beans grown in the Salinas Valley to nations in Europe for a considerable premium. He succeeds beyond his wildest expectations and wraps up a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> $15,000 in <b>cash</b> which he plans to give to Adam at Thanksgiving.|$|R
50|$|The parades {{generally}} {{take place}} in the late afternoon. A girl may join others observing the “Nnoba Ulo” or elect to do it alone. Dancing is an exhausting exercise and the “Nnoba Ulo” girl does not spare herself in efforts to win the applause of the spectators, including her relatives and those of her husband. Usually, she receives <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> cowries or <b>cash</b> from her relatives, in-laws and delighted spectators. To help refresh their ladies, the maids, use large fans on them after the bouts of dancing.|$|R
25|$|Wu Zhu Coins (AD 25). Even {{after the}} end of the Wang Mang regime (see below), the coinage system {{remained}} in disarray. Cloth, silk and grain were used as money along with coins. However, cash was the normal measure of wealth and was used in large quantities. When Yang Ping (92–195) was in economic difficulties, he was offered a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> one million <b>cash.</b> Wu Zhu coins continued to be issued, along with other coins, until the end of the sixth century. Some coins can be attributed to specific reigns or events; many can not.|$|R

50|$|Various exchanges {{are crucial}} to the Korean wedding: gifts of {{household}} goods (Honsu); gifts of clothing and jewelry between {{the bride and groom}} (Yedan, Chedan and Paemul); gifts given to the significant kin of the groom (Yedan); <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from the groom's kin to the bride (Cholgap), and from the bride's family to the groom's friends (Hamgap); and exchanges of food and wine between the two families (Sangsu). Not all practices are still common though.|$|E
5000|$|Gifts in kind, also {{referred}} to as in-kind donations, is a kind of charitable giving in which, instead of giving money to buy needed goods and services, the goods and services themselves are given. Gifts in kind are distinguished from <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> or stock. Some types of gifts in kind are appropriate, others are not. Examples of in-kind gifts include goods like food, clothing, medicines, furniture, office equipment, and building materials. Performance of services, such as building an orphanage, providing office space or offering administrative support, may also be counted as in-kind gifts.|$|E
25|$|Captain John Bertram (1796–1882) {{lived in}} Salem {{and is the}} founder of Salem Hospital, which was later renamed North Shore Medical Center (NSMC). In 1873, Captain John Bertram gave a <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> $25,000 in <b>cash,</b> plus a brick mansion on Charter Street to create Salem Hospital. From the {{original}} building on Charter Street, Salem Hospital moved to the current location on Highland Avenue in 1917. After John Bertram died in March 1882, his widow donated their home, a mansion built in the High Style Italianate with brick and brownstone for materials at 370 Essex Street, and this became the Salem Public Library. In addition, the John Bertram House is now a home for the elderly.|$|R
6000|$|The {{case on the}} {{accession}} of the new ministers was difficult. Peel {{himself has}} drawn the picture. By incompetent finance, by reckless colonial expenditure, by solving political difficulties through <b>gifts</b> or promises <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from the British treasury, by war and foreign relations hovering {{on the verge of}} war and necessitating extended preparations, the whigs had brought the national resources into an embarrassment that was extreme. The accumulated deficits of five years had become a heavy incubus, and the deficit of 1842-3 was likely to be not less than two and a half millions more. Commerce and manufactures were languishing. Distress was terrible. Poor-rates were mounting, and grants-in-aid would extend impoverishment from the factory districts to the rural. 'Judge then,' said Peel, 'whether we can with safety retrograde in manufactures.'[153] ...|$|R
50|$|Acceptance <b>of</b> <b>Gifts</b> Act <b>of</b> October 10, 1978 (7 USC 2269, Public Law 95-442) - Authorizes FS {{acceptance}} <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> and donations <b>of</b> real personal property.|$|R
5000|$|The {{price and}} {{ceremony}} {{for meeting the}} in-laws is called [...] "Mbonano" [...] and is entry to the house. This is followed by [...] "Guzvi", a second price for greeting the in-laws and accompanied by the traditional greeting (special clapping depending on culture, noting that the Shona people are 12 different ethnic groups). Subsequent <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> or food are then placed into a special plate that {{is used for the}} occasion. This is either bought or borrowed and has a price and ceremonial reference as well: [...] "Kubvisa ndiro" [...] (the price of buying or borrowing the plate).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the argument that gifts in kind often {{do not meet the}} needs of recipients, it has also been argued that gifts in kind fail to empower the recipients because the recipients don't have as much flexibility on how to spend the gifts as they would with <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> or of public goods that they actively solicit. Relatedly, {{it has been argued that}} sending gifts in kind without checking on what the recipients may actually need may be disrespectful to the recipients, and in some cases self-centered and narcissistic, being focused on the needs of the donor rather than the recipient.|$|E
50|$|Richard Atkinson criticizes Rommel for {{gaining a}} looted stamp {{collection}} (a bribe from Sepp Dietrich) and a villa {{taken from the}} Jews. Lucas, Matthews and Remy though describe the contemptuous and angry reaction of Rommel towards Dietrich's act, the lootings and other brutal behaviours of the SS that he had discovered in Italy. Claudia Hecht also explains that although the Stuttgart and Ulm authorities did arrange for the Rommel family the brief use of a villa (whose Jewish owners had been forced out two years before that) after their house had been destroyed by Allied bombing, the ownership was never transferred to them. Butler notes that Rommel {{was one of the}} few who refused large estates and <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> Hitler gave to his generals.|$|E
5000|$|The single {{exception}} was {{the defeat of}} Democratic Congressman Dan Rostenkowski in the Fifth Congressional District of Illinois. Rostenkowski had already served 18 terms as a Congressman, and spent close to $2.5 million on the election compared to the $133,000 spent by his Republican opponent. Nevertheless, this financing advantage of 22:1 was unable to save him from a 52-46 percent defeat. The advantage that opponent Michael Flanagan had over Rostenkowski {{in this case was}} that he wasn't involved in a 17-count federal investigation in [...] "misuse of personal and congressional funds, extortion <b>of</b> <b>gifts</b> and <b>cash,</b> and obstruction <b>of</b> justice." [...] The Rostenkowski example is frequently cited in claims that money does not buy elections.|$|R
2500|$|Buffalo Bill treated Native American {{employees}} as equals with white cowboys. Wild Westers received good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food and <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> clothing and <b>cash</b> from Buffalo Bill {{at the end}} of each season. [...] Wild Westers were employed as performers, interpreters and recruiters. [...] Men had money in their pockets and for their families on the reservation. Female performers were paid extra for infants and children and supplemented wages by making and selling Lakota crafts. Shows hired venerable elder male Indians to appear in the parades to ensure that young men acted with consideration and politeness when visiting host communities, and rules were self-policed by traditional Oglala Lakota chiefs and former U.S. Army Indian Scouts. Known as “Show Indians”, Oglala Wild Westers referred to themselves as [...] "Oskate Wicasa" [...] or [...] "Show Man", a title of great honor and respect. Since 1887, Wild Westing has been family tradition with several hundred Pine Ridge families, and the tradition of the Wild Wester community is not unlike the tradition of circus families and communities. [...] American Horse’s sons Ben American Horse and Samuel American Horse were Carlisle Wild Westers and interpreters.|$|R
5000|$|Pellegrino {{donated the}} land in 1969, agreeing to fund the {{development}} of the recreational facilities, park roads, playground equipment, a small pavilion shelter, and tree planting. [...] At the time of its donation to the city, the land was an empty field. [...] Construction of the park began in earnest, in 1970, following voter approval <b>of</b> Pellegrino's <b>gift</b> <b>of</b> land and <b>cash</b> to the city of Lutesville and Marble Hill. [...] The two acre lake was completed by February 1971. [...] Additionally, a road was cleared {{around the perimeter of the}} lake by that same month. [...] The initial fifteen picnic tables were funded by a grant from the US federal government and were constructed by employees the Office of Economic Opportunity. [...] While only one pavilion was originally slated for construction, a larger pavilion was added to the plans in 1971, after a late donation of funds by the board of the International Hat Company. [...] According to the first Pellegrino Park board president, Gene Ward, it was decided that the large pavilion would be named the Frank Pellegrino Shelter, in honor of Pellegrino's 50 years of service for the International Hat Company.|$|R

50|$|Lack of a {{long-term}} plan, however, took some of the steam out of these initial victories. Capistran Garza had been a great one for creating pious fervor, {{but he was not}} the man to organize an armed rebellion. His job, as he saw it, was to cross the border and stir up sympathy for the Cristero cause among U.S. Catholics, sympathy that would translate into large <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> with which to buy desperately needed ammunition. Garza knew that American support would dictate the outcome of the war, but the U.S. bishops were reluctant to give any sign of supporting an armed rebellion against a government recognized by the United States. Meanwhile, most of the Mexican bishops were looking for a negotiated settlement. Garza's northern sojourn yielded almost no fruit.|$|E
50|$|Wild Westers {{received}} good wages, transportation, housing, abundant food, and <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> {{and clothing}} {{at the end}} of each season. Wild Westing was very popular with the Lakota people and benefited their families and communities. Wild Westing offered opportunity and hope during time when people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. Americans and Europeans continue to have a great interest in Native peoples and enjoy modern Pow-wow culture, traditional Native Americans skills; horse culture, ceremonial dancing and cooking; and buying Native American art, music and crafts. First begun in Wild West shows, Pow-wow culture is popular with Native Americans throughout the United States and a source of tribal enterprise. Wild Westers still perform in movies, pow-wows, pageants and rodeos. Some Oglala Lakota people carry on family show business traditions from ancestors who first worked for Buffalo Bill and other Wild West shows.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} the three Rover boys slept but little that night. The loss <b>of</b> the <b>cash</b> was {{something}} <b>of</b> a serious matter to them, even though they still possessed a hundred odd dollars in cash between them, and could easily telegraph home for more. More than this, the diamonds and cuff buttons had been <b>gifts</b> <b>of</b> which they were very proud.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} essay, "The Source <b>of</b> <b>Cash</b> and Its Marginal Value," we study the {{relation}} between the source <b>of</b> firms' <b>cash</b> holdings and the value <b>of</b> the <b>cash</b> to shareholders. The marginal value of a dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings depends on the source of the dollar: $ 1. 00 <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> has a value of $ 1. 27 when it is from operations, $ 0. 80 when from financing, and $ 0. 46 when from investing. Within the same source, the marginal value of an added dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings is significantly higher than the absolute value of a subtracted dollar. Shareholders of financially constrained or distressed firms value incremental cash holdings from almost any source more highly than do shareholders of unconstrained or stronger firms, but differences in value remain across the sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> within each subsample. Agency costs and information asymmetry are two frictions that appear to have the largest impact upon the value <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> In the second essay, "Explanations for Diverging Values of Cash," we further explain the differing values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> found in the first essay. Intertemporal relationships among the sources and uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> provide a rational basis for shareholders to assign different values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> based on the source. Sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> provide information about likely uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> up to two to three years in the future, and many of the intertemporal relations are statistically and economically significant. Likewise, prior uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> relate significantly to later uses <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> Past sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> inform investors about likely future sources, even up to five years into the future. The fact that different kinds <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> flows have predictive power for future cash flows helps explain the wide range of the values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> associated with different sources...|$|R
