40|$|Abstract only availableThe white gene in Drosophila melanogaster {{codes for}} a {{half-size}} ABC transporter. We {{have identified a}} role of this transporter in <b>heat</b> <b>box</b> spatial learning. In the <b>heat</b> <b>box</b> paradigm, flies are allowed to move freely in a small dark chamber. During the training phase, when a fly enters a specified half of the chamber, the whole chamber adjusts to the heated probe temperature. When the fly moves to the other half, the chamber temperature adjusts to the preferred reference point. Flies can be conditioned within minutes to avoid the half of the chamber associated with negative temperature. This is especially important in understanding reinforcement processing, a key aspect of learning that is distinct from memory acquisition. An intriguing finding is that mutant eye color severity can be dissociated from performance deficits in the <b>heat</b> <b>box.</b> This finding leads to the hypothesis that systems requiring white-ABC Transporter function for conditioning are not similarly sensitive to the mutations as eye coloration. However, these behavioral measurements were done in flies with an undefined background, therefore leaving open room for several possible alternative explanations. In order to re-asses the eye-color/performance relationship, the same white mutant alleles tested previously were out-crossed to our wild-type strain and will be tested in <b>heat</b> <b>box</b> conditioning. These results will challenge the hypothesis that there are differently sensitive sites at the white locus for eye-pigment and memory formation.

This paper presents an interesting method to evaluate the thermal performance of a massive wall by using the frequency-domain regression (FDR) method to calculate CTF coefficients {{by means of the}} Fourier transform. The method is based on the EN ISO 13786 (2007) procedure by using the Taylor expansion for the elements of the heat matrix. Numerical results were validated through an experimental <b>heating</b> <b>box</b> with stochastic boundary conditions {{on one side of the}} wall representing real weather conditions and constant temperature profile on the other side representing the inside ambiance in real cases. Finally, a frequency analysis was performed in order to assess the validity and accuracy of the method used.

This method is useful for thermal transfer analysis in real weather conditions where the outside temperature is stochastic; it also allows the evaluation of the thermal performance of a wall through a frequency analysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} study is conducted {{as a part}} of a Department of Energy funded SunShot project titled “High Temperature Falling Particle Receiver”. In this concept, solid particles are heated by concentrated sunlight to very high temperatures to the point that they can become a suitable heat source for various thermal power and thermochemical cycles. Furthermore, one of the great advantages of this concept is the ability to store thermal energy in the solid particles at relatively low cost. However, an important feature of any Particle Heat Receiver (PHR) system is the particle to fluid heat exchanger (PFHXer), which is the interface between the solar energy system and the thermal power or chemical system. In order to create this system material data is needed for the design and optimization of this PFHXer. This study focuses on the heat transfer properties of particulates to solid surfaces. The particulates will be evaluated for three grain sizes of sand and two grain sizes of proppants. These two materials will be tested at one, five and ten millimetres per second in order to see how the various flow rates, which will be required for different loads, will affect the heat transfer coefficient. Finally the heat transfer coefficient will also be evaluated for both finned and non-finned heat exchangers to see the effect that changes in the surface geometry and surface area have on the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient will help determine the appropriate material that will be used in the PHR system. An experimental procedure is under development by Georgia Institute of Technology to examine the heat transfer coefficient. To accurately characterize the size distribution of the materials, the material will be placed through a sifting unit. Afterwards the material will be placed into the testing apparatus. The main components of the testing apparatus consist of the Old's Elevator which is used to move the sand and the PFHXer. The PFHXer is made up of the constant head plenum and the <b>heating</b> <b>box.</b> The constant head plenum allows for a constant particulate head and uniform flow. The heating unit is made up of eight electric cartridge heaters. These heaters act as the non-finned tubed heaters and through the use of a metal casing can also be changed into finned tubed heaters. By running the system to steady and state and measuring the surface, inlet and outlet temperatures the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Total body water (TBW) is an {{important}} parameter in pathological states where the normal regulation of fluid balance is impaired (e. g., during critical illness, congestive heart failure, bum injury and renal insufficiency). Dilution of water isotopes, such as deuterium oxide (D 2 O), is considered die gold standard method for measuring TBW in humans. However this procedure requires skilled staff, expensive equipment {{and the results are}} seldom available in a timely fashion, which makes it less suitable for clinical applications. Ethanol is completely miscible with water and is thought to distribute into the TBW. The ethanol volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) can be estimated by pharmacokinetic analysis of the concentration-time profile. Ethanol can be measured in expired breath with high precision and this non- invasive method of analysis could provide an attractive alternative with the prospect of bedside monitoring of Vss within 4 - 6 hours. The aim. of this thesis was to develop an appropriate pharmacokinetic model for intravenous ethanol administration and to identify experimental factors that impact on the results. With this background, we compared Vss. determined by ethanol dilution with TBW determined by D 20 dilution. The complicated absorption kinetics of ethanol (e. g. variable gastric emptying and first-pass metabolism) was avoided by use of the intravenous route of administration. Material and Methods: Forty-six healthy volunteers (20 women and 26 men) received intravenous infusions of ethanol (0. 4 - 0. 6 g/kg body weight) in 15 - 60 minutes. The concentration of ethanol was measured in end-expired breath by infrared spectrometry and in blood and urine by headspace gas chromatography. Specimens of blood and breath were obtained at 5 - 15 min intervals for 3 - 6 hours post-dosing. The concentration of D 20 in plasmawater was measured with isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Subjective feelings of inebriation were measured with a visual analogue scale. A number of pharmacokinetic models were developed and evaluated {{in the course of this}} thesis. The effect of eating a meal on ethanol kinetics was investigated in crossover studies by giving the same dose of ethanol in fed and fasted states. The magnitude and time-course of arterio-venous differences in ethanol concentration were determined to assess the importance of local peripheral vasodilatation and vasoconstriction on results. This was achieved by warming the sampling hand in a <b>heating</b> <b>box</b> or cooling the hand in cold water during ethanol infusion experiments. The impact of ~ling site on pharmacokinetic parameters of ethanol was investigated by simultaneous sampling in expired breath, arterial blood and venous blood. Inter- and intra-individual variations in precision of the estimates of Vss. and TBW were studied by making repeat infusions of ethanol a few days apart, and use of analysis of variance. Results and discussion: The two-compartment model with parallel Michaelis-Menten kinetics and first-order rend elimination provided an excellent prediction of the entire concentration-time profiles of ethanol and proved to be theoretically superior to the other kinetic models tested. A good reproducibility was obtained for all pharmacokinetic parameters, especially for Vss and the maximal metabolic rate (Vmax). Eating a meal increased the rate of ethanol metabolism by 30 - 60 % and this confounding factor needs to be considered in clinical studies when Vss. for ethanol is estimated. Peripheral vasoconstriction caused a lowering of the concentrations of ethanol in venous blood, which also impacts on the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethanol. Measuring ~ 1 in breath agreed more closely with arterial blood concentrations than with venous blood. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ethanol could be measured with equally high precision in expired breath and venous blood. An ethanol dose of 0. 4 g/kg body weight infused in 15 minutes led to unacceptable inebriation in some volunteer subjects. The precision of estimating Vss by ethanol dilution was about the same as for measuring TBW by D 20 dilution (SD 0. 8 -. 1. 1 litres). However, me observed a systematic bias of - 13 % between Vss and TBW (D 20). A likely explanation for this finding might be that water in the body, at least in part, is structured in such a way that ethanol is prevented from complete equilibration. Conclusions: A two-compartment model with parallel Michaelis-Menten and first-order renal elimination gave an excellent fit to the concentration-time profile of ethanol after intravenous ~on. Feeding state and peripheral circulation affected the estimated model parameters. Sampling and analysis of breath provided results with the same high precision as venous blood for estimating ethanol Vss. The non-invasive nature of breath sampling makes it more suitable for clinical purposes. The systematic bias of- 13 % between the Vss and TBW by D 20 dilution suggests that ethanol does not distribute uniformly into the TBW. The reason for this discrepancy remains to be established...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of indoor thermal environment {{has been carried}} out by computational fluid dynamics approach. The study focuses on the thermal comfort evaluation, particularly the flow and heat transfer effects due to conjugate natural convection, furniture arrangement and occupant number, and flow oscillations. Key physical features of thermo-fluid such as velocity and temperature distributions, thermal sensation maps, and oscillation frequency and its energy are quantified, analysed and compared. The benchmark case study of airflow and heat transfer showed that ANSYS Fluent RNG k - 5 turbulence model with temperature boundary condition on the heated boundary calculated the bestresults, compared with available data. It also showed that air velocity increased along the boundary walls and especially hot wall which led flow direction upwards. At the centre of the flow circulation, air momentum is very weak (e. g. almost zero velocity magnitude). The increase of complex features (6. g. a <b>box</b> with/without <b>heat)</b> in the domain would lead to flow separations causing recirculations above the box and in the rear space of the domain and swirls in the front space presenting three-dimensional flow, and a thermal plume, compared with a two-dimensional clockwise flow in an empty room. The flow recirculations and thermal buoyancy enhanced velocity magnitude and turbulence level in the domain. In fact, the highest frequency was obtained in the room with an unheated box, followed by the room with a <b>heated</b> <b>box.</b> The forrhation of thermal plume from the <b>heated</b> <b>box</b> stabilised the flow in the upper part and the sides of the <b>heated</b> <b>box</b> on a spanwise plane. The frequency of velocity oscillation was consistent with temperature at the location although the energy of the fluctuation is much higher in temperature. Moreover the dominant frequency depended on the orientation of the flow circulation, for example a high energy at a lower frequency on a spanwise plane while a low energy at a higher frequency on a streamwise plane. In an empty room, it was found that there is no direct relation in an empty room (case 3. 2. 1) between velocity and turbulent flow in power spectral density and frequency, and each of time-history velocity oscillations is independent and random. At the mid- height of the domain, the energy of the velocity fluctuation is relatively weak. The results from the study of conjugate natural convection heat transfer in a ventilated room with localised heat source and window glazing showed that the size of heat source and window glazing, the wall thickness and wall material property are important factors to temperature change and heat loss.

Interestingly, experience with a reinforcer unpaired from any predictors can enhance or impair later associative learning. We identified and characterized the reinforcement matching and the pre-exposure induced behavior in Drosophila spatial operant learning using high temperature as negative reinforcement. Further we investigated the neural systems influencing matching and pre-exposure effect. Analysis of the white mutant implicates a role for serotonin and dopamine in memory matching. Using genetic and pharmacological manipulations, we found that serotonin but not dopamine plays a critical role in reinforcement matching. The serotonergic system is required for reinforcement processing in the <b>heat</b> <b>box.</b> Our results also show that the serotonergic reinforcement circuit is required for uncertainty bias in the <b>heat</b> <b>box.</b> Furthermore, altering the excitability of serotonergic neurons is sufficient in memory matching and inducing the pre-exposure effect. Another important finding is that the absence of a behavioral predictor is important for the pre-exposure effect and this effect can bias learning in a positive way. Moreover, we also looked at the role of serotonergic signaling in aversive olfactory learning. Unlike the spatial learning where serotonin mediates the aversive reinforcing signal, serotonin enhances the olfactory memory 3 and 6 hrs post training. Finally, serotonin and dopamine seem to have specific functions in two different aversive learning paradigms arguing against common negative reinforcing signals. Octopamine, known to mediate some positive reinforcing signals, seems dispensable for place learning. This either supports the conclusion of the absence of an appetitive component in place learning or the presence of one that is not dependent on octopamine...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} climate have {{increased}} public attention and scientific evaluation of climate impacts on wild animals and plants. Variation in local weather and regional climate may affect breeding success in birds. Migratory species may {{be sensitive to}} these changes as breeding and wintering areas may experience different climate variations; some insectivorous species {{may be unable to}} alter timing of migration or laying dates and experience a mismatch between timing of nesting and peak insect availability for their nestlings. Therefore, I investigated the influence of local weather variables and regional climate on breeding performance of an insectivorous migrant songbird, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), and tried to examine effects of a mismatch between the timing of breeding and food availability. I used a 14 year data set from St. Denis, Saskatchewan, Canada, 1991 - 2004, to evaluate correlations among local weather, wetland conditions, aerial insects and regional climate indices and their relationships with variation in clutch initiation date, clutch size, and fledging success. Swallows returned to the study site in late April each year. Annual variation in median clutch initiation date was best explained by mean minimum temperatures during 1 - 15 May. Larger clutches were laid in years with higher pond water levels (possibly an indication of increased insect availability) and when the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was positive (representing La Niña conditions). Fledging success was not influenced greatly by any explanatory variable; however, fledging success tended to increase in years with higher average temperatures. Individual variation in clutch initiation date was examined using path analysis. I found high correlations between initiation date and both local environmental variables and regional climate indices; earlier nesting was associated with warmer temperatures (increased local temperatures, more positive North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) values and more negative SOI values) and decreased moisture (more positive NAOI values). Two reduced data sets, including female age or insect abundance, were also examined. Clutches were initiated earlier by older females and during springs with higher abundance of aerial insects. I applied two heating treatments to nest boxes used by pre-laying swallows and compared reproductive measures (timing of nesting, laying sequence, clutch size, egg weight and fledging success) of birds using <b>heated</b> <b>boxes</b> to those of females attending unheated control boxes. However, I was unable to directly examine the predictions of the mismatch hypothesis because nest <b>box</b> <b>heating</b> failed to advance laying dates. Furthermore, no increases in clutch size, egg weight and fledging success were detected between treatment and control nests. Although <b>box</b> <b>heating</b> increased nest temperatures an average of 6. 1 C (+ 0. 8 SE) over controls, length of time females spent in <b>heated</b> <b>boxes</b> may have been too short to alleviate energetic constraints on egg production, or energy savings associated with box use were insufficient to supersede the influence of ambient environmental conditions that control food availability and energy expenditure of foraging swallows.

40|$|Understanding {{of complex}} {{interactions}} and {{events in a}} nervous system, leading from the molecular level up to certain behavioural patterns calls for interdisciplinary interactions of various research areas. The goal of the presented work is to achieve such an interdisciplinary approach to study and manipulate animal behaviour and its underlying mechanisms. Optical in vivo imaging is a new constantly evolving method, allowing one to study not only the local but also wide reaching activity in the nervous system. Due to ease of its genetic accessibility Drosophila melanogaster represents an extraordinary experimental organism to utilize not only imaging but also various optogenetic techniques to study the neuronal underpinnings of behaviour. In this study four genetically encoded sensors were used to investigate the temporal dynamics of cAMP concentration changes in the horizontal lobes of the mushroom body, a brain area important for learning and memory, in response to various physiological and pharmacological stimuli. Several transgenic lines with various genomic insertion sites for the sensor constructs Epac 1, Epac 2, Epac 2 K 390 E and HCN 2 were screened for the best signal quality, one line was selected for further experiments. The in vivo functionality of the sensor was assessed via pharmacological application of 8 -bromo-cAMP as well as Forskolin, a substance stimulating cAMP producing adenylyl cyclases. This was followed by recording of the cAMP dynamics {{in response to the}} application of dopamine and octopamine, {{as well as to the}} presentation of electric shock, odorants or a simulated olfactory signal, induced by acetylcholine application to the observed brain area. In addition the interaction between the shock and the simulated olfactory signal by simultaneous presentation of both stimuli was studied. Preliminary results are supporting a coincidence detection mechanism at the level of the adenylyl cyclase as postulated by the present model for classical olfactory conditioning. In a second series of experiments an effort was made to selecticvely activate a subset of neurons via the optogenetic tool Channelrhodopsin (ChR 2). This was achieved by recording the behaviour of the fly in a walking ball paradigm. A new method was developed to analyse the walking behaviour of the animal whose brain was made optically accessible via a dissection technique, as used for imaging, thus allowing one to target selected brain areas. Using the Gal 4 -UAS system the protocerebral bridge, a substructure of the central complex, was highlighted by expressing the ChR 2 tagged by fluorescent protein EYFP. First behavioural recordings of such specially prepared animals were made. Lastly a new experimental paradigm for single animal conditioning was developed (Shock Box). Its design is based on the established <b>Heat</b> <b>Box</b> paradigm, however in addition to spatial and operant conditioning available in the <b>Heat</b> <b>Box,</b> the design of the new paradigm allows one to set up experiments to study classical and semioperant olfactory conditioning, as well as semioperant place learning and operant no idleness experiments. First experiments involving place learning were successfully performed in the new apparatus. Das Verständniss für die komplexen Interaktionen und Zusammenhänge, die von der molekularen Ebene bis zum Auftreten von bestimmten Verhaltensmustern führen, erfordert die interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit unterschiedlicher Forschungsrichtungen. Das Ziel der vorgelegten Arbeit war es einen solchen interdisziplinären Ansatz für die Erforschung und die Manipulation von Verhalten und ihm zu Grunde liegenden Mechanismen zu verwirklichen. Optisches in vivo Imaging ist eine neue, sich ständig weiterentwickelnde Methode, welche es ermöglicht, nicht nur lokale sondern auch weitläufige Aktivitäten innerhalb des Nervensystem zu untersuchen. Drosophila melanogaster stellt aufgrund der leichten genetischen Zugänglichkeit einen herausragenden experimentellen Organismus dar, bei welchem neben optischem Imaging eine ganze Reihe optogenetischer Methoden angewandt werden kann, um die neuronalen Grundlagen des Verhaltens zu erforschen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurde mit Hilfe von vier genetisch kodierten Sensoren in vivo die Dynamik der cAMP Konzentration in den horizontalen Loben des Pilzkörpers, bei Applikation unterschiedlicher physiologischer und pharmazeutischer Stimuli untersucht. Dabei wurden mehrere transgene Fliegenlinien mit Sensorkonstrukten Epac 1, Epac 2, Epac 2 K 390 E und HCN 2 an unterschiedlichen genomischen Insertionsorten, hinsichtlich ihrer Signalqualität untersucht, eine der Linien wurde für weitere Experimente ausgewählt. Zunächst wurde an dieser die in vivo Tauglichkeit des Sensors gezeigt, indem die Konzentration von cAMP durch pharmakologische Applikationen von 8 -Bromo-cAMP und Forskolin, einer Substanz welche die Aktivität von cAMP produzierenden Adenylatcyclasen stimuliert, appliziert wurden. Anschließend wurde eine Untersuchung der cAMP Dynamik als Antwort auf einen elektrischen Schock, unterschiedliche Düfte, sowie einen durch Applikation von Acetylcholin simulierten Duftstimulus durchgeführt. Vorläufige Ergebnisse bestärken das aktuelle Modell der klassischen olfaktorischen Konditionierung durch die Koinzidenzdetektion auf der Ebene der Adenylatcyclase. In einem weiteren Experiment wurde der Versuch einer optogenetischen neuronalen Aktivierung unternommen, dabei wurde basierend auf einem Laufball Paradigma eine Methode entwickelt, das Laufverhalten der Fliegen zu analysieren während ihr Gehirn durch eine Imaging-Präparation freigelegt wurde, um gezielt bestimmte durch fluoreszierende Proteine markierte Gehirnbereiche anzuregen. Erste Aufzeichnungen des Laufverhaltens bei Aktivierung der protocerebrallen Brücke, einer Substruktur des Zentralkomplexes, wurden durchgeführt.

2500|$|Dancers {{typically}} [...] "break in" [...] new pointe {{shoes to}} reduce or eliminate the discomfort they commonly cause, usually by performing releves and eleves that flex, and thus soften, the boxes and shanks in a natural manner. Various other methods have also been employed for breaking in pointe shoes, including deforming them with hands or against hard surfaces, striking them on hard surfaces, and moistening or <b>heating</b> the <b>boxes</b> to soften the glues, but these methods may shorten a pointe shoe's usable lifetime.|$|R

5000|$|An operant {{conditioning}} chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning (training) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions (like pressing a lever) {{in response to}} specific stimuli, such as a light or sound signal. When the subject correctly performs the behavior, the chamber mechanism delivers food or another reward. In some cases, the mechanism delivers a punishment for incorrect or missing responses. For instance, to test how {{operant conditioning}} works for certain invertebrates, such as fruit flies, psychologists use a device known as a [...] "heat box". Essentially this takes up the same form as the Skinner box, but the box is composed of two sides: one side that can undergo temperature change and the other that does not. As soon as the invertebrate crosses {{over to the side}} that can undergo a temperature change, the area is heated up. Eventually, the invertebrate will be conditioned to stay on the side that does not undergo a temperature change. This goes to the extent that even when the temperature is turned to its lowest point, the fruit fly will still refrain from approaching that area of the <b>heat</b> <b>box.</b> These types of apparatuses allow experimenters to perform studies in conditioning and training through reward/punishment mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|Synopsis- The {{surface tension}} of {{thermally}} stimulated sweat was measured on 22 subjects. The apocrine sweat from the axilla yielded distinctly lower values (53. 9 - 4 - 3. 5 dyne/cm) than the eccrine sweat {{from the skin}} surface of the back and the abdomen (60. 4 - 4 - 4. 5 dyne/cm). On {{the basis of the}} pH, the axillary sweat is more alkaline (p < 0. 001) and contained higher quan-tities of mucoproteins than eccrine sweat (p < 0. 01). Both types of sweat have almost identical specific gravities, and the sodium and nitrogen content were almost he same. The difference in the composition of eccrine and apocrine sweat is briefly discussed. Numerous publications on cleansing and wetting of the surface of skin (1) (2) are available, but information on the surface tension of sweat is limited. We, therefore, attempted to deftermine the surface tension of sweat and to com-pare the values for eccrine and apocrine sweat, the latter being represented by axillary sweat. In our opinion, these investigations and the methodology can help form a rationale for the action of antiperspirants, uch as aluminium compounds even in the form of finished products. METHODS Collection of sweat: We tested,,thermal " sweat obtained from subjects sweating in a <b>box</b> <b>heated</b> by electric light bulbs. Before the test, the test sub-jects washed with water. We made certain that the sweat was not contaminated by soap or cosmetics, which might have significantly influenced the resultant values. After about 10 - 15 min. in the <b>heated</b> <b>box,</b> most of the subjects star-ted to sweat profusely. Eccrine sweat was taken from the skin of the chest, abdomen and back. As soon as drops of sweat appeared on the skin, they were scraped into a glass vessel in order to minimize condensation due to evapo-ration. Axillary sweat was collected separately by absorption into loose cot-tonwool tampohs placed under the armpits of the test subjects. It was the...|$|R
