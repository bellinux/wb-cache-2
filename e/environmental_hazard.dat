25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} {{smoke detectors}} poses a potential <b>environmental</b> <b>hazard,</b> albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations and recommendations for smoke detectors vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing smoke detectors is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would have to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic smoke detector is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{incidence}} of natural hazards (e. g., earthquakes, hurricanes) {{and the presence}} of technological hazards (e. g., nuclear waste facilties, chemical spills) are both on the rise. This paper offers a review of research examining the association between migration and both natural and technological <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards,</b> with migration ranging from forced to voluntary. Using examples from both developed and developing regional contexts, the overview demonstrates that the association between migration and <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards</b> varies by setting, hazard types, and household characteristics. In many cases, however, research suggests that environmental factors play a role in shaping migration decisions, particularly among those most vulnerable to <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards.</b> Research also suggests that risk perception acts as a mediating factor. Classic migration theory is reviewed to offer a foundation for examination of these associations. 2 Migration and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Hazards</b> Several classic theoretical perspectives on migration, operating at micro and macro scales, provide foundations for examination of the association between migration and <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards.</b> Importantly, however, while contextual factors are often noted in these frameworks, they are rarely emphasized. Further, to the extent that empirical work has been undertaken with regard to th...|$|R

By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead, though {{the rear of the}} CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leache (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).|$|E
25|$|Following the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, {{there have}} emerged {{allegations}} {{that after the}} outbreak of the Somali Civil War in late 1991, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste. The huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tonnes of nuclear and toxic waste that was illegally dumped in Somali waters by several European firms – front companies created by the Italian mafia. The European Green Party followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the European Parliament in Strasbourg copies of contracts signed by two European companies—the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian waste broker, Progresso—and representatives of the warlords then in power, to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million). According to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) assessment mission, there are far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal hemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of Hobbio and Benadir on the Indian Ocean coast—diseases consistent with radiation sickness.

500|$|Hades– The former God of the Underworld. Hades {{participated in}} the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series and his {{champion}} was Alrik, who would later become the Barbarian King. In God of War, Hades aided Kratos in Pandora's Temple by giving him the magic, Army of Hades. However, with the combined murders of Hades' wife Persephone, niece Athena, and brother Poseidon, it drove him to near madness and a final confrontation with Kratos in God of War III, ending with Kratos taking Hades' weapon, the Claws of Hades, and killing the god, which subsequently released all souls from the Underworld. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Hades {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Nolan North in God of War, Clancy Brown in God of War III, and Fred Tatasciore in Ascension.

Oil from the ship's fuel tanks continued to pose an <b>environmental</b> <b>hazard,</b> a situation exacerbated by both the ship's structural failure and continuing pounding from the surf. In order to mitigate the situation, the Unified Command decided to set the fuel tanks on fire in order to burn off the oil. The first attempt was made on February 10. Napalm and other incendiary devices were used to ignite the fuel, but only one of the diesel tanks was burned effectively. A second attempt was made on February 11 when US Navy explosive experts placed 39 shaped charges to breach the top of the fuel tanks from within the cargo holds. 2,280liters of napalm and nearly 180kg of plastic explosives were also used to ignite the fuel on board. The ship burned for approximately 33hours. Additional smaller-scale attempts were made to burn more oil over the next two days, with limited success. The total amount of oil that was burned is estimated to be between [...] The structural stress caused by the fire, combined with continued severe weather, caused the vessel to break into two sections around midnight on February 11.|$|E

RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of most <b>environmental</b> <b>hazards</b> was high. Two or more hazards were found in 59 % of bathrooms and in 23 % to 42 % of the other rooms.
