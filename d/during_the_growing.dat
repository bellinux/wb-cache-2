5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season, {{the mean}} July {{temperature}} is 18°C (66°F).

5|$|Routine care <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season {{involves}} {{keeping the}} rows free of competing weeds, {{especially when the}} plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need {{a great deal of}} water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E

25|$|The Chardonnay vine has a {{tendency}} to produce excessive foliage which can hamper the ripening process with the vine diverting more energy to its leaves than to producing sugars and phenolics in the grape clusters. This requires Corton-Charlemagne growers to be limit the number of buds they leave with winter pruning and to be active <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season in leaf-pulling and removing excess shoots.|$|E

25|$|In {{grain and}} cotton crops, urea is often applied {{at the time}} of the last {{cultivation}} before planting.

40|$|Prescribed fire is {{becoming}} a more widely utilized habitat management practice in southern Texas. We {{examined the effects of}} winter burns on the abundance and diversity of forbs and grasses on three rangeland sites <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first and second growing seasons postburn in the western South Texas Plains. Forb and grass cover, density, and frequency were estimated in 50, 7. 9 -x 19. 7 -in quadrats. Forb and grass species richness and diversity were similar among treatments and growing seasons. Forb cover was greater on burned sites <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first <b>growing</b> season. Burning increased densities of three-seed croton (Croton lindheimerianus), rough buttonweed (Diodia teres), and spreading sida (Sida abutifolia) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first <b>growing</b> season. Densities of three-seed croton and rough buttonweed were similar among treatments <b>during</b> <b>the</b> second <b>growing</b> season, while increased densities of spreading sida persisted into <b>the</b> second <b>growing</b> season postburn. Most grasses were unaffected by burning. Date of burn influenced herbaceous vegetation response with greatest forb densities on early winter burns and highest grass densities on mid-winter burns. Even with less than optimum growing conditions burning can increase abundance of annual and perennial forbs...|$|R
40|$|Imagery from {{satellite}} sensors (IKONOS and QuickBird) {{were compared}} with information from a yield monitor to validate the usefulness of these geospatial technologies in predicting wheat grain yields under two non-uniform crop conditions. A center-pivot irrigated field of wheat under water stress was monitored by imagery from IKONOS and a yield monitor <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2001 <b>growing</b> season. In another location, a field of wheat under dryland conditions was monitored with Quickbird satellite imagery and a yield monitor <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2002 <b>growing</b> season. Yield maps were created from the yield monitor data and imagery were processed using NDVI and SAVI. Each method was compared for advantages and disadvantages. Yield monitor data are useful for determining patterns of crop growth and stress. Satellite imagery are useful for in-season analysis, but expensive and temporally limited. QuickBird satellite imagery were received within 10 - 15 days of acquisition <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2002 <b>growing</b> season, rivaling <b>the</b> turn-around time of aerial imagery.

25|$|In {{the midwestern}} United States, low-till or no-till farming {{techniques}} are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting {{or after the}} previous harvest. The fields are planted and fertilized. Weeds are controlled {{through the use of}} herbicides, and no cultivation tillage is done <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season.

25|$|While {{the climate}} of Pomerol is broadly similar {{to the rest of}} Bordeaux in the {{maritime}} influence, the region's distance from the sea and the Gironde estuary make the climate distinctly more continental than that of the Médoc. This means that Pomerol sees more diurnal temperature variation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season, between daytime highs and evening lows. Also while the region experiences more rainfall during the spring (which can cause problems for Merlot during flowering) there is overall significantly less rainfall during the summer months after veraison.|$|E
25|$|While the BLM rates horses by {{animal unit}} (AUM) {{to eat the}} same amount of forage as a cow-calf pair, 1.0, {{multiple}} studies of horse grazing patterns indicate that horses probably consume forage at a rate closer to 1.5 AUM. Modern rangeland management also recommends removing all livestock <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>growing</b> season to maximize recovery of the forage. Allowing livestock to graze year-round is not good for the range, and so mismanagement of feral herds can also degrade the range for the wildlife that shares the same area.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which effects of floor eggs, washed floor eggs, and clean nest eggs were investigated on incubation characteristics and performance in later life of broiler chickens. In both experiments, a young and an older breeder flock were used in a 3 × 2 factorial design <b>during</b> incubation. In <b>the</b> second experiment, male and female chickens were reared separately until d 35 of age in floor pens. During this grow out trial, an extra group was created in which chickens obtained from clean nest eggs were mixed with chickens obtained from floor eggs, meaning that grow out period was set up as a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial design with 4 egg types, 2 breeder ages, and 2 sexes. In both experiments, fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs were lower in floor and washed eggs than in clean nest eggs (hatchability: experiment 1 : 74. 4 vs. 70. 6 vs. 92. 6 % for floor eggs, washed floor eggs and clean nest eggs, respectively, P < 0. 001; experiment 2 : 78. 3 vs. 81. 7 vs. 90. 2 %, respectively, P < 0. 001). In experiment 2, BW at d 0 of chickens obtained from clean nest eggs was {{higher than that of}} chickens from floor eggs and washed floor eggs (41. 5 vs. 40. 4 and 40. 3 g, respectively; P < 0. 001). This difference disappeared <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>grow</b> out period and was absent at slaughter age at d 35 of age. Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>grow</b> out period were not affected by egg type. Incidence and severity of hock burns and footpad dermatitis were not affected by egg type or breeder age. Litter friability at d 35 of age tended to be lower in pens with chickens obtained from washed floor eggs compared to clean nest eggs. We conclude that incubation of floor eggs or washed floor eggs resulted in lower fertility and hatchability compared to clean nest eggs, but that performance <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>grow</b> out period was not affected. </p...|$|R
