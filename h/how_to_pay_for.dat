5|$|Following {{his capture}} Noriega was {{transferred}} to a cell in the Miami federal courthouse, where he was arraigned on the ten charges which the Miami grand jury had returned 2 years earlier. The start of the trial was delayed until September 1991 due to complex legal maneuvering over whether Noriega could be tried after his detention as a prisoner of war, the admissibility of evidence and witnesses, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> Noriega's legal defense. The trial ended in April 1992, when Noriega was convicted on eight of the ten charges of drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs.

The council have not yet decided <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year.

5|$|King Frederick William IV {{suffered}} a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> them) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck {{to the position of}} Minister-President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.|$|E

500|$|As the {{legislature}} sat, the townships of Bergen County fractured. [...] The {{provision of the}} Borough Act allowing separation had been little used prior to 1893. A year-long legal battle in Palisades Township, along the Hudson River, led to a referendum that saw Tenafly break away in January 1894. Some communities seceded in early 1894 because of disputes about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> macadamized roads, which were first paved through much of Bergen County {{in the first half}} of the 1890s. The Hackensack Republican reported on March 1, [...] "the chief reason why Delford , Westwood, Hillsdale and Park Ridge want to become boroughs is that they may avoid what is feared will be heavy macadam tax". [...] The proposed borough of Delford would take land from multiple townships, uniting communities on both sides of the Hackensack River that shared a school, but incorporation was put on hold because of legal uncertainty as to whether a borough could be formed from parts of more than one township.|$|E
500|$|During the Second World War, Keynes {{argued in}} <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pay</b> <b>for</b> the War, {{published}} in 1940, {{that the war}} effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than deficit spending, {{in order to avoid}} inflation. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April. In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a hereditary peerage in the King's Birthday Honours.

500|$|In {{order to}} avoid a {{confrontation}} over the naval budget, the Dutch Government postponed parliamentary discussions of the Royal Commission's recommendations during 1913 and early 1914. By this time Onze Vloots campaign {{in support of the}} fleet had gained considerable momentum. In late 1913 the Government accepted an offer made by [...] representatives of the Dutch business community to contribute 120,000 guilders towards the cost of a second battleship once parliament approved funding for the first ship. Despite this, the Government continued to delay submitting a plan for the defense of the NEI to parliament, though work continued on it. The main difficulty remained the question of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the fleet. The Minister of the Colonies, Thomas B. Pleyte, believed that the NEI's population needed to be sheltered from the cost of the ships to the extent possible so that funding for welfare projects was not reduced or taxes increased from what were already high levels. In 1914 he settled on a plan under which the necessary revenue would be raised through increasing the taxes on export duties and freight moved by privately owned railways and ships.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> things at the end."
