40|$|The USDA Economic Research Service {{shows that}} 17. 7 % of Pinal County {{residents}} {{are living in}} poverty. Pinal County Cooperative Extension offers a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and an Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) to low-income residents. Through their nutrition education programs, they encourage participants to purchase fresh foods from different locations. Typically, locally grown or locally produced foods are much fresher than imported foods. Local food also preserves open space, reduces food miles, and can support a more diverse and sustainable environment. Research shows that when shopping for their groceries, low-income consumers tend to shop at <b>discount</b> <b>centers</b> and supercenters where prices are lower than alternative locations. Research also shows that low-income SNAP participants who shop at <b>discount</b> <b>centers</b> and supercenters purchase less fresh foods than SNAP participants who shop at alternative locations. This study was created to answer the question, "How does knowledge of environment sustainability affect the purchase of local food in low-income consumers participating in nutrition education programs in Pinal County, Arizona?". The results of surveys suggested there is an association between the behavior of buying locally grown food and a participant's knowledge of environmental sustainability...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} claims that <b>Discount</b> Retail <b>Centers,</b> such as WAL*MART, were {{dramatically}} eliminating small town businesses, annual {{changes in the}} number of retail and wholesale establishments in several small towns within the functional region of a mid-size rural Nebraska city were analyzed to assess their reaction to DRCs that opened in five different regional market centers at eight different times since 1962. Establishment numbers were expected to change in conformance to sales variations suggested in previous studies. DRC host cities were expected to inordinately gain establishments in the years immediately following the openings of their respective DRCs, while experiencing gains or losses in particular retail and wholesale sectors. Non-host towns were expected to inordinately lose establishments after DRCs opened within the region. ^ Annual establishment numbers, however, showed no consistency in the years following DRC openings in market centers of any size. Abnormal establishment changes did not always occur after DRC openings, and, in several instances, occurred at times not associated with a DRC opening. Moreover, the direction of change (positive or negative) in those instances where abnormal changes did occur were inconsistent over time. Patterns of establishment change over time were similar in larger towns, but became increasingly disparate as town size decreased. Sequences of establishment change varied significantly from place to place in no discernible spatial pattern, although towns located along major routes gained establishments after DRC openings slightly more often than towns located elsewhere. There was no reason found to conclude that DRC openings played a dominant role in forcing regional retailing changes {{in terms of the number}} of functions available from place to place within the regional distributional central-place hierarchy. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy {{in the secondary}} prevention of cardiovascular events in the Philippines. MethodsA cost-utility analysis was performed by using Markov modeling in the secondary prevention setting. The models incorporated efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy demonstrated in randomized controlled trials and mortality rates obtained from local life tables. Average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained for simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and gemfibrozil. The costs of the following were included: medications, laboratory examinations, consultation and related expenses, and production losses. The costs were expressed in current or nominal prices as {{of the first quarter}} of 2010 (Philippine peso). Utility was expressed in quality-adjusted life-years gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed by using variations in the cost <b>centers,</b> <b>discount</b> rates, starting age, and differences in utility weights for stroke. ResultsIn the analysis using the lower-priced generic counterparts, therapy using 40 mg simvastatin daily was the most cost-effective option compared with the other therapies, while pravastatin 40 mg daily was the most cost-effective alternative if the higher-priced innovator drugs were used. In all sensitivity analyses, gemfibrozil was strongly dominated by the statins. ConclusionsIn secondary prevention, simvastatin or pravastatin were the most cost-effective options compared with atorvastatin and gemfibrozil in the Philippines.
