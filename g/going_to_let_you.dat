500|$|Following singer Taylor Swift's win for {{the music}} video [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Female Video, West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and {{declared}} that singer Beyoncé deserved the award for her [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] video. He declared, [...] "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> finish, but Beyoncé {{had one of the}} best videos of all time." [...] West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident. Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from an US urban radio station commented: [...] "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate." [...] Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2015, Marvin Carr, {{better known}} by his stage name, Capo, a {{longtime}} member of Keef's Glo Gang label, {{was shot and}} killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago. Upon killing Capo, the drivers of the vehicle reportedly struck a stroller with 13-month-old Dillan Harris in it, killing the baby instantly. Keef later announced via Twitter that he would be holding a free benefit concert to tribute Capo, as well as encourage concertgoers to donate to Harris' family. Additionally, Keef announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Due to outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music originally intended to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater, faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Keef was [...] "an unacceptable role model" [...] and that his music promoted violence. Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of the Craze Fest event, located in Hammond, Indiana, in an attempt to hold the concert there. Keef's hologram was able to plea for peace in Chicago, stating, [...] "Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. Let the kids grow up," [...] before performing [...] "I Don't Like". Fearing that the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. successfully organized for the city's police to shut down the generators powering Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted saying, [...] "I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was {{he has a lot of}} songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door." [...] Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Keef's First Amendment rights.|$|E

6000|$|When {{he spoke}} again {{his voice was}} less friendly, and he prodded Denton by way of address. [...] "Look see!" [...] he said: [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me show <b>you</b> 'ow to scrap?" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{she said}} it to herself, and Tom neither heard nor saw her. Now, you must not fancy that she was sentimental at all. If you do, and think that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> off <b>you,</b> or me, or any human being when we do wrong, because she is too tender-hearted to punish us, then you will find {{yourself}} very much mistaken, as many a man does every year and every day.|$|R
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> keep talking about the things {{you want to talk about}} and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature. [...] "We're not an open-world game, we're {{never going to be}} an open-world game but; we can try. It's still up in the air how much gameplay we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> wander around. But we aim to let you just ride a thousand miles off into the middle of nowhere and still find action and adventure as you go." [...] Ultimately the feel we want to get is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to feel like that. We aim to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very difficult for us to adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|After these operas, Glass {{began working}} on a symphonic cycle, {{commissioned}} by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> [...] [...] [...] {{be one of those}} opera composers who never write a symphony". Glass responded with two 3-movement symphonies ("Low" [...] , and Symphony No. 2 [...] ); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer's own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album Low (1977), whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in polytonality. He referred to the music of Honegger, Milhaud, and Villa-Lobos as possible models for his symphony. With the Concerto Grosso (1992), Symphony No. 3 (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the Rascher Quartet (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russel Davies), and Echorus (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass's symphony as one of the composer's [...] "most tautly unified works" [...] The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled Heroes (1996), commissioned the American Composers Orchestra. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album [...] "Heroes", 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by Twyla Tharp.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{now that}} we're here," [...] she went on, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>you</b> <b>letting</b> {{every little thing}} {{discourage}} you. I don't see what there was in Mr. Dryfoos's manner to give you any anxiety. He's just a common, stupid, inarticulate country person, and he didn't know how to express himself, as I said in the beginning, and that's the reason he didn't say anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maria, [...] "I {{suppose they}} would; {{but it is}} a great deal better to have money of your own. Besides, suppose that when you get to Liverpool, for some reason or other, your father should not be there. Then, having plenty of money, you could go to a hotel and stay there till your father comes. Or you could ask some one of the {{passengers}} who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> London <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go with him, and you could tell him that you had plenty of money to pay the expenses." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{looked into}} his face with some interest. [...] "What an odd thing!" [...] she remarked. [...] "Why, I should have thought that to-day {{you would have been}} amiability itself.

5000|$|Chamberlain {{delivered}} on his promises. While continuing {{his support of}} civil rights, he made war on government expenses and the high tax levels in the state. He tried to reduce all public officers' wages by a third and used his veto against tax rates that he considered too high. He urged that spending be cut for the lunatic asylum and that many of its inmates be shipped off to county poorhouses. Instead of paying {{so much for the}} penitentiary, he endorsed revival of the convict-lease system. There should only be half as much money for the agricultural college and an end to any state scholarship program. As for the state university, Chamberlain called for dismissing its faculty and replacing them with school teachers. [...] "We only want a good high school," [...] as he put it. His struggles over patronage pitted him against some of the leading African-American Republicans in the legislature and gave him a national reputation. It also made him deep enemies in the party. At one point, it was alleged, a senator rallied his colleagues: [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Chamberlain frighten <b>you</b> off with his cry of reform and economy? Why, gentlemen, there are five years of good stealing in South Carolina yet." ...|$|R

Captain Wilson is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry my girl shortly, and of course he feels just the same about it. So the next {{question}} is, 'What is the best thing we can do for you?' Now, if you have a fancy for squatting, you can come with me up country and learn the business; and this day, twelve-month, I will hand you over the deeds of a range, with five thousand sheep upon it.
