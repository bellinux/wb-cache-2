In 2007 citywide wireless internet coverage began, provided for 10 years by US Internet of Minnetonka to residents for about $20 per month and to businesses for $30.

Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different lifecycle. Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they <b>drop</b> <b>off</b> their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E

5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to <b>drop</b> <b>off.</b> Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E

5|$|Late on March9, Dera passed about 20km (12mi) east of Europa Island, {{although}} the large eye {{passed over the}} island. On March10, Dera attained tropical cyclone status, and after a brief bout of wind shear, the eye became better defined. The cyclone attained peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) on March11, according to the MFR, and 1minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to the JTWC. Despite being located unusually far to the south, Dera maintained its intensity due to warm waters, and it accelerated southeastward due to an approaching cold front. Wind shear increased on March12, and only on that day did water temperatures <b>drop</b> <b>off,</b> causing a marked decrease in intensity and for the eye to dissipate. Late on March12, Dera became extratropical, which continued southeastward along the cold front.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of Pacific City may be explored {{from the start}} of the game, allowing the player to locate the hideouts of each General and Kingpin, which can be made easier by accessing supply points scattered around the city.

Should the player die, they can respawn at any open supply point. While exploring, the player is likely to come across enemy resistance, with their aggressiveness based on how badly the player has damaged that particular gang recently. If the player is too aggressive against the non-gang residents of Pacific City, including the Peacekeepers, they are flagged as rogue, and Agency hit squads are dispatched to take them down.|$|E

5|$|At {{the midway}} point the {{following}} season, Daniel {{was named to}} his second consecutive NHL All-Star Game in January 2012.
