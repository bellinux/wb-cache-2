40|$|ABSTRACT-A semi-implicit time {{integration}} algorithm developed earlier for a {{barotropic model}} {{resulted in an}} appreciable economy of computing time. An extension of this method to baroclinic models is formulated, including {{a description of the}} various steps in the calculations. In the proposed scheme, the temperature is separated into a basic part dependent only on the vertical coordinate and a corresponding perturbation part. All terms involving the perturbation temperature are calculated from current values of the variables, while a centered finite-difference time average is applied to the horizontal pressure gradient, the divergence, and the vertical motion in the remaining terms. This method gives computationally stable integrations with relatively large time steps. The model used to test the semi-implicit scheme does not include topography, precipitation, diabatic heating, and other important physical processes. Five-day <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integrations</b> from real data with time steps of 60 and 30 min show differences of the order of 3 m. These errors are insignificant when compared to other sources of error normally present in most numerical models. Presently, this model produces relatively good short-range predictions, and this is a strong factor in favor of inserting the major physical processes as soon as possible. 1...|$|R
40|$|With {{remarkable}} success, Latin Americans {{have sought}} to impose their free trade policy agenda on a very reluctant and internally fractious United States. They have an ally in President George W. Bush, whose senior appointments notably support <b>hemispheric</b> trade <b>integration</b> even as political pressures sometimes have yielded protectionist outcomes. Bush’s trade negotiator, Robert Zoellick, pursues a doctrine of competitive liberalization while accepting some linkage between trade and social and political goals. In negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the administration will have to balance many domestic pressures without alienating Latin America. Ultimately, FTAA ratification will signal a new Western Hemisphere economic-security alliance for the twenty-first century. The United States has long resisted what geography would seem to dictate: a special relationship with Latin America. Frequent rhetorica...|$|R

40|$|The current Americas {{integration}} process is embarked on trade, {{environmental and social}} issues, as manifested in the declaration of principles of 1994 Miami Summit, where sustainability assumes an important role. However, this attempt has essentially been pushed for a free trade agenda as the focal way to reach <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration,</b> beyond NAFTA, and other important sustainable elements have been its importance reduced. The latter is causing asymmetrical unification in the region. If <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration</b> and social cohesion are congruent in building the new agenda, sustainability {{appears to be an}} important tool in reorienting perspectives. In that case, interconnections of biodiversity, indigenous knowledge and intellectual property rights, as presented in this paper, appear as an exercise to unite environmental, social and trade related issues. The latter aims to illustrate that a proper <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration</b> needs to be unified in a sustainable manner.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the process of}} economic integration in the Americas since the Miami Summit of 1994, when negociations toward the setting up of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) were launched, I will start off {{with the issue of}} <b>hemispheric</b> economic <b>integration</b> as it stood fifty years ago, and compare this to what is now recognized as a global order. 1 To set up this comparison, I will establish a clear-cut distinction between a world view and a global view, between the « mondial » and the « global » as we say in French. Subsequently, I will explain why, in order to {{understand the}} implication of the FTAA project, it is important to focus on the features of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) : these features will reveal that the project of free trade is not so much about trade, but about governance. This approach supports the argument that the FTAA plays a central role in setting up a new global order, the spirit of which is so aptly expressed in the introductoty quotation by T. L. Friedman. 1.

40|$|Throughout {{the field}} of neuropsychology, {{evidence}} for complex implicit competence has been documented in patients with neurological damage and limited linguistic, attentional, or mnemonic performance. Such results suggest that systems are activated and carrying out their functions even though this information is no longer available for conscious planning and problem solving. One example {{of this sort of}} competence in the face of impaired behavior is lexical and semantic priming in neurological populations. Results of this sort have been widely reported but their neurological implications and relation to psycholinguistic models of processing have not been made clear. The goal of this symposium is to examine the locus of both preserved and disturbed facilitation from the level of form represented by repetition priming to the level of conceptual knowledge represented by pictures. At the periphery, Dr. Swick’s studies of patients with left and right temporal parietal lesions demonstrate intact repetition priming for words, but an impairment in repetition priming of nonwords in left lesioned patients. Prior work has shown that both word and nonword repetition priming were intact in patients with frontal lobe damage. She hypothesizes that this may be related to a defective phonological store in the left temporal parietal patients which is crucial to establishing a stable representation of the nonword stimuli. Drs.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the level of reduced laterality in language is correlated with the degrees of schizotypal personality in healthy individuals and with their performance in the remote-associate task (RAT).

Analysis revealed correlations between CVC and O-LIFE, as well as between CVC and RAT performance.

40|$|As the {{barriers}} to <b>hemispheric</b> trade and <b>integration</b> are lowered, it will be asked whether we will we hear the "giant sucking sound" of poorer nations luring U. S. and Canadian firms south {{to take advantage of}} low wages and lax environmental regulations? Or, will Latin American nations passively accept this problematical specialization in doing the world's cheap and dirty work? Mexico is the ideal laboratory for such research. Though NAFTA took effect in 1994, trade liberalization in Mexico began long before that. From 1982 to 1996 Mexico transformed itself from one of the most closed {{to one of the most}} open economies in the world. As a first step in such efforts, this paper looks at the relationship between industrial pollution and economic activity in Mexico, compares those results to the United States, and draws out implications for the FTAA. The study finds that many of the industries deemed the dirtiest in the world economy are actually cleaner in Mexico than in the US, and the industries labeled the cleanest are dirtier in Mexico. To generalize, this exhibits that trade liberalization can have both positive and negative environmental effects in developing economies. Sectors where plant vintage determines pollution levels can benefit from their ability to take advantage of newer technologies after liberalizing trade, as is the case with the Mexican steel industry. However, if pollution is a function of end of pipe technology, as in the paper industry, pollution levels are determined by levels of regulation, enforcement and compliance, which are lower in Mexico.

40|$|Like current {{processes}} in the European Union, integration {{processes in}} the Americas are at present focused on a vision of 'enlargement'. As {{part of a broader}} process of <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration,</b> the central project is to construct by 2005 a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) stretching 'from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego', as George Bush famously put it in his announcement in 1990 of the FTAA's forerunner, the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI). Like EU enlargement, but to a much greater extent, the FTAA project envisions deepened integration among economies of widely disparate sizes and levels of development; and in both regions this deepened integration is premised oil processes of market reform and democratization that have swept Latin America and eastern and central Europe {{over the past couple of}} decades. The FTAA, however, is distinct front the project of European enlargement in two crucial senses. First, the project of European enlargement entails incorporating new countries into the existing structures of the EU. The FTAA, by contrast, does not constitute an enlargement of a bloc or institutional structure already in existence. This is so despite the initial inclinations of the United States towards enlargement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as the template for <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration,</b> thereby constructing a 'hub-spoke' type of integration in which South American, Central American and Caribbean countries would be brought into its orbit through accession to NAFTA. The notion of NAFTA enlargement, however, was quickly vetoed, and it was agreed at the 1998 FTAA trade ministerial meetings in San Jose, Costa Rica, to permit 'bloc bargaining' as the format for subsequent negotiations. Second, and as a result of these developments, the FTAA is distinct from the EU ill that it seeks to build itself on, and thus integrate, existing subregional blocs. This latter characteristic also makes the FTAA unique among contemporary regionalist projects...|$|E

40|$|This Note {{examines}} NAFTA 2 ̆ 7 s {{effort in}} {{meeting the needs of}} the moment (i. e., North American integration) and those of the future (i. e., <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration)</b> regarding the issue of dispute resolution. Dispute resolution is key to any trade agreement; without an effective means of settling specific disputes and enforcing provisions generally, parties will have a little incentive to honor their trade commitments. Moreover, ineffective dispute resolution hurts smaller, less developed countries in agreements with larger, more developed countries, because the larger countries will be tempted to use their economic leverage to solve disputes to the disadvantage of the smaller ones. A strong, rule-based dispute resolution mechanism (DRM) protects the weaker nations from the excesses of the stronger ones. These concerns drive Canada and Mexico to seek reliable DRMs, especially since the alternative General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) DRMs are considered inadequate...|$|E

40|$|In {{order for}} free trade {{as a policy}} to deliver fully on its social promise, it must be both “free” and “trade. ” In fact, it must be free, {{in the sense of}} voluntary, to be trade at all. In other words, for {{normative}} and practical reasons, free trade requires that global economic relations be structured through agreements which reflect the consent of those subject to them. The neoliberal trading system today only imperfectly lives up to this obligation. In this essay, I will examine the role of consent in trade agreements, drawing on examples from CAFTA as representative of important trends in multilateral and <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration</b> systems. I will argue that an investigation into the nature of trade as a human experience reveals that many aspects of current trade law and policy mix what is ostensibly free trade with something else: exploitation, coercion or predation. This has normative implications for the justification of the neoliberal trading system, and practical implications for the analysis and structure of trade agreements and the stability and security of our foreign relations...|$|E
40|$|The most {{long-lived}} satellite set {{of ozone}} observations, to date, is that {{derived from the}} Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) ozone sensor on Nimbus 4 and extends from April 1970 through 1976.

Techniques have been developed to account for these problems, and this paper presents results of the BUV total ozone variations and compares them with those from ground-based observations, specifically the computations of Angell and Korshover (1978). After adjustments for the spatial gaps and comparison with concurrent Dobson ground-based observations, no significant trend was found in the BUV data over the years 1970 - 74.

We also investigated whether this anatomical-clinical relationship was localized topographically on the CC by combining voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging approaches. We assessed patients' global cognitive deterioration and neuropsychiatric symptoms with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Increased global cognitive deterioration during the early course of AD was significantly related to reduced white matter density (p = 0. 004) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (p = 0. 012) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) (p = 0. 017) {{at the level of the}} CC isthmus/splenium.

40|$|This review proposes the ‘attachment and the {{deficient}} <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration</b> hypothesis ’ as {{explanation for}} psychopathy. The hypothesis states that since secure {{attachment to the}} parents {{is essential for the}} proper development of both the hemispheres in children, psychopaths with histories of neglect and abuse are unable to develop efficient interaction of both the hemispheres, important for emotional processing and regulation. Various studies have shown that without an efficient interaction between the two hemispheres psychopaths fail to perform adequately on tasks that require both language abilities and non-verbal emotional processing. The hypothesis also explains why psychopaths will perform inefficiently in conditions that selectively prime the left hemisphere resources as these people would have learnt to rely more on the language based mode of this hemisphere. The childhood of psychopaths is marked by insecure attachment with their parents where the parents fail to respond {{to the needs of the}} preverbal infant thus leading to improper development of the right hemisphere abilities, one of which is decoding and showing appropriate non-verbal emotional signals resembling a pattern shown by the parents. The hypothesis is useful in explaining different findings on laterality in psychopathy as well as answering the nature-nurture debate of the disorder. Research carried out under the proposed framework can be helpful in understanding the nature of the disorder which will be ultimately useful in the prevention of its full blown manifestation...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} Free Trade Area of the Americas {{has come}} to a standstill. Reasons for this reside in three aspects in which the FTAA differs from other regional integration schemes. First, it would combine existing preferential trading arrangements of which NAFTA and MERCOSUR are the two most significant ones. Second, each of the schemes has an undisputed regional leader: the U. S. and Brazil. However, two hegemons do not agree on a common vision for the hemispheric project. Third, the small membership of the two schemes is to be elevated to an area encompassing 34 states, i. e. to a situation of large n. The literature maintains that the provision of a collective good becomes more difficult the larger the number of members party to the scheme. The solution offered for this problem of large n is the existence of either a hegemon or a group of likeminded states to overcome collective action problems. In the case of the Americas, the solution offered by the literature is the very problem for efforts to integrate the hemisphere. The FTAA negotiations are stalled because the attempt to forge collective action among 34 member states is sought by two countries simultaneously. This thesis suggests that the large n problem of <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration</b> will be resolved by the hegemon more successful in subdividing the group size and imposing its vision. The research of this study therefore compares the procedural strategies of the U. S. and Brazil in their quest to shape the substance of the regional schem...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{integration}} {{processes are}} meant to provide a peaceful arena in which sovereign countries voluntarily combine their efforts in areas of mutual concern, creating common regional interests and objectives. Models and ideas, however, do not always result in concrete actions or significant accomplishments. Even the most developed institutional exercise of regional integration, the European Union (EU), is commonly overwhelmed by the contradictions and obstacles of the institutional architecture {{and the interests of}} the member states. The construction of the EU has continued for more than five decades and remains an unfinished project. Despite its ebbs and flows, the assessment of the European integration process is positive and still at the forefront of regional integration experiences. In that regard, what lessons can be learned in the Americas from the European experience? What are the peculiarities and prospects of the integration processes in the Western Hemisphere? What are the conditions necessary for developing integration processes? Some ideas and responses to these questions are provided in the articles of this book, grouped in four sections: <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration,</b> North America, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America. The contributors demonstrate that integration in the sub-regions of the Americas has progressed in varying degrees, and that each integration process is characterized by particular circumstances that constrain further institutional developments, legitimacy and credibility.

40|$|With the aim {{to enable}} more precise {{assessment}} of thermal load calculation, this thesis summarizes the methods for evaluating, from {{the perspectives of}} calculation and measurement, the solar shading performance against oblique incidence in a way that takes into account the frame impact and the multiple reflections of the glasses, which currently have not been considered. Chapter 1 outlines the background and purpose of this research. It includes a literature review and describes the physical theories to be used in this study. Chapter 2 describes a detailed calculating method for solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) at a window opening considering window frame at the time of oblique incidence. Direct solar radiation component was calculated by taking account of incident angle characteristics of the glass, influence of heat reception due to the difference in frame color and that of shadow on the glass surface cast from the frame, in case of insolation which was received on the window surface by both vertical and oblique incidence. As the result, it has been proved that influence of heat reception due to difference in frame color doesn’t have to be taken in to account for the calculation, since it is negligible. Diffuse solar radiation component was found that less than approximately 0. 81 times of that obtained by vertical incidence as a result of incident angle calculation by <b>hemispheric</b> <b>integration,</b> while considering the characteristics of window which is mounted vertically against the ground. Chapter 3 describes an apparatus which is able to easily measure SHGC for oblique incidence on the field by using actual product. Even though there was some difference between the results of measurement and calculation since not all phenomena were measured in detail, it has been proved that a tendency similar to the case of calculation appears on measurement result data. The result indicates that it is acceptable to use the calculating method for both direct solar radiation component and diffuse solar radiation component. Further, we’ve performed comparison with theoretical calculation by organizing heat transmission coefficient (U-Value), radiative heat transfer coefficient and the like from field measurement data. Chapter 4 as a non- window opening, describes the calculation method for the thermal performance of curtain wall considering frame. Because there are no established international standards, was examined on the basis of European standards about how to take the heat transfer area and the scope of the analysis model. Also, the calculation method of the generic window frames was applied to curtain wall frames, examined how to calculate the heat shield performance and thermal insulation performance. After considering six different frame structures, spandrel panels with openings, showed that there are common trends, respectively. Chapter 5 describes a simplified calculation method, can be used to calculate the heat load of the building 2 ̆ 7 s curtain wall frame. Based on detailed calculations in Chapter 4, we proposed a simplified calculation method. Moreover, SHGC of the waist, because it consists of a glass surface, SHGC calculation of the wall in the PAL has been underestimated. Therefore, we proposed a simplified calculation method for the glass curtain wall. The difference between detailed calculation method and Simplified calculation method, showed that within a few...|$|E
