40|$|Profit {{distribution}} {{is one of}} the most debatable subjects in financial field. Opposite theoretical models that sometimes, do not have a strong empirical support look for the explanation of corporate dividend policy. In this paper, the relationship between profit sharing policy and auditor`s and managers’ <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> is studied. The study gathers the necessary information of 99 firms listed on Tehran Stock Exchange over the period 2002 - 2011. The implementation of regression analysis shows that there was more explanatory power of auditors’ <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> than managers’ <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> in dividends. The results also show that there was no meaningful difference between auditors` <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> and managers` <b>expected</b> <b>profit...</b>|$|R

We use this function to derive those values of the service capacity which give the highest level of optimal <b>expected</b> <b>profit.</b>|$|R
2500|$|General Ralph Abercromby, the {{commander}} of the forces committed to the [...] "great push" [...] in the West Indies hesitated over which island to attack when he arrived in Barbados on 17 March 1796 before he dispatched a force under Major General Gordon Forbes to Port-au-Prince. Forbes's attempt to take the French-held city of Leogane ended in disaster as the French had built a deep ditch with palisades while Forbes had neglected to bring along heavy artillery. The French commander, the mulatto General Alexandre Pétion proved to be an excellent artilleryman, who used the guns of his fort to sink two of the three ships-of-line under Admiral Hyde Parker in the harbour, before turning his guns to the British forces; a French sortie led to a British rout and Forbes retreating back to Port-au-Prince. In the meantime, as more and more ships bringing troops committed to the [...] "great push" [...] arrived, more and more soldiers died of yellow fever. By 1 June 1796, of the 1, 000 from the Sixty-sixth regiment, only 198 had not been infected with yellow fever and of the 1, 000 men of the Sixth-ninth regiment, only 515 were not infected with yellow fever. Abercromby predicated that at the current rate of yellow fever infection, all of the men from the two regiments would be dead by November. Ultimately, 10, 000 British soldiers had arrived in Saint Domingue by June, but besides for some skirmishing near Bombarde, the British remained put in Port-au-Prince and other coastal enclaves while yellow fever continued to kill them all off. The government attracted much criticism about the mounting costs of the expedition to St. Domingue in the House of Commons, and in February 1797, General John Graves Simcoe arrived to replace Forbes with orders to pull back the British forces to Port-au-Prince. As the human and financial costs of the expedition mounted, more and more people in Britain demanded a withdrawal from St. Domingue, which was devouring money and soldiers while failing to produce the <b>expected</b> <b>profits.</b>|$|E

40|$|A simple {{stochastic}} model of an insurer 2 ̆ 7 s underwriting and related investment operations {{is used to}} determine the optimal amounts of written premiums for one period for the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s book of business. The written premium for each class is determined by the solution of a constrained optimization problem. The insurer 2 ̆ 7 s objective function is the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> on a book of business over the period. The insurer has a safety constraint where a certain portion of capital and surplus can be depleted with a small probability. This paper provides an explicit solution for optimum <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> and corresponding written premiums by classes.

We demonstrate that the iterates of our stochastic approximation algorithms converge to a stationary point of the total <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> function with probability one. Our computational experiments indicate that the bid prices computed by our approach perform quite well. ...|$|R
30|$|Thus, the {{performance}} evaluation {{function of the}} divisional manager {{is equal to the}} local profit plus the transferred amount multiplied by the transfer price. In a more general case, this is equal to the local <b>profit</b> plus the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> of the other division (the relevant part marked by a*) or rather the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> of the entire company. At the reporting stage, it is rather obvious that both of the divisions are interested in sending a report which leads to maximizing the total <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> rather than the local profit as in the classical Hirshleifer setting. In fact, it is a Nash equilibrium to report truthfully about the production schedules.|$|R

50|$|Financial {{fragility}} levels move {{together with}} the business cycle. After a recession, firms have lost much financing and choose only hedge, the safest. As the economy grows and <b>expected</b> <b>profits</b> rise, firms {{tend to believe that}} they can allow themselves to take on speculative financing. In this case, they know that profits will not cover all the interest all the time. Firms, however, believe that profits will rise and the loans will eventually be repaid without much trouble. More loans lead to more investment, and the economy grows further. Then lenders also start believing that they will get back all the money they lend. Therefore, they are ready to lend to firms without full guarantees of success.|$|E

40|$|A {{major issue}} that dominates the current {{thinking}} of catalogers {{is how to}} send mail more efficiently {{in order to increase}} response rates and decrease wasteful mailing activity. Currently cataloguers assume that a mailing decision should be made when <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> (or lifetime value) is positive or at best when <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> exceeds a certain threshold.

We suggest that a customer be sent the current catalog only if the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> with the current catalog exceeds the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> without the current catalog. We develop, estimate, and test a hazard function model with unobserved heterogeneity to estimate the sensitivity of the customers' purchase intensity to catalog drop and to other factors.

We find that it is better to send (not too many but) a few catalogs with (not too long but) a moderate amount of time between them in order to encourage purchases...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of demand {{uncertainty}} on optimal decisions and the <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> of a price-setting newsvendor who faces either additive or multiplicative stochastic demand. Our key findings are as follows. (1) A stochastically larger demand may even lead to a smaller order size and a lower profit when price is endogenous. (2) A stochastically larger demand will lead to a higher selling price in general for the additive demand case but to a lower selling price under certain mild conditions for the multiplicative demand case. Moreover, if the larger demand can be represented by a transformation of the lower one, it will lead to a higher <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> for both demand cases. However, except for the setting with a zero shortage cost, a larger demand may not necessarily result in a higher <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> in general. (3) Under mild conditions, a less variable demand will lead to a higher and lower selling price for the additive and multiplicative demand case, respectively, and a higher <b>expected</b> <b>profit</b> for both cases.
