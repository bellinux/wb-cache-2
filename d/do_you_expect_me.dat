2500|$|Bouazizi, {{angered by}} the confrontation, went to the governor's office to {{complain}} and to ask for his scales back. The governor refused to see or listen to him, even after Bouazizi was quoted as saying, [...] "If you don't see me, I'll burn myself." [...] Bouazizi then acquired a can of gasoline from a nearby gas station {{and returned to the}} governor's office. While {{standing in the middle of}} traffic, he shouted, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to make a living?" [...] He then doused himself with the gasoline and set himself alight with a match at [...] local time, less than an hour after the altercation.|$|E
2500|$|French {{at first}} {{reported}} to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their [...] "last card" [...] and the BEF were holding them off. [...] He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps [...] "might go during the night", {{although he did}} send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French [...] "believed what he wished to believe" [...] and [...] "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp". [...] He thought [...] "everything was going splendidly" [...] and [...] "the Germans were exhausted" [...] until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?" ...|$|E
60|$|HARRY. I don't know. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to guess}} what is {{at the back of}} a Chinese brain? She's hated me always.|$|E
6000|$|... "No liqueurs, thanks," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to-night? I don't {{think that}} I {{ought to have}} come, ought I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Se√±or Perkins {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} respectfully as to Donna Dolores, but scornfully of an unbusiness-like sex. [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to institute a comparison?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to be {{interested}} in?" [...] my father inquired. [...] "I was absorbed in the fowl. Favor me by returning to the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Major, {{stand up}} {{straight}} and behave yourself! How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to sponge your vest when you're wriggling around in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Campbell, triumphantly: [...] "Exactly! And now <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe}} you haven't been at that decanter? Where do you suppose you put it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (obstinately). Yes, lies. (He {{sits down}} again beside her.) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe that}} you are the most {{beautiful}} woman in the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED, tragically: [...] "Still! How soon <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to stop? I am {{here on the}} sofa, where I flung myself {{two hours}} ago, and I don't think I shall ever get up. There is no reason WHY I ever should." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What else <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to do?" [...] he cried, as if {{suddenly}} {{driven to}} despair. [...] "Have I {{the power to}} do more? Am I a general with an army at my back?--miserable sinner that I am to be despised by you at last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to {{come again}} so soon?" [...] said Tito, {{inclined}} {{to make her}} prattle. He still felt {{the effects of the}} agitation he had undergone--still felt like a man who has been violently jarred; and this was the easiest relief from silence and solitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you reciting a {{catalogue}} of your crimes, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to get up and}} cheer? What is a rugger blue, to start with?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Barbara laughed softly. [...] "Don't {{you think}} the {{question}} is a little difficult, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to present you with a catalogue of your virtues?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go too far," [...] Sylvia warned him. [...] "But I'd better {{understand}} the situation. How long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to be amiable to the man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never saw}} such a fellow {{in all my}} life!' cried John. 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean by saying THAT over and over again? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to be, I wonder! Here, sit down, Tom, and be a {{reasonable}} creature. How are you, my boy? I am delighted to see you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{replied the}} figure, {{supporting}} a prettily rounded chin on her hands, as {{she laid her}} elbows complacently on the wall,--"well, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect?</b> Did <b>you</b> want <b>me</b> to stand here all night, while you skulked moonstruck under a tree? Or <b>did</b> <b>you</b> look for me to call <b>you</b> by name? <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to shout out, 'Capt. Allan Brewster--'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} general relentlessly, [...] "that {{you have never}} {{attempted}} any defence. That has been to your credit with me. It inclined me to overlook your unwarranted course in writing to my daughter, when you told her you would never see her again. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to think, after that, of your coming back to see her? Or didn't <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to know it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to say?" [...] he asked, {{regarding}} {{her with}} some amusement and appreciation. She was alluringly pretty in her rather elaborate light dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if you hain't got {{any light}} of yourself, and you don't believe the Lord {{can give you}} any, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to do for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{want to be}} reasonable," [...] he protested. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to get in, when he's {{holding off}} the two of you, and you've got arms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am--alas!--most fully {{conscious}} of this danger you speak of. But--what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> of <b>me?</b> Why bear me your grievance? I am no statesman." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, {{looking out}} of the window: [...] "You know very well what you've <b>done.</b> <b>You</b> can't <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to humiliate myself by putting your offence into words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know it {{was wrong}} to tell whoppers," [...] he sobbed. [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to {{know it was}} wrong? All Mr. Sprott's {{children}} told them REGULAR every day, and cross their hearts too. I s'pose Paul Irving never tells whoppers and here I've been trying awful hard {{to be as good as}} him, but now I s'pose you'll never love me again. But I think you might have told me it was wrong. I'm awful sorry I've made you cry, Anne, and I'll never tell a whopper again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Somers: [...] "Well, no, then. I don't {{believe you}} would be a bore, if you knew it. Is that enough? or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to say {{something}} more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Skene," [...] said Lydia then, penetratingly; [...] "when {{you came}} to pay me this visit, what object did you propose to yourself? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to do?" [...] {{demanded the}} girl. [...] "Do you want ME {{to go to}} Irene and tell her that I've got him away from her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you want}} {{it so much that}} you won't even take it when it's pressed on <b>you.</b> How long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> seriously <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to bear it?" [...] Nick repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, good heavens, {{consider}} my position! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> seriously <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to lie in}} bed while <b>you</b> <b>do</b> all the work, and then to take a half share in the reward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are either}} an astonishingly ingenuous person, Mr. Laverick," [...] his visitor declared, [...] "or you're too subtle for <b>me.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to believe that}} you are in this with your eyes blindfolded? <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to believe that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know what is in that sealed envelope? Bah! It is a child's game, that, and we play as men with men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Hewson, giving himself time {{to realize}} that he was the psychical hero of two hemispheres. [...] "Well," [...] he resumed [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home!" [...] he sneered, looking about. [...] "Do {{you expect}} me to call this place home? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to hang about this scrubby hole to be disciplined by your Voices?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by that, you scoundrel?--Didn't I give you back your tobacco? Isn't that your tobacco lying there? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> to pay for what I did not take?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{alluded to}} them yourself. You {{know that they}} cannot be forgotten. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect?</b> Let <b>me</b> also talk to you in figurative language. It happens {{sometimes}} that a tree is struck by lightning and killed in an instant--leaf, branch, and root--killed and turned to dust and ashes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Brooke, [...] "I'll try it, {{but that}} brings us to the question, what else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> from <b>me?</b> It is very {{probable}} that I shall make an unfortunate mistake for both of us, if you leave me in the dark. I want to understand the position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Rujub. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>expect</b> <b>me</b> {{to remain}} indoors, I hope, for I should wear myself out if I {{were obliged to}} wait here doing nothing." ...|$|R
