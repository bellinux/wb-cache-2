50|$|In a {{conventional}} Otto cycle engine, each cylinder performs all <b>four</b> <b>strokes</b> per <b>cycle.</b> This means that two revolutions of the crankshaft {{are required for}} each power stroke.

40|$|Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) {{has been}} used to analyze the {{occurrence}} and the causes of cycle-to-cycle combustion variations in a spark-ignited four-valve single cylinder engine fuelled with a homogeneous propane-air mixture. The combus-tion modeling combines an Eulerian model derived from the RANS AKTIM model that mimics the spark ignition and the Extended Coherent Flame Model (ECFM-LES) that describes the flame propagation. The motion of piston and valves is accounted for using an Arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian (ALE) technique with body-fitted meshes. The computation covers ten consecutive complete <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycles.</b> The obtained LES results are compared with experimental measurements.

40|$|Abstract�Skip {{cycle is}} a working {{strategy}} for spark ignition engines, which allows changing the effective stroke of an engine through skipping {{some of the}} <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycles.</b> This study proposes a new mechanism to achieve the desired skip-cycle strategy for internal combustion engines. The air and fuel leakage, which occurs through the gas exchange, negatively affects {{the efficiency of the}} engine at high speeds and loads. An absolute sealing is assured by direct use of poppet valves, which are kept in fully closed position during the skipped mode. All the components of the mechanism were designed according to the real dimensions of the Anadolu Motor��� gasoline engine and modeled in 3 D by means of CAD software. As the mechanism operates in two modes, two dynamically equivalent models are established to obtain the force and strength analysis for critical components...|$|R
50|$|A valve job is an {{operation}} which is performed on any <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> internal combustion engine, {{the purpose of}} which is to resurface the mating surfaces of the poppet valves and their respective valve seats that control the intake and exhaust of the air/fuel mixture that powers the motion of the pistons after the start cycle.|$|E
50|$|Although {{obsolete}} for piston-ported two-stroke engines, crossflow scavenging is {{now very}} common in four stroke engines, where their inlet and exhaust valves are mounted {{on opposite sides of}} the cylinder head. As the inlet and exhaust strokes of the <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> happen on different strokes of the piston—the upward exhaust stroke, pushing exhaust gases out, is followed by the downward inlet stroke allowing the fresh charge in—the flow is as two isolated single flows, rather than as an unstable loop.|$|E
5000|$|Combustion: {{also known}} as power or {{ignition}} This {{is the start of}} the second revolution of the <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycle.</b> At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.|$|E

50|$|The Beare-head engine {{internal}} combustion engine technology combines a four-stroke engine bottom end with a ported cylinder head closely resembling that of a two-stroke engine.

5000|$|During 2003/2004 winter testing, Yamaha {{stepped up}} to the plate by pulling out all the stops in their {{collaboration}} with Rossi and Burgess. Through a systematic regime of innovation and testing, they sought to refine the M1's traditionally strong traits such as good braking and quick handling (which impressed Rossi), and marry them with good balance and transition to power. Working closely with Rossi and Burgess, Yamaha engineers under YZR-M1 project leader Koichi Tsuji experimented with a number of engine modifications in an attempt to fix the power delivery, and finally it was decided to go ahead with a four valve per cylinder head configuration (as opposed to the earlier five valve head), with a specially refined cylinder firing order. This turned the straight four cylinder engine from a traditional [...] "screamer", where the power pulses are spaced equally (every 180 crank degrees) in the <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> into a so-called [...] "long bang" [...] engine where the power pulses are grouped unevenly across the cycle (270-180-90-180). This firing order mimics the constant kinetic energy of a V4 engine while maintaining the desirable engine packaging of a traditional inline four cylinder. These developments significantly improved the torque characteristics of the engine, and coupled with slight changes to the position of the engine in the chassis, made the M1 much easier to control at the limit of adhesion while exiting corners. After a frantic winter of development and testing, the team showed the world that they had made a significant step in the right direction, when Rossi and the M1 won the BMW car at the 2004 pre season IRTA test at Catalunya, by posting the fastest lap of the open session (similar to normal race qualifying).|$|E

40|$|Presented {{here are}} the results of {{performance}} tests made with a single-cylinder, <b>four</b> <b>stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> compression-ignition engine. These tests were made on a precombustion chamber type of cylinder head designed to have air velocity and tangential air flow in both the chamber and cylinder. The performance was investigated for variable load and engine speed, type of fuel spray, valve opening pressure, injection period and, for the spherical chamber, position of the injection spray relative to the air flow. The pressure variations between the pear-shaped precombustion chamber and the cylinder for motoring and full load conditions were determined with a Farnboro electric indicator. The combustion chamber designs tested gave good mixing of a single compact fuel spray with the air, but did not control the ensuing combustion sufficiently. Relative to each other, the velocity of air flow was too high, the spray dispersion by injection too great, and the metering effect of the cylinder head passage insufficient.
