40|$|Synopsis: Both {{short and}} {{long-term}} performances of repaired or strengthened concrete structures using external FRP bonding are greatly affected by states of bonding substrates, which are covercrete and may have experienced various damages. One of them is <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in cold regions. This paper intends to investigate how the initial <b>frost</b> <b>damages</b> in concrete influence the static and fatigue bond performances of CFRP/concrete interfaces. Concrete specimens were exposed to freeze and thaw cycles before being bonded with CFRP sheets. The initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> of concrete was controlled approximately at three different levels {{in terms of its}} relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, which was 100 % (non <b>frost</b> <b>damage),</b> 85 % and 70 %, respectively. Test results showed that failure modes of CFRP/concrete bonded joints with initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in concrete were the delamination of covercrete. By contrast the joints without initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> failed in a thin concrete layer as usual. Moreover, CFRP/concrete joints with and without initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> showed different manners in their interface bonding strength and stiffness. If the initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> existed in concrete substrate the effective bond length of CFRP/concrete joints was increased due to the decrease of the bonding stiffness and interfacial fracture energy. Fatigue testing results indicated that the linear slopes of S-N curves of CFRP/concrete bonded joints were not influenced by the initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> The initial <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> did not shorten the fatigue life of CFRP/concrete joints if a same relative tensile stress level was kept in the FRP sheets, where the relative tensile stress level was defined as a ratio of the applied tensile force in FRP sheets for the fatigue tests to the maximum static pullout one achieved in each test series...|$|R

Lack of historical weather data required a theoretical-empirical approach. <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> for any specific day of the season was assumed to occur when the minimum temperature on that day was below the specific lethal temperature for the phenological stage predicted at that moment (based on phenological models). <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> probability was estimated for each production location of South Patagonia as the frequency of seasons in which at least one <b>damaging</b> <b>frost</b> (<b>damaging</b> 90 % of the reproductive organs) occurs, at any time during the growing season until harvest. <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk was compared among cultivars and locations. Finally, the effect of active frost control methods on <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk reduction was analyzed. There was very little difference in <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> risk among cultivars, although 'Sunburst' was the cultivar with the lowest risk. The most risky locations were Los Antiguos and Esquel, while Comodoro Rivadavia was the safest location. The frequency of years with at least one killing frost decreased dramatically when the minimum temperature was increased by 3 °C, using active frost control systems.

Thus, this type of quantitative analysis can support growers in decision-making on required investments and operational costs of the equipment for frost control, on the basis of potential impact of a particular control system on mean yields and yield stability.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{durability}} issues gained more interest {{and the necessity of}} reliable and suitable models for the prediction of concrete behaviour on time has grown. One of the most severe deterioration processes that may affect concrete structures is caused by freezing-and-thawing cycles. The causes and mechanisms of frost damaging process have been deeply studied during {{the last decades}} and different theories have been developed to describe the physical process of damaging due to frost action. Nevertheless very little attention has been given to the effect of frost attack on the behaviour of reinforced concrete (R/C) structures and on the material characteristics and bond properties of concrete. Recent studies showed that frost action leads to a reduction of compressive and tensile strength, an increasing of peak strain and fracture energy and a reduction of bond strength.

40|$|The {{objectives}} were: {{to review}} the successional behaviour of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) - trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michxt) stands in the literature, to conduct field studies of the successional behaviour of planted white spruce in aspen stands, and to test hexazinone herbicide {{as a means of}} modifying the postlogging environment to release white spruce and other conifers. Five and 13 year old white spruce plantations were selected for study. Fifty square random plots were established in each plantation. Total and mean aspen and white spruce volumes per plot were calculated. Each plantation was stratified into 3 components or "Situation Types" based on aspen density. Five plots were established at both plantations in each of these Types. These "Situation Plots" were circular and selected so that a white spruce tree was located at each plot centre. The central white spruce and the mean aspen tree on each "Situation Plot" were cut down for stem analysis. The number of <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> tips per m[superscript 2] crown area on each central white spruce tree were calculated. The mean and total aspen volumes per plot are not related to the white spruce volumes per plot in either plantation. The current annual increment curves of the paired central white spruce and the mean aspen tree from each "Situation Plot" do not show any trends for the 5 year old plantation. Current annual volume increment curves from the 13 year old plantation show that a rapidly growing aspen tree will suppress its white spruce neighbour. The number of <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> tips per m [superscript 2] white spruce crown area significantly decreases as the number of aspen trees per plot increases at the 5 year old plantation. This relationship was not strong at the 13 year old plantation. This information is used to make recommendations for releasing white spruce from trembling aspen competition with hexazinone herbicide. Factorial herbicide trials were established in the field and greenhouse to evaluate the effect of hexazinone herbicide on white spruce and trembling aspen. Trials were also established to evaluate the effect of hexazinone on black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), willow (Salix spp.) and beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta Marsh.), Various hexazinone rates, forms, spacings and spray positions were tested. Hexazinone 'Gridball' pellets and hexazinone concentrated solution (DPX-LX or LE) were the herbicide forms used. White spruce, black spruce and jack pine were found to be quite tolerant to hexazinone herbicide. Hexazinone did not reduce the survival or height growth of the white spruce significantly except in the greenhouse trial. Jack pine and black spruce were only significantly affected at the highest rates. In the greenhouse trial, the high hexazinone rates applied to the foliage and soil significantly reduced the survival and the foliage dry weight of both white spruce and jack pine. Most rates of hexazinone applied caused a significant reduction in height growth, survival and foliage dry weight of the aspen, willow and hazel.

40|$|Concrete {{undergoing}} early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in {{cold weather}} will experience significant loss of not only strength, but also of permeability and durability. Accordingly, concrete codes like ACI- 306 R prescribe a minimum compressive strength and duration of curing to prevent <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> {{at an early age}} and secure the quality of concrete. Such minimum compressive strength and duration of curing are mostly defined based on the strength development of concrete. However, concrete subjected to <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> at early age may not show a consistent relationship between its strength and durability. Especially, since durability of concrete is of utmost importance in nuclear power plant structures, this relationship should be imperatively clarified. Therefore, this study verifies the feasibility of the minimum compressive strength specified in the codes like ACI- 306 R by evaluating the strength development and the durability preventing the <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> of early age concrete for nuclear power plant. The results indicate that the value of 5 MPa specified by the concrete standards like ACI- 306 R as the minimum compressive strength to prevent the early <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> is reasonable in terms of the strength development, but seems to be inappropriate in the viewpoint of the resistance to chloride ion penetration and freeze-thaw.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the diverse experimental {{methods and results}} on the deformational behavior of the phases of concrete (mortar, aggregate and interfacial transition zone - ITZ) in meso-scale during freeze-thaw cycle (FTC). The FTC damage in concrete {{has long been a}} durability related problem in cold region like here in Hokkaido. This is why there is a large volume of research to clarify and understand the frost damage in concrete. However in spite of the large volume of research there are no consensus on the damage mechanism of concrete due primarily to concrete’s heterogeneous characteristics and the complex behavior of moisture during FTC. With this regard, it is {{the purpose of this study}} to present the deformational behavior of the constituent part of concrete (mortar, aggregate and ITZ) which is believed to be distinct from each of the other to clarify each of their role during FTC and the overall deformation of concrete. Unlike the common methodology in frost damage in concrete, specimens were sealed in the experiment so that moisture and temperature can be controlled. In addition, meso-scale size specimens are used in this study. The meso-scale size can be used to simulate the frost actions in a specific (localized) location of a bulk sample with conditions similar with the data used. Specimens were subjected to FTC under different moisture conditions. The increase in void ratio and decrease in elastic modulus associated with frost damage have been investigated and are related to the CTE change of <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> specimens. The study also investigates the deformational behavior of the ITZ which have not been presented in the microstructural investigation of concrete. The behavior of aggregate during FTC has been investigated as well. Based on the experimental results, the findings indicate that the deformational behavior of the specimens under FTC is primarily dependent on the amount of its moisture. The larger the amount of moisture, the larger will be the resulting deformation in both expansion and contraction behavior. The expansion during FTC is understood and pointed to be caused by the hydraulic pressure caused by ice formation during FTC. The contraction phenomena is also observed prior to the expansion. Due to constant moisture content, a limitation in the increase in tensile strain is observed during FTC and this tensile strain decreases until contraction is observed. The contraction is attributed to the removal of gel pore water arising from negative pressures. With an increased pore volume (void ratio) due to microcracks arising from frost damage and more importantly absence of available water supply, the specimens becomes partially saturated and the displaced pore water cannot be refilled, thus the sample cannot re-expand and results in contraction at the end of the FTC. After FTC tests, results show that the CTE of <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> mortar increases and its elastic modulus decreases which are primarily caused by microcracking when frost damage takes place. The reduction in elastic modulus has been related to the increase in void ratio which re{{presents the}} formation of microcracks of <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> specimens. Microcracks act as broken bridges or links which can detach the aggregate from the hardened cement paste and in effect reduces (or removes) the thermal restraint that fine aggregate and cement paste exerts on the other. The hardened cement paste can then expand or contract more freely under temperature variation, and thus can significantly affect (increase) the CTE of the whole composite (mortar). The stress transfer in the material is prevented as well due to microcracking resulting in elastic modulus reduction. One the one hand, the aggregates did not indicate considerable permanent deformation during the whole FTC though the specimens were conditioned to be fully saturated. This verifies the common acceptable knowledge that aggregate are unaffected by frost damage. The ITZ deformation is determined as distinct (being far higher) from the mortar and aggregate which is the crucial reason why the ITZ is treated as a separate phase in concrete. Besides its weaker strength, the much higher deformation of the ITZ during FTC where cracking and prominent damage are initiated and could extend to the matrix shows the important role of the ITZ during frost damage and other factors such as wet dry cycles (WDC). The obtained deformational behavior of the ITZ, mortar, and aggregate in this investigation reflects their commonly described behavior during FTC. The ITZ and mortar deformation agrees well with the observations on the occurrence of cracks for frost-damaged specimens and non-occurrence of cracks for dry specimens. These indicates the reliability of the presented method and suggests that the experimental method can be used as a basis to obtain the deformational behavior of mortar, aggregate and ITZ during FTC. Significantly, the results presented here are first and a complete data on the deformational behavior of mortar, aggregate, and ITZ have not yet been presented. The results and methodology presented in this study is therefore important in clarifying, understanding and simulation of frost damage in concrete...|$|E
40|$|Fall {{frost damage}} {{is a major}} threat to maize (Zea mays L.) seed {{production}} in the central United States. Frost events prior to harvest can cause various physical, mechanical, biochemical, and physiological changes to immature seed corn. These changes can lead to decreased germination and vigor. Early detection of frost damage could reduce the financial loss caused by poor emergence when these seed lots are planted. The central hypotheses of this dissertation are that the severity of a frost event can be quantified shortly after seed has been harvested and dried, and that the magnitude of the damage is associated with seed development and genetic background of the seed. This information can be used to predict field emergence of frosted seed lots. Many different aspects of frost damage have been explored in this project, which provides several methods for identifying frost damage in maize seed. This project advances our understanding of seed physiology as related to frost damage and changes in physiology during seed maturation.

In order to predict effects of frosts, it is desirable to know the stages of development at which broccoli plants are most susceptible to freezing injury. In this study, {{the effect of a}} range of sub-zero temperatures for a short period at different stages of crop development were assessed and quantified in terms of mortality, yield and quality of broccoli. Whole plants in pots or in the field were subjected to sub-zero temperature regimes from - 1 to - 19 degrees C. Extracellular ice formation was achieved by reducing temperatures slowly, at - 2 degrees C per hour. The floral initiation stage was most sensitive to freezing injury, as yields (fresh and dry head weights) were significantly reduced at - 1 and - 3 degrees C, and the shoot apices were killed at - 5 degrees C. There was no significant yield reduction when the inflorescence buttoning stage was treated at - 1 and - 3 degrees C. Although shoot apices survived the - 5 degrees C treatment at buttoning, very poor quality heads of uneven bud size were produced as a result of arrested development. The lethal temperature for pot-grown broccoli was between - 3 and - 5 degrees C, whereas the lethal temperature for field-grown broccoli was between - 7 and - 9 degrees C. The difference was presumably due to variation in cold acclimation. Freezing injury can reduce broccoli head yield and quality and retard plant growth.

However, an uncertainty was the extension and distribution of the damaged region which affected the prediction of the load capacity. ...|$|R
40|$|Meso-scale {{constitutive}} {{models of}} frost-damaged concrete are developed {{in this study}} through numerical simulation using a two-dimensional Rigid Body Spring Model (RBSM). The aim of the simulation is to predict the macro behavior of frost-damaged concrete subjected to mechanical loading. The models also clarify the difference in failure behavior of concrete with and without <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> Zero strength elements {{and the concept of}} meso-scale plastic tensile strain are introduced into the normal RBSM springs to consider the experimentally observed cracking and plastic deformation caused by <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> The difference in the effect of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> on compression and tension behavior as found in the experiments is clearly predicted. Finally, analysis of a notched beam subjected to bending after different degrees of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> is carried out. The resulting load-deflection curves agree well with those obtained in the experiments. These good correlations confirm the applicability of the meso-scale model for predicting the macro behavior of frost-damaged concrete...|$|R
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Not usually {{cultivated}} as animal feed. Japanese radishes & kale {{are produced}} as feed for livestock. When market prices are low or crops are damaged by hail, etc., {{it is sometimes}} fed to stock. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Turnips, radishes, cabbages, cauliflowers, and Brussel sprouts (Brassicaceae) are all vegetables which are produced for human consumption. They do not grow naturally in the wild. The tubers of some are utilised, (turnips, radishes, etc.), while the leaves and flowers and fruit of others are consumed (cabbages, cauliflowers, etc.). Weeds like wild radish and wild mustard do grow wild. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Haemopoietic: • The toxic principle of the Brassicaceae is dimethyl disulphide produced from SMCO. • Dimethyl disulphide reacts with the thiol group of GSH which is then not available to prevent oxidative damage of the red blood cell. • With oxidative damage the haemoglobin is denatured and the protein precipitate as Heinz bodies. • The affected erythrocytes are removed by the RE-system or intravascular haemolysis ensues resulting in haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria. Urogenital: Organic nitriles and glucosinolates are goitrogenic and teratogenic. SYNDROMES: Heinz body anemia. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Haemopoietic and urogenital systems. CLINICAL SIGNS: Acute: • Haemoglobinuria. Pale, anaemic mucous membranes • Icterus (jaundice) • Diarrhoea • Ruminal stasis Chronic: • Subclinical anaemia. • Ill-thrift. • Poor milk production, poor growth, emaciation. • Infertility. NECROPSY: Macroscopical findings: Icterus. Anemia – pale mucous membranes, watery blood. Haemoglobinuria and dark pigmented kidneys. Git irritation. TREATMENT: • Remove feed immediately • Blood transfusion in valuable or stud animals. PREVENTION: • Brassica’s should be fed only in limited quantities • Feed with other good quality hay, concentrate, etc. • Can slowly increase the percentage of Brassica’s in the ration • Avoid <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> plants - may have a higher concentration of the toxic principle.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Not usually {{cultivated}} as animal feed. When {{market prices}} are low or crops are damaged by hail etc., {{it is sometimes}} fed to stock. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: • Onions (Allium cepa), garlic and chives are all bulbous vegetables which are produced for human consumption. • They do not grow naturally in the wild. • The bulbs and/or leaves are edible. • Sometimes it is fed to stock for various reasons, {{or it could be}} part of the left-overs of human meals which is fed to pets. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • The toxic principle of Allium spp. is n-propyl disulphide, which is a non-nitrogenous, pungent, volatile oil, which inhibits the enzyme Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) in the pentose phosphate pathway of the red blood cell. • The synthesis of reduced NADPH is thus stopped. • NADPH is important in the reduction of glutathione (GSH) which is again necessary to protect haemoglobin and the erythrocyte membrane from oxidative damage. • With oxidative damage the haemoglobin is denatured and the protein precipitates as Heinz bodies. • The affected erythrocytes are removed by the RE-system or intravascular haemolysis ensues resulting in haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria. SYNDROMES: Heinz body anemia. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Haemopoietic system. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Especially sheep find onions palatable. • Cats and dogs are sometimes affected, since they could have been fed table scraps. Chronic ingestion results in a haemolytic anaemia and formation of Heinz-bodies. Acute: • Haemoglobinuria. Pale, anaemic mucous membranes. • Icterus (jaundice). • Diarrhoea, Ruminal stasis. Chronic: • Subclinical anaemia. • Ill-thrift. • Poor milk production, poor growth, emaciation • Infertility. NECROPSY: Icterus. Anemia – pale mucous membranes, watery blood. Haemoglobinuria and dark pigmented kidneys. G. i. t. irritation. Treatment: • Remove feed • Blood transfusion in valuable animals. • Symptomatic and supportive. PREVENTION: • Allium spp. should be fed only in limited quantities. • Feed with other good quality hay, concentrate, etc. • Can slowly increase the percentage of Allium spp. in the ration. • Avoid <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> plants - may have a higher concentration of the toxic principles.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available only in print edition. Apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) is a species particularly prone to erratic fruit set and flower bud drop has been repeatedly reported in different cultivars and growing conditions. A number of potential causes have been explored, but a clear main cause remains elusive. However, the fact that bud drop can {{vary depending on the}} year or site suggests that the process is somehow environmentally influenced. In this work bud development and bud damage have been related with frost temperatures during endo and ecodormancy. Two years of experiments showed that as it might be expected, no frost damage was recorded during endodormancy, when the buds are fulfilling their chilling requirements. Likewise, frost damage took place, when frost occurred after bud burst. But unexpectedly, flower buds were particularly vulnerable to frost damage when they enter in ecodormancy, which occurs once chilling requirements are fulfilled but prior to bud swelling. At this time, while no external symptoms were detected in an apparent still quiescent stage, internal damage was observed as perpendicular voids characteristics of ice formation that resulted in browning of tissues in the stamens, pistil or both. Vulnerability appeared concomitantly with the establishment of vascular connections first in the anthers and later in the pistil, and differences between buds in the stage of development explain differences in bud damage for a same frost episode. The proportion of <b>frost</b> <b>damaged</b> buds clearly contributed to the proportion of subsequent bud drop that occurred later. These results provide evidence for the contribution of frost damage to flower bud drop in apricot, showing that there is a stage particularly prone to frost damage, once the buds have completed their chilling requirements and prior to budburst, when the first xylem connections are established. The identification of the cause of a phenomenon that is widespread in this species and that is a limiting factor in cultivar adaptation will contribute to understand and select new cultivars for new areas.

40|$|According to the KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute) {{climate change}} {{will result in}} an {{increase}} of air temperature and rainfall intensities for the Netherlands in winter. Climate change also threatens cultural heritage. The European project 2 ̆ 6 quot;Climate for Culture 2 ̆ 6 quot; (CfC) investigates this impact. Not only the interior and the collection are important to preserve for future generations, but also monumental buildings themselves. The risk of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> to an external building envelope will become less due {{to the increase in}} air temperature. However, the risk of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> rises as a construction will be wet for a longer time due to the increase in rainfall intensities. In this study, a statement will be made about these conflicting <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> effects. Research will be done on the following topics: a) the type of material that is sensitive to frost, b) the conditions under which the material damage occurs, c) the outside climate conditions in future (<b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> winters) and d) the possibility to predicted <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> with a multiphysical model. The methodology was: 1) literature review on frost damage; 2) verification of a coupled heat-moisture model; 3) simulation of case studies to predict frost damage; 4) analysis of the external climate; 5) drawing of conclusions from literature and case studies. <b>Frost</b> <b>damage</b> in a frost-sensitive material may occur after long-term rainfall, immediately followed by severe frost, as excessive internal stresses arise caused by the volume increase due to the phase change of water into ice. Analysis of the external climate for winter periods from 1) data of the past till the present and 2) future data indicate that monthly average air temperatures increase. Also rain intensities increase in the future for winter months. Simulations with a hygrothermal model of external building envelopes with the frost-sensitive material calcium silicate brick show a reduction of the risk of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> in order of magnitude of 70...|$|R
