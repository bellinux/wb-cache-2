5|$|In the Rhineland, Custine {{continued}} the revolution by proclamation, and levied heavy {{taxes on the}} nobility and clergy. During the winter a Prussian army forced him to evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez's treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who gave his country good service. With Robespierre's defense, he was cleared of all charges, and later given command of the Army of the North.|$|E
25|$|An {{extremely}} frugal and <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> Francia {{left the}} state treasury {{with at least}} twice as much money in it as when he took office, including 36,500 pesos of his unspent salary, the equivalent of several years' salary.|$|E
25|$|Repington (whom Wilson {{thought a}} “dirty brute” and “lying brute”) {{attacked}} the current standards of British staff officers in The Times on 27 September 1910, arguing that Wilson had educated staff officers to be “sucking Napoleons” and that Robertson was a “first rate man” who would sort it out. Wilson wrote to Lord Loch (27 September 1910) “we can comfort ourselves with the reflexion {{that to be}} abused by Repington is the highest praise an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> can get”.|$|E

25|$|Brown {{started out}} his career {{working as a}} face in the south, portraying a simple, <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who always backed up his friends. He later portrayed a heel, acting like an arrogant, rich, self-obsessed character. During his career he won a number of singles championships such as NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship and the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship {{as well as a}} number of tag team championships, teaming with Muhammad to win the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship, NWA United States Tag Team Championship and AWA Southern Tag Team Championships.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, King Khalid {{was not an}} {{effective}} leader. Although {{he seemed to be}} reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. King Khalid is also considered to have been a genial caretaker during his reign. However, King Khalid failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. Although he did not have an active interest in affairs of state and his health was not good, he was admired as an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country.|$|E
25|$|Following World War I, circus films became popular. In 1924 He Who Gets Slapped was {{the first}} film {{released}} by MGM; in 1925 Sally of the Sawdust (remade 1930), Variety, and Vaudeville were produced, followed by The Devil's Circus in 1926 and The Circus starring Charlie Chaplin, Circus Rookies, 4 Devils; and Laugh Clown Laugh in 1928. German film Salto Mortale about trapeze artists was released in 1930 and remade in the United States and released as Trapeze starring Burt Lancaster in 1956; in 1932 Freaks was released; Charlie Chan at the Circus, Circus (USSR) and The Three Maxiums were released in 1936 and At the Circus starring the Marx Brothers and You Can't Cheat an <b>Honest</b> <b>Man</b> in 1939. Circus films continued to be popular during the Second World War; films from this era included The Great Profile starring John Barrymore (1940), the animated Disney film Dumbo (1941), Road Show (1941), The Wagons Roll at Night (1941) and Captive Wild Woman (1943).|$|E

25|$|Furious {{at their}} escape, Leontes now {{publicly}} accuses {{his wife of}} infidelity, and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends two of his lords, Cleomenes and Dion, to the Oracle at Delphos for what he is sure will be confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, {{in the hopes that}} the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, Camillo an <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband. Leontes vows {{to spend the rest of}} his days atoning for the loss of his son, his abandoned daughter, and his queen.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} a TV {{interviewer}} how {{he would like to}} be remembered, Shankly replied: [...] "Basically as an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> in a game that is sometimes short on honesty. That I've been working honestly for the people of Liverpool to try and give them entertainment".|$|E
500|$|On April 16, 1894, the Fort Worth Gazette {{wrote that}} Virgil Earp and John Behan had a [...] "deadly feud". It {{described}} Behan as [...] "an <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> a good official, and possessed {{many of the}} attributes of a gentleman". Earp, on the other hand, [...] "was head of band of desperadoes, a partner in stage robbers, {{and a friend of}} gamblers and professional killers... Wyatt was the boss killer of the region." ...|$|E

500|$|Davenport's {{drawings}} left few {{public figures}} unscathed; he even caricatured {{himself and his}} boss, Hearst. [...] Ultimately, Davenport's work became so well recognized for skewering political figures he considered corrupt, that in 1897 his opponents attempted {{to pass a law}} banning political cartoons in New York. [...] The bill, introduced in the state legislature with the prodding of U.S. Senator Thomas C. Platt, (R-NY), did not pass, but the effort inspired Davenport [...] to create one of his most famous works: [...] "No <b>Honest</b> <b>Man</b> Need Fear Cartoons." ...|$|E
500|$|In Cleveland, as {{the speech}} concluded, General Eisenhower turned to RNC Chairman Summerfield, [...] "Well, Arthur, you sure got your money's worth." [...] Mamie Eisenhower was in tears, {{and the general}} told her that Nixon was a {{completely}} <b>honest</b> <b>man.</b> The 15,000supporters waiting for Eisenhower to speak had heard the Checkers speech over the hall's public address system, and when Congressman George H. Bender took the microphone and asked the crowd, [...] "Are you in favor of Nixon?", pandemonium ensued. As the crowd below chanted, [...] "We want Nixon!", Eisenhower quickly revised his speech.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the sermon}} deals {{primarily}} with subjection to higher powers, some of Swift's contemporaries viewed the sermon as political propaganda. John Evans, Bishop of Meath, told the Archbishop of Canterbury {{that he heard}} [...] "a strange sermon... It was somewhat like one of Montaigne's essays, making very free with all orders and degrees of men among us – lords, bishops, [...] men in power. The pretended subjects were pride and humiliation." [...] He later continued to claim that [...] "in short, [...] {{is thought to be}} Tory... all over, which (here) is reckon'd by every <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> Jacobite." ...|$|E

[...] He paused, and then repeated, as though the phrase pleased him: [...] "Every revolution has had its <b>honest</b> <b>men.</b> They are soon disposed of afterwards." ...|$|R

500|$|Johnson's authors became {{increasingly}} frustrated with him {{towards the end}} of his life, Wakefield calling him [...] "heedless, insipid, [...] inactive" [...] and Lindsey describing him as [...] "a worthy and most <b>honest</b> <b>man,</b> but incorrigably [...] neglectful often to his own detriment". Priestley, by then in Pennsylvania, eventually broke off his forty-year relationship with the publisher, when his book orders were delayed several years and Johnson failed to communicate with him regarding the publication of his works. Most of the authors who became upset with Johnson were those writing religious or literary works, the riskiest publishing ventures.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of James (2005), Varma planned to remake Siva. The second remake, also entitled Shiva, featured Mohit Ahlawat and Priyanka Kothari as the characters played by Nagarjuna and Amala in the original. Unlike Siva, the protagonist in the second remake is an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> who joins the Mumbai Police as a new recruit; the cycle-chain scene and Raghuvaran's character were omitted. Shiva received negative reviews; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote that the film [...] "dare to ridiculously rest on the incapable shoulders of a non-acting cast", and nastiness was [...] "defined as a scowling ogre". Director Riingo Banerjee acknowledged Siva {{as a source of}} inspiration for his 2006 Bengali film Kranti.|$|E

On his broadcasting career, Suzuki recalls early interviews that demonstrated an affinity for public speaking and the jobs {{that allowed him to}} travel the world. Regarding his personal life, he describes his relationships with his five children and the development of his two marriages. In a review in the New Zealand Listener, David Larsen observes: [...] "Step by step, you see him thinking his way into full-fledged environmentalism: not because he's a natural zealot, but because he's an intellectually <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> brought face to face with evidence that our current economic and energy policies are digging our grandchildren's graves." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{about the}} age of 17 Josephine went through a {{religious}} crisis, which probably stemmed from an incident in which she discovered the body of a suicide while out riding. She became disenchanted with her weekly church attendance, describing the local vicar as [...] "an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> in the pulpit... taught us loyally all that he probably himself knew about God, but whose words did not even touch the fringe of my soul's deep discontent". Following her crisis, Josephine did not identify with any single strand of Christianity, and remained critical of the Anglican church. She later wrote that she [...] "imbibed from childhood the widest ideas of vital Christianity, only it was Christianity. I have not much sympathy with the Church". She began to speak directly to God in her prayers: ...|$|E
500|$|Republican James Sullivan won the governor's seat from Strong in 1807, but his {{successor}} {{was unable to}} hold the seat in the 1809 election, which went to Federalist Christopher Gore. [...] Gerry stood for election again in 1810 against Gore, and won a narrow victory. [...] Republicans cast Gore as an ostentatious British-loving Tory who wanted to restore the monarchy (his parents had remained Loyal during the Revolution), and Gerry as a patriotic American, while Federalists described Gerry as a [...] "French partizan" [...] and Gore as an <b>honest</b> <b>man</b> devoted to ridding the government of foreign influence. [...] A temporary lessening in {{the threat of war}} with Britain aided Gerry. [...] The two battled again in 1811, with Gerry once again victorious in a highly acrimonious campaign.|$|E
500|$|In 1760 Münchhausen {{retired to}} live as a Freiherr at his estates in Bodenwerder, where he {{remained}} {{until his death in}} 1797. It was there, especially at parties given for the area's aristocrats, that he developed a reputation as an imaginative after-dinner storyteller, creating witty and highly exaggerated accounts of his adventures in Russia. Over the ensuing thirty years, his storytelling abilities gained such renown that he frequently received visits from travelling nobles wanting to hear his tales. One guest described Münchhausen as telling his stories [...] "cavalierly, indeed with military emphasis, yet without any concession to the whimsicality of the man of the world; describing his adventures as one would incidents which were in the natural course of events". Rather than being considered a liar, Münchhausen was seen as an <b>honest</b> <b>man.</b> As another contemporary put it, Münchhausen's unbelievable narratives were designed not to deceive, but [...] "to ridicule the disposition for the marvellous which he observed in some of his acquaintances".|$|E
