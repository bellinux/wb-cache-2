5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in physics {{is to the}} description of linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with County Line Road, PA 263 crosses the Bucks County line and enters Warminster Township as York Road. In this area, the route is a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane and passes several businesses as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PA 132 (Street Road) intersection, where {{it becomes a}} four-lane divided highway that heads {{to the west of}} Archbishop Wood Catholic High School. The divided highway section ends at Roberts Road. PA 263 gains a center left-turn lane again as it continues north through more residential areas with a few businesses. Just before Bristol Road, Old York Road splits off from the route and PA 263 curves more to the northeast, retaining the name York Road.|$|E
5|$|In Buckingham Township, PA 263 {{becomes a}} four-lane {{undivided}} road passes {{a mix of}} farmland and homes as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> community of Furlong. Here, the road intersects Edison Furlong Road/Forest Grove Road and forms the border between Doylestown Township {{to the west and}} Buckingham Township to the east. At the intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 313 (Swamp Road), the route fully enters Buckingham Township again and turns northeast past a mix of farms and woods with some residences. Farther to the northeast, the route reaches the community of Buckingham and crosses PA 413 (Durham Road).|$|E

Two admirals and four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, pursers, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic science has been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, and the results were publicized in May 2013. In addition, {{researchers}} have extracted DNA from remains in the hopes of identifying origins of crew, and potentially living descendants.|$|E
5|$|Past MS25, MS172 passes several {{businesses}} in Iuka as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MS25 Business junction. The route continues east through wooded residential neighborhoods prior {{to making a}} turn to the southeast. MS172 leaves Iuka and heads back into forests as an unnamed road, running a short distance to the southwest of a Norfolk Southern railroad line. Further southeast, the route draws closer to US72 and curves to the east, passing a few fields. MS172 makes a sharp turn south away from the railroad tracks and comes to its eastern terminus at US72 immediately west of the Alabama border near Oldham. MS172 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary annals {{began to}} be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The {{material}} compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, {{with the exception of the}} Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.|$|E

5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E
5|$|Route 70 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Route 38 and County Route 601 (CR 601) in Pennsauken Township, Camden County. From this interchange, it {{heads to the}} southeast on Marlton Pike, a six-lane divided highway that runs through suburban residential and commercial areas. The road is also officially called the John Davison Rockefeller Memorial Highway for its entire length after John Davison Rockefeller. The road enters Cherry Hill and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with CR 636 before crossing under New Jersey Transit's Atlantic City Line, a short distance {{to the south of}} the Cherry Hill Station. In this area, Route 70 passes to the south of the former site of the Garden State Park before crossing CR 644. Past this intersection, the route narrows to four lanes and turns more to as <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ellisburg area. In Ellisburg, it has an intersection with Route 41 and the northern terminus of Route 154. The road runs through more suburban areas as it encounters Interstate 295 at another cloverleaf interchange. A short distance past I-295, Route 70 passes over the New Jersey Turnpike without an interchange before widening into an eight-lane highway and continuing east to junctions with CR 674 and CR 673. Following CR 673, the road narrows back to four lanes before it encounters CR 600, a former alignment of the road known as Old Marlton Pike.|$|E
