30|$|Turning to {{the case}} of German interregional migration, Decressin (1994) {{examined}} <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows for West German states up to 1988. His results show that a wage increase in one region relative to others causes a disproportional rise in the <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> levels in the first region. On the other hand, a rise in the unemployment in a region relative to others disproportionally lowers the <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> levels. Decressin does not find a significant connection between bilateral <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> and regional differences in wage level or unemployment when purely cross-sectional estimates are considered.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{structure}} and the dynamics of regional labour markets in terms of <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows in Finland. The study addresses also the composition of <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows. The study exploits the fact that Finland is divided into 85 sub-regions (the so-called NUTS 4 -level in the European Union). The yearly observations cover the period from 1989 to 1997. <b>Gross</b> <b>migration</b> rates are related to macroeconomic indicators, demographic factors, industry-structure and gross flows of jobs and workers by employing the data of 85 Finnish regions. The variables that characterize the evolution of <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows and the structure of economic fundamentals in the Finnish regions are collected by using aggregate data from Statistics Finland. The study includes macroeconomic indicators due to the fluctuations of the Finnish economy over the period of the investigation. The measurement of regional labour market flows applies a large longitudinal data of employees over the period from 1987 to 1997. The applied panel data is constructed by matching the measures of gross and worker flows and <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows with the economic fundamentals (including macroeconomic indicators). The estimation results imply that different factors can have similar effects on net changes in migration flows by various means of affecting gross changes. In particular, the migration equations show that the idiosyncratic factors (i. e. unobservable individual-level characteristics) play definitely a more important role for <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows of employees with higher university degrees. ...|$|E
30|$|We {{recognize}} {{concerns that}} the <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> rate may not accurately capture relocation responses {{if there is a}} high correlation between out- and in-migration. If this is the case <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> may not accurately reflect population outflows, as out migrants are replaced by in migrants. To check this we calculate a net 5 -year migration rate from the Census, which does include information on where people moved to domestically. The correlation between the two measures is high, alleviating {{concerns that the}} <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> rate does not reflect population movements. In the 2010 Census the correlation between the gross and net domestic migration rate is 0.794, while in the 2000 Census the correlation is 0.8598.|$|E

30|$|To further address {{concerns}} about net migration we estimate the instrumental variables model on two other outcome variables. First, we use net migration for the municipal cross section, and find similar results {{to those that}} use <b>gross</b> <b>migrations.</b> The IV coefficient on the 5 -year net migration rate is - 0.0009 and insignificant. Second, we use the population of 18 to 65  year olds {{at the state level}} from the ENOE (calculated {{in the first quarter of}} each year). The IV coefficient on population is negative, but small and insignificant. This suggests our results are robust to the consideration of in-migration.

This paper examines frictional migration in a multi-region equi-librium model with local housing markets. Idiosyncratic region preference shocks, a moving cost, and imperfect directed migration influence the equilibrium distribution of regional populations and rental rates. The model accounts for the comovements of relative unemployment and rental rates with <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> observed in a panel of U. S. states. It can also match the observed variability in rental rates and leads to persistent house price growth. Structural estimation reveals large reallocation barriers across local labor markets...|$|E
40|$|Cities {{experience}} significant, near {{random walk}} productivity shocks, yet population is slow to adjust. In practise local population changes {{are dominated by}} variation in net migration, and we argue that understanding <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> is essential to quantify how net migration may slow population adjustments. Housing is also a natural candidate for slowing population adjustments because {{it is difficult to}} move, costly to build quickly, and a large durable stock makes a city attractive to potential migrants. We quantify the influence of migration and housing on urban population dynamics using a dynamic general equilibrium model of cities which incorporates a new theory of <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> motivated by patterns we uncover in a panel of US cities. After assigning values to the model's parameters with an exactly identified procedure, we demonstrate that its implied dynamic responses to productivity shocks of population, <b>gross</b> <b>migration,</b> employment, wages, home construction and house prices strongly resemble those we estimate with our panel data. The empirically validated model implies that costs of attracting workers to cities drive slow population adjustments. Housing plays a very limited role...|$|E

The impacts of structural changes in local industries are different across <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows (rural - urban, urban - rural, urban - urban, and rural - rural migration), as are the impacts of other determinants of migration such as earnings differentials, aggregate employment growth, national unemployment, distance, and age structure. ...|$|E

With heterogeneous labour, the implied symmetrical treatment of immigration and emigration cannot be justified a priori. Because of heterogeneity among migrants, <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> flows may lead to considerable interregional redistribution of human capital even when net migration is zero. Moreover, the effects of regional economic conditions on gross in- and out-migration flows may not be symmetric. In this comparative study of regional growth and migration, the net and the <b>gross</b> <b>migration</b> approaches are compared.

40|$|We {{examined}} radiographic polyethylene wear in 233 cemented total hip arthroplasties (201 patients) {{with either}} a metal-backed or a non-metal-backed acetabular cup. All patients had identical cemented one-piece titanium femoral stems with a femoral head diameter of 28 mm. The mean linear wear rate was 0. 11 mm/yr in metal-backed sockets and 0. 08 mm/yrin non-metal-backed sockets(p = 0. 0002). The mean volumetric wear rate was 66. 2 mm 3 /yr in the metal-backed sockets and 48. 2 mm 3 /yr in the polyethylene sockets (p = 0. 0002). The addition of metal backing to a cemented acetabu-lar cup therefore resulted in a 37 % increase in mean polyethylene wear rates which may partially explain the higher failure rate of cemented metal-backed cups. Linear regression analysis also implicated increased follow-up time (log), <b>gross</b> acetabular <b>migration,</b> metal backing and male gender in increasing polyethylene wear.

Die Daten dieser Auswanderer wurden zusammen getragen und in einer neuen Online-Datenbank im Schloss Museum Landeck gespeichert. Dieses Material zusammen mit den gefundenen Daten in der Ellis Island Database in New York hilft uns nicht nur die Art und Dauer der Migration zu recherchieren, sondern auch den Einfluss der Tiroler in America darzustellen. Diese Arbeit stellt jene Bewohner des Bezirkes Landeck in den Mittelpunkt die sich entscheiden mussten ob sie 'Bleiben oder Gehen?' sollten. Um diese Frage zu beantworten werden nicht nur politische und geosoziale Aspekte aufgegriffen sondern auch die Einzelschicksale hervorgehoben. Die Analyse der Daten wird im Lichte der Cultural Memory Studies untersucht, welche uns helfen wird die Unterschiede zwischen Geschichte und Erinnerung zu verstehen. When the {{population}} {{numbers in the}} Alps reached their peak and the soil could no longer support its people a movement towards the surrounding countries set in. Landeck County presents itself as an exemplary case, since not only the seasonal working migration had its peak in this area, but also temporary and final emigration. Documents, narratives, and other information by emigrants have been collected and stored in {{the archives of the}} museum in Landeck. The extensive source material available at these archives of the museum in Landeck combined with the data from the Ellis Island archives allows us to see three immigration waves in the German speaking countries of Europe {{around the turn of the}} century.

Trying to answer this question we will find not only the historic, geographic and political context of Landeck County is essential background-knowledge, but also the individual stories. The three main questions concerning these emigrants answered in this paper are: Why did people leave Landeck? Where did they go? What happened to them on their way and after they finally arrived? Further investigation into the courses of their emigration and subsequent U.

40|$|A {{main feature}} characterising the {{transition}} process of eastern Germany is the scope with which East-West migration took place before, during, {{and after the}} German reunification. Overall, 4 million individuals left East Germany to migrate to the west between 1989 and 2007 (<b>gross</b> <b>migration).</b> Taking into account West-East migration, cumulative net migration amounted to 1. 7 million persons.

The analysis is based upon a newly available data source [...] Federal income tax returns. Approximately 90 % of the US population is covered by this data series. The matching of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) returns between filing dates enables the determination both of the origin and of the destination of migrants, with few of the risks of geographic miscoding present. These data illustrate that despite divergent economic fluctuations over the past nine years, the patterns of interstate migration have remained virtually unchanged. With few exceptions, the number of migrants either leaving or entering a particular state comprise identical proportions over time. Unlike migration data obtained from the Current Population Survey which enables the study of regional mobility only, the IRS data document current state-to-state flows that can be constructed on an annual basis. Comparisons are also made with the Current Work History Sample. In addition, these data offer considerable evidence that current residence has {{a significant impact on}} the selection of a destination. The resistance of migration patterns to large economic and social shifts during the period examined also implies that the explanation of individual migration determinants and the forecasting of aggregate migration flows should be treated as separate research questions. The potential of the data for the addition of further demographic detail and for use in forecasting also is considered. ...|$|R

In spite of their success and huge popularity, the postoperative failure rates for these procedures remain significant. Migration and micromotion of the implant are the primary indicators of its postoperative stability and many in vitro measurement techniques have been discussed. However, effective, practical methods to measure these metrics in vivo have proven elusive {{and the evolution of}} such a technique {{is the subject of this}} thesis. An implantable, remotely interrogated electronic system for the in vivo measurement of both micromotion and migration in the axial direction is proposed. The main purpose of the device is to improve the ability of clinicians to assess the longterm stability of orthopaedic implants and also to plan and optimise patients’ rehabilitation protocols. The system is based on a modified form of differential variable reluctance transducer (DVRT) in which the nullpoint of the system set automatically by means of a selfcalibration process. Simulations and preliminary in vitro measurements on the bench show that the selfcalibration algorithm works correctly in spite of component tolerances and initial set up errors, allowing a <b>gross</b> displacement (<b>migration)</b> to be measured with a resolution of 15 µm and a range from 0 to 4 mm, and that the device can measure micromotion with an amplitude as low as 1 µm in the range from 200 µm to 200 µm. Accuracy of less than 10 % are achieved in both micromotion and migration measurements.
