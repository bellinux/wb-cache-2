50|$|Constructed of {{reinforced}} concrete {{with an estimated}} 5 acre of tinted, <b>heat-absorbing</b> <b>glass,</b> and standing 200 ft tall, the Glass House features central air conditioning, escalators on the first seven floors to augment elevators, movable interior partitions and glass partitions for primary interior corridors. To maximize interior flexibility, structural columns are located outside the exterior curtain wall or within the building's core, providing a clear interior span for office space.|$|E
50|$|Manning {{designed}} one of {{the first}} Ludwig Mies van der Rohe style skyscrapers built in New Zealand, the AMP Building (1962 - Thorpe, Cutter, Pickmere & Douglas) on the corner of Queen and Victoria Streets, Auckland. Revolutionary features, for its time, include structure based on a concrete frame, sheathed with a curtain wall consisting of aluminium frames clad with stainless steel, and glazed with units of <b>heat-absorbing</b> <b>glass</b> and green opaque spandrels. The ground floor columns are clad with black ebony granite.|$|E
5000|$|A flat {{piece of}} <b>heat-absorbing</b> <b>glass</b> is often {{placed in the}} light path between the {{condensing}} lens and the slide, to avoid damaging the latter. This glass transmits visible wavelengths but absorbs infrared. Light passes through the transparent slide and lens, and the resulting image is enlarged and projected onto a perpendicular flat screen so the audience can view its reflection. Alternatively, the image may be projected onto a translucent [...] "rear projection" [...] screen, often used for continuous automatic display for close viewing. This form of projection also avoids the audience interrupting the light stream by casting their shadows on the projection or by bumping into the projector.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{presents itself}} as a cube that has been deconstructed into four units: a dramatic cantilevered courtroom block on the front with office blocks on each side and to the rear. These four components surmount a single-story base called the podium. The building is clad in flame-treated Royal Pearl granite from Georgia and bronze-tinted, <b>heat-absorbing,</b> glare-reducing <b>glass</b> with slim bronze-anodized aluminum mullions. Lundy's skillful use of materials and voids between blocks articulate the units.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The fly ash {{and coal}} gangue {{were used as}} main raw {{materials}} to roast solid insulating brick. Lower than solid clay brick (300 ℃) which belongs to low temperature roasting, roasting time cycle is 24 h,the ratio of fly ash and coal gangue is 60 %: 35 %. the B 7 admixing expanded pearlite compressive strength is 30. 25 MPa. Strength reach general clay brick MU 30 high-class level. Thermal coefficient of conduction is 0. 4 W/(m. K), lower than general clay brick thermal coefficient of conduction 0. 78 W/(m. K); In addition, B 7 XRD pattern has evident quartz, mullite diffraction character peak and TGA-DTA pattern between 900 ℃~ 1200 ℃, following temperature rise, green body <b>heat-absorbing,</b> begin melt, <b>glass</b> reduction. The result is high in strengths. SEM scanning show: after being roasted in 950 ℃, globular solid glass bead, pearlitic drusy pearlite, flocculation aluminosilicate phase and so on, raw materials particle interstices were filled with viscous hyaline, so that B 7 turned out high strengths. Acidproof, alkaliproof, freezing test and strengths results show: the lasting quality of solid insulating brick was best...|$|R
40|$|Both {{panes of}} factory-sealed double-glazing units are {{susceptible}} to thermal breakage. The outer pane experiences large thermally induced stresses when solar radiation falls on the sealed unit in cool weather. The breakage potential is even greater for units with heat-absorbing or heat- reflecting glass in the outer pane than for units with a clear outer pane. The inner pane experiences a high thermal stress when the outdoor air temperature is very low and the unit is subjected to localized heating. The breakage potential of the inner pane is greater for heat-reflecting units with a low U-value than for clear, heat-absorbing, or high-emissivity heat-reflecting units. Measured and calculated values of thermal stress for inner and outer panes of sealed glazing units indicate that thermal stress by itself should not cause glass breakage. Extensive breakage failure will only occur if the thermal stress is augmented by other tensile stresses or if weak or damaged glass is used. In {{the absence of a}} reliable method of predicting the probability of thermal breakage in sealed units, however, all factors that can possibly reduce the potential for breakage should be accommodated in design. This is especially true for units with <b>heat-absorbing</b> and heat-reflecting <b>glass.</b> Aussi disponible en fran 7 ais: Possibilit 9 s de bris d'origine thermique des vitrages doubles scell 9 sPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
