5000|$|Stereolithography {{requires}} {{the use of}} supporting structures which attach to the <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> to prevent deflection due to gravity and to hold cross sections in place in order to resist lateral pressure from the resin-filled blade or retain newly created sections during the [...] "vat rocking" [...] of bottom-up printing. Supports are created automatically during the preparation of 3D Computer Aided Design models and can also be made manually. With more expensive stereolithography models, these supports must be removed from the finished product manually.|$|E
50|$|In models {{featuring}} {{an elevator}} apparatus, an <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> descends a distance {{equal to the}} thickness of a single layer of the design (typically 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm) into the photopolymer vat. Then, a resin-filled blade sweeps across {{a cross section of}} the layer, re-coating it with fresh material. The subsequent layer is traced, joining the previous layer. A complete 3D object can be formed using this process. Designs are then immersed in a chemical bath in order to remove any excess resin and cured in an ultraviolet oven.|$|E

40|$|In {{prediction}} {{of the dynamic}} behaviour of an elevator car system, {{it is important to}} take into account the influence of passengers’ behaviour in the car. In this paper a simulation model is extended to analyse the influence of various loading car conditions on the dynamic response of the elevator system. This involves the investigation into the dynamic response of the car with different loads. An experimental rig with a rectangular <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> fixed on the top of four silent blocks attached to a shaker is designed to conduct experimental tests. The car is excited over a range of frequencies and amplitudes. A number of passengers wearing different type of shoes in the car are investigated. The transmissibility measurements are carried out with a harmonic excitation applied first to an empty car and then to the car with a number of passengers. The excellent agreement from experimental tests with the model predictions is achieved. The passenger’s role to act as a dynamic absorber is assessed and recommendations to achieve the best ride quality under load conditions are provided and summarised...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{the dynamic}} {{performance}} of an elevator car system represents a complex task and forms {{an important step}} in the elevator system design procedure. The need to consider the behaviour of passengers travelling in the car complicates the procedure further. This paper presents an original approach to identify the stiffness and damping characteristics of an elevator car system in order to investigate the effect of passenger load on the dynamic response. A simplified model is developed and the experimental rig with a rectangular <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> fixed on the top of four silent blocks attached to a shaker is setup. The transmissibility measurements are carried out with a harmonic excitation applied first to a platform with no passenger load and then to the platform with one passenger within the frequency range of 1 – 20 Hz. A single person standing on the platform is employed in order to assess the passenger’s contribution to the dynamic behaviour of the elevator car system. Curve fitting technique implemented in MATLAB is used to determine the damping and stiffness coefficients both for the empty car system and the car-passenger system. Investigation on the tolerances for both parameters is carried out. An approach to simplify the experimental procedure and {{to reduce the number of}} individual tests is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Music is {{a potent}} mood {{regulator}} that can induce relaxation and reduce anxiety in different situations. While several studies demonstrate that certain types of music have a subjective anxiolytic effect, the reported results from physiological responses are less conclusive. Virtual reality allows us to study diverse scenarios of real life under strict experimental control while preserving high ecological validity. We aimed to study the modulating effect of music on the anxiety responses triggered by an immersive virtual reality scenario designed to induce fear of heights. Subjects experienced a virtual scenario depicting an exterior <b>elevator</b> <b>platform</b> ascending and descending the total height of its 350 meters tall supporting structure. Participants were allocated to either a group that experienced the elevator ride with background music or without, in a between-groups design. Furthermore, each group included participants with different degrees of fear of heights, ranging from low to high fear. Recordings of heart rate, galvanic skin response, body balance, and head movements were obtained during the experiments. Subjective anxiety was measured by means of three questionnaires. The scenario produced significant changes in subjective and physiological measures, confirming its efficacy as a stressor. A significant increase in state anxiety was found between pre and post-assessment in the silence group, {{but not in the}} music group indicating that post-stress recovery was faster in the musical group. Results suggest that music can ameliorate the subjective anxiety produced by fear of heights...|$|E

2500|$|Cinematic platformers are a {{small but}} {{distinct}} subgenre of platform games, usually distinguished by their relative realism compared to traditional platformers. [...] These games focus on fluid, lifelike movements, without the unnatural physics found in nearly all other platform games. To achieve this realism, many cinematic platformers, beginning with Prince of Persia, have employed rotoscoping techniques to animate their characters based on video footage of live actors performing the same stunts. Jumping abilities are typically roughly {{within the confines of}} an athletic human's capacity. To expand vertical exploration, many cinematic platformers feature the ability to grab onto ledges, or make extensive use of <b>elevator</b> <b>platforms.</b> Other distinguishing characteristics include step-based control, in which an action is performed after the character completes his current animation, rather than the instant the button is pressed, and multi-screen stages that do not scroll.|$|R
