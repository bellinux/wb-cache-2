Methods:We parameterised a population-level decision model with data from national-level TB databases (n = 199, 511) and implementation studies. The model follows cohorts of TB suspects from diagnosis to treatment under current diagnostic guidelines or an algorithm that includes Xpert. Assumptions include the number of TB suspects, symptom prevalence of 5. 5 %, annual suspect growth rate of 10 %, and 2010 public-sector salaries and drug and service delivery costs. Xpert test costs are {{based on data from}} an in-country pilot evaluation and assumptions about when global volumes allowing cartridge discounts will be reached. Results: At full scale, Xpert will increase the number of TB cases diagnosed per year by 30 %– 37 % and the number of MDR-TB cases diagnosed by 69 %– 71 %. It will diagnose 81 % of patients after the first visit, compared to 46 % currently. The cost of TB diagnosis per suspect will increase by 55 % to USD 60 – 61 and the cost of diagnosis and treatment per TB case treated by 8 % to USD 797 – 873.

40|$|Shifting {{population}} patterns, {{the rate}} of urbanization and the demands for higher levels of municipal services combined with many financial constraints facing Canadian municipalities, demand {{an increase in the}} sophistication of financial planning. <b>Recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> which are those costs recurring annually in the form of operating, maintenance, debt servicing and others costs required for the support of capital facilities require increased analysis if municipalities are to avoid the problems of over-expansion, under-financing and loss of productivity. By analyzing <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs,</b> municipalities will be able to assess the fiscal impact of capital expenditures and as such, meet the financial challenges of the future. All urban municipalities in Canada over the population of 75, 000 were surveyed to determine the following: 1) the number of municipalities which analyze <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> 2) the type of <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> analyzed 3) the estimated dollar impact of <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> 4) the type of decision-making groups presented with <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> information; and 5) the difference between those municipalities which analyze <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> and those which do not.

Causative factors identified and discussed include (1) a functionally unintegrated MOH structure [...] consisting of (a) the autonomous hospitals and (b) {{the remainder of the}} Ministry; (2) the functional isolation of the Ministry's planning department from its budgetary department; (3) the use of historical-budget based decision-making [...] in lieu of more explicitly goal oriented resource allocation and planning criteria; (4) donor agencies' funding of infrastructure construction projects, coupled with their unwillingness to financially support the <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> such projects ultimately give rise to; and finally, (5) the civil war and its associated economic dislocation, altered central government funding priorities and general state of disarray. The effects of persistent underfinancing of <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> in El Salvador are the growing proportion of the MOH budget being consumed by outlays for personnel at the expense of virtually all other budgetary categories; the shortages of drugs and general medical supplies in public health facilities; and reduced levels of utilization of those facilities from what would otherwise be expected; all of which together imply a reduced level of both productivity and effectiveness of the public health care system.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies reveal that effectiveness of aid on growth is ambiguous.

They consider the donor's budget support as {{a device to}} supplement the shortage of the recipient's <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> and to alleviate the misallocation of inputs.

40|$|Background: Detailed cost {{analysis}} {{is an important}} tool for review of health policy and reforms.

Method: Six BHUs {{were randomly selected from}} each of the five districts in Khyber Pukhtonkhawa (KPK) and two agencies in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan for this study. Actual expenditure data and utilization data in the year 2005 – 06 of 42 BHUs was collected from selected district health offices in KPK and FATA. Costs were estimated for outpatient visits to BHUs. Perspective on cost estimates was district-based health planning and management of BHUs. Results:Average recurring cost was PKR. 245 (USD 4. 1) per OPV to BHU. Staff salaries constituted 90 % of <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost.</b> On the average there were 16 OPV per day to the BHUs.

40|$|Abstract Background Two TB control {{strategies}} {{appropriate for}} South Asia (a community-based DOTS [CBD] strategy and a family-based DOTS [FBD] strategy) {{have been shown}} to be effective in Nepal in meeting the global target for the proportion of registered patients successfully treated. Here we estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of the two strategies. This information is essential to allow meaningful comparisons between these and other strategies and will contribute to the small but growing body of knowledge on the costs and cost-effectiveness of different approaches to TB control. Methods In 2001 – 2, costs relating to TB diagnosis and care were collected for each strategy. Structured and semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect costs from health facility records and a sample of 10 patients in each of 10 districts, 3 using CBD and 2 using FBD. The data collected included costs to the health care system and social costs (including opportunity costs) incurred by patients and their supervisors. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was estimated. Results Total <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> per patient using the CBD and FBD strategies were US$ 76. 2 and US$ 84. 1 respectively. The social costs incurred by patients and their supervisors represent more than a third of total <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> under each strategy (37 % and 35 % respectively). The CBD strategy was more cost-effective than the FBD strategy: <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> per successful treatment were US$ 91. 8 and US$ 102. 2 respectively. Discussion Although the CBD strategy was more cost-effective than the FBD strategy in the study context, the estimates of cost-effectiveness were sensitive to relatively small changes in underlying costs and treatment outcomes. Even using these relatively patient-friendly approaches to DOTS, social costs can represent a significant financial burden for TB patients. </p...|$|R
