During one scene, Tom makes a joke, then says, [...] "Am <b>I</b> <b>right,</b> Justin?" [...] The {{line is a}} reference to Leslie's stylish ex-boyfriend Justin, played by actor Justin Theroux earlier in the season, who Tom desperately admired.

500|$|When the {{instrumentation}} was completed, Draiman {{began to}} write melody lines for each song. Draiman commented, [...] "I'm {{a big believer in}} the vibe of the music and the feel of it, how the song makes you feel musically should dictate {{what it is to be}} about and so if you start with something that has meaning, but the music doesn't support the meaning, then what good is it?" [...] The first song completed musically was [...] "The Night", and Draiman completed the melody line in three days. This caused Draiman to tentatively call the record The Night. As Draiman recalled, [...] "The instrumentation was so cool and so dark and textural that <b>I</b> <b>right</b> away kind of jumped into it." [...] When the first batch of songs were completed, the band sent them out to their record label, Reprise Records, and waited for their approval to continue writing more songs. After they received approval, they wrote the rest of the songs featured on the album.|$|E

50|$|After a hiatus, Wolpert {{returned}} to the Goodson Productions team and produced a new The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> series for Goodson and Paramount Television.

50|$|The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> premiered on September 12, 1994. Unlike the {{previous}} syndicated series, {{there was no}} requirement attached that the show could not air at certain {{times of the day}} for the stations that aired The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right.</b> This enabled the series to avoid the clearance problems that the 1985-86 syndicated Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right,</b> hosted by Tom Kennedy, went through; because of the codicil attached, the 1985 series found itself airing in late night on a large number of stations because, due to an increasingly crowded syndication market, the prime slots were filled. With no such restrictions on The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right,</b> stations were free to place it wherever they wished and some even opted to air it in daytime slots. In some markets, The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> was paired with the veteran syndicated Family Feud, which for its seventh season saw a return of Richard Dawson as its host.|$|R

50|$|In {{spite of}} all of this, The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> {{struggled}} to find an audience. The series {{was never able to}} find any sort of ratings footing and by midseason, Chris-Craft pulled The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> from all of its stations just before the new year. With its two largest affiliates now gone, the ratings bottomed out and Paramount canceled the series shortly thereafter. On January 27, 1995, The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> aired its eightieth and final episode; at sixteen weeks it proved the shortest running of all the syndicated Price productions.|$|R

5000|$|Barker would host Truth or Consequences on NBC until 1965, {{and later}} in daily {{syndication}} until 1975, by which time he had also taken over a revival of The Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> on CBS from 1972 onward. As a result, thanks to Edwards's [...] "be yourself" [...] admonition, Barker became as familiar with a generation of Truth or Consequences and Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> viewers, as earlier fans had with Edwards and original Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> host Bill Cullen during the original versions of the shows in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> was {{the third}} attempt at a {{syndicated}} edition of the CBS daytime show, preceded by a weekly series that ran concurrently with the daytime series from 1972 until 1980 and a daily series that aired from 1985 until 1986. Like those two series, The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> was thirty minutes in length as opposed to its parent series, which has been sixty minutes in length since 1975. Another similarity it shared with its predecessors in syndication {{was an increase in}} the prize budget as opposed to the daytime series. Despite the similarities, The New Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> was designed to not be a strict copy of its parent series; to this effect, several changes were made to distinguish the series from the daytime Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right.</b>|$|R
