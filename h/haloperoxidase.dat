To convert the linear heptapeptide, eight enzymes, open reading frames (ORFs) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 20, and 21 are used. The enzymes ORF 7, 8, 9, and 20 are P450 enzymes.

40|$|Several hundred {{halogenated}} compounds, such as antibiotics, pesticides etc., {{are present}} in nature as intermediates and products of many biosynthetic pathways. The enzymes for halogenation reactions within these pathways are largely unknown. In contrast to chemical halogenation enzymatic halogenation reactions proceed under mild conditions and yield less byproducts than comparable technical reactions. So far, only enzymes from eukaryotes, marine algae and fungi were described all of them whit heme at their catalytic site. Recently bacterial enzymes, bromoperoxidases from Streptomyces and Pseudomonas strains, were detected (1, 2, 3). Some of these bacterial bromoperoxidases have no peroxidase or catalase activity. These new <b>haloperoxidases</b> contain no heme, {{and up to the}} description of the catalytic center were termed non-heme <b>haloperoxidases.</b> Besides bromoperoxidase activity, one of these non-heme enzymes has also chlorinating activity (3, 4). A typical problem with heme <b>haloperoxidases</b> is the decrease of halogenating activity within short time periods due to H 2 O 2 -consumption in side reactions and irreversible inactivation of the respective enzyme. These properties prevent the technical application of heme enzymes for halogenation reactions. Non-heme <b>haloperoxidases,</b> however, show constant halogenation rates over days under these conditions. They have no H 2 O 2 consuming side activity, and therefore should be useful for technical halogenation reactions. Some of these <b>haloperoxidases</b> were characterized with respect to substrate speepcifity and enzyme reactor performance.

Prior to {{tryptophan}} 7-halogenase's discovery, it was thought that all halogen atoms in metabolites were incorporated by the action of <b>haloperoxidases,</b> another class of halogenases dependent on metal centers such as vanadium or heme, or perhydrolases, a class of halogenases that generates peracids that in turn oxidize halide ions to hypohalous acids, which act as halogenating agents. These enzymes halogenate without substrate specificity and regioselectivity. The first tryptophan 7-halogenase was isolated in 1995 by Dairi et al. after a comparison in amino acid sequence revealed no similarity with previously known <b>haloperoxidases.</b> In contrast with <b>haloperoxidases,</b> flavin-dependent halogenases are much narrower in substrate scope and significantly more regioselective.

Thus far, six families of halogenating enzymes have been identified: cofactor-free <b>haloperoxidases</b> (HPO), vanadium-dependent <b>haloperoxidases</b> (V-HPO), heme iron-dependent <b>haloperoxidases</b> (HI-HPO), non-heme iron-dependent halogenases (NI-HG), flavin-dependent halogenases (F-HG), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) -dependent halogenases (S-HG). However, these halogenating enzymes with similar biological functions but distinct structures might have evolved independently. Phylogenetic and structural analyses suggest that the HPO, V-HPO, HI-HPO, NI-HG, F-HG, and S-HG enzyme families may have evolutionary relationships to the α/β hydrolases, acid phosphatases, peroxidases, chemotaxis phosphatases, oxidoreductases, and SAM hydroxide adenosyltransferases, respectively.

Our review shows that {{it is by no means}} rare that biotic processes create conditions that render biocidal concentrations of reactive chlorine compounds, which suggest that extracellular production of reactive chlorine may have an important role in antagonistic microbial interactions.

The Curvularia <b>haloperoxidase</b> system caused several-log-unit reductions in counts of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas salmonicida, Shewanella putrefaciens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Candida sp. and Rhodotorula sp.), and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubigensis, Aspergillus versicolor, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Penicillium paxilli) cultured in suspension. Also, bacteria adhering to the surfaces of contact lenses were killed.

The surprising evolutionary relationship between the bacterial and mammalian acid phosphatases that hydrolyze phosphate monoesters and the vanadium <b>haloperoxidases</b> will be shown...|$|R
40|$|Vanadium <b>haloperoxidases</b> differ {{strongly}} from heme peroxidases in {{substrate specificity}} and stability and {{in contrast to}} a heme group they contain the bare metal oxide vanadate as a prosthetic group. These enzymes specifically oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide into hypohalous acids. These reactive halogen intermediates will react rapidly and aspecifically with many organic molecules. Marine algae and diatoms containing these iodo-and bromoperoxidases produce short-lived brominated methanes (bromoform, CHBr 3 and dibromomethane CH 2 Br 2) or iodinated compounds. Some seas and oceans are supersaturated with these compounds and they form an important source of bromine to the troposphere and lower stratosphere and contribute significantly to the global budget of halogenated hydrocarbons. This perspective focuses, in particular, on the biosynthesis of these volatile compounds and the direct or indirect involvement of vanadium <b>haloperoxidases</b> in the production of huge amounts of bromoform and dibromomethane. Some of the global sources are discussed and from the literature a picture emerges in which oxidized brominated species generated by phytoplankton, seaweeds and cyanobacteria react with dissolved organic matter in seawater, resulting in the formation of intermediate brominated compounds. These compounds are unstable and decay via a haloform reaction to form an array of volatile brominated compounds of which bromoform is the major component followed by dibromomethane...|$|R
