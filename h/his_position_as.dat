5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>as</b> a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's {{production}} of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>as</b> the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence.
