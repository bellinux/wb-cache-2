25|$|Paestum {{was a major}} ancient Greek city on {{the coast}} of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Magna Graecia (southern Italy). The ruins of Paestum are famous for their three ancient Greek temples in the Doric order, dating from about 600 to 450 BC, which are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> state of preservation. The city walls and amphitheatre are largely intact, and the bottom of the walls of many other {{structures}} remain, as well as paved roads. The site is open to the public, and there is a modern national museum within it, which also contains the finds from the associated Greek site of Foce del Sele.|$|E
25|$|The French {{initially}} occupied {{both sides}} of the Chao Phraya in Bangkok, with two fortresses, one on the left bank (the Bangkok fortress) and one on the right bank (the Thonburi fortress). Seeing that the position would be difficult to defend, especially since communications would become nearly impossible at low tide, the French decided to regroup in the larger fortress, on the left bank of the river. The French destroyed parts of the fortifications, split 18 cannons and spiked the rest. Soon after they left the smaller fort, Siamese troops invested it and began to set up cannons and mortars to bombard the French positions. Forty cannons were set up there, which were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> position to shoot at the French fortress {{on the other side of}} the river.|$|E
25|$|For the League's 13th Round, Palmeiras drew with Goiás {{away from}} home by the score of 1–1. Ewerthon opened the score after just 12 minutes from the {{beginning}} with a long range shot. Palmeiras played extremely well during the first half, but in the second half, the team didn't make a good appearance, trying to hold a 1–0 lead until the end, when a dubious foul was committed by Palmeiras defence, and after the kick, Goiás drew with a header from Amaral. The result was disappointing for the team who was almost certain to win 3 points in the league. Despite of the bad result, the team continued 11th in the table awaiting the return of some important players to the squad. In the following round, Palmeiras won the match against Atlético-PR by 2–0 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> appearance from all the players.|$|E

500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} {{with the}} characters' reaction to Lori opting for an abortion. Halden criticized the character's opposing {{views on the}} matter, and stated that their reasonings were invalid. Halden wrote. [...] "I'm not even sure {{it would be possible}} for her to abort the pregnancy at this point, but the show's working on the assumption that having a child in a world where death literally lurks around every corner is an unequivocal good. The only person who’s been anti-pregnancy is Lori, and the show hasn't managed to cast her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> light, so it’s not like her arguments hold much water—which is also ridiculous, because ultimately, her opinion {{is the only one that}} matters."

[...] When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison, Lister stated: [...] "Not very well! It's all completely overwhelming for her.

[...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would {{live up to the}} original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took.

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head4 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument4) weighs 6 tons {{and has been}} moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. Colossal Head4 is [...] high, [...] wide and [...] deep. The head was {{discovered}} by Matthew Stirling in 1946, [...] northwest of the principal mound, {{at the edge of}} a gully. When excavated, it was found to be lying on its right-hand side and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> state of preservation. Ceramic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head5, making ceramic dating of the monument difficult. The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords, similar to those of Head3. On the right-hand side, three tassels descend from the upper portion of the headdress; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band. These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords. Also on the right hand side, two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument. On the left-hand side, three vertical cords descend across the ear. The earflare is only visible on the right hand side; it is formed of a plain disc and peg. The face is that of an ageing man with a creased forehead, low cheekbones and a prominent chin. The lips are thick and slightly parted.|$|E

Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E
