40|$|A {{floating}} {{island was}} generated using two height maps, {{one for the}} bottom of the island and one for the top. Vertices of the island was displaced in the Y axis using an algorithm called Simplex noise. To avoid texture stretching that appears when displacing the vertices an algorithm called “tri planar projection” was implemented. After the vertices had been displaced the normal was smoothed using “normal smoothing”. An algorithm here called “the AVG algorithm” is created to smooth <b>jig</b> <b>sawed</b> edges around the island that appears after the island has been generated. The results of the AVG algorithm is judged by a group of 26 participants to see if any <b>jig</b> <b>sawed</b> edges are perceived.

40|$|Background: Although some {{occupational}} {{sources of}} hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) have been extensively investigated, {{the risks associated}} with others are poorly characterized. Methods: A questionnaire was mailed to a community sample of 12, 240 men aged 16 - 64 years and 906 men from the armed forces. Questions covered current occupation, sources of HTV, numbness or tingling in the fingers in the past week, and finger blanching. In the 5, 364 respondents who had been at work in the past week, associations between symptoms and exposures were examined by logistic regression, with odds ratios converted into prevalence ratios (PRs). Results: Altogether, 513 men (10 %) reported cold-induced finger blanching and 769 (14 %) sensory symptoms in the fingers. The risk of blanching was increased in builders (PR 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 5. 2), carpenters and joiners (PR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 4), motor mechanics (PR 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 4. 6), and laborers (PR 2. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 6. 0); while the risk of sensory symptoms was elevated in laborers (PR 4. 0, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 6. 6) and plant operatives (PR 3. 5, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 5. 9). Use of hand-guided mowers, concrete breakers, chain <b>saws,</b> and <b>jig</b> <b>saws</b> was significantly associated with symptoms. Conclusions: Little {{attention has been paid to}} the risks of vibration injury in construction workers, woodworkers, motor mechanics, and laborers, or to the risks from mowers, <b>jig</b> <b>saws</b> and several other common vibratory tools.

40|$|Abstract—Analogously to Graphical Markov models, also Compositional models {{serve as}} an {{efficient}} tool for multidimensional models representation. The main idea of the latter models resembles a <b>jig</b> <b>saw</b> puzzle: Multidimensional models are assembled (composed) from {{a large number of}} small pieces, from a large number of low-dimensional models. Originally they were designed to represent multidimensional probability distributions. In this paper they will be used to represent multidimensional belief functions (or more precisely, multidimensional basic belief assignments) {{with the help of a}} system of low-dimensional ones. In addition to a number of basic properties of such models, in the paper it will be shown that these models can serve as a real enrichment of probabilistic models. They can relieve a drawback of probabilistic models that can be, in case that the initial building blocks of the model are inconsistent, undefined. As a side result of the paper we propose a new way how to define the concept of conditional independence for belief functions. I...|$|E

The article explores for the possibility to design the collaborative learning on the <b>Jig</b> <b>Saw</b> technique framework using wiki. The paper reports the findings from a quantitative research which had two independent variable i. e. gender and learning strategy. The control group was classroom based collaborative learning and the experimental group was online collaborative learning. The dependent variable was student motivation learning which measured by questionnaire. The proposed hypotheses were tested using two way ANOVA that to find the main effect of gender and learning strategy, and the interaction of both variables. The findings of this research are that gender did not give significant effect to student learning motivation. But, learning strategy gave the significant effect to student learning strategy which the online collaborative learning had better affect to the motivation than classroom based collaborative learning. Both independent variable had slight interaction but statistically not significant.
