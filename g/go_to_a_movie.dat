5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, {{and it was not}} a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie if you bring a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E
2500|$|In 1919, when Igor was 15, the Greenberg {{family moved}} to Vienna, Austria. [...] Living {{conditions}} in Vienna were not much better {{than they had been}} in Grodek. [...] Igor worked at many different jobs during these years: [...] in an iron factory, a tailor shop, and delivering milk. [...] The work hours were from 6 am until 8 pm, 6 days a week. [...] In what little free time he had, he visited the public library and sat in on many lectures at the Urania, a tuition-free night school. [...] On Sundays he would often <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> theater and he developed a fascination with America. [...] Like many, he loved Westerns, and cowboys and horses would forever fascinate him.|$|E

50|$|Elaine is a {{character}} reference for Beth and Arnie (Stephen Caffrey), a couple {{who are trying to}} adopt, but the story she tells during an interview destroys all hope of adoption: she mentions a time when she and the couple <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> and the husband lost his temper because Elaine was talking during the movie.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of September 22, 2006, Cassie was house sitting for Allison and Frank Contreras, her aunt and uncle who had moved from California with their {{children}} the year before. She was visited that evening by her boyfriend Matt. Later, Draper and Adamcik showed up. The four decided to watch a movie together, until Draper and Adamcik said they'd prefer to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> at a local theater, leaving Cassie and Matt at the home. At one point when Cassie and Matt were alone, the electricity suddenly went out. It was restored before Matt {{was picked up by}} his mother. Unbeknownst to Cassie or Matt, Draper and Adamcik had returned to the house before Matt's departure (roughly 10:30 p.m).|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Anne Edwards {{wrote about}} the tone and tenor of Shirley Temple films, [...] "This was mid-Depression, and schemes proliferated {{for the care of}} the needy and the {{regeneration}} of the fallen. But they all required endless paperwork and demeaning, hours-long queues, {{at the end of which}} an exhausted, nettled social worker dealt with each person as a faceless number. Shirley offered a natural solution: to open one's heart." [...] Edwards pointed out that the characters created for the little actress would change the lives of the cold, the hardened, and the criminal with positive results. Her films were seen as generating hope and optimism, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, [...] "It is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American can <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited {{unprecedented}} {{media attention}} for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 courtship. The two {{were referred to}} as the first superstar couple of the Internet age, [...] and the pairing's popularity resulted in their being known by the portmanteau [...] "Bennifer" [...] (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination. The term Bennifer itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated: [...] was probably bad for my career. What happens is this sort of bleed-over from the tabloids across your movie work. You <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody. I ended up in an unfortunate crosshair position where I was in a relationship and [...] mostly lied and inflated a bunch of salacious stuff for the sake of selling magazines. And I paid a certain price for that. Then, in concert with some movies that didn’t work...|$|E

60|$|Yet Lister knew {{it stood}} {{for all the}} relief from labor in the {{stinging}} alkali dust one could get. One could loaf in a hard {{chair in front of}} the hotel, lose a dollar or two at the shabby pool-room, or <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> show and see pictures of frankly ridiculous Western melodrama. In the real West, the pictures were ridiculous, because romantic shootings-up did not happen. In fact, unless a stubborn labor dispute began, nothing broke the dull monotony of toilsome effort. Romance had vanished with the buffaloes. Lister admitted that he had not long felt the monotony. The trouble began when he stopped at Winnipeg.|$|E
