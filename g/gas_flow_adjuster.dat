Titrating these ECMO settings can involve multiple steps because, frequently, the initially chosen parameters will not produce the desired result in terms of blood gases, leading {{to at least one}} more cycle of parameter change and blood gas analysis. The whole process has to be repeated whenever the patient condition changes. As a consequence of its lower solubility and lower volume of distribution throughout multiple compartments, PaO 2 reaches equilibrium much sooner than PaCO 2 [10]. Therefore, in order to optimize the frequency of changes in ECMO settings, it would be of utmost importance to know how long it takes for CO 2 to equilibrate after ECMO support initiation or any parameter change.|$|R

The types and amount of gas used vary depending upon the etch process; for instance, sulfur hexafluoride is commonly used for etching silicon.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundVentilatory muscle {{endurance}} training (VMET) involves increasing {{minute ventilation}} (V˙E) against a low flow resistance at rest {{to simulate the}} hyperpnea of exercise. Ideally, VMET must maintain normocapnia {{over a wide range}} of V˙E. This can be achieved by providing a constant fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to a sequential rebreathing circuit. The challenge to make VMET suitable for home use is to provide a source of constant fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to the circuit without resorting to compressed gas. MethodsOur VMET circuit was based on a commercial sequential gas delivery breathing circuit (Pulmanex Hi-Ox, Viasys Healthcare, Yorba Linda, CA USA). Airflow was provided either by a small battery-driven aquarium air pump or by the entrainment of air down a pressure gradient created by the recoil of a hanging bellows that was charged during each inhalation. In each case, fresh <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> was <b>adjusted</b> to be just less than resting V˙E. Eight subjects then breathed from the circuit for three 10 min periods consisting of relaxed breathing, breathing at 20 and then at 40 L/min. We monitored V˙E, end-tidal PCO 2 (PetCO 2) and hemoglobin O 2 saturation (SpO 2). ResultsDuring hyperpnea at 20 and 40 L/min, PetCO 2 did not differ significantly from resting levels with either method of supplying fresh gas. SpO 2 remained greater than 96 % during all tests. ConclusionIsocapnic VMET can be reliably accomplished with a simple self-regulating, sequential rebreathing circuit without the use of compressed gas...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} yeast cells to high densities at low, but constant, oxygen {{concentrations}} {{is difficult because}} the cells themselves respire oxygen; hence, as cell mass increases, so does oxygen consumption. To circumvent this problem, we have designed a system consisting of a computer-controlled <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> train that <b>adjusts</b> oxygen concentration in the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to match cellular demand. It does this by using a proportional-integral-differential algorithm {{in conjunction with a}} three-way valve to mix two gases, adjusting their proportions to maintain the desired oxygen concentration. By modeling yeast cell yields at intermediate to low oxygen concentrations, we have found that cellular respiration declines with oxygen concentration, most likely because of a decrease in the expression of genes for respiratory proteins. These lowered rates of oxygen consumption, together with the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> system described here, allow the growth of yeast cells to high densities at low oxygen concentrations. This system {{can also be used to}} grow cells at any desired oxygen concentration and for regulated shifts between oxygen concentrations...|$|R

Increasing the nitrogen pressure further, up to 600 kPa, had no additional benefit. The densification rate was increased significantly by increasing the gas pressure to 600 kPa during both heating and isothermal holding. Under argon the elevated pressure did not increase the densification rate.

40|$|Trace element {{determination}} in seawater is analytically challenging {{due to the}} typically {{very low}} concentrations of the trace elements and the potential interference of the salt matrix. A common way to address {{the challenge is to}} pre-concentrate the trace elements on a chelating resin, then rinse the matrix elements from the resin and subsequently elute and detect the trace elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This technique typically involves time-consuming pre-treatment of the samples for ‘off-line’ analyses or complicated sample introduction systems involving several pumps and valves for ‘on-line’ analyses. As an alternative, the following method offers a simple method for ‘on-line’ analyses of seawater by ICP-MS. As opposed to previous methods, excess seawater was pumped through the nebulizer of the ICP-MS during the pre-concentration step but the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> was <b>adjusted</b> so that the seawater was pumped out as waste without being sprayed into the instrument. Advantages of the method include: • Simple and convenient analyses of seawater requiring no changes to the ‘standard’ sample introduction system except from a resin-filled micro-column connected to the sample tube. The ‘standard’ sample introduction system refers to that used for routine digest-solution analyses of biota and sediment by ICP-MS using only one peristaltic pump; and • Accurate determination of the elements V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in a range of different seawater matrices verified by participation in 6 successive rounds of the international laboratory intercalibration program QUASIMEME...|$|R

Research of aerodynamic parameters it’s the first step of studies to determine the optimal case, at the average <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> velocity in cyclone channels were 8, 12 and 16 m/s, the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> dynamics dependencies into cyclone were determined...|$|R

Equation (26) constraints nodal pressure, where ρ_i, ρ_i, ρ_i are nodal pressure, the lower limit of nodal pressure and the upper limit of nodal pressure.
