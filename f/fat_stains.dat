Deep mucosal fat was commonly associated with those clinical groups showing normal mucosal structure. While fine granular surface epithelial fat was common in normal and abnormal biopsies, the presence of large fat globules in the surface epithelium was almost entirely limited to biopsies showing villous shortening. Large fat globules in the surface epithelium in coeliac disease and cow's milk sensitive enteropathy were probably related to the more severe degrees of villous abnormality encountered in these clinical groups.

40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 719 - 723. Background & Aims: Hepatocellular {{ballooning}} {{is a key}} {{finding in}} nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is conventionally defined by hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showing enlarged cells with rarefied cytoplasm and recently by changes in the cytoskeleton. Fat droplets are emerging as important organelles in cell metabolism. To address a possible relation between fat droplets and ballooning, we studied <b>fat</b> <b>staining,</b> H&E, and keratin 18 staining in human NASH. Methods: Sequential staining and high resolution imaging were used to study freshly prepared cryo-sections from 10 patients with histologically confirmed steatohepatitis using oil red O for fat droplet identification, H&E to identify ballooning, and anti-K 18 to confirm cytoskeletal changes. High resolution images were captured at each stage using the Aperio Scanscope. To provide ultrastructural correlation, glutaraldehyde-fixed specimens were studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with serial sectioning for localization of ballooned cells by light microscopy and TEM in identical specimens. Results: Serial staining consistently demonstrated that hepatocellular ballooning is associated with fat droplet accumulation evident by oil red O positivity and depletion of cytoplasmic keratin 18 with K- 18 positive Mallory–Denk bodies (MDB). TEM confirmed the association between osmium <b>stained</b> <b>fat</b> droplets,MDB formation, and cellular enlargement and suggested droplet-associated dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum. Conclusions: These results indicate a relationship between cellular ballooning, fat droplet accumulation, and cytoskeletal injury in NASH. We speculate that injury to multiple organelles, including fat droplets and endoplasmic reticulum, contribute to this characteristic finding...|$|R
40|$|The {{proportions}} {{of body fat}} and fat-free mass are determining factors of adiposity-associated diseases. Work in Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed evolutionarily conserved pathways of fat metabolism. Nevertheless, analysis of body composition and fat distribution in the nematodes has only been partially unraveled because of methodological difficulties. We characterized metabolic C. elegans mutants by using novel and feasible BODIPY 493 / 503 -based <b>fat</b> <b>staining</b> and flow cytometry approaches. Fixative as well as vital BODIPY staining procedures visualize major fat stores, preserve native lipid droplet morphology, and allow quantification of fat content per body volume of individual worms. Colocalization studies using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, and imaging of lysosome-related organelles as well as biochemical measurement confirm our approaches. We found that the fat-to-volume ratio of dietary restriction, TGF-β, and germline mutants are specific for each strain. In contrast, the proportion of fat-free mass is constant between the mutants, although their volumes differ {{by a factor of}} 3.

This method gave a deeper staining and increased the difference between hyperfunctioning and unnivolved parathyroid tissue with respect to the amount of stainable lipid in the chief cells. It was found to be a valuable supplement, adding a functional dimension to the structural interpretation of the tissue, and it facilitated the peroperative distinction between ademona and hyperplasia.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis is a histochemical and {{biochemical}} {{study on}} {{a patient with}} hyalinosis cutis et mucosae with a 31 year medical follow-up. The most outstanding histological feature consisted of an accumulation of extracellular hyaline material in boundary areas, namely, upper cutis, around the excretory and secretory sweat ducts, hair follicles and small blood vessels. This hyaline material was strongly PAS positive, slightly digested by diastase and stained faintly for collagen with Gomori's trichrome. <b>Fat</b> <b>stains</b> were negative within the hyaline material. Following pepsin digestion, most of the PAS positive material was removed, thus, suggesting that the carbohydrate component is most probably linked to a protein. This protein {{does not appear to}} be collagen since it is susceptible to pepsin digestion and contains tryptophan. An unusual feature was the presence of islands of PAS-positive material in the external root sheath of several hair follicles which appeared to represent infolding of the hyaline material from the outer layer of the vitreous membrane. The biochemical studies suggested that the hyaline in question probably represents a glycoprotein free or loosely bound to collagen, which is not soluble to salt, weak alkali or acid solutions...|$|E

Seven male F 344 rats with diabetes induced by a single i. v. dose of alloxan were sacrificed after twenty-five weeks of treatment. Histologically, the pancreatic acini were diffusely atrophied, and the islets showed marked atrophy or had disappeared, and giant eosinophilic granules and small vacuoles were observed in almost all acinar cells. The eosinophilic granules showed negative reactions for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and acid phosphatase, as well as <b>fat</b> <b>stains</b> such as Nile blue, Oil red O, and Sudan III. Ultrastructurally, the giant eosinophilic granules were huge structures surrounded by a double membrane containing many irregular cristae.

C. elegans possess {{the full range of}} desaturases, including the Δ 9 desaturases expressed by fat- 5, fat- 6 and fat- 7. They regulate the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, used for the synthesis of lipids including phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Results Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to define the metabolome of all the possible knock-outs for the Δ 9 desaturases, including for the first time intact lipids. Despite the genes having similar enzymatic roles, excellent discrimination was achievable for all single and viable double mutants highlighting the distinctive roles of fat- 6 and fat- 7, both expressing steroyl-CoA desaturases. The metabolomic changes extend to aqueous metabolites demonstrating the influence Δ 9 desaturases have on regulating global metabolism and highlighting how comprehensive metabolomics is more discriminatory than classically used dyes for <b>fat</b> <b>staining.</b> Conclusions The propagation of metabolic changes across the network of metabolism demonstrates that modification of the Δ 9 desaturases places C. elegans into a catabolic state compared with wildtype controls. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Steroid cell {{tumors are}} microscopically {{characterized}} by abundant eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm {{that is often}} positive for <b>fat</b> <b>stains.</b> These tumors could be of ovarian or ectopic adrenal origin. We present a rare case of a steroid cell tumor arising from the pelvic mesentery. Case presentation A 31 -year-old Asian woman was undergoing treatment for infertility and virilizing symptoms. She underwent laparoscopy followed by laprotomy for a suspected ovarian cyst/pelvic mass. During the laprotomy, a mass of 9 × 7 cm was detected in the pelvic mesentery. Microscopically, the tumor showed large cells arranged predominantly in sheets with abundant granular cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tumor was seen infiltrating surrounding adipose tissue. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed strong positivity for kertain, inhibin, vimentine, melan-A, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, and S- 100 protein and focal positivity to epithelial membrane antigen. An MIB 1 index showed 4 % nuclear positivity. The tumor cells were negative for calretinin, desmin, and muscle actin. Considering the clinical findings, histomorphology, and immunohistochemistry, we made the diagnosis of extraovarian and extra-adrenal steroid cell tumor (not otherwise specified) of the pelvic mesentery. Conclusions We report an extremely rare case of an extraovarian and extra-adrenal steroid cell tumor of the pelvic mesentery. The tumor was a cause of virilizing symptoms and infertility in the patient. Surgical removal of the tumor reverted the symptoms of virilization, and the patient subsequently conceived.

40|$|Many {{advances}} {{have occurred in}} recent years in the diagnosis, localization, and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Several different operative choices for primary hyperparathyroidism also have been proposed [...] a unilateral approach versus the standard bilateral parathyroid exploration. The unilateral approach is based on the concept that if an enlarged parathyroid gland and a normal gland are found on the first side of the neck that is explored, then this is an adenoma and the second side should not be explored. Only if both glands on the initial side are recognized to be abnormal is the second side explored. The theoretical advantages of this unilateral approach are a decrease in operative morbidity rates [...] hypoparathyroidism and nerve injuries [...] and a decrease in operative time. Furthermore, proponents argue that if persistent hyperparathyroidism occurs, the second side can be easily explored because it was previously untouched. In the hands of several expert parathyroid surgeons, excellent results have been achieved. However, the unilateral approach has a number of disadvantages. It places considerable pressure on the surgeon and pathologist, for they have only one parathyroid gland other than the large one to examine. There is a significant potential risk of missing double adenomas or asymmetric hyperplasia because the second, ipsilateral parathyroid gland may appear normal or near normal in these conditions. This could lead to an increased incidence of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, a significant reduction of operative time may be questioned, especially when the time for performing special <b>fat</b> <b>stains,</b> which often are performed with unilateral explorations, is added. Finally, even if the intent is to perform a unilateral exploration, a bilateral exploration will be necessary about half of the time. The authors strongly recommend a bilateral parathyroid exploration for all patients undergoing an initial parathyroid operation. In cases of adenoma, bilateral visualization of normal parathyroid glands and careful biopsy of only one of them will minimize hypoparathyroidism. This operative approach will lead to better results, especially for the less experienced parathyroid surgeon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAngiosarcoma (AS) showed diverse morphologies from {{well formed}} {{malignant}} vasculatures to poorly differentiated tumor {{with only a}} few clues of endothelial differentiation. Herein reported are two cases of AS without primitive vasoformative channels (VC). They showed, instead, a very few foci of intracytoplasmic vacuoles (ICV) that mimicked liposarcoma. The two cases were found in 12 cases of AS in computer database. Both are men, 57 and 68 years. One is cutaneous (foot) AS and another is soft tissue (thigh) AS. The largest diameter of cutaneous AS was 5 cm, and that of soft tissue AS 9 cm. The prognosis of both patients was poor; both died of metastases 4 and 6 years after initial presentation. In both cases, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) diagnosis was difficult because there were no VC, and most of the tumors were composed of primitive mesenchymal tissues. In both cases, however, a few very tiny foci consisting of ICV were seen. At first, the author considered them as mucins or fat, and suspected liposarcoma. In fact, they were pseudolipoblasts. Several mucin stains showed no mucins, and <b>fat</b> <b>stains</b> of frozen sections of formalin fixed tissue were negative for fat. Immunohistochemically, the vacuoles were positive for factor VIII-related antigen (F-VIII-RA), Ulex lectin, CD 31, CD 34, vimentin, p 53 and Ki- 67 (labeling index= 64 % and 75 %), but negative for various types of cytokeratins (CK), EMA, CEA, CA 19 - 9, CD 45, smooth muscle actins, S 100 protein, myoglobin, HMB- 45, Melan A, NCAM, and NSE. F-VIII-RA is specific and Ulex lectin and CD 31 are relatively specific for endothelium. Therefore, the pathological diagnosis of AS could be made by the combined histologic features (ICV) and Immunohistochemical positivity of F-VIII-RA, Ulex lectin, and CD 31. Thus, it appeared that the ICV may be the only clue of poorly differentiated or undifferentiated AS. In such undifferentiated cases, combined observations of meticulous histologic observations (intracytoplasmic lumens and ICV) immunohistochemistry of F-VIII-RA, Ulex lectin, and CD 31 may be helpful in the diagnosis of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated AS. Electron microscopic observations were not done in the present study...|$|E
40|$|We {{encountered}} {{and reported}} one such rare case of liposarcoma which {{originated in the}} chest wall. A 60 -year-old man came to our hospital with the chief complaint of a phyma in the right anterior chest wall. On palpation, a hard and non-mobile phyma measuring 3 × 3 cm was felt in the chest wall. Chest CT showed a phyma measuring 2. 2 × 1. 5 cm in the right anterior chest. The periphery of the phyma was smooth, and had a well-defined boundary with the surrounding tissues. Ultrasonic examination revealed that the tumor existed between the major and minor pectoral musdes. The inside of the tumor was nearly uniform, and showed low echo. Punctured cytological examination revealed scattered atypical cells with spindle, foamy or vacuolar sporophores on the mucoid matrix. A <b>fat</b> <b>staining</b> examination revealed lipoblasts with oil red-positive granules. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having myxoid type liposarcoma.

40|$|Associated visceral organ {{involvement}} evidence by systemic fibrosis has {{not been}} explored in oral submucous fibrosis (OSF). The investigations in this aspect were limited to loco¬regional sites of naso/oropharynx and oesophagus. The study of whether the oral fibrosis {{is part of a}} systemic spectrum of disease involving multiple organs is an interesting pursuit. With this intention the patients diagnosed on clinical and histological grounds for OSF were concurrently tested by biophysical means for the presence of endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), pancreatic (PF) and retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF), which are endemic to the area studied. Twenty five (n= 25) cases of OSF who visited the Department of Oral pathology & Microbiology. Govt. Dental College, Trivandrum, India for symptomatic relief of their illness comprised the study group. Ten (n= 10) age and sex matched healthy volunteers comprised the control. All the subjects have had undergone cardiologic and gastrointestinal investigations to rule out the possibility of concurrent EMF and PF. The patients were all of Indian ethnic extraction and mostly (> 90 %) were from low socio economic classes. The mean age of the patients was 54. 16 ± 14. 6 years, including 18 females and 7 males (F:M= 2. 57 : 1). The severity of fibrosis was unrealated to the age of patients (P> 0. 05). All the patients were chewers of areca quid (12 %) / tobacco (88 %). In addition to quid chewing 3 / 25 (12 %) patients smoked 'bidi' and 6 / 25 (24 %) consumed home brewed liquor (arrack/toddy) which contain about 40 - 50 % ethanol. Statistically no relationship was observed between the clinical stages of OSF and severity of epithelial dysplasia in this study (P> 0. 05). Out of the 25 patients, 5 (20 %) showed sclerotic aortic value which may be an age related finding. Also 7 (28 %) patients were found to be hypertensive and interstitial lung disease was present in 2 (8 %). The possibility of EMF in one female patient who showed thickened RV apical endocardium was ruled out by cardiac catheterisation. Thus none of the patients showed evidence of endomyocardial fibrosis. The pancreas was found to be hyperchoic in 8 (321 / 4) by ultra sonography. Liver was found to be hyperchoic in 6 (24 %). <b>Fat</b> <b>stain</b> in stool samples was found to be positive in 13 (58 %). The hyperchogenicity of pancreas may be due to alcholism or an underlying endocrine pancreatic insufficiency like diabetes and not due to pancreatic fibrosis. The positivity of <b>fat</b> <b>stain</b> could be due to fatty liver/alcoholism. Thus the study fails to reveal any evidence of pancreatic fibrosis in the group.

Unfortunately, {{there is no}} currently available drug established to treat NAFLD. It was recently reported that intraperitoneal administration of taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) improved hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice. We hereby examined the effect of oral TUDCA treatment on hepatic steatosis and associated changes in hepatic gene expression in ob/ob mice. We administered TUDCA to ob/ob mice at a dose of 500 mg/kg twice a day by gastric gavage for 3 weeks. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and hepatic gene expression were examined in comparison with control ob/ob mice and normal littermate C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Compared to the control ob/ob mice, TUDCA treated ob/ob mice revealed markedly reduced liver <b>fat</b> <b>stained</b> by oil red O (44. 2 ± 5. 8 % vs. 21. 1 ± 10. 4 %, P< 0. 05), whereas {{there was no difference}} in body weight, oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and ER stress. Microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression demonstrated that oral TUDCA treatment mainly decreased the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis among the components of lipid homeostasis. At pathway levels, oral TUDCA altered the genes regulating amino acid, carbohydrate, and drug metabolism in addition to lipid metabolism. In summary, oral TUDCA treatment decreased hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice by cooperative regulation of multiple metabolic pathways, particularly by reducing the expression of genes known to regulate de novo lipogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{has emerged}} as an important model for studies of the regulation of fat storage. C. elegans feed on bacteria, and various strains of E. coli are commonly used in research settings. However, {{it is not known}} whether particular bacterial diets affect fat storage and metabolism. Methodology/Principal Findings: <b>Fat</b> <b>staining</b> of fixed nematodes, as well as biochemical analysis of lipid classes, revealed considerable differences in fat stores in C. elegans growing on four different E. coli strains. Fatty acid composition and carbohydrate levels differ in the E. coli strains examined in these studies, however these nutrient differences did not appear to have a causative effect on fat storage levels in worms. Analysis of C. elegans strains carrying mutations disrupting neuroendocrine and other fat-regulatory pathways demonstrated that the intensity of Nile Red staining of live worms does not correlate well with biochemical methods of fat quantification. Several neuroendocrine pathway mutants and eating defective mutants show higher or lower fat storage levels than wild type, however, these mutants still show differences in fat stores when grown on different bacterial strains. Of all the mutants tested, only pept- 1 mutants, which lack a functional intestinal peptide transporter, fail to show differential fat stores. Furthermore, fatty acid analysis of triacylglycerol stores reveals an inverse correlation between total fat stores and the levels of 15 -methylpalmitic acid, derived from leucine catabolism.

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy started between the 31 st and 38 th weeks of pregnancy, with malaise, vomiting, jaundice, and lethargy as the main clinical manifestations. Polydipsia (in nine episodes) and skin pruritus (in seven episodes) were unusual clinical findings. In two patients, pruritus started two and four weeks before AFLP, suggesting that an intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy preceded AFLP in those patients. Considering the current prevalence of both diseases in Chile, their association should be considered fortuitous. In another patient, two consecutive pregnancies were affected by AFLP, raising to three the number of reported patients with recurrent AFLP. In 11 episodes, liver biopsies supported the diagnosis of AFLP by showing small and midsized vacuolar cytoplasmic transformation as the most prominent histopathological feature.

40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is an {{attractive}} animal model for biological and biomedical research because it permits relatively easy genetic dissection of cellular pathways, including insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS), that are conserved in mammalian cells. To explore C. elegans as a model system to study the regulation of the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT), we have characterized the GLUT gene homologues in C. elegans: fgt- 1, R 09 B 5. 11, C 35 A 11. 4, F 53 H 8. 3, F 48 E 3. 2, F 13 B 12. 2, Y 61 A 9 LA. 1, K 08 F 9. 1 and Y 37 A 1 A. 3. The exogenous expression of these gene products in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity to unmetabolized glucose analogue 2 -deoxy-D-glucose only in FGT- 1. The FGT- 1 -mediated transport activity was inhibited by the specific GLUT inhibitor phloretin and exhibited a Michaelis constant (Km) of 2. 8 mM. Mannose, galactose, and fructose were able to inhibit FGT- 1 -mediated 2 -deoxy-D-glucose uptake (P < 0. 01), indicating that FGT- 1 is also able to transport these hexose sugars. A GFP fusion protein of FGT- 1 was observed only on the basolateral membrane of digestive tract epithelia in C. elegans, but not in other tissues.

40|$|Cytosolic lipid {{droplets}} (LDs) are evolutionary conserved {{and versatile}} organelles important for storage and utilization of lipids {{in almost all}} cell types. In order to gain insights into the functional connection between LD size and lipid homeostasis we isolated, identified and finally characterized an Sadenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS 1) deficient Caenorhabditis elegans (C.  elegans) mutant showing enlarged LDs throughout the life cycle. SAMS 1 belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved enzymes, which catalyze the only known route of Sadenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis. SAMdependent methylation is of quantitative importance for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major phospholipid of membranes. Syntheses of PC and triacylglycerol (TAG) are intimately coupled to each other due to common intermediates, shared biosynthetic routes and mutual regulatory mechanisms. The present study shows that SAMS 1 is necessary for homeostasis of PC and TAG synthesis and that SAMS 1 deficiency results in excessive TAG storage in C.  elegans. Thin layer chromatography based analysis of lipid extracts revealed that SAMS- 1 deficiency reduces PC level but increases TAG proportions. Microarraybased expression profiling identified upregulation of several lipogenic genes due to SAMS 1 deficiency, {{which is supposed to}} contribute to increased TAG proportions. Vital <b>fat</b> <b>staining</b> via BODIPY™ 493 / 503 revealed that increased TAG level are stored in fewer but larger LDs in sams 1 mutants. A reduced surface area of few large-sized LDs is supposed to represent a mechanism to economize PC. Moreover, sams 1 mutants displayed a reduced body size and an impaired reproductive capability. In summary, our data reveal a mechanism of how SAMS 1 deficiency mediates increased fat storage through impaired PC synthesis, LD expansion, increased lipogenesis and reduced lipolysis efficiency...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Neurologic {{dysfunction}} after cardiopulmonary bypass {{might be}} due to arterial microembolization. Pericardial suction blood is a possible source of embolic material. Our aim was to determine the capillary-pore flow ability of pericardial suction blood. Methods: Pericardial suction blood from patients undergoing coronary bypass was collected, and pericardial suction blood and venous blood were sampled at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass and before reinfusion of pericardial suction blood. Pericardial suction blood was (n = 10) or was not (n = 10) prefiltered through a 30 -μm cardiotomy screen filter before capillary in vitro analysis. Additionally, in 8 patients the plasma viscosity was measured, and in 5 of these patients, pericardial suction blood capillary deposits were evaluated by using a microscopy-imprint method and <b>fat</b> <b>staining.</b> Capillary flow was tested through 5 -μm pore membranes. Tested components were plasma, plasma-eliminated whole-blood resuspension, and leukocyte/plasma-eliminated erythrocyte resuspension. Initial filtration rate and clogging slope expressed the blood-to-capillary interaction. Results: The plasma-flow profile of pericardial suction blood was highly impaired, with a 47 % reduction in initial filtration rate (P <. 001) and a 142 % steeper clogging slope flow deceleration (P <. 01). This difference was not due to a change in pericardial suction blood viscosity, such as by free hemoglobin, which corresponded to 5. 7 % of the erythrocytes. There were no differences in resuspended whole blood or erythrocytes. The cardiotomy filter had no effect. Microscopy suggested the presence of capillary fat deposits in pericardial suction blood that were not seen with venous plasma (P <. 05). The pericardial suction blood volume was 458 ± 42 mL and contained 95. 6 ± 9. 3 g/L hemoglobin. Conclusions: The pericardial suction blood plasma capillary flow function was highly impaired by liquid fat. Pericardial suction blood hemoglobin appears worth recovering after fat removal, despite profound hemolysis. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 124 : 377 - 8...|$|R
40|$|An {{association}} of Chlamydia pneumoniae with atherosclerosis of coronary and carotid arteries and aorta {{has been found}} by seroepidemiology and by demonstration of the organism in atheromata. Age-matched control tissue from persons without atherosclerosis was usually not available. We studied autopsy tissue from young persons, many with no atherosclerosis, to determine whether C. pneumoniae is present in atheroma in young persons with early atherosclerosis and to compare the findings in age- and sex-matched persons without atherosclerosis. A left anterior descending coronary artery sample, formalin-fixed, from 49 subjects, 15 - 34 years of age, from the multicenter study called Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY), was examined by immunocytochemistry and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{for the presence of}} C. pneumoniae and by PCR for cytomegalovirus. A hematoxylin/eosin-stained section was used to determine disease present in the studied sample. Seven of the artery samples were found to have atheromatous plaque, 11 had intimal thickening, and 31 had no lesions. Eight of the samples were positive for C. pneumoniae by immunocytochemistry (n = 7) and/or PCR (n = 3). Six of the 7 (86 %) atheroma, 2 of the 11 (18 %) with intimal thickening, and none of the 31 normal-appearing coronary samples were positive. Four were positive by PCR for cytomegalovirus, 2 from diseased arteries and 2 from normal arteries. Examination of the adjacent left coronary artery sample with a <b>fat</b> <b>stain</b> found abnormalities in 25 of the patients, but 19 still showed no evidence of atherosclerosis as a result of either examination. Thus, C. pneumoniae is found in coronary lesions in young adults with atherosclerosis but is not found in normal-appearing coronary arteries of both persons with and without other evidence of atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{has emerged}} as an important model for studies of the regulation of fat storage. C. elegans feed on bacteria, and various strains of E. coli are commonly used in research settings. However, {{it is not known}} whether particular bacterial diets affect fat storage and metabolism. <b>Fat</b> <b>staining</b> of fixed nematodes, as well as biochemical analysis of lipid classes, revealed considerable differences in fat stores in C. elegans growing on four different E. coli strains. Fatty acid composition and carbohydrate levels differ in the E. coli strains examined in these studies, however these nutrient differences did not appear to have a causative effect on fat storage levels in worms. Analysis of C. elegans strains carrying mutations disrupting neuroendocrine and other fat-regulatory pathways demonstrated that the intensity of Nile Red staining of live worms does not correlate well with biochemical methods of fat quantification. Several neuroendocrine pathway mutants and eating defective mutants show higher or lower fat storage levels than wild type, however, these mutants still show differences in fat stores when grown on different bacterial strains. Of all the mutants tested, only pept- 1 mutants, which lack a functional intestinal peptide transporter, fail to show differential fat stores. Furthermore, fatty acid analysis of triacylglycerol stores reveals an inverse correlation between total fat stores and the levels of 15 -methylpalmitic acid, derived from leucine catabolism. These studies demonstrate that nutritional cues perceived in the intestine regulate fat storage levels independently of neuroendocrine cues. The involvement of peptide transport and the accumulation of a fatty acid product derived from an amino acid suggest that specific peptides or amino acids may provide nutritional signals regulating fat metabolism and fat storage levels...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{screen for}} amyloid {{and to assess}} {{associated}} clinical and laboratory characteristics in Egyptian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Abdominal subcutaneous fat aspirates were consecutively collected from 112 patients (103 women, nine men) having RA for five years or more. To detect amyloid, <b>fat</b> smears were <b>stained</b> with Congo red and the concentration of amyloid A protein in fat tissue was measured. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of the patients were assessed. Results: Amyloid was detected in eight (7 %) of the <b>fat</b> smears <b>stained</b> with Congo red. Compared with the Congo red stain, the sensitivity for detecting amyloid by measurement of amyloid A protein in fat tissue was 75 % and the specificity was 100 %. The amount of amyloid found was small for both methods. The median disease duration of the eight amyloid patients was significantly longer (17 years) {{than that of the}} non-amyloid patients (10 years). Bronchopulmonary disease and constipation were more common, whereas proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency were not. The number of swollen joints and the number of red blood cells were significantly lower in the amyloid group. Conclusions: Quantification of amyloid A protein and staining with Congo red are strongly concordant methods of screening for amyloid in fat tissue. The prevalence of amyloid in Egyptian patients with RA is 7 %. Proteinuria is not a discriminating feature, whereas long disease duration, constipation, bronchopulmonary symptoms, and a moderate to Iow number of red blood cells may help to identify the arthritic patients with amyloid...|$|R
40|$|With the U. S. {{fuel ethanol}} {{industry}} projected to grow {{during the next}} several years, supplies of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) are anticipated {{to continue to grow}} as well. DDGS is used primarily as livestock feed. Much of the DDGS must be shipped, often over large distances, outside the Corn Belt (which is where most of the corn-based ethanol plants are currently located). Stickiness and caking among particles is a common issue for DDGS, and it often leads to flowability problems. To address this, the objective {{of this study was to}} understand the cross-sectional and surface natures of DDGS particles from five ethanol plants, and how they interact with DDGS properties. This study examined the distribution patterns of chemical components within cross-sections, within section edges (i. e., surface layers), and on surfaces using standard staining techniques; chemical composition was determined using standard protocols; and physical and flowability properties were also determined. Crude protein in the samples was 28. 33 – 30. 65 % db, crude fat was 9. 40 – 10. 98 % db, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was 31. 84 – 39. 90 % db. Moisture contents were 4. 61 – 8. 08 % db, and geometric mean diameters were 0. 37 – 0. 52 mm. Cross-sectional staining showed protein levels of 19. 57 – 40. 39 %, and carbohydrate levels of 22. 17 – 43. 06 %, depending on the particle size examined and the production plant from which the DDGS was sampled. Staining of DDGS particles indicated a higher amount of surface layer protein compared with carbohydrate thickness in DDGS particles that had a lower flow function index (which indicated potential flow issues). Additionally, surface <b>fat</b> <b>staining</b> suggested that higher surface fat also occurred in samples with worse flow problems. This study represents another step toward understanding why DDGS particles stick together during storage and transport, and will hopefully help to improve DDGS material handling strategies...|$|R
40|$|We {{know from}} {{previous}} experiments that heat stress (HS) reduces egg production in laying hens, in part {{at least through}} disruption of steroidogenesis. We also noted in several studies changes in the morphology of the granulosa cells (GC) {{at the level of}} lipid droplets (LD). It has been reported that HS increases lipid oxidation in the hen, and that normal lipid endocytosis is controlled by the amount of lipid in the cell. However, oxidized lipid receptors are not controlled, at least in human macrophages located in the endothelium of blood vessel walls, causing the formation of giant macrophage cells and leading to the formation of plaques in arteries. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine and describe the effect of HS on the morphology of LD in GC of the laying hen and the subsequent recovery to the pre-HS state. Two groups of hens were used; one group was subjected to 24 C, 30 %RH (control), the other to 36 C, 60 %RH for 24 h (HS treatment). At the end of 24 h, the F 1 follicles were collected from both groups and the GC monolayers were isolated and fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 h. The monolayer was then <b>stained</b> using <b>fat</b> <b>stain</b> Oil Red O to localize LDs in the GC. In control GC, LDs were small and uniform in size and shape and they were randomly and evenly distributed in the cells. In contrast, the GC of the HS birds contained much larger LD of different sizes and shapes, and they were arranged neatly around the cell periphery. The percentage of cell area covered by LD in HS GC was significantly (P= 0. 000) greater than that of the control group. We hypothesize that, during HS, the reduction in activity of GC (steroid production) results in lipid accumulation in the cells. Alternatively, HS-induced lipid oxidation may lead to this accumulation via unregulated oxidized lipid receptors. Both of these are consistent with the recovery that occurs over time in these cells...|$|R
40|$|Targeting {{proteins}} that are overexpressed in atherosclerotic plaques may open novel diagnostic applications. The C domain of tenascin-C is absent from normal adult tissues {{but can be}} inserted during tumor progression or tissue repair into the molecule by alternative splicing. We tested {{the ability of the}} human antibody G 11, specific to this antigen, to reveal murine atherosclerotic plaques ex vivo. The antibody directed against the extra domain B of fibronectin (L 19) was used as a reference. METHODS: We intravenously injected (125) I-labeled G 11 or L 19 antibodies into apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice and harvested the aortae 4 or 24 h later. En face analyses of distal aortae and longitudinal sections of the aortic arch were performed to compare antibody uptake using autoradiography with plaque staining using oil red O. Plaque macrophages were detected by immunohistochemistry (anti-CD 68 staining). Biodistribution of injected antibodies was investigated in aortae and blood at 4 and 24 h. RESULTS: En face analyses revealed a significant correlation between radiolabeled G 11 and fat-stained areas, increasing from 4 to 24 h, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 92 (P < 0. 0001) and an average signal-to-noise ratio of 104 : 1 at 24 h. Plaque imaging using L 19 showed similar results (r = 0. 86; P < 0. 0001; signal-to-noise ratio, 72 : 1 at 24 h). Uptake of radiolabeled antibodies in histologic sections colocalized with <b>fat</b> <b>staining</b> and activated macrophages in aortic plaques. Biodistribution analyses confirmed specific accumulation in aortic plaques as well as rapid blood pool clearance of the antibodies 24 h after injection. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed increased expression of tenascin and fibronectin isoforms in macrophage-rich plaques. CONCLUSION: The antibody G 11, specific to the C domain of tenascin-C, visualizes murine atherosclerotic plaques ex vivo. In conjunction with the increased expression of the C domain of tenascin-C in macrophage-rich plaques, the colocalization of G 11 uptake with activated macrophages, and the favorable target-to-blood ratio at 24 h, this antibody may be useful for molecular imaging of advanced atherosclerotic plaques in the intact organism...|$|R

A small sample is dissolved in water or saline, glacial acetic acid is added to hydrolyze the insoluble salts of fatty acids, a few drops of alcoholic solution of Sudan III are added, the sample is spread on a microscopic slide, and heated twice to boil. Normally a stool sample should show only a few drops of red-orange <b>stained</b> <b>fat</b> under the microscope. The method is only semiquantitative but, due to its simplicity, it is used for screening.|$|R
