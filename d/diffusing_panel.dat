40|$|Changing {{the way we}} {{experience}} the light, bringing the outdoors indoors: this is {{the mission of the}} CoeLux technology, which after 12 years of research, managed to obtain CoeLux(HE), the first commercial product able to reproduce sky and sunlight in an interior space. The result is a warm, direct, sunlight and a surrounding sky light, completely transforming indoor spaces, giving them volume and shape through light and shadow, and which allows creating a new relationship between people and the surrounding architecture. The next step of the company’s growth plan is to bring this pioneering product, which can be produced for a small niche of high-end users, to the industrial scale, thus satisfying the blossoming demand. This will be the focus of the CoeLux(VR) innovation project, which will deliver two new modular systems (SkyBlade and SkyCasket), amenable to large scale production. This will be achieved through 4 developmental stages: 1 Upscaling of the nanomaterial dispersion used to coat the <b>diffusing</b> <b>panel</b> which represents the company’s key and proprietary technology. 2. Upgrade of the LED source and the optical design, which allows incorporating a radically new LED system, exclusively designed for CoeLux. 3 Engineering, industrial design and packaging, which focusses around the customers’ perception of the product, as well as its industrial manufacturing process. 4. Finally, the overarching ambition is to set-up the production supply chain, inspired by lean manufacturing principles, organizing the sourcing of the semi-finished products from the selected suppliers, and the internal production logistics in a standardized manufacturing plan, in view of the high-end positioning of the product. The project results will allow CoeLux to ramp-up its operational capacity, also increasing the company’s preparedness to the global market through core assets as product certification, trademark, and IP protection, thus reaping the benefit of this revolutionising technology...|$|E

40|$|The Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is {{currently}} under development for NASA's Earth Observing System. The instrument consists of nine pushbroom cameras, each with four spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared. The cameras point in different view directions to provide measurements from nadir to highly oblique view angles in the along-track plane. Multiple view-angle observations provide a unique resource for studies of clouds, aerosols, and the surface. MISR is built to challenging radiometric and geometric performance specifications. Radiometric accuracy, for example, must be within +/- 3 %/ 1 sigma, and polarization insensitivity must {{be better than}} +/- 1 %. An onboard calibrator (OBC) provides monthly updates to the instrument gain coefficients. Spectralon <b>diffuse</b> <b>panels</b> are used within the OBC to provide a uniform target for the cameras to view. The absolute radiometric scale is established both preflight and in orbit {{through the use of}} detector standards. During the mission, ground data processing to accomplish radiometric calibration, geometric rectification and registration of the nine view-angle imagery, and geophysical retrievals will proceed in an automated fashion. A global dataset is produced every 9 days. This paper details the preflight characterization of the MISR instrument, the design of the OBC, and the radiance product processing...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is an Earth-observing sensor, which {{provides}} global retrievals of aerosols, clouds, and land surface parameters. Instrument specifications require an accurate absolute calibration, {{as well as}} accurate camera-to-camera, band-to-band and pixel-to-pixel relative response determinations. In order to achieve these requirements, MISR makes use of an on-board calibrator (OBC), as well as vicarious calibration (VC) experiments. The OBC makes use of two Spectralon <b>diffuse</b> <b>panels</b> {{in order to provide}} a flatfield illumination. Bi-monthly deployments of these panels into the camera fields-of-view will be made. At these times, solar-reflected radiance values are measured by photodiode detector standards. Accurate relative bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data are required to transfer these photodiode-measured radiances into camera-incident values. An independent calibration pathway, known as VC, will also be implemented in order to reduce systematic errors and to provide a crosscheck on the OBC findings. Here, the top-ofatmosphere radiances are computed from in situ observations of surface reflectance and atmospheric transmittances. Key to these measurements is knowledge of the hemispheric/directional reflectance factor (HDRF) of the field reflectance standards. This report describes the BRF measurements of the MISR flight panels, and provides an estimation as to the differences between HDRF and BRF for the MISR view angles. This BRF data base is available from the MISR web site, [URL] D 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) This thesis {{explores the}} means of objectively {{measuring}} diffuse sound fields contained within music performance auditoria. Although the diffuse field {{is considered to be}} {{an important component of the}} reverberant sound field there is currently no widely accepted method for its measurement. A review of methods shows that attempts to characterize the field may be divided into those methods that seek to directly measure the state of the field and those that indirectly indicate the existence of the state. The primary focus of this thesis is the application of Ambisonic techniques to capture the spatial aspects of the sound field. Initial work explores the rotation of a directional microphone in three measurement spaces. The results and modeling in idealised simulated sound fields indicate that the method may have some efficacy. The method is extended through the application of signal processing to the output of an Ambisonic microphone array. The method is tested firstly in a reverberation room that is modified progressively to produce a series of room states with incrementally increasing reverberation time. The extents of the measurement system were tested by measuring the degrees of diffusivity reached in a reverberation room. <b>Diffusing</b> <b>panels</b> were progressively added in the expectation the increases in diffusivity would be detected. The measurement was carried out in conjunction with standard absorption coefficient measurements outlined in Appendix A of ISO 354. Comparison was made between the measured field and the standard method for achieving a diffuse field in a reverberation room test facility. The final stage attempts to find correlation between physical measures of diffuse fields and listener’s subjective assessment of those fields. To that end a paired comparison test was conducted where listeners were presented music samples rendered through simulated halls where the scattering coefficients and consequently the sound field diffusivity was varied. Subjects were asked to choose which pair they preferred...|$|R

40|$|In his 1942 {{paper on}} the sound {{insulation}} of single leaf walls, Cremer [(1942). Akust. Z. 7, 81 ¿ 104] {{made a number of}} approximations in order to show the general trend of sound insulation above the critical frequency. Cremer realized that these approximations limited the application of his theory to frequencies greater than twice the critical frequency. This paper removes most of Cremer¿s approximations so that the revised theory can be used down to the critical frequency. The revised theory is used as a correction to the <b>diffuse</b> field limp <b>panel</b> mass law below the critical frequency by setting the nonexistent coincidence angle to 90 °. The <b>diffuse</b> field limp <b>panel</b> mass law for a finite size wall is derived without recourse to a limiting angle by following the average diffuse field single sided radiation efficiency approach. The shear wave correction derived by Heckl and Donner [(1985). Rundfunktech Mitt. 29, 287 ¿ 291] is applied to the revised theory in order to cover the case of thicker walls. The revised theory predicts the general trend of the experimental data, although the agreement is usually worse at low frequencies and depends on the value of damping loss factor used in the region of and above the critical frequency...|$|R

40|$|The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) {{plans to}} use {{deployable}} <b>diffuse</b> reflectance <b>panels</b> to provide periodic radiometric calibrations of its nine cameras while in-flight. Near-Lambertian reflectance characteristics are desirable to facilitate flat-field camera intercomparisons. Also required is panel spatial and spectral uniformity, and stability with time. Spectralon, a commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) compound, has been baselined in the MISR design. To assess the suitability of this material, a series of degradation tests were planned and implemented. These included UV vacuum exposure and proton bombardment tests which simulated the exposure levels to be encountered during the mission life. Proton levels are now considered too low to be of concern, but UV vacuum tests demonstrate sensitivity to material contamination. Material investigations have concluded that hydrocarbons {{are present in the}} bulk of the material, and that plastic packaging materials can introduce additional surface-layer contamination. It is found however, that these unwanted elements can be eliminated through vacuum pumping at elevated temperatures. Exposure to a UV source, while in vacuum, is again planned for a set of targets which have been vacuum baked. This will assess the stability of the pure PTFE form...|$|R
40|$|The {{policy and}} {{institutional}} dimensions {{addressed in this}} symposium were diverse and somewhat <b>diffuse.</b> Each <b>panel</b> was developed to include a political, policy, and institutional perspective. Some of these perspectives were shared from a policy-maker’s point of view, others from the view of scientific and technical managers with responsibility for integrating science into planning and management. Others represented a science practitioner’s view on how and under what conditions the policy world might absorb, integrate, and respond to new information. In this short synthesis, we draw from several of the themes expressed in the symposium concerning the nether margins between science and policy, in which science shies away from oversimplifications and policy fears the arcane and complex. We do not claim to represent accurately or to summarize the individual presentations given by Baggett, Murphy, Nechodom, Ruth, Stewart, {{or any of the}} various keynote speakers. In fact, what we do say below may even run counter to the intentions of the other policy and institutions speakers. For that, we apologize and hope we have correctly captured the dominant themes.

40|$|The {{detection}} and study {{of climate change}} over a time frame of decades requires successive generations of satellite, airborne, and ground-based instrumentation carefully calibrated against a common radiance scale. In NASA s Earth Observing System (EOS) program, the pre-launch radiometric calibration of these instruments in the wavelength region from 400 nm to 2500 nm is accomplished using internally illuminated integrating spheres and <b>diffuse</b> reflectance <b>panels</b> illuminated by irradiance standard lamps. Since 1995, the EOS Calibration Program operating within the EOS Project Science Office (PSO) has enlisted the expertise of national standards laboratories and government and university metrology laboratories {{in an effort to}} validate the radiance scales assigned to sphere and panel radiance sources by EOS instrument calibration facilities. This state-of-the-art program has been accomplished using ultra-stable transfer radiometers independently calibrated by the above participating institutions. In ten comparisons since February 1995, the agreement between the radiance measurements of the transfer radiometers is plus or minus 1. 80 % at 411 nm, plus or minus 1. 31 % at 552. 5 nm, plus or minus 1. 32 % at 868. 0 nm, plus or minus 2. 54 % at 1622 nm, and plus or minus 2. 81 % at 2200 nm (sigma = 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades in India there have been large {{increases}} in outsourced jobs and large increases in schooling rates, particularly in English. Existing evidence suggests the trends are broadly related. In this paper we explore how localized these impacts are; this has implications for understanding how quickly information about these jobs <b>diffuses.</b> We use <b>panel</b> data on school enrollment from a comprehensive school-level administrative dataset. This is merged with detailed data on Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) center location and founding dates. Using school fixed effects, we estimate the impact of introducing a new ITES center {{in the vicinity of the}} school on enrollment. We find that introducing a new ITES center results in a 5. 7 % increase in number of children enrolled; these effects are extremely localized. We argue this result is not driven by pre-trends in enrollment or endogenous center placement, and is not a result of ITES-center induced changes in population or increases in income. The effect is driven entirely by English-language schools, consistent with the claim that the impacts are driven by changes in returns to schooling. ...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{reflectance}} {{characteristics of}} substrates in a coral reef environment are often {{measured in the}} field by viewing a substrate at nadir. However, viewing a substrate from multiple angles would likely result in different spectral characteristics for most coral reef substrates and provide valuable information on structural properties. To {{understand the relationship between}} the morphology of a substrate and its spectral response it is necessary to correct the observed above-water radiance for the effects of atmosphere and water attenuation, at a number of view and azimuth angles. In this way the actual surface reflectance can be determined. This research examines the air-water surface interaction for two hypothetical atmospheric conditions (clear Rayleigh scattering and totally cloudcovered) and the global irradiance reaching the benthic surface. It accounts for both water scattering and absorption, with simplifications for shallow water conditions, as well as the additive effect of background reflectance being reflected at the water-air surface at angles greater than the critical refraction angle (~ 48 °). A model was developed to correct measured above-water radiance along the refracted view angle for its decrease due to path attenuation and the "n squared law of radiance" and the additive surface reflectance. This allows bidirectional benthic surface reflectance and nadir-normalised reflectance to be determined. These theoretical models were adapted to incorporate above-water measures relative to a standard, <b>diffuse,</b> white reference <b>panel.</b> The derived spectral signatures of a number of coral and non-coral benthic surfaces compared well with other published results, and the signatures and nadir normalised reflectance of the corals and other benthic surface classes indicate good class separation...|$|R
