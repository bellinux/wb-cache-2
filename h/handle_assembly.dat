5000|$|AVX Aircraft {{proposed}} an aircraft with their coaxial rotor and twin ducted fan design that provides better steering and some additional forward power. Their JMR-TD {{is to be}} built at 75% scale. It is capable of flying at , with 40% lift from the small forward wings and 60% from the 56-foot rotors. Half the drag of the design comes from the fuselage and half from the rotor system, so wind tunnel tests are aiming to reduce drag by a third. The rotor system has two composite-flexbeam hubs with drag-reducing aerodynamic fairings on the blade cuffs and the mast between the hubs. The medium-sized version is proposed to weight 27,000 lb, carry four crew and 12 troops, and have a 13,000 lb external lifting capacity. It has a six-by-six foot cabin, which is twice {{the interior of the}} UH-60 Black Hawk, and has an 8,000 lb internal lifting capacity. The aircraft can carry 12 NATO litters, have an auxiliary fuel system for self-deployment over distances, and is planned to be capable of being optionally manned. The utility and attack versions will have 90% commonality and fly at the same speed. Test aircraft will be equipped with current GE T706 engines, but AVX is looking to equip their design with the Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine with its higher 4,800 hp output. AVX has teamed with Rockwell Collins, General Electric, and BAE Systems. It features entry doors {{on both sides of the}} fuselage with a large rear ramp for easy cargo handling. Both versions have retractable landing gear, and the attack variant carries all armaments stored inside until needed to provide a clean aerodynamic design. The company refers to the unnamed concept as an [...] "innovative compound coaxial helicopter" [...] capable of achieving 80 percent of the speed of the V-22 Osprey at half the cost. It will be able to hover at 6,000 ft in temperatures of 35˚C (95˚F) and fly unrefueled from Travis Air Force Base in California to Hawaii, a distance of [...] AVX considers its position as a smaller company (with 25 employees, some of which worked on the V-22) to its advantage without a legacy or burden of overhead attributes like larger defense corporations; if selected to supply an aircraft, AVX will likely have a teaming arrangement with another company that can <b>handle</b> <b>assembly,</b> integration, and production support.

It was {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering [© Professional Engineering Publishing] and is available at: [URL] paper explores the potential to combine rapid manufacturing (RM) technologies and design for environment (DFE) software with an automotive application. The work focuses on the redesign of a door <b>handle</b> <b>assembly</b> for the Jaguar XJ Saloon. The original 11 -piece assembly, comprising eight different materials, was subject to a redesign with an RM technology in mind as the method for final manufacture. In this case the suggested method for manufacture was selective laser sintering (SLS). The design freedoms afforded by the SLS process {{had a profound effect on}} the potential to redesign the product. Two different redesigns were proposed, and these, along with the original design, were subjected to analyses of environmental burden and financial profits/costs for end-of-life recycling and reuse using Boothroyd Dewhurst DFE software. The first redesign incorporated the entire assembly as a single prefabricated unit and consequently rendered a DFE analysis impossible. The second redesign was a four-piece assembly retaining three metallic components from the original product and, when subjected to the DFE analysis, showed a significant reduction in environmental burden and cost for disassembly. The surface finish of the SLS parts proved to be inadequate for visual components on a luxury car, but the potential to apply RM for applications with less stringent aesthetic requirements remains...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background High {{throughput}} {{gene expression}} studies using oligonucleotide microarrays {{depend on the}} specificity of each oligonucleotide (oligo or probe) for its target gene. However, target specific probes can only be designed when a reference genome of the species at hand were completely sequenced, when this genome were completely annotated and when the genetic variation of the sampled individuals were completely known. Unfortunately {{there is not a}} single species for which such a complete data set is available. Therefore, it is important that probe annotation can be updated frequently for optimal interpretation of microarray experiments. Results In this paper we present OligoRAP, a pipeline to automatically update the annotation of oligo libraries and estimate oligo target specificity. OligoRAP uses a reference genome assembly with Ensembl and Entrez Gene annotation supplemented with a set of unmapped transcripts derived from RefSeq and UniGene to <b>handle</b> <b>assembly</b> gaps. OligoRAP produces alignments of each oligo with the reference assembly as well as with unmapped transcripts. These alignments are re-mapped to the annotation sources, which results in a concise, as complete as possible and up-to-date annotation of the oligo library. The building blocks of this pipeline are BioMoby web services creating a highly modular and distributed system with a robust, remote programmatic interface. OligoRAP was used to update the annotation for a subset of 791 oligos from the ARK-Genomics 20 K chicken array, which were selected as starting material for the oligo annotation session of the EADGENE/SABRE Post-analysis workshop. Based on the updated annotation about one third of these oligos is problematic with regard to target specificity. In addition, the accession numbers or ids the oligos were originally designed for no longer exist in the updated annotation for almost half of the oligos. Conclusion As microarrays are designed on incomplete data, it is important to update probe annotation and check target specificity regularly. OligoRAP provides both and due to its design based on BioMoby web services it can easily be embedded as an oligo annotation engine in customised applications for microarray data analysis. The dramatic difference in updated annotation and target specificity for the ARK-Genomics 20 K chicken array as compared to the original data emphasises the need for regular updates. </p...|$|E
