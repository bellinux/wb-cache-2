5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thin slot and grins.|$|E
2500|$|Ennis {{travels to}} meet with Jack's mother and father, and offers to take Jack's ashes to the mountain. The father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. Permitted by Jack's mother to see his {{childhood}} bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt {{he thought he had}} lost on Brokeback Mountain. He discovers Jack kept it hanging with his own stained shirt from that summer's fight. Ennis holds both shirts up to his face, silently weeping. Jack's mother lets him keep the shirts. Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. arrives at Ennis' trailer to tell her father she is engaged. She asks for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fiancé really loves her and she replies [...] "yes". After Alma leaves, Ennis goes to his closet, where his and Jack's shirts hang together, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ensemble for a moment, tears in his eyes, and murmurs, [...] "Jack, I swear..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Mary," [...] the {{botanist}} whispers {{with white}} lips, but <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} man. His face whitens, it becomes so transfigured with emotion {{that for a moment}} it does not look weak. Then I see that his thin hand is clenched.|$|E
60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. <b>He</b> returned; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead {{rhinoceros}} and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hole in its throat; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> still smoking rifle.|$|R
60|$|James {{scarcely}} heard; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor, brooding sorrowfully.|$|R
60|$|Sir Oliver's brows went up, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> row of solemn faces.|$|R
60|$|ANDERSON (quaintly). Then I shall go in my best coat, dear. (He {{turns to}} the press, {{beginning}} {{to take off his}} coat.) Where--? (<b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> empty nail for a moment; then looks quickly round to the fire; strides across to it; and lifts Richard's coat.) Why, my dear, it seems that he has gone in my best coat.|$|E
6000|$|The Florist, alone, thoughtfully {{turning over}} the papers on his counter: [...] "That is sdrainche that I mage that mistake about the attress! I can't find the oder one anwhere; and if I lost it, what am I coing {{to do with the}} rhoces the other lady ortert?" [...] He steps back and looks at his feet, and then stoops and picks up a paper, which he examines. [...] "Ach! here it iss! Zlipped down behindt. Now I don't want to get it mixed with that oder any more." [...] He puts it down at the left, and takes up the address for the young man's roses on the right; <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two {{addresses}} in a stupefaction. [...] "That is very sdrainche too. Well!" [...] He drops the papers with a shrug, and goes on arranging the flowers.|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS--[Despondently.] All right, Ay tal him. [ANNA {{goes out}} the doorway on rear. CHRIS follows {{her out and}} stands on the deck outside for a moment looking after her. Then he comes back inside and shuts the door. He stands looking out of the window--mutters--"Dirty die davil, you." [...] Then {{he goes to the}} table, sets the cloth {{straight}} mechanically, picks up the newspaper ANNA has let fall to the floor and sits down in the rocking-chair. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper for a while, then puts it on table, holds {{his head in his hands}} and sighs drearily. The noise of a man's heavy footsteps comes from the deck outside and there is a loud knock on the door. CHRIS starts, makes a move as if to get up and go to the door, then thinks better of it and sits still. The knock is repeated--then as no answer comes, the door is flung open and MAT BURKE appears. CHRIS scowls at the intruder and his hand instinctively goes back to the sheath knife on his hip. BURKE is dressed up--wears a cheap blue suit, a striped cotton shirt with a black tie, and black shoes newly shined. His face is beaming with good humor.] ...|$|E
60|$|He stopped suddenly, {{rose and}} went white. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, open-mouthed; <b>he</b> trembled visibly.|$|R
60|$|THE rain {{trickled down}} his back, and {{for nearly an}} hour <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> float.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{pictures}} on the wall, and a tide of disgust surged up in him.|$|R
60|$|Another {{class of}} tramp is a man, the most {{valuable}} part of whose stock-in-trade is a highly perplexed demeanour. He is got up like a countryman, and you will often come upon the poor fellow, while he is endeavouring to decipher the inscription on a milestone-- quite a fruitless endeavour, for he cannot read. He asks your pardon, he truly does (he is very slow of speech, this tramp, and he looks in a bewildered way all round the prospect while he talks to you), {{but all of us}} shold do as we wold be done by, and he'll take it kind, if you'll put a power man in the right road fur to jine his eldest son as has broke his leg bad in the masoning, and is in this heere Orspit'l as is wrote down by Squire Pouncerby's own hand as wold not tell a lie fur no man. He then produces from under his dark frock (being always very slow and perplexed) a neat but worn old leathern purse, from which he takes a scrap of paper. On this scrap of paper is written, by Squire Pouncerby, of The Grove, 'Please to direct the Bearer, a poor but very worthy man, to the Sussex County Hospital, near Brighton'--a matter of some difficulty at the moment, seeing that the request comes suddenly upon you in the depths of Hertfordshire. The more you endeavour to indicate where Brighton is--when you have with the greatest difficulty remembered--the less the devoted father can be made to comprehend, and the more obtusely <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prospect; whereby, being reduced to extremity, you recommend the faithful parent to begin by going to St. Albans, and present him with half- a-crown. It does him good, no doubt, but scarcely helps him forward, since you find him lying drunk that same evening in the wheelwright's sawpit under the shed where the felled trees are, opposite the sign of the Three Jolly Hedgers.|$|E
60|$|If we were to-morrow morning snowed up in {{the street}} in which we live, we should step {{suddenly}} into a much larger and much wilder world than we have ever known. And it is the whole effort of the typically modern person {{to escape from the}} street in which he lives. First he invents modern hygiene and goes to Margate. Then he invents modern culture and goes to Florence. Then he invents modern imperialism and goes to Timbuctoo. He goes to the fantastic borders of the earth. He pretends to shoot tigers. He almost rides on a camel. And in all this he is still essentially fleeing from the street in which he was born; and of this flight he is always ready with his own explanation. He says he is fleeing from his street because it is dull; he is lying. He is really fleeing from his street because it is a great deal too exciting. It is exciting because it is exacting; it is exacting because it is alive. He can visit Venice because to him the Venetians are only Venetians; the people in his own street are men. He can stare at the Chinese because for him the Chinese are a passive thing to be stared at; if <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old lady in the next garden, she becomes active. He is forced to flee, in short, from the too stimulating society of his equals--of free men, perverse, personal, deliberately different from himself. The street in Brixton is too glowing and overpowering. He has to soothe and quiet himself among tigers and vultures, camels and crocodiles. These creatures are indeed very different from himself. But they do not put their shape or colour or custom into a decisive intellectual competition with his own. They do not seek to destroy his principles and assert their own; the stranger monsters of the suburban street do seek to do this. The camel does not contort his features into a fine sneer because Mr. Robinson has not got a hump; the cultured gentleman at No. 5 does exhibit a sneer because Robinson has not got a dado. The vulture will not roar with laughter because a man does not fly; but the major at No. 9 will roar with laughter because a man does not smoke. The complaint we commonly have to make of our neighbours is that they will not, as we express it, mind their own business. We do not really mean that they will not mind their own business. If our neighbours did not mind their own business they would be asked abruptly for their rent, and would rapidly cease to be our neighbours. What we really mean when we say that they cannot mind their own business is something much deeper. We do not dislike them because they have so little force and fire that they cannot be interested in themselves. We dislike them because they have so much force and fire that they can be interested in us as well. What we dread about our neighbours, in short, is not the narrowness of their horizon, but their superb tendency to broaden it. And all aversions to ordinary humanity have this general character. They are not aversions to its feebleness (as is pretended), but to its energy. The misanthropes pretend that they despise humanity for its weakness. As a matter of fact, they hate it for its strength.|$|E

60|$|The noise had aroused {{the sick}} man, and, opening his eyes, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two boys.|$|R
6000|$|Again Mr Boffin's {{eyes opened}} wide, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{applicant}} {{from head to}} foot, repeating 'Queer!--You're sure it was Secretary? Are you?' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spectators—the next <b>he</b> turned toward Carl, {{and with a}} loud snarl leaped {{straight}} for the young performer’s throat.|$|R
50|$|Nandalal is {{overwhelmed}} by emotions as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{money in his}} hand. Putting the money back in pocket, he walks away.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{ends with}} Isaac saying to Jake {{that he has}} no idea what he just did because as he said: [...] "Cassie Blake is not the only child of Blackwell in the Circle". Jake leaves with the witch hunters and while the boat is fending off, <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> members of the Circle while they are staring back at him.|$|E
50|$|Femi and Mona (Omoni Oboli) {{meet at the}} {{car park}} - She has been posted to Araromire as well; it is {{revealed}} here that they were once close friends. They both board a bus headed for Araromire. While in the bus, Mona is asleep and Femi brings out a ring; <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ring and cuddles it while he stares at sleeping Mona. He is also seen cuddling the ring later at the camp.|$|E
60|$|Grandfather Frog {{shook his}} head. His big goggly eyes seemed more goggly than ever, as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new pond in the Green Forest.|$|R
60|$|At {{this sudden}} {{announcement}} his partner became exceedingly interested. Leaning back in <b>the</b> chair <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> decorated ceiling, and uttered his favourite wind-in-the-wires whistle.|$|R
60|$|Hickory <b>at</b> once {{recognized}} <b>the</b> battered doll {{under the}} aristocratic title which Polly {{had long ago}} bestowed upon it. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bald and battered head.|$|R
50|$|Discovering the {{incident}} in the bar, Renard, Hank, Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette head to the bar to find Nick. Renard, Hank and Monroe enter the bar but Nick {{is nowhere to be}} found. Monroe then uses his ability to scent to find Nick's path. While Hank and Monroe look for Nick, Nick has found a house in the woods with a family entering while <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> family, seemingly planning on attack them.|$|E
5000|$|... "Long Boret {{arrives in}} a car driven by his wife...he looks wretched. His eyes are puffed. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground. He...knows what faces him. I {{want to get away}} but I feel I must say {{something}} to him, and Pran understands. I take Long Boret's hands and tell him what a brave thing he has done for his country and that I admire him for it. Pran takes his hands too...Long Boret tries to respond but cannot. Finally he mumbles 'Thank you.' And we must leave him." ...|$|E
50|$|The boyfriend {{opens the}} sun visor above him while driving and finds {{the veil of}} the dress the younger version had worn while partying. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> veil, hinting that he decides to make up with her. But he does not notice the large {{boulders}} on the road from a small rock slide. He swerves to avoid the rocks and accidentally drives off a cliff, dying in the subsequent crash without getting {{a chance to make}} up, while the woman's younger self also 'dies' at the same time (possibly representing the death of her colorful personality). The song ends abruptly as the sounds of the car violently rolling are heard.|$|E
6000|$|A dull scowl {{appeared}} on Cranly's forehead. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table where Moynihan had bent {{to write his}} name on the roll, and then said flatly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you like}} your school?" [...] asked the boy, {{changing}} the subject, after a little pause, during which <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.|$|R
60|$|Sydney Barnes did not answer, but {{his cheeks}} were like chalk. His mouth {{was a little}} open, {{disclosing}} his yellow teeth. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Colonel with frightened, fascinated eyes.|$|R

50|$|Using his ability, Cris {{helps the}} FBI track the {{terrorist}}s {{to the port}} where they are based. When they arrive, Cris is able to walk {{right up to the}} terrorist leader and avoid being hit, by seeing where the bullets will go and dodging them. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved. Ferris shows Cris a seismograph, hoping that he will see any tremors caused by explosions before they happen. As <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late: the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well {{as the rest of the}} city.|$|E
50|$|The year 1969. Kinshasa, Congo. On July 21, the Apollo 11 {{is going}} {{to land on the}} Moon. Tanga and Nika, husband and wife, wait for Sister Mwezi to spend a “Moon” evening with Nika’s brother Muntu-wa-Bantu. However, the nun does not appear. The Moon is full. Muntu-wa-Bantu holds the {{transistor}} radio up to his ear as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Moon. He wants to see the first steps of mankind on the Moon for himself. But no matter how long he stares, he cannot see what they are saying on the radio. Can the Moon be that far away? That night, Muntu-wa-Bantu decides that he too will walk on the Moon.|$|E
60|$|B. came in just as I had got {{everything}} into a pile. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bed, {{and asked me}} what I was doing. I told him I was packing.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{letter for}} a moment after he had {{finished}} it, and his face grew a dark red. Then he seized the paper and tore it slowly, deliberately, into bits.|$|R
6000|$|The dying Zulu's spear struck Ishmael, who {{had turned}} his head away, upon the cheek, just {{pricking}} it and causing the blood to flow, no more. Ishmael was still also, paralysed almost, or so he seemed, for even {{the pain of the}} cut did not make him move. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Dove; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead Zulu, and in his heart a voice cried: [...] "You have murdered them. By now they are pleading to God for vengeance on you, Ishmael, the outcast. You will never dare to be alone again, for they will haunt you." ...|$|R
