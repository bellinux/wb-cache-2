Lombard had asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{numerous}} times after the United States had entered World War II. After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit {{attached to a}} B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself. In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named after Carole Lombard would be launched. Gable attended {{the launch of the}} SS Carole Lombard on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of Lombard's record-breaking war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1796, the French and the Austrians had chased each other {{back and forth across}} the south German states. By October, the Austrian force, under the command of Archduke Charles, had pushed the French back to the Rhine. With the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October, the French army withdrew south and west toward the Rhine. The French commander, Jean Victor Marie Moreau, offered an armistice that the Archduke was inclined to accept. The Achduke wanted to secure the Rhine crossings so he could send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged Mantua; an armistice with Moreau would allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> However, his brother, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice, forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at Hüningen and Kehl.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of the {{scheduled}} flight, the day before the concert, on 12 September, Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were not at the airport. At this point, Clapton had not been aware of the concert, nor of Lennon contacting him. Brower had managed to get through to Clapton and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton said he got [...] "a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour." [...] The group had two rehearsals: one was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, and the other shortly before appearing on stage at the actual festival. Lennon said the group [...] "didn't know what to play", as they had not previously performed together. Also on the flight, Lennon gained the confidence, that when he got back to England, to leave the Beatles. Lennon told this to Clapton, and shortly afterwards, to the Beatles' then-manager, Allen Klein.|$|E

But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song.
