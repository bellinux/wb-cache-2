However leakage current may lead to dangerous high potentials on these objects and around them. The results of calculations and experimental research have revealed that in the rain leakage current on an earthed object and insulation resistance depends on the width of moistened zone and practically does not depend on an object size and shape. Leakage current does not exceed 3 mA at an operating voltage and 15 mA at possible <b>internal</b> <b>overvoltage</b> and full insulation resistance is not less than 3 … 4 MW for actual overhead distribution line spans. </p...|$|E

40|$|The voltage {{transients}} generated {{during the}} breaker operations in cable systems, for instance, a wind park collection grid, can reach very low rise times. The rise times of these transients can be almost 50 times {{shorter than the}} rise time of a lightning pulse. Such transients can generate a very high voltage stress on the internal transformers insulation. In this paper, a test case is studied using verified models {{of different types of}} transformers and wind turbine layouts in order to account for typical wind turbine layouts found in modern wind farms. A critical switching scenario is chosen in order to provoke the highest possible voltage transients during a current interruption. Furthermore, <b>internal</b> <b>overvoltages</b> are estimated using model of a similarly sized winding. Simulations show that the magnitude of the voltage transients is higher than the basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) defined by present standards. Moreover, it is found that the rise time of the voltage surges is much shorter than the rise time of the lightning pulse. The shortest rise time of 40 ns is obtained in a wind turbine layout where the wind turbine breaker is placed near the transformer. Due to very short rise times of the transients, very high <b>internal</b> <b>overvoltages</b> are estimated in dry-type transformer windings. These <b>internal</b> <b>overvoltages</b> are much higher than overvoltages recorded at the basic lightning impulse level. For a wind turbine layout where a breaker is placed {{in the bottom of a}} tower and a dry-type transformer in a nacelle, the highest turn-to-turn voltage of about 1. 5 pu is estimated. This is almost 4 times higher turn-to-turn voltage then the voltage obtained during the BIL test. In a wind turbine layout where a breaker is placed close to the transformer, the amplitude of the turn-to-turn voltages reached 1. 8 pu due to lower stray capacitances and thus a shorter rise time of voltage strikes...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} lines of high-voltage networks are protected against lightning strikes and <b>internal</b> <b>overvoltages</b> {{with the use}} of overhead ground wires and surge arresters. The appropriate modelling of a power system's components is a significant issue, in order to obtain reliable theoretical simulation results for the lightning performance of the line that will be used in the design of a new line or the improvement of an existing one. Metal-oxide surge arresters present difficulties in their modelling owing to their dynamic characteristics, which depends on the rise time of the injected impulse current. Several equivalent circuit models have been proposed in the technical literature for the adequate simulation of this frequency-dependent behaviour. The current paper presents the most important surge arresters models, comparing the residual voltage that each model extracts for different lighting currents. For each model, the arresters failure probability is computed implementing them on Hellenic high-voltage {{transmission lines}}, performing a sensitivity analysis for the tower footing resistance and the arresters interval installation. © 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology...|$|R

40|$|Electricity is a {{necessity}} of the modern life due to its everywhere usage. Its proper continuity depends on {{the reliability of the}} equipments used in power system. The transformer is one of the basic components which are commonly used in the power system, generation, transmission or distribution. Its high cost and difficult maintenance highlights its importance in power system. Proper protection is necessary to protect this costly equipment from any damage. Therefore, surge arresters are installed near to the transformer to protect from high voltages. However, during lightning and switching of circuit breakers, re-strikes and pre-strikes during opening and closing of a circuit breaker may lead to a broad band frequency spectrum of overvoltages. Such overvoltages may have an oscillating character and lower amplitude at the transformer terminals. In addition they may arrive at the transformer input without any changes in amplitude and waveform so the surge arrestor will not able to detect any overvoltages near the terminals {{as well as at the}} input sides.. If the oscillating frequency component of the external overvoltage is equal to the natural frequency of the windings, then the magnitude of the <b>internal</b> resonance <b>overvoltage</b> has its maximum value. Therefore, overvoltages generated in transients and switching stages in electrical power equipment may be dangerous for the insulating system despite the applied overvoltage protection. The resonance frequencies for transformer winding have been experimentally determined. The frequency band taken into account was between 10 Hz and 10 MHz, in addition the band has been divided into lower frequency band (10 Hz- 200 KHz) and higher frequency band (200 KHz- 10 MHz). Then applying sinusoidal waves with the resonance frequencies, voltage stresses on different nodes along the winding have been located. From these voltages stressed nodes it was concluded that the stressed nodes are shifting from centre of the winding towards the upper part of the winding as from lower to higher resonance frequencies. After that the voltage distribution at different resonance frequencies was analyzed. At lower frequency band, the voltage stress between turn to ground in terms of standing wave was observed whereas at higher frequency band inter layer stress was the concluded result. Voltage stress on different nodes under wider frequency was also investigated where the same behavior was seen. Step responses were also applied at the input to investigate the resonance frequencies and their voltage stressed along the length of the windings. Finally the results for sinusoidal wave and step response were compared...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a reliable, {{versatile}} and rigorous method for {{high frequency power}} transformer modeling is searched and established. The purpose is to apply this model to sensitivity analysis of FRA (Frequency Response Analysis) which is a quite new diagnostic method for assessing the mechanical integrity of power transformer windings on-site. The method should be versatile {{in terms of being}} able to estimate <b>internal</b> and external <b>overvoltages</b> and resonances. Another important aspect is that the method chosen is suitable for real transformer geometries. In order to verify the suitability of the model for real transformers, a specific test-object is used. This is a 20 MVA transformer, and details are given in chapter 1. 4. The high frequency power transformer model is established from geometrical and constructional information from the manufacturer, together with available material characteristics. All circuit parameters in the lumped circuit representation is calculated based on these data. No empirical modifications need to be performed. Comparison shows capability of reasonable accuracy in the range from 10 kHz to 1 MHz utilizing a disc-to-disc representation. A compromise between accuracy of model due to discretisation and complexity of the model in a turn-to-turn representation is inevitable. The importance of the iron core is emphasized through a comparison of representations with/without the core included. Frequency-dependent phenomena are accurately represented using an isotropic equivalent for windings and core, even with a coarse mesh for the FEM-model. This is achieved through a frequency-dependent complex permeability representation of the materials. This permeability is deduced from an analytical solution of the frequency-dependent magnetic field inside the conductors and the core. The importance of dielectric losses in a transformer model is also assessed. Since published data on the high frequency properties of pressboard are limited, some initial measurements are done on impregnated pressboard at different temperatures and moisture-levels. Tanδ is found to be twice the corresponding value for impregnated paper at frequencies from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. Moisture has a minor effect on the losses when frequency approaches 1 MHz. Service-aged paper (impregnated) is also tested in order to investigate other ageing-effects than produced water, but the test show the same decreasing influence at higher frequencies as impregnated pressboard with moisture added. The following main conclusions were drawn from this work: • A simple, analytical approach cannot be used to build a versatile high frequency power transformer model. The reason being mainly the lack of a proper representation of the iron core, since a FEM-representation without the core did not increase coherence to measurements significantly. • A proper representation of the iron core is very important for the calculation of inductances. Losses mainly originate from the core at intermediate frequencies (10 - 200 kHz), and not only from eddy currents in the windings as traditionally assumed. The permeability seem to be of less importance {{as long as it is}} well above permeability for oil, since the internal resonances mainly depends on the leakage inductances. The core leg equivalent is important for the leakage field and determines the leakage inductances and winding losses. • Using a frequency-dependent complex permeability in a FEM-simulation makes possible an accurate representation of core and windings using a coarse mesh. If coating resistivity is sufficiently low to create interlaminar currents/ losses, the iron laminates should be represented by a 2 -dimensional complex permeability. Coating parameters are seldom available. • Dielectric properties of power transformer insulating materials depend on frequency, temperature, moisture, ageing and pressure. Temperature has minor influence on FRA-signatures, other parameters have practically no influence. • Impulse- and resonant overvoltages both internally and on terminals can be analysed using this method with sufficient accuracy, provided the discretisation of the winding is sufficiently refined regarding the frequencies involved. Since terminal behaviour is given by the internal geometry and material parameters, it is assumed that internal behaviour is related to the accuracy of the terminal behaviour. • FRA sensitivity to axial displacement is 1. 2 % of total axial height. The sensitivity to radial deformation (forced buckling) is found to be a buckling depth of 9 % of the radius of the winding. Turn-to-turn short-circuits could not be modeled correctly since the lumped elements includes several turns. Disc-todisc short circuits are easily detected. Axial bending is not detectable. Detection of loose windings and aged insulation is improbable and will be dependent on the available sensitivity (mainly related to the repeatability of the measurements and the reference utilized for comparison). The contributions in this work relates to different topics such as; Frequency-dependent iron core representation in FEM, study of interlaminar currents and its effect on the internal magnetic field, characterization of high frequency dielectric properties of impregnated pressboard and service-aged impregnated paper, procedure for evaluation of internal/external overvoltages, and finally sensitivity guidelines for the application of FRA to mechanical deformations. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
