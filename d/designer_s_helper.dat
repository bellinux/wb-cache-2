40|$|Designers are {{challenged}} to manage customer, technology, and socio-economic uncertainty causing dynamic, unquenchable demands on limited resources. In this context, increased concept flexibility, {{referring to a}} <b>designer</b> <b>s</b> ability to generate concepts, is crucial. Concept flexibility can be significantly increased through the integrated design of product and material concepts. Hence, {{the challenge is to}} leverage knowledge of material structure-property relations that significantly affect system concepts for function-based, systematic design of product and materials concepts in an integrated fashion. However, having selected an integrated product and material system concept, managing complexity in embodiment design-processes is important. Facing a complex network of decisions and evolving analysis models a designer needs the flexibility to systematically generate and evaluate embodiment design-process alternatives. In order to address these challenges and respond to the primary research question of how to increase a <b>designer</b> <b>s</b> concept and design-process flexibility to enhance product creation in the conceptual and early embodiment design phases, the primary hypothesis in this dissertation is embodied as a systematic approach for integrated product, materials and design-process design. The systematic approach consists of two components i) a function-based, systematic approach to the integrated design of product and material concepts from a systems perspective, and ii) a systematic strategy to design-process generation and selection based on a decision-centric perspective and a value-of-information-based Process Performance Indicator. The systematic approach is validated using the validation-square approach that consists of theoretical and empirical validation. Empirical validation of the framework is carried out using various examples including: i) design of a reactive material containment system, and ii) design of an optoelectronic communication system.

40|$|A Rauscher virus (RV) -transformed erythroid cell line, RA-t, {{was shown}} to be a non-producer cell line. RA- 1 cells express not only gp 51 - 54 env-related glycoprotein, but also gp 70, which is more closely related to gp 51 - 54 coded by a {{recombinant}} env gene than to the MuLV-R gp 70. RA- 1 cells could be infected by Friend, Moloney and Gross viruses, but not by the homologous Rauscher murine leukaemia virus. Rescue of spleen focus-forming activity was obtained on i fection of these cells with MuLV-F or MuLV-Mol, but not with MuLV-Gross. The RNA of the RV complex resembles closely that of Friend virus (FV). It contains a 32 S, presumably defective, genome, which most likely is responsible for spleen focus formation, and a 35 <b>S</b> <b>helper</b> virus genome. Oligonucleo-tide fingerprint data suggest that RV has evolved independently of FV.

40|$|Geometric {{modeling}} of aircraft during the Conceptual design phase {{is very different}} from that needed for the Preliminary or Detailed design phases. The Conceptual design phase is characterized by the rapid, multi-disciplinary analysis of many design variables by a small engineering team. The designer must walk a line between fidelity and productivity, picking tools and methods with the appropriate balance of characteristics to achieve the goals of the study, while staying within the available resources. Identifying geometric details that are important, and those that are not, is critical to making modeling and methodology choices. This is true for both the low-order analysis methods traditionally used in Conceptual design as well as the highest-order analyses available.

The recent increasing demand for industrial robots compounded with their high complexity {{has provided the}} robot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>designers</b> with a new challenging and time-consuming problem. The reason behind it is that a robot 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>designer</b> cannot easily predict the effect of changing an operational condition or a geometrical parameter on the dynamic performance. In this dissertation a comprehensive {{study was conducted to}} analyse the dynamic characteristics of robot manipulators under different operational condi tions and various structural and geometrical configurations. Therefore, both kine matic and dynamic modelling were extensively used in both iterative and closed form.
