40|$|The {{stability}} of clear, solid antiperspirant formulations gelled with <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol</b> was investigated. It {{was found that}} the choice of glycol or alcohol solvent had a minor effect on product stability. A major enhancement of stability was achieved by incorporating acetamide MEA, methenamine, or zinc acetate, alone or in combination, as stabilizing agents. Using these materials, products have been prepared that are stable for over a year at 45 ø C...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} small {{quantities}} of 1, 3 : 2, 4 -di(4 -chlorobenzylidene) sorbitol dispersed in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) provide {{a very effective}} self-assembling nanoscale framework which, with a flow field, yields extremely high levels of polymer crystal orientation. During modest shear flow of the polymer melt, the additive forms highly extended nano-particles which adopt a preferred alignment {{with respect to the}} flow field. On cooling, polymer crystallisation is directed by these particles. This chloro substituted <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol</b> is considerably more effective at directing the crystal growth of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) than the unsubstituted compound...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} 1, 3 : 2, 4 - <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol</b> (DBS), a low-molecular organic molecule, on the space charge distribution in polyethylene. Morphological studies of the blends show {{the presence of a}} DBS network in the host system. Avrami analysis shows an increase in the nucleation density of polyethylene with the nucleating agent. Accumulation of space charge {{is one of the main}} causes of failure for high voltage cables and it depends on many factors such as additives, materials and treatment. In the present study we investigate the effects of different quantities of DBS in a blend of polyethylene. The space charge response during a stressing period and decay after removal of the applied electric field were observed. The results show that space charge accumulations are dependent on the concentration of the nucleating agent. In particular, the decay in a sample with 0. 3 % DBS indicates shallow traps, whilst samples containing 1 and 3 % DBS show evidence of deep trap charges...|$|E
40|$|Memory {{effects in}} propylene/ethylene {{copolymer}} (cPP) systems containing different amounts of <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol</b> (DBS) {{have been studied}} using wide-angle X-ray scattering techniques. It has been observed that shear flow deformation applied to the melt state containing small amounts of DBS is templated into the crystalline state. After crystallizing a sheared cPP/DBS melt, an anisotropic texture is observed by X-ray scattering, whereas the crystals produced from sheared pure cPP melts are randomly distributed. We attribute this directly to the DBS structure within the polypropylene copolymer melt. Different DBS concentrations and varying flow conditions have been explored and show that, below a certain temperature, the DBS self-organizes into a three-dimensional network within the cPP melt. When deformation is applied to this gel state, it is templated into the polymer lamellae that subsequently form, whereas when the melt is sheared at a temperature where the DBS is dissolved in the polymer, no memory of the deformation process is retained on crystallization. support of this research by a Marie Curie Fellowship of the European Union programme “Human Potential” under Contract HPMF-CT- 2000 - 00657.

40|$|AbstractThe {{crystallisation}} of polymers such as polyethylene or polypropylene {{from the}} melt is {{greatly influenced by}} the flow-thermal history prior to the crystallisation. We {{explore the influence of}} the chemical configuration of polypropylene based chains on the formation of row structures on crystallisation. We use a combination of in situ time resolved small-angle X-ray scattering, ex situ wide angle X-ray scattering with optical and scanning electron microscopy to show that row nuclei are formed in random copolymers of propylene with a limited amount of ethylene subjected to modest shear flow fields. We contrast observations performed using two homopolymers of isotactic polypropylene and one random copolymer of propylene and ethylene. We propose that it is not strictly necessary to argue that the row nuclei are already crystalline nor to invoke epitaxial crystallisation as the mechanism for the nucleation of lamellae, as similar structures can be formed on carbon nanotubes and fibrils of <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol.</b> The combination of microscopy and scattering provides a powerful approach to investigating these phenomena, especially as compared to either technique used in isolation...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol</b> (DBS) on the optical clarity, crystallization behaviour and morphology of polyethylene {{has been studied}} by UV/visible spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). By combining crystal growth rates with Avrami parameters derived from DSC crystallization exotherms, nucleation densities were determined {{as a function of}} crystallization temperature. In the blend without DBS, the nucleation density decreased progressively with increasing crystallization temperature whereas, in the system containing DBS, the nucleating efficiency was found to remain constant and then decrease dramatically above 120 degrees C. Throughout the crystallization range studied, the DBS increased the nucleation density substantially, often to a value comparable with that seen in a commercial sorbitol-clarified propylene/ethylene copolymer system. SEM revealed a change from a continuous lamellar texture at low temperatures to one based upon isolated sheaf-like objects at 124 degrees C. At high crystallization temperatures, both the DSC and the SEM also provided evidence of a significant rejected linear fraction, which appeared to decorate the sorbitol network on quenching. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graft terpolymers {{consist of}} a polymer {{backbone}} onto which are grafted two series of chemically dissimilar sidechains. Depending on monomer incompatibility, such terpolymers either order into periodic morphologies or remain microscopically mixed. Addition of a small quantity (< 2 wt %) of <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol,</b> a small-molecule gelling agent which self-associates through hydrogen bonding, to a homogeneous (Le., disordered) amphiphilic graft terpolymer results in a physical gel that exhibits two levels of structural organization. In this initial study, {{we report on the}} nature and evolution of such hierarchical order. Interactions between the gellant and terpolymer result in the formation of a fine percolation network comprised of fibrillar strands measuring 10 - 20 nm in diameter, as determined from scanning electron micrographs. Amorphous micrometer-size spherules, similar in appearance to crystalline spherulites, subsequently develop through nucleation. Dynamic rheological measurements reveal that these two distinct levels of microstructural organization are (i) responsible for deformation mechanisms manifested at different strain levels and (ii) recoverable upon mechanical and thermal recycling. These polymer-rich gels constitute a new family of responsive materials which show promise in biomedical applications. Block and graft colterpolymers continue to receive consider-able attention because they can be used commercially a...|$|E
40|$|Isotactic polypropylene, iPP, {{exhibits}} valuable {{properties and}} very competitive price, and is, therefore, {{one of the}} most widely used and studied commodity plastics. The crystallization behavior of iPP is very complicated. The iPP chains adopt a 31 helical conformation when crystallized from the molten state. These helical chains can organize into several different spatial arrangements giving rise to three distinct polymorphs: α-monoclinic, β-hexagonal and γ-orthorhombic forms, depending on the crystallization conditions and catalyst used [1 - 6]. Cooling from the melt at low or moderate cooling rates leads usually to the formation of the thermodynamically stable α-monoclinic crystalline lattice, being this α-form the most common one. However, the incorporation of a small amount of organic nucleating agents might favor the majority appearance of other crystalline lattices. These agents present different efficiencies for inducing iPP crystallization and included [7]: (i) natural compounds and their derivatives, like <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol,</b> (ii) organic salts such as sodium benzoate, (iii) organic phosphate salts, and (iv) low-molecular-weight polymers, like poly(α-pinene). The purpose of the present investigation is to analyze the effect of addition to a Ziegler-Natta iPP of a small content (1 % in weight) of a nucleating agent based on pimelic acid/calcium stearate in a 1 : 2 ratio. The polymer/nucleating agent mixture was prepared in a Haake Rheocord 9000 at 180 ºC and at 40 rpm for 10 min. After blending and homogenization of the two components, a film was obtained by compression molding in a Collin press between hot plates (200 ºC) at a pressure of 30 bar for 5 min. A quench was applied to the different films from the melt to room temperature. The real-time WAXS experiment, carried out in polymer line A 2 at Hasylab, shows the existence o...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between morphology and properties of non polar polymers {{in the presence of}} polar additives of different nature. The addi- tion of the physical gel <b>dibenzylidene</b> <b>sorbitol</b> (DBS) in a polyethylene (PE) blend has shown to act as a nucleation site on the polymer. Electron microscopy was used to reveal the fibrillar network formed by the DBS and its interaction with the PE. Moreover, the nucleation density in each material was obtained {{as a function of the}} crystallization temperature, which showed an increase in the number of nuclei in the clarified system compared to the unclarified one. However, this was found to be temperature dependent. The nucleation of PE on DBS was also studied through the induction time, which revealed a reduced surface energy of the polymer nucleus in the presence of the DBS. Space charge measurements were taken {{to investigate the}} charge transport in PE/DBS blends and the space charge at low concentration of the gelator was found to improve the space charge distribution. The same polyethylene blend has then been studied also upon addition of relatively polar ethylene/ vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), with a VA content varying from 9 % to 40 %. Morphology studies showed that three main factors control the phase separation, namely the the time the blend is kept in the melt, the PE:EVA ratio and also the EVA molecular weight. However, breakdown testing demonstrated that the polarity of EVA decreased the breakdown strength of the blends, independently on the morphology. Finally, a preliminary study was conducted with EVA based nanocomposites to determine the effect of filler on the dielectric properties of the nanocomposite. Two relatively polar copolymers, EVA 9 and EVA 18, were processed by solution blending together with 5 % of o-MMT (I 30 P and I 44 PA), and the time of solution blending was varied from 10 min to 100 min. X-ray scattering data showed intercalation in the case of EVA 9 based anocomposites and potential exfoliation for EVA 18 based nanocomposites. However, X-ray results suggest that the solution blending could extract a fraction of the organo-modified ions from in between the MMT galleries, leading to shrinkage of the clay spacing. The nanocomposite was also analysed from the point of view of its breakdown properties, which were shown to be unaffected by the presence of fillers.
