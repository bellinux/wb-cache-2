A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).|$|E
5|$|Each {{chemical}} element {{has a unique}} atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms <b>have</b> <b>six</b> protons and most <b>have</b> <b>six</b> neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Having exactly three pitch {{classes for}} its open notes (for example {C,E,G}), each major-thirds tuning repeats every note {{in a higher}} octave, because guitars <b>have</b> <b>six</b> strings. Being regular, M3 tunings repeat each note after two strings: this {{repetition}} simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.|$|E

In some cases, like Acorus (Acorales), {{they have become}} insignificant. In others, like Butomus (Alismatales), they <b>have</b> <b>six</b> coloured tepals, and so could be called 'petaloid', but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in the lilioid monocots.|$|E
5|$|Natural calcium is {{a mixture}} of five stable {{isotopes}} (40Ca, 42Ca, 43Ca, 44Ca, and 46Ca) and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes (48Ca, with a half-life of about 4.3×1019years). Calcium is the first (lightest) element to <b>have</b> <b>six</b> naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 1834, in Paris, {{he married}} Celina Szymanowska, {{daughter}} of composer and concert pianist Maria Agata Szymanowska.

5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals {{typically}} have four parathyroid glands, while other types of animals typically <b>have</b> <b>six.</b> The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions.|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also <b>have</b> <b>six</b> or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
