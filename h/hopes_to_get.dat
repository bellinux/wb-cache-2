2500|$|For {{the second}} time in the meetings' history (the first was Dubai 2003), outdoor demonstrations are outlawed due to Singapore laws banning outdoor protests and marches.

Speaking to Gay Byrne in RTÉ's The Meaning of Life series, Mr Ahern {{described}} himself as a regular Mass-goer, but said he had not been to Confession for 40 years. In a lengthy interview, Mr Ahern revealed that he and the former DUP leader Dr Ian Paisley bonded over their shared faith when they had their first formal meeting together. The meeting took place in January 2004 at the Irish Embassy in London. He recalled how Dr Paisley began a prayer in the Irish Embassy and he joined in with him. He said the prayer was [...] "like our Confiteor" [...] and officials had wondered why they had spent so much time alone. The pair started discussing their values and the rules by which they lived. His government came under severe criticism for the deal they made with the religious orders, capping their contribution to the redress board at €128 million while taxpayers will have to pay out €1 billion. As a Catholic, he wanted the church to [...] "do well", but it could not retreat behind canon law, he said. [...] "There was one time when the church tried to put up the defence of canon law and my colleagues just looked up to the sky and thought they were joking. Unfortunately, they weren’t joking, they made bad decisions." [...] Mr Ahern said he was convinced that life [...] "did not end at the graveyard" [...] and he often prayed to dead relatives for guidance. He used Mass as an opportunity to pray for people in trouble and stayed off alcohol in November and at Lent. He rationalised inexplicable events, such as the death of a young person, by stating that God cannot influence [...] "every single thing". He said he received a [...] "fair amount of hate mail" [...] about [...] "living in sin", but it upset other people more than it did him and he admitted that he had not lived up to his parents’ [...] "stereotype" [...] of married life.|$|E
