2500|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is a {{term used}} in contract law that applies where there may not otherwise be an <b>enforceable</b> <b>contract.</b> [...] The importance of promissory estoppel in contract law {{is that it has}} enabled legal obligations, which fall into the category of contract law but fail to show any consideration, to be argued for. Promissory estoppel provides a way in which promises can be legally binding even if no consideration has been given. Promissory estoppel relates to a form of future conduct. The doctrine of promissory estoppel may not make the total contract fully enforceable. The specific facts in the case must actually establish the elements of promissory estoppel before the contract becomes enforceable in law.|$|E
2500|$|The drastic remedy of {{liquidation}} was mitigated significantly as the unfair prejudice {{action was}} introduced by the Companies Act 1985. Now under the Companies Act 2006 section 996, a court can grant any remedy, but will often simply require that a minority shareholder's interest is bought out by the majority at a fair value. The cause of action, stated in section 994, is very broad. A shareholder must simply allege they have been prejudiced (i.e. their interests as a member have been harmed) {{in a way that}} is unfair. [...] "Unfairness" [...] is now given a minimum meaning identical to that in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd. A court must at least have an [...] "equitable consideration" [...] to grant a remedy. Generally this will refer to an agreement between two or more corporators in a small business that is just short of being an <b>enforceable</b> <b>contract,</b> for the lack of legal consideration. A clear assurance, on which a corporator relies, which would be inequitable to go back on, would suffice, unlike the facts of the leading case, O'Neill v Phillips. Here Mr O'Neill had been a prodigy in Mr Phillips' asbestos stripping business, and took on a greater and greater role until economic difficulties struck. Mr O'Neill was then demoted, but claimed that he should be given 50 per cent of the company's shares because negotiations had started for this to happen and Mr Phillips had said one day it might. Lord Hoffmann held that the vague aspiration that it [...] "might" [...] was not enough here: there was no concrete assurance or promise given, and so no unfairness in Mr Phillips' recanting. Unfair prejudice in this sense is an action not well suited to public companies, when the alleged obligations binding the company were potentially undisclosed to public investors in the constitution, since this would undermine the principle of transparency. However it is plain that minority shareholders can also bring claims for more serious breaches of obligation, such as breach of directors' duties. Unfair prejudice petitions remain most prevalent in small companies, and are the most numerous form of dispute to enter company courts. But if to hold directors accountable dispersed shareholders do not engage through voting, or through litigation, companies may be ripe for takeover.|$|E
2500|$|When {{people start}} work, there will almost {{always be a}} {{contract}} of employment that governs the relationship of employee and the employing entity (usually a corporation, but occasionally a human being). A [...] "contract" [...] is an agreement enforceable in law. Very often it can be written down, or signed, but an oral agreement is also a fully <b>enforceable</b> <b>contract.</b> Because employees have unequal bargaining power to almost all employing entities, most employment contracts are [...] "standard form". Most terms and conditions are photocopied or reproduced for many people. Genuine negotiation is rare, unlike in commercial transactions between two business corporations. This has been the main justification for enactment of rights in federal and state law. The federal right to collective bargaining, by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make collective agreements. The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased overtime pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a [...] "minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers", even when a person {{could not get a}} high enough wage by individual bargaining. These and other rights, including family leave, rights against discrimination, or basic job security standards, were designed by the United States Congress and state legislatures to replace individual contract provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 entitles states and municipalities to set minimum wages beyond the federal minimum. By contrast, other statutes such as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, have been interpreted in a series of contentious judgments by the US Supreme Court to [...] "preempt" [...] state law enactments. These interpretations have had the effect to [...] "stay experimentation in things social and economic" [...] and stop states wanting to [...] "serve as a laboratory" [...] by improving labor rights. Where minimum rights do not exist in federal or state statutes, principles of contract law, and potentially torts, will apply.|$|E

Further, I study how what can be considered verifiable is influenced by parties’ incentives to produce evidence and by the particular evidence cost structure.

I also study how the availability of redundant documents expands the set of <b>enforceable</b> <b>contracts,</b> and discuss the relevance of my findings to the design of legal institutions. contracts, verifiability...|$|R

Due to enforceability problems, financial contracts are constrained optimal, that is, they maximize the surplus of the contract subject to incentive compatibility constraints.
