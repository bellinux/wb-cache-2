5000|$|Springs {{for energy}} storage {{can be made}} of SWCNTs or MWCNTs {{arranged}} in dense bundles of long, aligned tubes called 'forests' of CNTs [...] that are grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The 'forests' can grow to heights of up to 6mm. A deformed CNT requires a support structure {{to carry the load}} of the spring prior to discharge. A mechanical spring must be coupled to external mechanisms to build a power source that is functionally useful. On its own a spring stores potential energy when an external force is applied to it but releases the energy in a single rapid burst once the force is removed. An effective power source needs to store energy over a period of time, release the energy only when needed and discharge the energy at a desired power level. A CNT based portable power source should have a basic architecture made of four main components: a CNT spring, a supporting structure for the spring, a <b>generator-motor</b> combination, and a coupling mechanism between the spring and the generator.|$|E
40|$|A {{flywheel}} {{energy storage}} system based on a doubly-fed induction <b>generator-motor</b> basically consists of a wound-rotor induction machine and a cycloconverter or a voltage-source PWM rectifier-inverter which is used as an AC exciter. Adjusting the rotor speed makes the <b>generator-motor</b> either release the kinetic energy to the power system or absorb it from the utility grid. Thus, the <b>generator-motor</b> has the capability of achieving not only reactive power control, but also active power control based on the flywheel effect of the rotating parts. This paper proposes a new control strategy for a doubly-fed induction <b>generator-motor,</b> which {{is characterized by the}} combination of vector control and decoupling control. The control strategy enables the induction <b>generator-motor</b> to perform active power control independent of reactive power control even in transient states. The validity of the theory developed in this paper, along with the effectiveness and viability of the control strategy, is confirmed by computer simulation. In addition, this paper discusses a transient behavior of a magnetizing current in the induction machine</p...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{brushless}} three-phase synchronous {{induction motor}} with two stators which can self-start as a wound-rotor induction motor without external secondary resistance is proposed. In the proposed motor, two excitation schemes, separately and self-ones, can be realized. In the separately excitation scheme, the proposed machine can operate as a synchronous <b>generator-motor.</b> The proposed machine compared with traditional brushless synchronous motor with AC exciter has the following advantages : the rotor structure is simple and robust, the operating reliability is high, and the high starting torque is realized...|$|E
