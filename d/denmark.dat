5|$|After the A215 {{crosses the}} A202 it becomes <b>Denmark</b> Hill. This road was {{originally}} known as Dulwich Hill, and was renamed in 1683 {{to commemorate the}} marriage of Princess Anne (later Queen Anne) to Prince George of <b>Denmark.</b> The road runs between Kings College Hospital and The Maudsley Hospital before going alongside Ruskin Park. Further south the road passes the <b>Denmark</b> Hill Estate.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was born}} on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of <b>Denmark.</b> Her birth came as a blow to her father, King Frederick II of <b>Denmark,</b> who was desperately hoping for a son. But her mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future Christian IV of <b>Denmark.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, <b>Denmark</b> was not keen on peace {{after their}} recent successes and {{witnessing}} {{the weakness of}} the Swedish efforts. The Netherlands withdrew their blockade, but were soon convinced by <b>Denmark</b> to support them again. France and England intervened for Sweden and the situation was again teetering {{on the edge of a}} major conflict. However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers. The conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen (1660). Sweden returned Bornholm and Trøndelag to <b>Denmark.</b> The treaty of 1660 established political borders between <b>Denmark,</b> Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day, and secured the Swedish dominium maris baltici.|$|E
5|$|Sweden had won {{its most}} prestigious victory, and <b>Denmark</b> had {{suffered}} its most costly defeat. <b>Denmark</b> {{was forced to}} yield the provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and the island of Bornholm. Halland had already been under Swedish control since {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, but they now became Swedish territory indefinitely. <b>Denmark</b> also had to surrender the Norwegian province Trøndelag to Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Hamlet is Prince Hamlet of <b>Denmark,</b> {{son of the}} {{recently}} deceased King Hamlet, and nephew of King Claudius, his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, and took the throne for himself. <b>Denmark</b> has a long-standing feud with neighboring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although <b>Denmark</b> defeated Norway, and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, <b>Denmark</b> fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.|$|E
5|$|With the {{declaration}} of war against Sweden on 2 September 1675, <b>Denmark</b> saw a chance to regain its recently lost eastern provinces. The southern Baltic became an important strategic theatre for both <b>Denmark</b> and Sweden. <b>Denmark</b> needed the sea lanes to invade Scania, and Sweden needed to reinforce Swedish Pomerania on the Baltic coast; both stood to gain by {{taking control of the}} Baltic trade routes. As war broke out between <b>Denmark</b> and Sweden a strong naval presence also became essential for Sweden to secure its interests at home and overseas.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Kalmar Union (1397–1523) between <b>Denmark,</b> Norway and Sweden, by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of <b>Denmark</b> when Eric of Pomerania moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle. The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King Christian I, following approval from Pope Sixtus IV. This makes it the oldest university in <b>Denmark</b> and one of the oldest in Europe. Originally controlled by the Catholic Church, the university's role in society was forced to change during the Reformation in <b>Denmark</b> in the late 1530s.|$|E

5|$|Although he was {{of royal}} blood, his family was {{relatively}} obscure and lived a comparatively normal life by royal standards. In 1852, however, George's father was designated the heir presumptive to the childless King Frederick VII of <b>Denmark,</b> and the family became princes and princesses of <b>Denmark.</b> George's siblings were Frederick (who succeeded their father as King of <b>Denmark),</b> Alexandra (who became wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom {{and the mother of}} King George V), Dagmar (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Emperor Nicholas II), Thyra (who married Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale) and Valdemar.|$|E

The German Confederation successfully invaded <b>Denmark,</b> reducing the area of <b>Denmark</b> by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
