40|$|Objectives: Cationic {{antimicrobial}} peptides (CAPs) are the effector {{molecules of}} innate immunity, similar in potency to classic antibiotics that {{function in the}} first-line of defence against infectious agents. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of negatively charged mucins on the antibacterial activity of the positively charged cathelicidin LL- 37 peptide, its synthetic analogue WLBU 2 and the antimicrobial cationic steroid CSA- 13. Methods: Mucin, DNA, F-actin and hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 in saliva samples were evaluated by microscopy or immunoblotting. Bacterial killing assays and determination of MICs were used to determine bacteri-cidal activity. Binding of rhodamine-B-labelled LL- 37 peptide to mucin was fluorimetrically assessed. Results: Microscopic evaluation of saliva after addition of rhodamine-B-labelled LL- 37 showed localiz-ation similar to that observed after the addition of a specific mucin-binding lectin. Immunoblotting con-firmed the presence of hCAP- 18 /LL- 37 in saliva samples and LL- 37 peptide bound to isolated submaxillary <b>gland</b> mucin-coated <b>plates.</b> Mucin/LL- 37 binding was partially prevented by treatment of mucin with neuraminidase, indicating involvement of sialic acid moieties. Decreased LL- 37 and WLBU 2 antibacterial activity was observed in the presence of mucin or dialysed human saliva, whereas CSA- 13 antibacterial activity was significantly resistant to inhibition by mucins...|$|R
50|$|The Phylloxeran {{species are}} very small to minute insects. Besides, {{there is a high}} {{polymorphism}} in the Phylloxeridae family making it really hard sometimes to identify its members. Also, they can pretty easily be confused to related insects such as Adelgids and true Aphids. The most important features used to tell them apart from their relatives and from other insects are the wings’ venation, the ovipositor and some characteristics of their antennae.Phylloxerans have a three-segmented antenna in all forms (both adults and immature). The Wings held flat over the body at rest and the Cu1 and Cu2 of the front wings are stalked at the base. The flagellum always ends in a sensorium (or rhinaria) and adult females can have one or two additional sensorial on the flagellum. Egg laying females and males have vestigial mouthparts and are wingless. Concerning the immature, the nymphs resemble adults but never have the secondary sensorium. Also the immature of the sexuales have a unique non-feeding pupiform larva.You can distinguish Phylloxerans from Adelgids {{by the fact that they}} have a vulva instead of a sclerotized ovipositor and usually lack the wax <b>glands</b> or <b>plates</b> found in Adelgids. They can also be distinguished from Aphids because they have 3 veins while Aphids have 4-6 veins.|$|R
50|$|The egg has a tough spiny coat, {{and usually}} hatches {{to release a}} free-swimming trochophore larva, typical of many other mollusc groups. In a few cases, the trochophore remains within the egg (and is then called lecithotrophic - {{deriving}} nutrition from yolk), which hatches to produce a miniature adult. Unlike most other molluscs, there is no intermediate stage, or veliger, between the trochophore and the adult. Instead, a segmented shell gland forms {{on one side of}} the larva, and a foot forms on the opposite side. When the larva is ready to become an adult, the body elongates, and the shell <b>gland</b> secretes the <b>plates</b> of the shell. Unlike the fully grown adult, the larva has a pair of simple eyes, although these may remain for some time in the immature adult.|$|R
40|$|Cockroaches are not {{considered}} typical plant pollinators, however, there are some exceptions to this rule. One {{of them is the}} South American species Amazonina platystylata, which is known for pollinating a dioecious shrub Clusia blattophila. This clusia is quite abundant on the Nouragues inselberg in French Guyana and is endemic there. In my research I was focused on the plant-animal communication. The aim of this thesis was to find possible behavioural response to the flower scent of clusia or to the compounds of flower scent, as clusia flowers differ in compounds of scent. Male flowers produce acetoin as a major compound. This compound is also found in female flowers but only at lower levels and in the first night of flowering. When acetoin was added to two days old female flowers, the amount of cockroaches' visits in such flowers increased to the same level as observed on male flowers. Until now there were no records about biology of this cockroach species and neither was morphology of their glands described. I have found out that both males and females of A. platystylata have tergal modification on the 7 th to 8 th tergite; a modification that could be connected to their <b>glands.</b> Evaporation <b>plate</b> on the first tergal shield in A. platystylata is described in this thesis for the first time.

50|$|The {{mesoderm}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} germinal layers that appears in the third week of embryonic development. It is formed through a process called gastrulation. There are three important components, the paraxial mesoderm, the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm forms the somitomeres, which give rise to mesenchyme of the head and organize into somites in occipital and caudal segments. give , sclerotome (cartilage and bone), and dermatome (subcutaneous tissue of the skin). Signals for somite differentiation are derived from surroundings structures, including the notochord, neural tube and epidermis. The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate, eventually it differentiates into urogenital structures consisting of the kidneys, gonads, their associated ducts, and the adrenal <b>glands.</b> The lateral <b>plate</b> mesoderm give rise to the heart, blood vessels and blood cells of the circulatory system {{as well as to the}} mesodermal component of the limbs.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{cerebellum}} {{is a major}} motor structure. However, in humans, its efferent topographical organization remains {{controversial and}} indirectly inferred from neuroimaging and animal studies. Even central questions such as 'Can we evoke limb movements by stimulating the cerebellar cortex?' have no clear answer. To address this issue, we electrically stimulated the posterior cerebellum of 20 human patients undergoing surgery for tumours located outside this structure (e. g. pineal <b>gland,</b> quadrigeminal <b>plate).</b> Stimulation, delivered at a 60 -Hz frequency for 2 s, evoked focal (single-joint) ipsilateral movements. Different regions {{were associated with the}} production of head (vermal lobule VI), face/mouth (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb (hemispheric lobules VIIb-IX) responses. Upper-limb representations were more widely distributed. They intermingled with face/mouth representations in the superior posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VI) and lower-limb representations in the inferior posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobules VIIb-IX). No intra- or inter-limb somatotopy was found in these areas. Functionally, upper-limb (face/mouth movements) and upper limb-lower limb postural coordinations are major elements of our motor repertoire. Representation of these pairs of segments in common regions might favour the production of integrated motor behaviours. The intermediate region of the posterior cerebellum (hemispheric lobule VII and vermal lobules VII-VIII) was mostly silent. Latency results in conjunction with previous electrophysiological evidence in animals suggest that electrically evoked motor responses were not mediated by a cortical route but rather by brainstem structures. The potential role of this descending efferent pathway for fine motor control is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Histological {{examination}} of serial sections through the abdomen of workers of three species of Myopias ants revealed {{the presence of}} several exocrine glands. These include the common venom and Dufour glands {{as well as the}} pygidial gland, but also more specific sternal glands and glands associated with the sting base and the gonostyli. Two of these glands have not been reported previously among ants: one is the paired oblong <b>plate</b> <b>gland,</b> that occurs next to the oblong plate and may have a pheromonal function. The other novel gland is the paired sting shaft gland, that occurs at the dorsal side in the proximal region of the sting shaft. A remarkable characteristic of these Myopias ants is that all glands of class- 3 show ducts with gradually widening internal diameter. Myopias emeryi shows a clearly more simple variety of abdominal glands than Myopias maligna and M. sp. 1. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} head {{development}} {{is complex and}} {{with the exception of}} the hindbrain region, it is unlike trunk development in as much as it does not involve discrete segmentation. Recent evidence suggests that the paired-like family of genes play a role in regulating anterior development. To further understand the role that these genes possess, we have cloned the Xenopus homolog of Prix 1. XPitx 1 is present as a maternal transcript with expression observed as a dorsal streak during gastrulation. This streak restricts to a small circular domain underlying the centre of presumptive neural plate. Concomitantly, a crescent of expression is observed at the border of anterior neural ectoderm. Expression of xPitx 1 persists throughout the cement gland anlage during gastrulation. At the onset of organogenesis, xPitx 1 is expressed within the cement <b>gland,</b> eye, lateral <b>plate</b> mesoderm, and first branchial arch derivatives. Misexpression of xPitx 1 in whole embryos leads to the formation of enlarged or ectopic cement glands. In addition, variable posterior deficits are observed with extreme cases where the embryo exhibits no recognizable structures posterior to the cement gland. Expression of markers such as XCG- 1, xOtx 2, xPar 6, and xTwist suggest that increases in cement gland and lower mandibular size are likely at the expense of other head tissues. Conversely, antagonization of xPitx 1 with a mutant form of the gene results in cement gland inhibition and head malformations. Animal cap assays show that xPitx 1 can directly induce cement gland formation and that induction requires DNA binding by xPitx 1.
