5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He <b>explains</b> that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He <b>explains</b> that they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together.

40|$|It is “easy” to <b>explain</b> doing, “hard” to <b>explain</b> feeling. Turing has set {{the agenda}} for the easy {{explanation}} (though {{it will be a long}} time coming). I will try to <b>explain</b> why and how <b>explaining</b> feeling will not only be hard, but impossible. <b>Explaining</b> meaning will prove almost as hard because meaning is a hybrid of know-how and what it feels like to know how...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated whether {{studying a}} text with an "explanation intention" and then actually <b>explaining</b> it to (fictitious) {{other students in}} writing, would yield the same benefits as previously found for <b>explaining</b> on video. Experiment 1 had participants first studying a text either with the intention to <b>explain</b> it to others or to complete a test, and subsequently restudying vs. <b>explaining</b> in writing. Neither study intention nor <b>explaining</b> affected learning outcomes. Experiment 2 directly compared <b>explaining</b> in writing and on video. Participants studied a text with a test intention followed by restudy, or study with an explanation intention followed by either <b>explaining</b> in writing or on video. <b>Explaining</b> on video, but not in writing, enhanced learning more than restudy. These {{findings suggest that the}} benefits of <b>explaining</b> on video are not a result of engaging in explanation per se. Results are discussed in light of feelings of social presence...|$|R
40|$|What {{is it to}} <b>explain</b> away an intuition? Philosophers {{regularly}} {{attempt to}} <b>explain</b> intuitions away, but it is often unclear what the success conditions for their project consist in. I attempt to articulate some of these conditions, taking philosophical case studies as guides, and arguing that many attempts to <b>explain</b> away intuitions underestimate the challenge the project of <b>explaining</b> away involves. I will conclude, therefore, that <b>explaining</b> away intuitions is a more difficult task than has sometimes been appreciated; I also suggest, however, {{that the importance of}} <b>explaining</b> away intuitions has often been exaggerated...|$|R

He apologises for his father's actions and <b>explains</b> that even though he will probably be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes. Catherine accepts and the couple marry.|$|E
