5|$|Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as {{binoculars}} {{may result}} in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the eye at <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> levels.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of the uses of gated imaging tubes. Because of {{the combination of the}} very high speeds at which a gated tube may operate and their light amplification capability, gated tubes can record specific portions of a beam of light. It is possible to capture only the portion of light reflected from a target, when a pulsed beam of light is fired at the target, by controlling the gating parameters. Gated-Pulsed-Active Night Vision (GPANV) devices are another example of an application that uses this technique. GPANV devices can allow a user to see objects of interest that are obscured behind vegetation, foliage, and/or mist. These devices are also useful for locating objects in deep water, where reflections of light off of nearby particles from a continuous light source, such as a <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> underwater floodlight, would otherwise obscure the image.|$|E

500|$|As {{a cheaper}} option the UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being [...] "a more {{affordable}} luxury", retaining the [...] "premium feel" [...] of the Zenbook range {{but at a}} lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD to keep costs down, was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous-generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a matte finish and relatively <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found [...] "quite suitable for outdoor use", noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent {{compounds}} {{are often}} used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a [...] "whitening" [...] effect. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white. Optical brighteners are used in laundry detergents, <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> paper, cosmetics, high-visibility clothing and more.|$|E
2500|$|Strongly {{fluorescent}} pigments {{often have}} an unusual appearance {{which is often}} described colloquially as a [...] "neon color." [...] This phenomenon was termed [...] "Farbenglut" [...] by Hermann von Helmholtz and [...] "fluorence" [...] by Ralph M. Evans. It is generally thought {{to be related to}} the <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a photoinjector, in {{particular}} that of the electron source, is of central importance for free electron laser (FEL) machines where a <b>high</b> beam <b>brightness</b> is required. In comparison to standard designs, an rf traveling-wave photocathode gun can provide a more rigid beam with a <b>higher</b> <b>brightness</b> and a shorter pulse. This is illustrated by applying a specific optimization procedure to the SwissFEL photoinjector, for which a brightness improvement up to a factor 3 could be achieved together with a double gun output energy compared to the reference setup foreseeing a state-of-the-art S-band rf standing-wave gun. The <b>higher</b> <b>brightness</b> is mainly given by a (at least) double peak current at the exit of the gun which brings benefits for both the beam dynamics in the linac and {{the efficiency of the}} FEL process. The gun design foresees an innovative coaxial rf coupling {{at both ends of the}} structure which allows a solenoid with integrated bucking coil to be placed around the cathode in order to provide the necessary focusing right after emission...|$|R
2500|$|Brightness is {{a measure}} of how much light is {{reflected}} by paper under specified conditions and is usually reported as a percentage of how much light is reflected, so a higher number represents a brighter or whiter paper. In the US, the TAPPI T 452 [...] or T 525 standards are used. The international community uses ISO standards. The following table shows how the two systems rate <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> papers, but there is no simple way to convert between the two systems because the test methods are so different. Note that the ISO rating is higher and can go above 100. This is because today’s white paper manufacturing uses fluorescent whitening agents (FWA). Because the ISO standard only measures a narrow range of blue light, it is not an adequate measure for the actual whiteness or brightness.|$|E
2500|$|A modern display {{technology}} using {{a variation of}} cathode ray tube is often used in videocassette recorders, DVD players and recorders, microwave oven control panels, [...] and automotive dashboards. Rather than raster scanning, these vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD) switch control grids and anode voltages on and off, for instance, to display discrete characters. The VFD uses phosphor-coated anodes as in other display cathode ray tubes. Because the filaments are in view, they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly. This is possible using more recent cathode technology, and these tubes also operate with quite low anode voltages (often less than 50 volts) unlike cathode ray tubes. Their <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> allows reading the display in bright daylight. VFD tubes are flat and rectangular, as well as relatively thin. Typical VFD phosphors emit {{a broad spectrum of}} greenish-white light, permitting use of color filters, though different phosphors can give other colors even within the same display. The design of these tubes provides a bright glow despite the low energy of the incident electrons. This is because the distance between the cathode and anode is relatively small. (This technology is distinct from fluorescent lighting, which uses a discharge tube.) ...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{synchrotron}} radiation as an intense X-ray source for biological diffraction has only very recently been promoted into a long-term experimental programme.

In the case of small-angle studies on weakly scattering specimens at high time resolution, e. g. stroboscopic diffraction studies on muscle, the lack of X-ray sources of considerably <b>higher</b> <b>brightness</b> than from conventional X-ray generators has become limiting.

Write {{and tell me that}} you forgive and pity me. I love you even more, if such a thing is possible, than I have ever loved you. This is my only comfort and compensation, that I have had and have been able to feel such a love, and I know I shall always feel it.--Nancy." [...] The first effect of this letter was a paralyzing one. I was unable to realize or believe the thing that had happened to me, and I sat stupidly holding the sheet in my hand until I heard voices along the path, and then I fled instinctively, like an animal, to hide my injury from any persons I might meet. I wandered down the shore of the lake, striking at length into the woods, seeking some inviolable shelter; nor was I conscious of physical effort until I found myself panting near the crest of the ridge where there was a pasture, which some ancient glacier had strewn with great boulders. Beside one of these I sank. Heralded by the deep tones of bells, two steers appeared above the shoulder of a hill and stood staring at me with bovine curiosity, and fell to grazing again. A fleet of white clouds, like ships pressed with sail, hurried across the sky as though racing for some determined port; and the shadows they cast along the hillsides accentuated the <b>high</b> <b>brightness</b> of the day, emphasized the vivid and hateful beauty of the landscape. My numbness began to be penetrated by shooting pains, and I grasped little by little the fulness of my calamity, until I was in the state of wild rebellion of one whom life for the first time has foiled in a supreme desire. There was no fate about this thing, it was just an absurd accident. The operation of the laws of nature had sent a man to the ground: another combination of circumstances would have killed him, still another, and he would have arisen unhurt. But because of this particular combination my happiness was ruined, and Nancy's! She had not expected me to understand. Well, I didn't understand, I had no pity, in that hour I felt a resentment almost amounting to hate; I could see only unreasoning superstition in the woman I wanted above everything in the world. Women of other days had indeed renounced great loves: the thing was not unheard of. But that this should happen in these times--and to me! It was unthinkable that Nancy of all women shouldn't be emancipated from the thralls of religious inhibition! And if it wasn't [...] "conscience," [...] what was it? ...|$|E
