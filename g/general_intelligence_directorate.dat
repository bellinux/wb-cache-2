5|$|Al-Balawi was a Jordanian {{doctor and}} {{jihadist}} website writer who was detained and interrogated over three days by the Jordanian intelligence service, the <b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate</b> (GID), in January 2009. The GID and the CIA {{thought they had}} turned al-Balawi to penetrate al-Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas to provide intelligence for high-level targets. Instead, al-Balawi used this trust {{to gain access to}} the CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack.

50|$|During {{the reign}} of King Saud bin Abdulaziz, the <b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> was {{separated}} from the Mabahith (<b>General</b> Investigation <b>Directorate).</b> <b>Intelligence</b> was established as an independent security service with the issuing of the Royal Decree 11 in 1957 that ordered the setting up of a special department under the title of Maslahat Al-Istikhbarat Al-Aammah or (<b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Department). During this period two branches of the Presidency were set up locally, the western branch in Jeddah, and eastern one in Dhahran.|$|R
50|$|Fighting {{broke out}} between the {{fedayeen}} and the army in Zarqa on 7 June. Two days later, the fedayeen opened fire on the <b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate's</b> (Mukhabarat) headquarters. Hussein went to visit the mukhabarat's HQ after the incident, but his motorcade came under heavy fedayeen fire that killed one of his guards. Bedouin units of the army retaliated for the assassination attempt against their King by shelling Al-Wehdat and Al-Hussein camps, which developed into a conflict that lasted three days. An Israeli army meeting discussed the events in Jordan, according {{to the director of}} Israel's Military Intelligence, there were around 2,000 fedayeen in Amman armed with mortars and Katyusha rockets. Hussein's advisors were divided: some were urging him to finish the job, while others urging restraint as it could only be accomplished at the cost of thousands of lives which was unacceptable. Hussein halted the fighting, and the three day conflict's toll was around 300 dead and around 700 wounded, including civilians. A ceasefire was announced by Hussein and Arafat, but the PFLP did not abide. It immediately held around 68 foreign nationals as hostages in two Amman hotels, threatening to blow them up in the buildings if Sharif Zaid and Sharif Nasser were not dismissed and the Special Forces unit was not disbanded. Arafat did not agree with the PFLP, but had to play along as he feared losing his stance in public opinion.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 1967, the Cuban <b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate,</b> or DGI, {{had begun}} to {{establish}} ties with Nicaraguan revolutionary organizations. By 1970 the DGI had managed to train hundreds of Sandinista guerrilla leaders and had vast influence over the organization. After the successful ousting of Somoza, DGI involvement in the new Sandinista government expanded rapidly. An early indication of the central role that the DGI would play in the Cuban-Nicaraguan relationship is a meeting in Havana on July 27, 1979, at which diplomatic ties {{between the two countries}} were re-established after more than 25 years. Julián López Díaz, a prominent DGI agent, was named Ambassador to Nicaragua. Cuban military and DGI advisors, initially brought in during the Sandinista insurgency, would swell to over 2,500 and operated {{at all levels of the}} new Nicaraguan government.|$|E

In early 2007, the Treasury Department, {{acting on a}} June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread {{weapons of mass destruction}} and being supportive of terrorism. Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to [...] "undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon" [...] in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian <b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate</b> and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.|$|E
500|$|In March 2006, Warner Bros. hired screenwriter William Monahan {{to adapt}} the novel Penetration by David Ignatius into a feature film, which would be {{directed}} by Ridley Scott. In April 2007, with the novel re-titled Body of Lies and the film similarly re-titled, actor Leonardo DiCaprio was cast in the lead role. DiCaprio chose to pursue the role because he considered it a throwback to political films in the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). DiCaprio dyed his hair brown, and wore brown contacts for the role. After DiCaprio was cast, Russell Crowe was courted for a supporting role, to which he formally committed after Monahan's script was revised by Steve Zaillian, who wrote Scott and Crowe's American Gangster. Crowe gained 63 pounds to suit his role. The actor said {{as a result of}} the film's exploration of the American government and foreign policy, [...] "I don't think it will be very popular, but that’s never been part of my project choice process." [...] Mark Strong, who plays Hani Salaam, the head of the Jordanian <b>General</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Directorate</b> (GID) ascribed his casting to his performances in the 2005 films Syriana and Oliver Twist. The character Haani Salaam was modelled after the 2000–2005 GID chief Saad Kheir (1953–2009), whose involvement, according to the original author David Ignatius, in sharply handled interrogations without use of torture, an encounter with a jihadist with his mother on the phone and being called the 'fingernail boss' were near accurately featured in the film.|$|E

He was crown prince when he was born in 1962, but Hussein transferred the title to his brother Hassan in 1965 due to political uncertainty back then. On his way back to Jordan in January 1999, Hussein stopped in London. Doctors advised him to rest and stay in England for a few weeks, as he was still too fragile to travel.
