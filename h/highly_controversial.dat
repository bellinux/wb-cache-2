Curtis served during the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars and was highly praised in the former conflict for his bravery under fire at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, where he saved several hundred Spanish lives at great risk to his own. His career suffered however {{in the aftermath of the}} Glorious First of June, when he was heavily criticised for his conduct by several influential figures, including Cuthbert Collingwood. His popularity fell further due to his involvement in two <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> courts-martial, those of Anthony Molloy in 1795 and James Gambier in 1810.|$|E

5|$|The {{report cards}} for these {{operations}} are <b>highly</b> <b>controversial.</b> Some sources claim the commandos suffered immense casualties and were ineffectual.

One Israeli divisional commander also commended the Egyptian Sa'iqa.|$|E
5|$|Doug Wickenheiser was {{selected}} by Montreal with the first pick at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. The decision was <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> as the fans in Montreal had hoped the team would take francophone star Denis Savard. Wickenheiser's transition to the NHL was difficult; his popularity was harmed by comparisons of his struggles to Savard's immediate success with the Black Hawks. He {{was traded to the}} Blues midway through the 1983–84 season.|$|E
5|$|From the {{perspective}} of the Canadian 1st Army, the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations — the most notable being a <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> attack by the Royal Highland Regiment (Black Watch) of Canada on 25 July.

In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} what {{happened}} at Salon Kitty first came to light in Walter Schellenberg's memoirs, published in Germany in 1956 under the title The Labyrinth. Peter Norden later expanded the story in his 1970 book Salon Kitty.

5|$|While Darwinian {{evolution}} {{never became}} an issue for northern Presbyterians as most accommodated themselves {{to some form of}} theistic evolution, the new discipline of biblical interpretation known as higher criticism would become <b>highly</b> <b>controversial.</b> Utilizing comparative linguistics, archaeology, and literary analysis, German proponents of high criticism, such as Julius Wellhausen and David Friedrich Strauss, began questioning long-held assumptions about the Bible. At the forefront of the controversy in the PCUSA was Charles A. Briggs, a professor at PCUSA's Union Theological Seminary in New York.|$|E

5|$|Congestion pricing remains <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> {{with the}} public {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been {{resolved}} through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Hu Lanqi {{was born}} to an {{affluent}} family in Chengdu, Sichuan Province in 1901, during the tumultuous late Qing dynasty.

However, soon afterwards she rebelled against the arranged marriage and divorced her husband, which was <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's legacy {{has been}} <b>highly</b> <b>controversial.</b> In the years {{following}} his death his ideas became taboo in the Spanish realm, and he {{was seen as a}} nearly heretical extremist; the accounts written by his enemies Lopez de Gómara and Oviedo were widely read and published. As the British empire rose to power and hostilities between the British and Spanish began, the British used Las Casas's accounts of Spanish cruelty as a political tool making it part of the foundation of what Spanish nationalists have called the Black Legend, the tendency of historians to slander Spain for its imperial past, while looking mildly at the same undertakings by others such as the British.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea in particular, that many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be <b>highly</b> <b>controversial.</b> This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E
5|$|Revie's {{reputation}} {{suffered in}} the late 1970s after his <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> England resignation. Both the Daily Mirror and Sunday People claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake's claims that Revie's captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages, along with legal costs, after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match in question, testified {{that he had heard}} no mention of the alleged bribes.|$|E
5|$|SMS Von der Tann was {{the first}} German battlecruiser, ordered in 1907. She was {{designed}} {{in response to the}} British s, construction on which had begun the previous year. As the first of a new type, the design process for Von der Tann was <b>highly</b> <b>controversial.</b> Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary for the Imperial German Navy, wanted the ship to follow the British pattern of large guns, relatively light armor, and high speed. Kaiser Wilhelm II, along with other senior navy officers instead argued that, owing to Germany's numerical inferiority, the new ships should have armor strong enough to permit their use in the battle line.|$|E

25|$|In {{the runoff}} of August 8, 2006, {{although}} there were about 8,000 more voters than in the primary, McKinney received {{about the same number}} of votes as in July. Johnson won with 41,178 votes (59%) to McKinney's 28,832 (41%). McKinney's loss is attributed to a mid-decade redistricting, in which the 4th had absorbed portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale Counties, as well as her <b>highly</b> publicized <b>controversial</b> run-in with a police officer in the March 29, 2006, Capitol Hill police incident.|$|R
5|$|The 1951 WHO {{publication}} {{was highly}} influential in causing widespread {{changes in the}} practices and prevalence of institutional care for infants and children, and in changing practices relating to the stays of small children in hospitals so that parents were allowed more frequent and longer visits. Although the monograph was primarily concerned with the removal of children from their homes it was also used for political purposes to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen. The publication was also <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> with, amongst others, psychoanalysts, psychologists and learning theorists, and sparked significant debate and research {{on the issue of}} children's early relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was <b>highly</b> <b>controversial</b> {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E

By May 2006 the continuous protests had left the magazine without an office. The bad publicity led advertisers to abandon the magazine. Ultimately the magazine was shut down after releasing ten issues, having moved to the predominantly Hindu island Bali since its second issue, in June 2006.|$|E
