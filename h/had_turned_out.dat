5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 {{million for the}} company's next film, From Russia with Love. The film was shot in Europe, which <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be the more profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding, {{celebrated for}} his {{development}} of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related {{the story of how}} he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be Herbert Newby McCoy, who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{acquisition}} of S.G. Warburg & Co., a leading British investment banking firm, in 1995 {{for the price}} of US$1.4billion signified a major push into investment banking. S.G. Warburg & Co. had established a reputation as a daring merchant bank that grew {{to be one of the}} most respected investment banks in London. However, a Warburg expansion into the U.S. <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> flawed and costly, and talks in 1994 with Morgan Stanley about a merger had collapsed. SBC merged the firm with its own existing investment banking unit to create SBC Warburg.|$|E

5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{was first}} {{performed}} on 13 June 1997 at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall during the 50th Aldeburgh Festival. Sally Burgess {{was accompanied by}} the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by Nicholas Kok. The companion piece was the chamber opera The Country of the Blind which Turnage had composed relatively quickly {{in order to make}} up a full programme after Twice <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> much shorter than originally intended. To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with a staging at its main home in the London Coliseum. This production was premiered on 20 October 1997 with Susan Bickley as the soloist and with Kok again conducting. In this context it was a companion piece for From the House of the Dead, an opera set in a Siberian prison camp.|$|E

25|$|Six-day cycle races {{involving}} {{more than}} one rider {{grew out of the}} 19th-century enthusiasm for endurance and other novelty competitions. A promoter at the Agricultural Hall held a six-day walking contest in April 1877. It was enough of a success for another to be held the following year. That inspired another organiser, name no longer known, to organise a six-day race in the same hall but for cyclists, also in 1878. He hoped to attract the crowd of 20,000 a day that <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> for the walkers.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, police {{wielding}} batons {{clashed with}} protesters who disrupted {{the passage of}} a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste from France to Germany. The train carrying the nuclear waste was heading for Dannenberg where the 123 tonnes of waste was loaded onto trucks and taken to the nearby storage facility of Gorleben, in central Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Organisers said 50,000 people <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> but police said the figure was closer to 20,000. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January 1926 Jääkarhu {{was ready}} for first sea trials in the North Sea. Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the {{delivery}} of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to be very severe. Despite {{the best efforts of}} existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of Åland were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of Utö {{at the edge of the}} Archipelago Sea.|$|E

25|$|The Allies {{landed at}} Normandy on June 6, 1944, {{and two months}} later broke the German lines and began to advance toward and around Paris. German control over Paris was already {{breaking}} down. One hundred thousand Parisians <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> on July 14 for a prohibited celebration of Bastille Day. German soldiers fired into the air, but the French police did nothing. On August 10, half of the eighty thousand railroad workers in the Paris region went on strike, stopping all railroad traffic. On August 15, the new German commander of Paris, General Dietrich von Choltitz, ordered that three thousand resistance members held in Paris jails be transferred out of the city. They were loaded into trains, 170 persons in each cattle car, {{and sent to the}} concentration camps of Buchenwald and Ravensbrück. Only twenty-seven returned. On the same day, the Paris police learned that policemen in the suburbs were being disarmed by the Germans; they immediately went on strike. In Paris, most of the electricity and gas were cut off, there was little food available, and the metro had stopped running.|$|E
25|$|The Mustangs were a surf music instrumental/dance band {{formed in}} Adelaide in 1964 with Mick Bower on rhythm guitar, Rick Morrison on lead guitar, Brian Vaughton on drums and Gavin Webb on bass guitar. Initially they played covers of The Shadows and The Ventures songs. The band's output was profoundly {{influenced}} by the Australian tour of The Beatles in June 1964, which had a particular impact in Adelaide, due to recent migrants from United Kingdom (UK). When The Beatles arrived in Adelaide they were greeted by the largest crowd ever seen in their touring career—estimates as high as 300,000 while Adelaide's population being less than 1 million—one-third of the city <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> to greet them (see The Beatles' influence on popular culture). Following The Beatles' chart breakthrough and tour, {{it was obvious that}} the surf/instrumental style was passé. The Mustangs changed style and took on a lead singer, Scottish immigrant, Jim Keays. The Mustangs rehearsed regularly in a shed behind a hotel owned by Vaughton's family. Their original manager, Graham Longley, made a tape recording of a rehearsal; it was rediscovered and released on CD in 2004 as Mustangs to Masters... First Year Apprentices. After Keays joined on lead vocals, the band produced more original songs in the beat style.|$|E
