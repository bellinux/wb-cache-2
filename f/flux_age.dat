40|$|Abstract. Environmental tracers {{are used}} widely to {{evaluate}} flow processes and estimate <b>fluxes</b> and <b>ages</b> of pore water in arid regions. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate uncertainties in water <b>flux</b> and <b>age</b> on the basis of data from environmental tracers, including meteoric Cl, 36 Cl, 3 H, d 2 H, and d 18 O in porous media. Representative profiles of environmental tracers from drainage and interdrainage areas at a site in the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas were evaluated. The chloride mass balance approach (CMB) was used to evaluate water <b>fluxes</b> and <b>ages.</b> The long residence times indicated by the Cl data in interdrainage areas (55, 000 to 105, 000 years to 25 m depth) were generally corroborated by residence times estimated from radioactive decay of 36 Cl (39, 000 6 13, 000 to 59, 000 6 14, 400 years). Uncertainties in the CMB approach include uncertainties in transport processes, Cl input, and Cl output. Although the CMB approach assumes one-dimensional, downward piston flow, water potential and stable isotope data in interdrainage areas suggest net upward water movement. Cl data indicate that drying of the profiles may have persisted throughout the Holocene (; 10, 000 years). Therefore the downward flow assumption may only be applicable in the older, deeper sections of th...|$|R

40|$|We use {{polarity}} reversal systematics from numerical dynamos {{to quantify the}} hypothesis that the modulation of geomagnetic reversal frequency, including geomagnetic superchrons, results from changes in core heat flux related to growth and collapse of lower mantle superplumes. We parameterize the reversal frequency sensitivity from numerical dynamos in terms of average core heat flux normalized by the difference between the present-day core heat flux and the core heat flux at geomagnetic superchron onset. A low-order polynomial fit to the 0 - 300 Ma Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) reveals that a decrease in core heat flux relative to present-day of approximately 30 % can account for the Cretaceous Normal Polarity and Kiaman Reverse Polarity Superchrons, whereas the hyper-reversing periods in the Jurassic require a core heat flux equal to or higher than present-day. Possible links between GPTS transitions, large igneous provinces (LIPs), and the two lower mantle superplumes are explored.

Application of the semi-empirical technique of Burgasser, Burrows & Kirkpatrick indicates that HD 3651 B has Teff = 790 +/- 30 K and log g = 5. 0 +/- 0. 3 for a metallicity of [M/H] = 0. 12 +/- 0. 04, consistent with a mass M = 0. 033 +/- 0. 013 M_sun and an age of 0. 7 - 4. 7 Gyr.

40|$|The {{completion}} of the GALEX All-Sky Survey in the ultraviolet allows activity measurements to be acquired for many more stars than is possible with the limited sensitivity of ROSAT or the limited sky coverage of Chandra, XMM, or spectroscopic surveys for line emission in the optical or ultraviolet. We have explored the use of GALEX photometry as an activity indicator, using as a calibration sample stars within 50 pc, representing the field, and in selected nearby associations, representing the youngest stages of stellar evolution. We present preliminary relations between UV flux and the optical activity indicator R'_HK and between UV <b>flux</b> and <b>age.</b> We demonstrate that far-UV (FUV, 1350 - 1780 Å) excess flux is roughly proportional to R'_HK.

40|$|Many {{metabolic}} pathways are critically regulated during {{development and}} aging but {{little is known}} about the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. One key metabolic cascade in eukaryotes is the mevalonate pathway. It catalyzes the synthesis of sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids, such as cholesterol and ubiquinone, as well as other metabolites. In humans, an age-dependent decrease in ubiquinone levels and changes in cholesterol homeostasis suggest that mevalonate pathway activity changes with age. However, our knowledge of the mechanistic basis of these changes remains rudimentary. We have identified a regulatory circuit controlling the sumoylation state of Caenorhabditis elegans HMG-CoA synthase (HMGS- 1). This protein is the ortholog of human HMGCS 1 enzyme, which mediates the first committed step of the mevalonate pathway. In vivo, HMGS- 1 undergoes an age-dependent sumoylation that is balanced by the activity of ULP- 4 small ubiquitin-like modifier protease. ULP- 4 exhibits an age-regulated expression pattern and a dynamic cytoplasm-to-mitochondria translocation. Thus, spatiotemporal ULP- 4 activity controls the HMGS- 1 sumoylation state in a mechanism that orchestrates mevalonate pathway activity with the age of the organism. To expand the HMGS- 1 regulatory network, we combined proteomic analyses with knockout studies and found that the HMGS- 1 level is also governed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We propose that these conserved molecular circuits have evolved to govern the level of mevalonate pathway <b>flux</b> during <b>aging,</b> a <b>flux</b> whose dysregulation is associated with numerous age-dependent cardiovascular and cancer pathologies...|$|R

40|$|Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are stable post-translational {{modifications}} of proteins {{formed by the}} spontaneous reaction with glucose and related metabolites. Important AGEs quantitatively are methylglyoxal (MG) -derived hydroimidazolone MG-H 1, Nε- carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) and glucosepane. They {{contribute to the development}} of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cellular proteolysis of AGE-modified proteins forms AGE free adducts, glycated amino acids, which are cleared by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Dietary AGEs mainly supplement the endogenous <b>flux</b> of <b>AGE</b> free adduct formation. AGE free adducts accumulate markedly in plasma with decline in glomerular filtration rate. A key precursor of AGEs is the dicarbonyl metabolite, MG, which is metabolised by glyoxalase 1 (Glo 1) of the cytoplasmic glyoxalase system. Proteins susceptible to MG modification are called collectively the “dicarbonyl proteome”. Abnormal increase of MG “dicarbonyl stress” and is a characteristic of CKD, driven by down regulation of renal Glo 1, increasing flux of MG-H 1 formation. Protein inactivation and dysfunction linked to the dicarbonyl proteome contributes to CKD development. The receptor for AGEs, RAGE, is important in development of CKD but its interaction with AGEs in vivo remains enigmatic; other ligands and ternary complexation may be influential. Prevention of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by overexpression of Glo 1 in transgenic animal models has stimulated the development of small molecule inducers of Glo 1 expression, “Glo 1 inducers”, to prevent AGE formation. trans- Resveratrol-hesperetin combination therapy is a Glo 1 inducer.

These data will constrain theories of field evolution in these stars. Using the new spectropolarimeter ESPaDOnS at CFHT, we have obtained 44 measurements of the mean longitudinal fields of 23 B 6 - A 2 stars that have been identified as possible Ap stars and that are possible members of open clusters, with a median uncertainty of about 45 G. Of these stars, 10 have definite field detections. Nine stars of our sample are found not to be magnetic Ap stars. The ESPaDOnS data contain a large amount of useful information not readily obtained from lower resolution spectropolarimetry. With the new observations we are able to expand the available data on fields of low-mass, relatively evolved Ap stars, and identify more robustly which observed stars are actually magnetic Ap stars and cluster members. Re-analysis of the enlarged data set of cluster Ap stars indicates that such stars with masses in the range of 2 [...] 5 show RMS fields larger than about 1 kG only when they are near the ZAMS. The time scale on which these large fields disappear varies strongly with mass, ranging from about 250 Myr for stars of 2 - 3 solar mass to 15 Myr for stars of 4 - 5 solar mass.

Short-circuit current (Isc) and flux of FITC-dextran 4000 (FD 4) were used to evaluate electrolyte secretion and paracellular permeability, respectively. Cholinergic modulation was investigated by the use of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) assay was performed on each level of the bowel at each age to describe acetylcholine catabolism. Results: An age effect was identified for most of the parameters studied, yet with different patterns depending on the location and the parameter considered. In the jejunum, FD 4 <b>flux</b> increased with <b>age</b> (+ 420 %, P< 0. 05) while Isc decreased sharply after birth (- 64 %, P< 0. 05). Cholinergic stimulation tended to reduce FD 4 flux (- 50 %, P= 0. 11) at birth with no further effect on jejunal permeability in older piglets. In contrast, carbachol-induced electrolyte secretion increased with age (+ 317 %, P< 0. 05). A similar pattern was observed in the ileum, although basal Isc decrease with age occurred later, between d 14 and d 28 (- 830 %, P< 0. 05). Conversely, in the colon although basal FD 4 flux and Isc post-natal evolution trend was similar than in the small intestine, the changes were more progressive and with less amplitude within the first month of life (difference between d 0 and d 28 : FD 4 flux + 162 %, P< 0. 05 and Isc - 70 %, P= 0. 08). Opposite to the small intestine, carbachol had no effect on colonic FD 4 <b>flux</b> at any <b>age</b> and induced electrolyte secretion at birth but not in older piglets. AChE activity decreased sharply (- 50 %, P< 0. 05) between birth and day 2 in the jejunum with no further changes with age and was stable with time in the ileum. In the colon, AChE activity was nearly 10 times higher and decreased progressively with age (- 22 % between d 0 and d 28, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that intestinal epithelial cell sensitivity to acetylcholine differs with post-natal age in piglet small and large intestine. It also emphasizes the need for more studies to understand how, where and when cholinergic system modulates the intestinal barrier...|$|R
40|$|Background: Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} {{occurs during}} aging in humans and mice and {{may contribute to}} the development of heart failure. Aging also impairs myocardial fatty acid oxidation, causing increased reliance on flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to maintain function. We hypothesize that the metabolic changes in aged hearts make them less tolerant to acutely increased work and that thyroid hormone supplementation reverses these defects. Methods: Studies were performed on young (Young, 4 – 6 months) and aged (Old, 22 – 24 months) C 57 /BL 6 mice at standard (50 mmHg) and high afterload (80 mmHg). Another aged group received thyroid hormone for 3 weeks (Old-TH, high afterload only). Function was measured in isolated working hearts along with substrate fractional contributions (Fc) to the citric acid cycle (CAC) using perfusate with 13 C labeled lactate, pyruvate, glucose and unlabeled palmitate and insulin. Results: Old mice maintained cardiac function under standard workload conditions, despite a marked decrease in unlabeled (presumably palmitate) Fc and relatively similar individual carbohydrate contributions. However, old mice exhibited reduced palmitate oxidation with diastolic dysfunction exemplified by lower-dP/dT. Thyroid hormone abrogated the functional and substrate <b>flux</b> abnormalities in <b>aged</b> mice. Conclusion: The aged heart shows diminished ability to increase cardiac work due to substrate limitations, primarily impaired fatty acid oxidation. The heart accommodates slightly by increasing efficiency through oxidation of carbohydrat...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} ultraviolet and visible wavelength images {{for the central}} regions of the interacting galaxies NGC 3395 and NGC 3396, using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The images show many isolated sources of ultraviolet emission produced by young star-forming regions (knots). The FWHM {{of most of the}} knots in both galaxies is 20 pc. Far-UV flux distributions for the complete sample of knots can be fitted with a power law with exponent = 1. 20 0. 35 for NGC 3395 and a power law with exponent = 0. 69 0. 21 for NGC 3396. Comparison with models from Leitherer et al. indicates that the ages of most of the knots are 80 Myr. Reddening of the knots ranges from E(BV) = 0. 0 to E(BV) = 0. 3 mag, indicating variable amounts of dust in these regions. Almost all the knots have masses less than 106 M. Many of the knots are probably bound and at least six knots are good proto–globular cluster candidates. There are no significant differences in the <b>fluxes,</b> sizes, and <b>ages</b> of the knots in the two galaxies. The average mass of the knots in NGC 3395 is an order of magnitude less than the average mass of the knots in NGC 3396. There is no obvious correlation between the age of a knot and its position the galaxy...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{decision}} support systems (CDSS) are developed primarily from knowledge gleaned from evidence-based research, guidelines, trusted resources and domain experts. While these resources generally represent {{information that is}} research proven, time-tested and consistent with current medical knowledge, they lack some qualities that would be desirable in a CDSS. For instance, the information is presented as generalized recommendations that are not specific to particular patients and may not consider certain subpopulations. In addition, the knowledge base that produces the guidelines may be outdated and may not reflect real-world practice. Ideally, resources for {{decision support}} should be timely, patient-specific, and represent current practice. Patient-oriented clinical decision support is particularly important {{in the practice of}} pediatrics because it addresses a population in constant <b>flux.</b> Every <b>age</b> represents a different set of physiological and developmental concerns and considerations, especially in medication dosing patterns. Patient clinical data warehouses (CDW) may be able to bridge the knowledge gap. CDWs contain the collective intelligence of various contributors (i. e. clinicians, administrators, etc.) where each data entry provides information regarding medical care for a patient in the real world. CDWs have the potential to provide information as current as the latest upload, be focused to specific subpopulations and reflect current clinical practice. In this paper, I study the potential of a well-known patient clinical data warehouse to provide information regarding pediatric levothyroxine dosing as a form of clinical decision support. I study the state of the stored data, the necessary data transformations and options for representing the data to effectively summarize and communicate the findings. (cont.) I also compare the resulting transformed data, representing actual practice within this population, against established dosing recommendations. Of the transformed records, 728 of the 854 (85. 2 %, [95 % confidence interval 82. 7 : 87. 6]) medication records contained doses that were under the published recommended range for levothyroxine. As demonstrated by these results, real world practice can diverge from established recommendations. Delivering this information on real-world peer practice medication dosing to clinicians in real-time offers the potential to provide a valuable supplement to established dosing guidelines, enhancing the general and sometimes static dosing recommendations. by Elisabeth Lee Scheufele.

40|$|Context: A small {{fraction}} of upper main sequence stars have strong, highly structured magnetic fields. The origin and evolution of these fields are not adequately understood. Aims: We are carrying out a survey of magnetic fields in Ap stars in open clusters {{in order to obtain}} the first sample of magnetic upper main sequence stars with precisely known ages. These data will constrain theories of field evolution in these stars. Methods: A survey of candidate open cluster magnetic Ap stars was carried out using the new ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the CFHT. This instrument provides an alternative to the FORS 1 spectropolarimeter used up to now for this survey. Results: We have obtained 44 measurements of the mean longitudinal fields of 23 B 6 -A 2 stars that have been identified as possible Ap stars and that are possible members of open clusters, with a median uncertainty of about 45 G. Of these stars, 10 have definite field detections. Nine stars of our sample are found not to be magnetic Ap stars. These observations significantly increase the information available about low-mass stars near the TAMS compared to our previous sample. Conclusions: We find that ESPaDOnS provides field measurements comparable to those that we have previously obtained with FORS 1, and that these data also contain a large amount of useful information not readily obtained from lower resolution spectropolarimetry. With the new data we are able to expand the available data on low-mass, relatively evolved Ap stars, and identify more robustly which observed stars are actually magnetic Ap stars and cluster members. Re-analysis of the enlarged data set of cluster Ap stars indicates that such stars with masses in the range of 2 - 5 {M_o. } show rms fields larger than about 1 kG only when they are near the ZAMS. The time scale on which these large fields disappear varies strongly with mass, ranging from about 250 Myr for stars of 2 - 3 {M_o. } to 15 Myr for stars of 4 - 5 {M_o. }. Our data are consistent either with emergent flux conservation for most (but not all) Ap stars, or with modest decline in <b>flux</b> with <b>age...</b>|$|R
