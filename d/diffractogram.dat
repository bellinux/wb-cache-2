25|$|Aperiodic tilings were {{considered}} as mathematical artefacts until 1984, when physicist Dan Shechtman announced {{the discovery of}} a phase of an aluminium-manganese alloy which produced a sharp <b>diffractogram</b> with an unambiguous fivefold symmetry – so {{it had to be a}} crystalline substance with icosahedral symmetry. In 1975 Robert Ammann had already extended the Penrose construction to a three-dimensional icosahedral equivalent. In such cases the term 'tiling' is taken to mean 'filling the space'. Photonic devices are currently built as aperiodical sequences of different layers, being thus aperiodic in one direction and periodic in the other two. Quasicrystal structures of Cd-Te appear to consist of atomic layers in which the atoms are arranged in a planar aperiodic pattern. Sometimes an energetical minimum or a maximum of entropy occur for such aperiodic structures. Steinhardt has shown that Gummelt's overlapping decagons allow the application of an extremal principle and thus provide the link between the mathematics of aperiodic tiling and the structure of quasicrystals. Faraday waves have been observed to form large patches of aperiodic patterns. The physics of this discovery has revived the interest in incommensurate structures and frequencies suggesting to link aperiodic tilings with interference phenomena.|$|E

Copper (most commonly used radiation source) is a poor match with iron containing materials due to induced fluorescence. Magnetite and maghemite are analysed in different configurations using copper or cobalt radiation. Results show the effects of fluorescence repressing measures and the superiority of <b>diffractograms</b> obtained with cobalt radiation. <b>Diffractograms</b> obtained with copper radiation make incontestable phase identification often impossible.

50|$|In this equation, G is the {{reciprocal}} lattice vector, q is {{the length of}} {{the reciprocal}} lattice vector, k is the momentum transfer vector, θ is half of the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of the radiation. Powder diffraction data are usually presented as a <b>diffractogram</b> in which the diffracted intensity, I, is shown as a function either of the scattering angle 2θ or {{as a function of the}} scattering vector length q. The latter variable has the advantage that the <b>diffractogram</b> no longer depends on the value of the wavelength λ. The advent of synchrotron sources has widened the choice of wavelength considerably. To facilitate comparability of data obtained with different wavelengths the use of q is therefore recommended and gaining acceptability.|$|E

50|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} {{is closely}} related to X-ray powder diffraction. In fact the single crystal version of the technique is less commonly used because currently available neutron sources require relatively large samples and large single crystals are hard or impossible to come by for most materials. Future developments, however, may well change this picture. Because the data is typically a 1D powder <b>diffractogram</b> they are usually processed using Rietveld refinement. In fact the latter found its origin in neutron diffraction (at Petten in the Netherlands) and was later extended for use in X-ray diffraction.|$|E

50|$|Exfoliated {{graphite}} nano-platelets (xGnP) are {{new types}} of nanoparticles made from graphite. These nanoparticles consist of small stacks of graphene that are 1 to 15 nanometers thick, with diameters ranging from sub-micrometre to 100 micrometres. The X-ray <b>diffractogram</b> of this material would resemble that of graphite, in that the 002 peak would still appear at ~26o 2 theta. However, the peak would appear considerably smaller and broader. These features indicate that the interplanar distance in exfoliated graphite {{is similar to that}} of the parent graphite, but the stack size (of graphene layers) is small. Since xGnP is composed of the same material as carbon nanotubes, it shares many of the electrochemical characteristics, although not the tensile strength. The platelet shape, however, offers xGnP edges that are easier to modify chemically for enhanced dispersion in polymers.|$|E

The advantage of TEM recording during in situ heating is that it provides shorter exposure times (approximately 1  s) relative to the slower scans required by SE in the STEM modes. This allows higher accuracy and more reliable analysis of the atomic structure via computed <b>diffractograms</b> (sample drift and scan artifacts can strongly affect STEM <b>diffractograms).</b> The column vacuum was maintained at 4.8 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  Pa even during in situ heating.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{extends the}} work {{presented}} in a previous publication (Hansford, 2011 [1], subsequently referred to as Paper 1) to optimise {{the performance of a}} simple reflection-mode X-ray diffraction instrument with respect to the geometrical configuration. Both papers focus on the maximisation or minimisation of quantifiable characteristics of the X-ray beam incident on the sample in order to optimise the peak heights and widths in the resulting <b>diffractogram.</b> The reason for this approach is mathematical tractability, and its success relies on the relationship between the incident beam characteristics and the <b>diffractogram</b> properties. Part of Paper 1 was devoted to the minimisation of the equatorial divergence angle of the X-ray beam, while keeping the total X-ray flux constant, in order to minimise the <b>diffractogram</b> peak widths. While equatorial divergence and peak widths are certainly linked, their relationship is complex and depends quite significantly on other geometric parameters. An alternative optimisation approach is taken in this paper, focusing on the maximisation of the X-ray flux and minimisation of the incident beam axial divergence, while equatorial divergence is kept constant to ensure at least reasonable resolution. The rationale for this approach is that the incident beam flux and the axial divergence angle are more directly linked to <b>diffractogram</b> peak heights and peak asymmetry, respectively. Families of candidate geometric solutions result from this approach which is regarded as advantageous because there is no unique optimised solution and it allows the parameter space to be fully explored...|$|E

The X-ray <b>diffractogram</b> analysis of every soil profile indicates that the <b>diffractogram</b> peaks: 3. 2; 3. 4; 3. 56; 9. 9; 12. 4; 14. 5; 15. 4; 16. 8; and 17. 7 Ao are identified as montmorilonite clay mineral, and the <b>diffractogram</b> peaks 7. 2 and 10. 1 Ao are haloisite. Meanwhile, the diffrctogram peaks 3. 58, 3. 59, and 7. 15 Ao are identified as kaolinite. Each soil profile with its <b>diffractogram</b> peak signifies that all profiles have clay mineral montmorilonite, haloisite, and kaolite, except soil profile P 1 only bears montmorilonite, and haloisite. Therefore, it could be said that P 1 has been through longer decomposition process than P 2, P 3, and P 4 have, although it never leads to a soil development rate. The overall results of both sand fraction minerals and clay minerals signify that the soil development rate of each profile slopes down.
