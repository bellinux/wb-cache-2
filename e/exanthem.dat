25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the exanthema covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The <b>exanthem</b> became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were going to survive {{developed}} a black <b>exanthem.</b> According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E
25|$|Because watery nasal {{discharge}} containing live virus usually precedes both <b>exanthem</b> (external rash) and enanthem (oral ulcers) by 1 to 2 days, {{the infected}} person actually becomes contagious {{one to two}} days before recognition of the disease. Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts (scabs), which usually entails four or five days, by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases.|$|E
25|$|Rubella has {{symptoms}} {{that are similar}} to those of flu. However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (<b>exanthem)</b> on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis.|$|E
40|$|Parvovirus B 19 (B 19 V) {{infection}} may differently {{manifest in}} various age groups. Erythema infectiosum ('fifth disease') {{is the most}} common B 19 V manifestations in children. Arthralgias and arthritis, with or without rash, are common manifestations of B 19 V infection in adults. Pruritus is usually present in adults and children. However, other cutaneous manifestations and atypical <b>exanthems</b> have been occasionally reported during B 19 V infection. To investigate the putative role of B 19 V infection in atypical <b>exanthems,</b> a total of 390 consecutive patients with atypical <b>exanthems</b> were analysed for B 19 V infection by determining B 19 V IgG and IgM antibodies titres in acute and convalescent phase as well as B 19 V DNA detection in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Atypical <b>exanthems</b> resulted related to B 19 V infection in 6 of the 120 pediatric (5 %) and 14 of the 270 adult patients (5. 2 %). In conclusion this study reveals that atypical <b>exanthems</b> related to B 19 V infection are possible both in children and in adults, with a similar prevalence...|$|R

25|$|At the blister stage, intense itching {{is usually}} present. Blisters may also {{occur on the}} palms, soles, and genital area. Commonly, visible {{evidence}} of the disease develops in the oral cavity and tonsil areas {{in the form of}} small ulcers which can be painful or itchy or both; this enanthem (internal rash) can precede the <b>exanthem</b> (external rash) by 1 to 3 days or can be concurrent. These symptoms of chickenpox appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person. Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever, and {{they are more likely to}} experience complications, such as varicella pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|The early (prodromal) {{symptoms}} in adolescents and adults are nausea, loss of appetite, aching muscles, and headache. This {{is followed by}} the characteristic rash or oral sores, malaise, and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease. Oral manifestations of the disease (enanthem) not uncommonly may precede the external rash (<b>exanthem).</b> In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms, and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity. The rash begins as small red dots on the face, scalp, torso, upper arms and legs; progressing over 10–12 hours to small bumps, blisters and pustules; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs.|$|E

5000|$|Cutaneous manifestations {{specifically}} rashes, are {{not uncommon}} in WNV-infected patients; however, there is a paucity of detailed descriptions in case reports and there are few clinical images widely available. Punctate erythematous, macular, and papular eruptions, most pronounced on the extremities have been observed in WNV cases {{and in some cases}} histopathologic findings have shown a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, a manifestation commonly seen in viral <b>exanthems.</b> A literature review provides support that this punctate rash is a common cutaneous presentation of WNV infection.|$|R
40|$|Maculopapular (exanthematous) {{reactions}} {{are the most}} common adverse drug eruptions affecting the skin. Several studies indicate that immunological mechanisms including cytotoxic T cells (CD 4 + > CD 8 +), both type 1 (e. g. IFN- γ) and type 2 (e. g. IL- 5) cytokines and various chemokines are critically involved in the pathogenesis of these eruptions. While maculopapular <b>exanthems</b> can virtually be elicited by any drug, antimicrobials (e. g. Β -lactam antibiotic, sulfonamides), anticonvulsants, allopurinol, and NSAIDs are most frequently involved. Clinical manifestations are variable and range from faint macules to widespread erythematous and maculopapular lesions, which usually begin on the trunk, neck and upper extremities and subsequently spread downwards in a symmetrical fashion. Although the clinical course is often relatively mild, these <b>exanthems</b> may sometimes progress to erythroderma or represent the beginning of even more severe drug reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. In most cases, management includes early withdrawal of the offending drug and usually supportive treatment with emollients, topical corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines depending on the severity of the eruption. Allergological work-up is recommended to provide the patient with appropriate information about the causative drug and possible alternatives for future use...|$|R
