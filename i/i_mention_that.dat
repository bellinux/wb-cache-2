25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, yet my {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E
6000|$|... "My granddaughter {{will marry}} Lord Harbinger. <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that,</b> Mr. Courtier, for your peace of mind. You are {{a man of}} honour; it will go no further." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 301 I hope I am not betraying {{a cabinet}} secret if <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> this [...] {{committee}} {{was composed of}} Mr. Gladstone, Lord Spencer, Lord [...] Herschell, Mr. Campbell-Bannermann, Mr. Bryce, and myself.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was on my}} way to Branscombe, and inquired the distance.|$|R
60|$|I {{found my}} lady {{in her own}} sitting room. She started and looked annoyed when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Sergeant Cuff wished to speak to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} about all that," [...] he replied. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Mary was a {{practical}} girl. Possibly she had thought of these details." ...|$|R
60|$|Did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> he {{had always}} one eye wide open, and one eye nearly shut; and that the one eye nearly shut was always the {{expressive}} eye? I don't think I did.|$|E
60|$|Did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> the Pepperleigh family, generations ago, {{had taken}} up land near the Aroostook, {{and that it was}} from there the judge's father came to Tecumseh township? Perhaps not, but it doesn't matter.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> we had dinner, {{not because}} I {{think that the}} {{information}} will prove exciting to the reader, but because I wish to warn my countrymen, travelling in Germany, against undue indulgence in Liptauer cheese.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked down}} at me from under his {{beautiful}} eyelashes (have <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a little woman?), and he asked in his persuasive tones: [...] "Must we say good-by?" ...|$|R
60|$|Merriman. Yes, Miss. He {{seemed very}} much disappointed. <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> you and Miss Prism {{were in the}} garden. He said he was anxious {{to speak to you}} privately for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|Robert {{answered}} very unwillingly. [...] "I {{took the}} liberty of reminding her ladyship that she had left her letter unsealed," [...] he said. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> as my excuse for speaking,"--he stopped, and corrected himself--"I believe <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> a valuable inclosure was in the letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} the {{interest}} in the matter will be diminished, colonel, when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> the charge was executed at night, and that I was ignorant of {{the vicinity of the}} French until I rode into the middle of them." ...|$|E
60|$|When I am totally prostrated (did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> I {{was totally}} prostrated by Marian's letter?) it always takes me {{three days to}} get up again. I was very unreasonable--I {{expected}} three days of quiet. Of course I didn't get them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a pity you didn't say so, in good time, is it not?' {{retorted}} Carker, coolly. 'However, I think it's {{all for the}} best. I really, think it's all for the best. Did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} something like a little confidence between Miss Dombey and myself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are. Now {{and then}} you are also a little crude, which is {{probably}} what you mean. Still, that's not the question. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should sooner you didn't come to supper this evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} full value for your goods," [...] Scopus {{said when they}} left the shop--"that was why <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> you had entered Nero's household, for it is a great thing to have a friend at court." ...|$|R
6000|$|Waynefleet {{rose and}} turned to the girl. [...] "I'll put on my rubber overshoes," [...] he announced. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might have to go out, it's a pity you didn't think of laying out my coat to warm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{speak of}} eager native traders {{following}} us for miles for the [...] smallest piece of cloth. <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> after travelling many miles to [...] obtain cloth for ivory and redwood powder, the despairing natives [...] asked: 'Well, {{what is it}} you do want? Tell us, and we will get it for [...] you.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not here}} to expound my philosophy," [...] replied the other, [...] "but to {{distribute}} these cream tarts. If <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> I heartily include myself in the ridicule of the transaction, I hope you will consider honour satisfied and condescend. If not, you will constrain me to eat my twenty-eighth, and I own to being weary of the exercise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{take into}} consideration, Mr. Cleveland, the present {{aspect of the}} {{political}} world, when we call to mind the present situation of the two great political parties, {{you will not be}} surprised, I feel confident, when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> certain personages have thought that the season was at hand when a move might be made in the political world with very considerable effect--" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{were given}} 100 Windows-based {{computers}} by Taiwan. The education sector uses predominantly Apple Macintosh computers, so <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> we may also need software. Taiwan immediately delivered 100 brand new copies of Windows XP, {{and offered to}} train our computer technicians." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} little soldier quietly, [...] "it is a {{confirmation}} of several things I {{have heard of}} lately. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> the bush was not a desirable place for you to wander in. Still, you are probably going back there again?" ...|$|R
60|$|After I {{had drunk}} {{half a dozen}} glasses, my policy of temperateness in mind, I decided that I had had enough for <b>that</b> time. So <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going aboard the Razzle Dazzle, then lying at the city wharf, a hundred yards away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hum!' said I. 'Not {{that her}} {{happiness}} was of long duration,' pursued Traddles, 'for, unfortunately, {{within a week}} another execution came in. It broke up the establishment. I {{have been living in}} a furnished apartment since then, and the Mortimers have been very private indeed. I hope you won't think it selfish, Copperfield, if <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> the broker carried off my little round table with the marble top, and Sophy's flower-pot and stand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It rather puzzled {{me at the}} time,' said Mr Boffin, 'and {{it rather}} puzzled me and Mrs Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards, because (not to make a mystery of our belief) we have always {{believed}} a Secretary to {{be a piece of}} furniture, mostly of mahogany, lined with green baize or leather, with a lot of little drawers in it. Now, you won't think I take a liberty when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> you certainly ain't THAT.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Dear Sir,--It is {{some time}} since the {{undersigned}} had the [...] honour of conversing with you, but I am respectfully trusting [...] that you may recall me to mind when <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> until [...] recently I served Mr. Brewster, your father-in-law, in the [...] capacity of valet. Owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding, [...] I was dismissed from that position and am now temporarily out [...] of a job. [...] "How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of [...] the morning!" [...] (Isaiah xiv. 12.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Waters; [...] "she didn't do that." [...] Colville {{imagined a}} consciousness in him, which perhaps did not exist. [...] "She didn't allude {{to the subject}} further than to state the fact, when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was coming to see you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Anaimangalam {{copperplate}} of Kulothunga Chola <b>I</b> <b>mentions</b> <b>that</b> Kasiba Thera (Buddhist Monk) renovated {{the shrine}} in 6th century AD {{with the help}} of monks of [...] "Naganadu" [...] (Nagapattinam). The Pallava King Rajasimha (690 - 728) permitted a Chinese king to build Buddha vihara in Nagappattinam.|$|R
60|$|When I {{closed my}} {{letter of the}} 12th, <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> Sir Robert Napier had written to Theodore, urging him most {{strongly}} to surrender, as he had no possibility of a successful resistance; {{and the destruction of}} life, if we were to open fire upon Magdala, would be terrible.|$|R
6000|$|Marian smiled. [...] "Perhaps {{it would}} have been unreasonable, but taking it for granted that he hasn't been communicative, I've a piece of news for you. Some Canadian {{tourists}} stayed a night at the Ghyll, two or three months ago, and it seems they met him in British Columbia. I understand he is by no means prosperous, but at least getting a footing in the country, and the people apparently have rather a high opinion of him. Did <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> one of the party was a girl?" ...|$|E
60|$|While in our {{external}} relations some serious inconveniences and embarrassments have been overcome and others lessened, {{it is with}} much pain and deep regret <b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> circumstances of a very unwelcome nature have lately occurred. Our trade has suffered and is suffering extensive injuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of the French Republic, and communications have been received from its minister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its authority, and which are in other respects far from agreeable.|$|E
6000|$|I also {{mentioned}} to your sister--I again address the non-professional Miss Dorrit--that my son would {{have nothing in}} the event of such a marriage, and would be an absolute beggar. (<b>I</b> <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> merely as a fact {{which is part of the}} narrative, and not as supposing it to have influenced your sister, except in the prudent and legitimate way in which, constituted as our artificial system is, we must all be influenced by such considerations.) Finally, after some high words and high spirit on the part of your sister, we came to the complete understanding that there was no danger; and your sister was so obliging as to allow me to present her with a mark or two of my appreciation at my dressmaker's.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Charters people!" [...] he declared. [...] "When I was in Victoria I had a {{talk with}} them. I partly {{expected}} something of the kind. By the way, I got a notification from the rancher <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>I</b> continued operations, proceedings would be begun against me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> should <b>mention</b> <b>that</b> {{he wore a}} dainty white cravat, and dainty linen altogether.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be sure, of course,' exclaimed Mrs. Swancourt; {{and looking}} up from her own letter. 'Christopher, I quite forgot to tell you, when <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had seen my distant relative, Harry Knight, that I invited him here for {{whatever}} length of time he could spare. And now {{he says he can}} come any day in August.' ...|$|R
