5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> to leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

Thunder was also allowed to run in the end zone after a touchdown, but because MetLife Stadium was {{considered}} a neutral zone for both teams, he was not allowed to run the length of the field.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, backup {{receiver}} and redshirt freshman Jamere Holland was dismissed from the team, although not for any violation of team rules. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> to stay on scholarship for the year.

He would later transfer to the University of Oregon.|$|E

Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> to work as law agent in the lower courts, and – being well-known and popular – set up a successful law practice.

Although the Kentucky Constitution imposed an age requirement of twenty-four for members of the House of Representatives, Johnson was so popular that no one raised questions about his age, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> to take his seat. He was placed on the Committee on Courts of Justice. During his tenure, he supported legislation to protect settlers from land speculators. On January 26, 1807, he delivered an address condemning the Burr conspiracy.|$|E

Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.|$|E
5|$|These policy failures, and the {{stalemate}} that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become {{highly critical of}} Karmal's leadership. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to Moscow. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> to return to Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from liver cancer.|$|E

The novel was one of three that Andrić wrote over the next several years. All three were published in short succession in 1945, following Belgrade's liberation from the Nazis. The Bridge on the Drina was published in March of that year to widespread acclaim.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Miller was {{selected}} for the New Zealand tour, under the captaincy of Queensland's Bill Brown. Miller started the tour well, top-scoring with 139 against Auckland. Along with seven other debutants, Miller made his test debut in the match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, a match that was retrospectively accorded Test status in 1948. On a sticky wicket, New Zealand won the toss and batted. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings as O'Reilly and Ernie Toshack skittled the home side for just 42. Australia made 8/199 with Miller scoring 30. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> to take the new ball in the second innings, taking 2/6 in six overs before a flare-up of his back injury forced him to be removed from the attack. Australia bowled their hosts out for 54, securing an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a {{deep-lying}} playmaker role by his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This position best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> more time on the ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
