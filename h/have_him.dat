5|$|Ochs's friends {{tried to}} help him. His brother Michael {{attempted}} to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> committed to a psychiatric hospital. Friends pleaded with him to get help voluntarily.

60|$|Hardly {{anyone was}} at work that day--no doubt the {{builders}} were <b>having</b> <b>him</b> in some obscure manner--and the whole place seemed a dismal and depressing litter. The builder's shed, black-lettered WILKINS, BUILDER, HYTHE, looked like a stranded thing amidst a cast-up disorder of wheelbarrows and wheeling planks, and earth and sand and bricks. The foundations of the walls were trenches full of damp concrete, drying in patches; the rooms--it was incredible they could ever be rooms--were shaped out as squares and oblongs of coarse, wet grass and sorrel. They looked absurdly small--dishonestly small. What could you expect? Of course the builders were <b>having</b> <b>him,</b> building too small, building all wrong, using bad materials! Old Kipps <b>had</b> told <b>him</b> a wrinkle or two. The builders were <b>having</b> <b>him,</b> young Walshingham was <b>having</b> <b>him,</b> everybody was <b>having</b> <b>him!</b> They were <b>having</b> <b>him</b> and laughing at him because they didn't respect him. They didn't respect him because he couldn't do things right. Who could respect him?...|$|R

5|$|Returning home, Catherine packs a {{suitcase}} for Black, {{telling him that}} she cannot <b>have</b> <b>him</b> in their home for the time being, believing that he sacrificed a part of himself in killing her attacker. She hopes that time apart might help him recover what he is missing inside; he takes the case and drives off.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Hitler was {{eligible}} for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> deported back to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his {{service in the}} German Army made his Austrian citizenship void. In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there is}} no {{physical}} evidence to prove that Rappo killed Callahan's wife and son, the case remains unsolved. Mulder's narration states that Rappo's family tries to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> buried at Arlington National Cemetery; he is instead buried in a civilian cemetery in Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|With {{the crisis}} unresolved, Kerr decided to dismiss Whitlam as prime minister. Fearing that Whitlam {{would go to}} the Queen and {{potentially}} <b>have</b> <b>him</b> removed, the Governor-General gave Whitlam no prior hint. He conferred (against Whitlam's advice) with High Court Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, who agreed that he had the power to dismiss Whitlam.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E

6000|$|She {{raised her}} hand in quick impatience: the {{suggestion}} might have been almost abject. [...] "It isn't a question of recovery. It won't be a question of any vulgar struggle.

[...] "What I take her to be waking up to is the truth that, all the while, she really HASN'T <b>had</b> <b>him.</b> Never." ...|$|R
5|$|Although it was {{cut short}} by Roosevelt's desire to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> testify before Congress on Lend-Lease, Willkie's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph. Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; {{because of the risk}} of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|Another {{one of the}} men {{gave the}} {{surprising}} testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> shot after he refused to answer some questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the infantry, during basic {{training}} at Camp Wolters, Texas, Murphy earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Clasp and the Expert Badge with Bayonet Clasp. While {{participating in a}} close-order drill during that hot Texas summer, he passed out. His company commander thought his build was too slight for service in the infantry, and tried to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> transferred to a cook and bakers' school, but Murphy insisted on becoming a combat soldier. He completed the 13-week {{basic training}} course and in October was given leave to visit his family, after which {{he was sent to}} Fort George G. Meade in Maryland for advanced infantry training until January 1943.|$|E
50|$|However, {{ultimately}} Balj ibn Bishr <b>had</b> <b>him</b> {{arrested in}} Cordova for former grievances, {{put him to}} a horrible death in 742, and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> crucified {{on the outskirts of}} the city flanked by a similarly killed pig and dog on either side.|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} I <b>had</b> <b>him</b> beaten, {{although}} I {{was afraid of}} his short thumps as he headed away and tugged. Finally I <b>had</b> <b>him</b> within twenty feet circling around me, tired and loggy, yet still strong enough to require careful handling.|$|R

5|$|Besides sermons Wulfstan {{was also}} {{instrumental}} in drafting law codes for both kings Æthelred the Unready and Cnut the Great of England. He {{is considered one}} of the two major writers of the late Anglo-Saxon period in England. After his death in 1023, miracles were said to have occurred at his tomb, but attempts to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> declared a saint never bore fruit.|$|E
5|$|C. J. gets emotionally {{involved}} in {{a story about the}} deadly assault on a homosexual youth. She sees {{this as an opportunity to}} push hate crime legislation, but the suggestion finds little support among the others. Reporter Danny Concannon also disagrees, but this encourages her to finally accept his offer of a date, to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> convince her.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was a miracle, and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E

60|$|He sat in silence. He {{was full}} of a feeling that she <b>had</b> deceived <b>him.</b> She <b>had</b> despised <b>him</b> when he thought she worshipped <b>him.</b> She <b>had</b> let <b>him</b> say wrong things, and <b>had</b> not contradicted <b>him.</b> She <b>had</b> let <b>him</b> fight alone. But it stuck in his throat that she <b>had</b> despised <b>him</b> whilst he thought she worshipped <b>him.</b> She should <b>have</b> told <b>him</b> when she found fault with <b>him.</b> She <b>had</b> not played fair. He hated her. All these years she <b>had</b> treated <b>him</b> {{as if he were}} a hero, and thought of him {{secretly}} as an infant, a foolish child. Then why had she left the foolish child to his folly? His heart was hard against her.|$|R

5|$|Duke of Marmalade did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the soft ground.

5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some of his fellow senators tried to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
50|$|In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Norrington has {{a smaller}} role despite setting the film's plot in motion.
