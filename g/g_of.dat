5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> desert locust provides 11.5 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol.

5|$|In summary, {{the desired}} line L1 {{is defined by}} two points: the radical center <b>G</b> <b>of</b> the three given circles and the pole in C1 {{of one of the}} four lines {{connecting}} the homothetic centers.

Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line L'k does not intersect its circle C'k for some k, there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named dicoumarol. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.|$|E

25|$|After {{several days}} of fasting, all cells in the body begin to break down protein.

However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2–3 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> glucose; about 20–30 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> protein is broken down each day to make 10 <b>g</b> <b>of</b> glucose to keep the brain alive.
