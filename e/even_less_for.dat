500|$|Diamond {{has a wide}} bandgap of [...] {{corresponding}} to the deep ultraviolet wavelength of 225 nanometers. This means that pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong, and only atoms of nitrogen, boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Transition metals nickel and cobalt, which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high-pressure high-temperature techniques, have been detected in diamond as individual atoms; the maximum concentration is 0.01% for nickel and <b>even</b> <b>less</b> <b>for</b> cobalt. Virtually any element can be introduced to diamond by ion implantation.|$|E

Her two-hour set was a {{brilliant}} pop extravaganza that kept the songs at its center." [...] He further noted that Knowles didn't need distractions from her singing, [...] "which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with [...] staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a very positive review for the concert and noted that Knowles performed [...] "two fast-paced hours of terrific singing, solid musicianship, spectacular staging {{and some of the}} most imaginative choreography ever to have graced the stage of Oracle Arena." [...] Hildebrand further noted that Knowles used [...] "occasional bits of rasp to her ringing mezzo tones to emphasize key lines" [...] while performing the ballads. He wrote that every [...] "twitch, turn, slide and hip shake was in perfect sync" [...] and praised the singer's constant motion most of the time which never left her [...] "out of breath". While reviewing Knowles' concert in Bangkok, Thailand, Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised her dancing which included [...] "shaking, bouncing and belly dancing, mixed with hip-hop" [...] further comparing it with Shakira's. She further noted that the highlight of the show was when Knowles sang the slow-tempo ballads. The Courier Mails Tonya Turner praised Knowles' [...] "passionate and fiery" [...] performance accompanied by [...] "frantic booty popping and sexy R moves". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers noted that the tour was one of the [...] "modern superstar spectacles that casts the artist's reality onto the level of myth". However, she noted, that [...] "Beyoncé's 'Experience' plays off the performer's well-known struggles and triumphs to build a story that will make fans both gawk and relate. The maddening thing about this dazzling entertainment, though, is that the tale it tells is partly the wrong one." [...] She concluded the review by saying, [...] "Beyoncé is electric in concert yet reined in by her show's post-feminist theme. Why not just let it be about her musical prowess?". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News praised Knowles' energy and powerful performance on stage, writing [...] "With her triumphant gait, statuesque figure and steely stare, the singer seemed primed not just to perform but to vanquish... Beyoncé sang with a fiery determination, stressing cries and shouts that had no use for subtlety and <b>even</b> <b>less</b> <b>for</b> vulnerability. She danced at an equally mad clip... hitting every mark with a vengeance... A Beyoncé show... {{has everything to do with}} power and nothing to do with nuance. It's the kind of thing meant to inspire awe, not intimacy... She sang her songs last night with the force of a rapper, stressing pieces from her two solo albums in a way that made every sound seem percussive." [...] However, Farber criticized the unsure repertoire of songs performed, writing [...] "Many of her tunes prove too skittish to sink in, and some of her rhythms are too robotic to find a groove." [...] Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter noted that the snippets of other artists that Knowles included in her own songs were refreshing and included the fast-paced Destiny's Child medley and the performances of [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights of the show.
