5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the restructuring, in 2006 the LCR consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup, Bechtel, Halcrow and Systra (which form Rail Link Engineering (RLE)); transport operators National Express and SNCF (which operates the Eurostar (UK) share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways); electricity company EDF; and UBS Investment Bank. On completion of section 1 by RLE, the line was handed over to Union Railways (South), which then handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> London & Continental Stations and Property (LCSP), the long-term owners of the line. Once section 2 of the line had been completed it was handed over to Union Railways (North), which handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> LCSP. The entire line, including St Pancras, is managed, operated and maintained by Network Rail (CTRL).|$|E

In 2002 the company claimed that an American woman {{underwent}} a standard cloning procedure {{that led to}} the birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). Although few believe the claim, it nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status.|$|E

Nations then enter the stadium alphabetical or continental wise with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Speeches are given, formally opening the Games. Finally, the Queen's Baton is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final baton carrier, often a successful Commonwealth athlete from the host nation, who hands <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Head of the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S.

During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed their beliefs. The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E

5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, the Malinska {{class were}} {{classified}} as minelayers. At {{the start of the}} German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, the five Malinska-class ships were assigned to the Coast Defence Command and spread over three sectors; Malinska in Selce (North Sector), Mosor and Marjan in Šibenik (Central Sector), and Mljet and Meljine in Kotor (South Sector). All five were soon captured by Italian forces, including Malinska which had been scuttled by its crew, but was raised by the Italians and commissioned as Arbe, along with Ugliano (ex-Marjan), Solta (ex-Meljine), Meleda (ex-Mljet) and Pasman (ex-Mosor). In Italian service they were known as the Arbe class, and could carry 30 mines. Following the Italian Armistice, Ugliano was taken over by German forces and probably lost in their hands. Pasman was also captured by the Germans, who handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia. This ship was stranded on the Island of Ist on 31 December 1944, but was not scrapped until 1954.|$|E

5|$|Howden's {{account of}} events reveals that Haraldr {{and his family}} gained control of Moray early in 1196, and charter {{evidence}} suggests that William and royal forces were in the north that summer. Although the Chronicle of Melrose appears to indicate that Hvarflǫð and Haraldr's eldest son was defeated in 1197, {{it is possible that}} this event dates to 1196 instead and relates to William's aforesaid northern campaign. Fordun's account records that William successfully asserted royal power in the northern regions; and Howden's account species that the king stripped Haraldr of his lordship in Caithness, and handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Haraldr Eiríksson, a claimant to the Orcadian earldom. At some point after this, Howden's account reveals that Haraldr overcame and killed Haraldr Eiríksson, and the Icelandic Annals specifically date the latter's fall to 1198.|$|E
5|$|In 1561, he {{finished}} his Historia General de las Indias and signed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the College of San Gregorio, stipulating {{that it could not}} be published until after forty years. In fact it was not published for 314 years, finally being done so in 1875. He also had to repeatedly defend himself against accusations of treason: someone, possibly Sepúlveda, denounced him to the Spanish Inquisition, but nothing came from the case. Las Casas also appeared as a witness {{in the case of the}} Inquisition against his friend Archbishop Bartolomé Carranza de Miranda, who had been falsely accused of heresy. In 1565 he wrote his last will, signing over his immense library to the college. Bartolomé de Las Casas died on July 18, 1566, in Madrid.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 {{the poet}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge rented the cottage. While he lived there he wrote {{many of his}} better known works. He was visited by William Wordsworth and other early members of the Romantic movement. Coleridge moved out in 1799 and the {{building}} was refurbished. Almost 100 years after his occupation some of his admirers leased the property and eventually bought it, after a national campaign and significant private funding. In 1909 they handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries further renovation and expansion was undertaken, since when it has won awards as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was {{in danger}} of being torn down to {{construct}} apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of turning <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the plan to move the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his contribution to the battles at Saratoga, General Arnold had his seniority restored (he had lost it after being passed over for promotion earlier in 1777). His leg wound left Arnold bedridden for five months. Later, while still unfit for field service but serving as military governor of Philadelphia, Arnold entered into treasonous correspondence with the British. He received command of the fort at West Point and plotted to hand <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the British, only to flee into the British lines when the capture of his contact John Andre led to the exposure of the plot. Arnold went on to serve under William Phillips, the commander of Burgoyne's right wing, in a 1781 expedition into Virginia.|$|E
