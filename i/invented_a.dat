5|$|Gerard Kitchen O'Neill (February 6, 1927 – April 27, 1992) was an American {{physicist}} and space activist. As {{a faculty member}} of Princeton University, he <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> device called the particle storage ring for high-energy physics experiments. Later, he <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> magnetic launcher called the mass driver. In the 1970s, he developed a plan to build human settlements in outer space, including a space habitat design known as the O'Neill cylinder. He founded the Space Studies Institute, an organization devoted to funding research into space manufacturing and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Grundy's Foundry {{was another}} {{important}} employer. Its founder, John Grundy <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> warm {{air heating system}} {{that was used in}} churches and halls. He built a foundry close to the railway in Lower Elliot Street.|$|E
5|$|Later famous horologists {{included}} John Arnold {{who made}} the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, Thomas Earnshaw {{who was the first}} to make these available to the public, Daniel Quare, who <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.|$|E

5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows {{of the blast}} furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the bellows.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer and {{his machine}} became {{well known in}} Philadelphia in 1812. Redheffer claimed he had <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{perpetual}} motion machine and exhibited it in a house near the Schuylkill River in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He charged an admission fee of $5 (some sources claim $1) for men to view it; depending on the source, women were admitted free or at a charge of $1. The machine caused a sensation, and Redheffer lobbied for funds to build a larger version.|$|E
5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to have <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{was officially}} {{invested}} as Prince of Wales {{in a special}} ceremony at Caernarfon Castle on 13 July 1911. The investiture took place in Wales, at the instigation of the Welsh politician David Lloyd George, Constable of the Castle and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Liberal government. Lloyd George <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> rather fanciful ceremony {{in the style of}} a Welsh pageant, and coached Edward to speak a few words in Welsh.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{was also}} an {{innovator}} {{in the realm of}} craftsmanship, conceiving new technical and decorative solutions with his materials, for example his way of designing ceramic mosaics made of waste pieces ("trencadís") in original and imaginative combinations. For the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral he <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> new technique to produce stained glass, which consisted of juxtaposing three glass panes of primary colours, and sometimes a neutral one, varying the thickness of the glass in order to graduate the light's intensity.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake of Pennsylvania <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{drilling}} process to extract oil {{from deep within}} the earth. Drake's invention is credited with giving birth to the oil industry in the U.S. The first oil refiner in the United States opened in 1861 in Western Pennsylvania, during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, James Ritty, a saloon owner, <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{mechanical}} cash register, paving way for {{its production}} through the National Cash Register Company, based in Dayton. The company prospered through the 21st century, producing automated teller machines, barcode scanners, {{and other related}} products, employing thousands. It was eventually relocated to Georgia in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the French {{microbiologist}} Charles Chamberland <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> filter, {{known today}} as the Chamberland filter or Chamberland–Pasteur filter, that has pores smaller than bacteria. Thus he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution. In the early 1890s the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study {{what became known as}} the tobacco mosaic virus. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.|$|E
5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> {{form of the}} {{crucible}} steel process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Roy McBride, {{a farmer}} from Alpine, Texas, <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> collar {{filled with the}} poison {{compound}} 1080 to protect his livestock from coyotes, which tended to attack the throat. This device {{is known as the}} livestock protection collar and is in widespread use in Texas, as well as in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|New {{methods of}} {{producing}} it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, {{new methods of}} producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.|$|E

5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's first {{employment}} {{following the}} war was in October 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent of the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad. In 1866 {{he was promoted to}} president, a position he retained until 1870, when he was ousted in a hostile takeover. This job overlapped with that of president of the New Orleans and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison <b>invented</b> <b>a</b> method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E
