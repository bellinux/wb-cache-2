5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from <b>health</b> <b>authority).</b> Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1996, the <b>Health</b> <b>Authority</b> {{decided to}} close Mardon and to {{transfer}} the long-term general nursing care of the applicant to the local authority. The <b>Health</b> <b>Authority</b> reasoned that the continued provision of the care service to the current residents in Mardon had become costly, was not financially viable, and resulted in fewer resources for other services. Although the <b>Health</b> <b>Authority</b> undertook to fund the applicant's care {{for the remainder of}} her life, they did not offer to provide her with a home for life as promised.|$|E

25|$|Justice Hidden, {{hearing the}} matter in the High Court, entered {{judgment}} for Coughlan. He held that the representations made by the <b>Health</b> <b>Authority</b> towards Coughlan and the other patients amounted to an explicit promise that Mardon House would be their home for life. The promise made was a promise to provide care at Mardon House, rather than at various unspecified locations as contended by the <b>Health</b> <b>Authority.</b> To resile from such a promise would amount to unfairness. However, in the case where an overriding public interest demanded, the <b>Health</b> <b>Authority</b> would be justified to break its promise. On {{the facts of the}} case, the <b>Health</b> <b>Authority</b> could not produce proof that there were compelling circumstances amounting to an overriding public interest to justify a departure from the promise made.|$|E
