40|$|AbstractIn city logistics, <b>courier</b> {{express and}} <b>parcel</b> <b>services</b> (CEP) deal with last mile {{deliveries}} {{in an urban}} environment. CEP route vehicles to deliver parcels to costumers distributed in the cities area. Customers expect fast and reliable services to reasonable prices. As a result, CEP have to plan and execute their routing efficiently. In a city logistic environment, CEP faces several challenges. Especially, travel times between customers are not deterministic but uncertain and differ during the day regarding traffic volumes and stochastic events like congestion. Further, city traffic flows are controlled by traffic control management (TM). TM decisions additionally impact travel times for CEP. This paper shows the impact of TM decisions to travel times and emphasizes the benefit of cooperational planning between CEP and TM...|$|R
40|$|With the {{requirements}} of European Commission’s White Book that demand emission-free city logistics in major urban areas until 2050, cargo bicycles may {{play a significant role}} for last mile deliveries. They require less space than vans and can be parked on the sidewalk. These electrically assisted bicycles, tricycles or quadracycles do not emit any local emissions and are capable to transport 50 - 250 kg of cargo. But, in topologically moved areas the capacity of conventional battery concepts constrains the transport range: delivery tours by bike can have a daily mileage up to 50 - 80 km. In the urge of finding energy carriers with a higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries hydrogen comes into the focus for innovative and sustainable cargo bike propulsion systems. This paper outlines the DLR activities to develop a versatile hydrogen fuel cell and its thermal management which suits the transport needs of commercial last mile deliveries with cargo bikes. First studies show that cargo cycles have high potentials not only in postal services but also for the growing <b>courier</b> and <b>parcel</b> <b>service.</b> Active thermal management systems to increase the range and the hill climb capability, the life time and the operational capability like shortening the refilling time are introduced in this paper...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith {{the advent}} of the Internet in private {{households}} and in almost every company in the last two decades, many things have changed. One of the major changes concerns the rapid growth of the e-commerce utilization, which brings changes to the transportation system – e. g., <b>courier,</b> express and <b>parcel</b> <b>service</b> providers (CEP) sector with it. Thus, the CEP sector is the most increasing and dominant logistics sector worldwide. Especially in agglomerations, a high growth potential is expected for the future. It is mostly driven by the demand of private households and retail in urban agglomerations. Considering the importance of CEP, the knowledge about CEP – from a transport modeller's view – is still scarce. There are several studies with focus on consumer's e-commerce behaviour or the supply side. However, – as far as the authors are aware of – there are no extensive studies examining both, transport demand and supply. This, however, is crucial for a better understanding and modelling of CEP actors. We present our first results and a theoretical and empirical based approach to characterise not only the supply side of CEP service providers, but also the demand side of private households, and businesses regarding e-commerce as a driver for the development of freight demand...|$|R
