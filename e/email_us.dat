They are characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and gapless edge or surface states which are protected by time-reversal symmetry. These topological materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in a variety of systems, including HgTe quantum wells, BiSb alloys, and Bi$_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $ and Bi$_ 2 $Se$_ 3 $ crystals. We review theoretical models, materials properties and experimental results on two-dimensional and three-dimensional topological insulators, and discuss both the topological band theory and the topological field theory. Topological superconductors have a full pairing gap in the bulk and gapless surface states consisting of Majorana fermions. We review the theory of topological superconductors in close analogy to the theory of topological insulators.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new way to {{understand}} the timing of branching events in phylogenetic trees. Our method explicitly considers the relative timing of diversification events between sister clades; as such it is complimentary to existing methods using lineages-through-time plots which consider diversification in aggregate. The method looks for evidence of diversification happening in lineage-specific ``bursts'', or the opposite, where diversification between two clades happens in an unusually regular fashion. In {{order to be able to}} distinguish interesting events from stochasticity, we propose two classes of neutral models on trees with timing information and develop a statistical framework for testing these models. Our models substantially generalize both the coalescent with ancestral population size variation and the global-rate speciation-extinction models. We end the paper with several example applications: first, we show that the evolution of the Hepatitis C virus appears to proceed in a lineage-specific bursting fashion. Second, we analyze a large tree of ants, demonstrating that a period of elevated diversification rates does not appear to occurred in a bursting manner.

40|$|Norcliffe, and Stephen Sheppard for {{comments}} on an earlier draft. Please <b>email</b> <b>us</b> for updates before citing. Because of growing interest in creative cities and cultural industries, scholars of economic development enjoy a new frontier for timely research with planning and policy implications. However, diverse literatures often use the terms creative and cultural without clearing defining them and without transparency in the use of data and statistics to measure and compare them. Cities rush to commission cultural plans and mandate cultural districts, states fund "cool cities " programs, and real estate interests dub certain areas of cities creative without the benefit of careful reasoning and empirical analysis. In this paper, we argue {{that there are a number}} of nested definitions of the regional cultural economy that researchers and policymakers can use with relative precision and for useful policy work. We explore the conceptual underpinnings of the terms "creative " and "cultural, " both fuzzy concepts. The term "creative " is popular but problematic, and in the rest of our paper, we use the more focused term, "cultural. " We analyze two sets of metrics for assessing the regional cultural economy...|$|E
