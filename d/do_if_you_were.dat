500|$|The video {{depicts a}} band playing [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)". U2 were {{cast in the}} role of the band's {{guardian}} angels, watching over the position that corresponds to their instrument in U2. Meret Becker is the lead actress of the video, cast as the band's lead singer. Wenders stated that they [...] "liked the idea that Bono's voice would be sung by a girl in this video." [...] Throughout the video U2 help the musicians play the track; drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. is shown assisting in the beat, while The Edge tunes the guitar, which Wenders noted is [...] "what you'd <b>do</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> guardian angel to a lead guitarist." [...] The video alternates between the band playing, the members of U2 standing on Victoria, and scenes from both Wenders films. At the conclusion of the video, Bono leaves the band on their own. The final shot shows him falling to earth, personifying the final lyric [...] "Just the bang and the clatter as an angel hits the ground." ...|$|E

2500|$|The ongoing of the {{election}} made third parties attract voters' attention. On March 3, 2016, Libertarian Gary Johnson addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington DC, touting himself as the third-party option for anti-Trump Republicans. In early May, some commentators opined that Johnson was moderate enough to pull votes away from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who were very disliked and polarizing. Both conservative and liberal media noted that Johnson could get votes from [...] "Never Trump" [...] Republicans and disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters. Johnson also began to get time on national television, being invited on ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Bloomberg, and many other networks. In September and October 2016, Johnson suffered a [...] "string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs." [...] On September 8, Johnson, when he appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe, was asked by panelist Mike Barnicle, [...] "What would you <b>do,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> elected, about Aleppo?" [...] (referring to a war-torn city in Syria). Johnson responded, [...] "And what is Aleppo?" [...] Johnson's [...] "what is Aleppo?" [...] question prompted widespread attention, much of it negative. Later that day, Johnson {{said that he had}} [...] "blanked" [...] and that he did [...] "understand the dynamics of the Syrian conflict – I talk about them every day." ...|$|E
