40|$|Numerous turf {{fungicides}} {{were tested}} {{under various conditions}} for possible deleterious effects upon the earthworm Eisenla foetida. Earthworms treated by immersion for one minute in 0. 1 % solutions of 10 different fungicides died insignificant numbers after benomyl and thiophanate methyl treatments. After 1 % fungicide treatments, there was significant mortality from benomyl, ethazole, Kromad, and thiophanate methyl fungicides. With 2 % fungicide solutions, significant numbers died after benomyl, cadmium succinate, ethazole, thiophanate methyl, and thiram treatments. Earthworms fed bermudagrass clippings treated with 10 different fungicides showed {{a significant decrease in}} longevity from clippings treated with benomyl, <b>dinocap,</b> ethazole, and thiophanate methyl. Earthworms reared for 84 days in soil treated with 15 different turf fungicides showed a significant decrease in longevity from soil treated with aniyaline, benomyl, chlorothalonil, Duoson, ethazole, fenaminosulf, Kromad, mancozeb, PCNB, thiabendazole, thiophanate methyl, and thiram. Cadmium succinate, <b>dinocap,</b> and RP 26019 did not cause a decrease in longevity. There was no reproduction by worms in soil treated with Duosan, PCNB, thiophanate methyl, and thiram, and only trace amounts in soil treated with chlorothalonil, ethazole, and Kromad.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{determine}} the residual toxicity of the main pesticides used in citrus, on Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) under laboratory conditions. For this, it was used the residual contact bioassay. Citrus leaves of the variety Pêra were sprayed in a Potter tower. The residual action was evaluated at 2 hours and 1; 3; 5; 7; 10; 14 e 21 days after treatment. Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, <b>dinocap,</b> sulphur, fenpropathrin, fenbutatin oxide and propargite were innocuous to N. californicus. On the other hand, abamectin, azocyclotin e cyhexatin caused mortalities of 29. 8; 32. 0 e 34. 1 %, respectively, two hours after transference. Dicofol, pyridaben and chlorfenapyr were extremely toxic to the predator mite, causing 100 % of mortality two hours after the application. This way, to this population of N. californicus, the releases can be performed safely 3 days after the application, except for cyhexatin (5 days), dicofol and pyridaben (14 days) and chlorfenapyr (21 days), without risk of significant adult mortality rates due to the application of pesticides...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi verificar a influência dos resíduos de calda sulfocálcica sobre a eficiência de acaricidas empregados no controle de Brevipalpus phoenicis. Inicialmente, o experimento foi instalado em um pomar de citros, em que foram selecionadas 10 plantas que continham frutos com verrugose. Realizou-se a aplicação de calda sulfocálcica (8 g i. a. L- 1 de água) em cinco plantas e as outras cinco plantas permaneceram sem aplicação de produto fitossanitário. Protegeram-se, com copos de plástico transparente de 500 mL, 64 frutos nas plantas tratadas com calda e 64 frutos nas plantas não-tratadas, totalizando 128 frutos protegidos. Decorridos 30 dias da aplicação, os frutos foram colhidos e levados para o laboratório. Estes frutos foram parcialmente parafinados, deixando-se em cada fruto uma arena de 2, 5 cm de diâmetro com verrugose e sem parafina, delimitada com cola entomológica. Em seguida, procedeu-se à aplicação sobre os frutos em Torre de Potter dos seguintes acaricidas nas concentrações expressas em mg de ingrediente ativo por litro de água: {{propargite}} a 720 mg, óxido de fenbutatina a 400 mg, cyhexatin a 250 mg, azocyclotin a 250 mg, fenpyroximate a 50 mg, dicofol a 960 mg e <b>dinocap</b> a 738 mg e a testemunha sem aplicação de acaricida. Após 1, 7 e 16 dias da aplicação, transferiram-se para cada fruto 10 ácaros B. phoenicis para avaliar a mortalidade. Constatou-se que os resíduos de calda sulfocálcica não prejudicaram a eficiência dos acaricidas avaliados no controle de B. phoenicis. The {{objective was}} to assess the influence of lime sulfur residues on the acaricidal efficiency against Brevipalpus phoenicis mite. Initially, the experiment was conducted in a citrus orchard where 10 plants presenting scab fruits were selected. Secondly, the application of lime sulfur (8 mg a. i. L- 1 of water) was performed in five plants, and the other five plants remained without application. Next lime sulfur application, 64 fruits in the plants with lime sulfur application were protected with plastic cups and others 64 fruits also were protected in the plants without lime sulfur application with plastic cups. After 30 days of field application, fruits were harvested and transported to the laboratory. These fruits were partially waxed, leaving an arena of approximately 2. 5 cm in diameter with scab and without paraffin and entrapped with entomological glue. Afterwards, acaricides application were done following the concentration expressed in mg of active ingredient per liter of water: propargite (720 mg), fenbutatin oxide (400 mg), cyhexatin (250 mg), azocyclotin (250 mg), fenpyroximate (50 mg), dicofol (960 mg), <b>dinocap</b> (738 mg) and control treatment by using the petri dish-Potter tower method.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} has been to investigate the efficiency of chemical preparations and their sustainability of apple cultivars against powdery mildew pathogen (Podosphaeraleucotricha). Three cultivars of apple (Jonathan, Idared and Vizajka-native cultivars) have been tested in experimental fields (in the municipality of Peja, Kosovo) during the two years of research (2013 - 2014). Fungicides that are used were: Webeton (triadimefon), Rubigan (fenarimol), Karathan EC (<b>dinocap)</b> and Kossan WG (sulfur). During the vegetation has been made eight spraying, three spraying before the blossoming and five spraying after the blossoming, within a period of 10 - 15 days between spraying and sprinkling. After that, there have been done three evaluations {{of the disease and}} the results obtained have been processed according to Mc Kinney index. Through the processed results has been seen that higher efficiency of chemical preparations has been in the Webeton and Karathan combination EC (variant- B 2) and in Rubigan and Karathan combination EC (variant- B 1), during the two years of the research. Whereas, regarding the suitability of cultivars to pathogen, cultivar “Vizajka ” (native cultivar) showed the highest sustainability against disease pathogen, where, the index in the first and second year of the research has been lower in all variants as well as to control compared to two other cultivars.

40|$|The {{preventative}} and curative {{effects of}} some plant derived agents based on plant extracts or essential oils were studied at different concentrations against Erysiphe cichoracearum DC. ex Merat, the causal pathogen of okra powdery mildew by the detached leaf-disk and potted plants bioassays. Through detached leaf-disk assay, the highest mean preventative effect (97. 74 %) was recorded by neem seed oil followed by jojoba oil (89. 82 %) and extract of Rynoutria sachalinensis (82. 77 %). Neem seed oil at 1 % {{was the most}} effective agent followed by jojoba oil and extract of R. sachalinensis at 1. 5 % and 2 %, respectively, where they suppressed E. cichoracearum completely. Potted plants assay revealed that neem seed oil, jojoba oil and extract of R. sachalinensis {{as well as the}} fungicide (active ingredient <b>dinocap)</b> showed higher preventative efficacy at all leaf olds treated after 7 and 14 days of inoculation as compared with extracts of henna and garlic. Moreover, the preventative efficacy partly remained apparent after 14 days of inoculation at all leaf olds tested.

40|$|This study {{involved}} assessments of therapeutant effects on pollination and fruit set; of temperature effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in apples, peaches and kiwifruits; of flowerage effects on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in kiwifruit styles; and of hand pollination effects on fruit set, fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit vines. From {{the point of}} view of their in vitro effects on pollen germination therapeutants can be listed in order of decreasing inhibitory effect as follows: (a) for apples - mancozeb plus <b>dinocap,</b> triforine, dichlofluanid, bupirimate, bayleton, citowett R captan and mancozeb; (b) for peaches - triforine, vinclozoline, streptomycin plus triforine, mancozeb, captafol, iprodione, dichlofluanid, streptomycin and benomyl; and (c) for kiwifruits - dichlofluanid, captan and vinclozoline. However, it appeared that while in vitro a therapeutant was very inhibitory, the application of a spray to anthers in an intact flower did not affect the germination of pollen subsequently released by those anthers. Fungicides proven to be toxic to pollen in vitro did not necessarily produce similarly toxic effects in vivo. Reasons for such varying effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth in vitro and in vivo are suggested. At 24 hours after pollination the number of pollen tubes growing more than 1 / 2 the style length of kiwifruit (Hayward) flowers one to two days old were 38 % and 27 % higher than in flowers less than one day old and more than three days old respectively. In apples 5 sprays of either bayleton or captan, 3 sprays of either of the therapeutants mancozeb, mancozeb plus <b>dinocap,</b> and triforine and a wetting agent citowett R applied during bloom period caused no effect in fruit set in Golden Delicious trees; and 3 bupirimate sprays during bloom period had no effect on the fruit set in Splendour trees. In peaches 6 sprays of either captafol, or benomyl or iprodione, 5 sprays of either mancozeb or vinclozoline or streptomycin or triforine during bloom period caused no effect on fruit set in Golden Queen trees. Three sprays of streptomycin or dichlofluanid caused no effect but 3 sprays of triforine, triforine plus streptomycin or of ethephon caused 50 %, 70 % and 90 % reduction in fruit set in Red Haven peach trees. In kiwifruits 3 sprays of either dichlofluanid, captan or vinclozoline reduced seed numbers per fruit by 37 % but did not affect fruit set or fruit weight. Thus in vitro and in vivo studies were useful in determining therapeutant effects on pollen but did not necessarily provide information on their effects on fruit set in apple, peach and kiwifruit and on fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit. The germination of both apple and peach pollen was higher at 24 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C, 28 °C and at 32 °C. After 18 hours incubation pollen tubes were longer at 28 °C and at 32 °C than at 16 °C, 20 °C and 24 °C. In vivo studies with kiwifruit (Matua) pollen showed that pollen germination at 14 °C, 18 °C, 22 °C and 26 °C did not differ significantly. Temperatures both higher and lower than the temperature range 18 to 22 °C were found to be inhibitory to pollen tube growth in kiwifruit (Hayward) styles. Hand pollination of flowers did not influence percentage fruit set but increased fruit weight and seed numbers per fruit in kiwifruit (Hayward) vines. Because fruit weight was positively correlated with seed number per fruit in fruits from both bee pollinated and bee plus hand pollinated flower clusters, supplementary pollination may play an important role in the production of fruit in kiwifruit orchards...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} an {{overview}} {{of what we know}} at present about the patogen Uncinula necator and the disease powdery mildew of grapevine, i. e. its economic status, inoculum source, microclimate conditions, vine susceptibility and principles of its protection. Powdery mildew is a major grapevine disease in terms of losses. It infects the plant’s green parts, reducing its fertility, spoiling the quality of grapes and wine and ruining plant vitality. The process additionally affects subsequent vegetation seasons. The disease occursevery year and its intensity depends on a number of factors. It had long been assumed that overwintering mycelium was the primary source of inoculum. More recent research, however, has revealed a crucial role of cleistothecia in many vineyards. They were found in our vine-growing regions long ago but their true role in the epidemiology of disease has been explained only recently. Microclimate conditions considerably affect the abundance and vitality of cleistothecia and the pathogen’s infection potential. Outbreaks and intensity of disease both depend on them, while vine susceptibility plays another important role, depending on cultivarand plant ontogenesis. Grapevine is most sensitive during flowering and bunch formation when conditions are generally good for the disease to appear and spread. Temperature, precipitation and relative air humidity may limit the occurrence of powdery mildew, but extreme values in that respect are a rarity. Their normal scope is more or less favourable for the disease, especially in Podgorica vineyards. Knowing the pathogen, especially its infection potential, environmental conditions, dynamics of host development and timely and good quality protection of vines, both preventive and chemical, is crucial for grapevine protection. Prevention is important but treatments with fungicides are crucial for U. necator control, and they can either focus on destroying the inoculum and delaying mildew outbreaks or on preventing primary and secondary infection and spreading of disease. Fungicides that arenormally used include some old compounds (sulphur, <b>dinocap)</b> as well as new ones (strobilurins and hinolines), while inhibitors of ergoserol biosynthesis have an increasing role...|$|E

30|$|According to {{the results}} {{presented}} in Table  2, the maximum and minimum removal efficiency of diazinon were 96 and 23 %, respectively. Results showed that the observed values of the removal efficiency of diazinon were {{in the range of}} 23 – 96 which was not different from the values predicted by the model (RSM). The findings of this study (using Eq.  2) showed that this treatment process was able to remove 96 % of diazinon from aquatic environments. This process underwent the main, interaction, and square effects. Each of these effects have coefficients with positive or negative signs that indicate positive or negative effects are on removal efficiency. The best model to fit the experimental data with independent variables was the quadratic model. ANOVA was used to determine the significance of the model (P values <  0.05). Overall, results showed that this process was significance (P values <  0.0001). Results presented in Table  3 showed that R 2, justified R 2, and adequacy precision were 0.931, 0.8665, and 14.842, respectively. Figure  3 indicated that with increasing the parameters from − 1 level (2.5  mg/L) to + 1 level (7.5  mg/L), the removal efficiency of diazinon reduced significantly. There is an inverse relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and its initial concentration, so that with increasing the diazinon concentration from − 1 level to + 1 level, its removal efficiency decreased 24.25 % while the reaction time, pH, and concentration of yeast were at the zero level (P value <  0.0001). This is because with increasing the concentration of diazinon, adsorption sites on yeast walls are saturated and decrease the absorption capacity (Mahmoud 2016). Mahmoud (2016) confirmed that with the use of S. cerevisiae, the removal efficiency of reactive dye decreased with increasing the concentration of its pollutant (Mahmoud 2016). Studies show that numerous bacteria are involved in the degradation of diazinon (Kristina et al. 2008). The hydrolase enzyme in bacteria {{plays a major role in}} the biodegradation of diazinon. It can biodegrade alkyl and aryl bonds of P-O in organophosphates (Gunner and Zuckerman 1968; Kristina et al. 2008). Abasalt et al. (2014) showed that Pseudomonas plecoglossicida can use diazinon as a carbon and phosphorus source and biodegrade it. Mahiudddin et al. (2014) concluded that Pseudomonas peli, Burkholderia caryophylli and Brevundimonas diminuta can completely biodegrade diazinon in the concentration of 20  mg/L (Mahiudddin et al. 2014). According to Fig.  3, there is a direct relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and reaction time, so that with increasing the reaction time from − 1 level to + 1 level, removal efficiency increased 43.39 % while the initial concentrations of diazinon, pH, and the concentration of yeast were at the zero level (P value <  0.0001). This positive effect (Eq.  2) has been shown by the coefficient of + 11.29 for parameter B. Mariusz et al. (2009) indicated that Serratia and Pseudomonas can successfully biodegrade diazinon (at the concentration of 50  mg/L for the period of 42  days) by 83 and 87 %, respectively (Mariusz 2009). Sadeghi et al. (2014) showed that S. cerevisiae can biodegrade Carmoisine and Reactive Black 5 Dyes within 24  h. Therefore, the maximum removal of carmoisine and Reactive Black 5 Dyes was 85 and 53 %, respectively (Sadeghi et al. 2014). Bumpus et al. (1993) reported the ability of Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade 27.5 % of chlorpyrifos during the 18 -day incubation (Bumpus et al. 1993). The results demonstrated a direct relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and the concentration of S. cerevisiae, so that the removal efficiency of diazinon (while the initial concentration of diazinon, pH, and reaction time were at the zero level) increased by 27.8 % over time from − 1 level to + 1 level (P value <  0.05). Zaharia et al. (2013) indicated that a 5 % concentration of S. cerevisiae can significantly biodegrade the <b>DINOCAP</b> and DNOC pesticides. The findings of this study (Fig.  3) suggest that there is an inverse relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and pH. Accordingly, with increasing the pH from − 1 level to + 1 level, the removal efficiency of diazinon decreases by 30 % while the reaction time, initial concentration of diazinon, and the concentration of S. cerevisiae were at the zero level (P value <  0.0001). pH is one of the important parameters influencing chemical reactions and biological aqueous solutions. It affects the surface charge of absorbents and the ionization degree of absorbate (Sadeghi et al. 2015). S. cerevisiae has carboxyl, phosphonate, and amine groups which include negative, negative, and positive charges, respectively. Amine groups are mainly found in proteins and bio-mass and are also more active than other groups in biosorption (Sadeghi et al. 2015). At a low pH, active sites (amino groups) of S. cerevisiae are protonated and the density of positive charge in the absorbent surface increases (Sadeghi et al. 2015). If the adsorption phenomenon is involved alone, a high adsorption must be observed in an alkaline pH, while a high adsorption must observed in an acidic pH (Konstantinos et al. 2012; Sadeghi et al. 2015). Kristina et al. (2008) showed that the removal efficiency of diazinon increases by microorganisms at a low pH (Kristina et al. 2008). Aksu (2003) demonstrated that the efficiency of S. cerevisiae in reactive dye removal increased significantly at a low pH.|$|E
