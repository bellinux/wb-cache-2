50|$|The Dublin Assay Office was {{established}} in 1637 to supervise the assaying of all gold and silver throughout the whole kingdom of Ireland. Originally, hallmarks consisted of the goldsmiths' proper mark which was the maker's mark originally used to identify the silversmith or goldsmith responsible for making the article. The <b>fineness</b> <b>mark,</b> the crowned harp, was applied to 22 carat gold and sterling silver, which was silver of a standard of 925 parts of fine silver in each 1000.|$|E
5000|$|Hallmarks {{are often}} {{confused}} with [...] "trademarks" [...] or [...] "maker's marks". A hallmark {{is not the}} mark of a manufacturer to distinguish his products from other manufacturers' products: that is the function of trademarks or makers' marks. To be a true hallmark, it must be the guarantee of an independent body or authority that the contents are as marked. Thus, a stamp of '925' by itself is not, strictly speaking, a hallmark, but is rather an unattested <b>fineness</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is one assay {{office at}} Aradippou.The Law {{governing}} the marking {{of precious metal}} articles has been ratified by the House of Representatives in 1991, creating a new semi-Governmental Organisation, the Cyprus Organisation for the Hallmarking of precious metals. The Cyprus Assay Office (CAO) is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. The Cyprus Hallmark consists of three compulsory symbols: 1. The manufacturer's mark - Consists of the initials of the manufacturer of the article surrounded by a small shield; 2. The <b>fineness</b> <b>mark</b> - The purity of the metal, in parts per thousand; 3. The official mark - the Head of Aphrodite until December 2001 and a ship as from January 2002 denotes that the article is made of Gold, and the fish that the articles is made of Silver. The manufacturer's mark must be struck on the articles by the manufacturer before its submitted to the Assay Office for Hallmarking. The manufacturer may make arrangements for the manufacture's mark to be struck by the Assay Office upon submission of the article to be struck with the approved hallmarks. The manufacturer's mark which is registered under the relevant section of the Law shall include the initial letters of the name or names of the manufacturer and shall be of such design as may be approved by the Assay Office. The standards of fineness of Gold and Silver articles that are hallmarked are for gold : 375, 585, 750 and 916 parts per thousand; for silver: 800, 830 and 925 parts per thousand; no negative tolerance is permitted on the above standards of fineness.|$|E
50|$|Many nations require, as a {{prerequisite}} to official hallmarking, that the maker or sponsor itself marks upon the item a responsibility mark and a claim of <b>fineness.</b> Responsibility <b>marks</b> are also required in the U.S. if metal fineness is claimed, {{even though there is}} no official hallmarking scheme in that country. Nevertheless, in nations with an official hallmarking scheme, the hallmark is only applied after the item has been assayed to determine that its purity conforms not only to the standards set down by the law but also with the maker's claims as to metal content.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} many methods of {{detecting}} fake precious metals, there are realistically only two options available for verifying the <b>marked</b> <b>fineness</b> of metal as being reasonably accurate: assaying the metal (which requires destroying it), or using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF will only measure the outermost portion of the piece of metal, so it may get fooled by thick plating.|$|R
50|$|Coins {{were defined}} by {{monetary}} regulations {{as so many}} minted per mark weight and of a certain minimum <b>fineness.</b> The mint <b>mark</b> used was the mark of Castile. It originated when Alfonso X (1252-1284) replaced the Roman pound (libra) with the Cologne mark. Spanish numismatists usually use the weight of this mark as determined in 1799, i.e. 230Â·0465 grams. The measure of fineness (ley in Spanish) for gold was 24 quilates (carats), each of 4 granos (grains); the measure for silver was 12 dineros, each of 24 granos.|$|R
50|$|Complete {{international}} hallmarking {{has been}} plagued by difficulties, because even amongst countries which have implemented hallmarking, standards and enforcement vary considerably, making it difficult for one country to accept another's hallmarking as equivalent to its own. While some countries permit a variance from the <b>marked</b> <b>fineness</b> of up to 10 parts per thousand, others do not permit any variance (known as negative tolerance) at all. Many nations abide by the Vienna system and procedures are in place to allow additional nations to join the Vienna Convention. Similarly, with the consent of all the current member states, the terms of the convention may be amended.|$|R
