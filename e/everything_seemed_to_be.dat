500|$|Stanley Donen {{was born}} in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the {{daughter}} of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis {{was born in}} August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy {{as one of the few}} Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he [...] "must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me." [...] He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him.|$|E
500|$|The Rutherford {{government}} {{had just been}} resoundingly re-elected in the 1909 provincial election, winning 36 of the legislature's 41 seats, when the new legislature first met in February 1910. [...] There was initially no sign of controversy {{in relation to the}} A Railway: William Clarke, A President, had several months earlier announced that the line would be completed by the end of 1912, ahead of schedule. [...] When the A bonds went on sale in London in November 1909, the issue was oversubscribed. [...] The following month, the contract for ties was awarded. [...] <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> progressing as planned when, {{at the beginning of the}} new legislative session, Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle asked the government a series of innocuous questions about the company and the guarantees made to it. [...] Rutherford, Minister of Railways as well as Premier, responded to the questions in writing. [...] Before he did so, however, a rumour began to circulate that William Henry Cushing, Minister of Public Works, had resigned from the cabinet.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, {{especially}} {{the first half}} of this period, people experienced considerable prosperity in the Roaring Twenties. The social and societal upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to Europe in the aftermath of World War I. The Roaring Twenties, often called [...] "The Jazz Age", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. 'Normalcy' returned to politics, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle.|$|E

60|$|All this greatly charmed Euphemia. It was so cute, so complete. There were no {{interviews}} with disagreeable trades-people, {{none of the}} ordinary annoyances of housekeeping. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done with a bell, a speaking-tube or a crank.|$|E

60|$|That, however, {{which made}} the deepest {{impression}} on me during this visit was {{the manner in which}} the work of training the young is conducted. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done with an amount of wisdom and vigour which cannot fail to tell most beneficially and extensively on future generations.|$|E

60|$|Not {{without much}} {{difficulty}} did the three youths {{manage to get}} the ropes disentangled from the rear wheels and the back axle.

6000|$|<b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{slipping}} away from me. I pushed {{on to the}} ugly facts that remained over from the wreck of my interpretation.

60|$|But quickly this palled. After a short time, she was {{not very}} much {{interested}} in being good. Her soul was in quest of something, which was not just being good, and doing one's best. No, she wanted something else: something that was not her ready-made duty. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{merely a matter of}} social duty, and never of her self.

60|$|The {{talk was}} very often {{political}} or sociological, and interesting, curiously anarchistic. There was {{an accumulation of}} powerful force in the room, powerful and destructive. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrown into the melting pot, {{and it seemed to}} Ursula they were all witches, helping the pot to bubble. There was an elation and a satisfaction in it all, but it was cruelly exhausting for the new-comers, this ruthless mental pressure, this powerful, consuming, destructive mentality that emanated from Joshua and Hermione and Birkin and dominated the rest.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that he saw}} {{him better}} Philip was {{surprised}} again at his boyish air: you felt {{that he should be}} larking in the street with the other lads instead of waiting anxiously for the birth of a child.
