5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions,</b> and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E

40|$|Trait-based {{approaches}} evaluate <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under {{environmental change}} by relating traits predicting changes in species densities (response traits) to traits driving <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> (effect traits). Stressors can, however, affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> {{not only by}} altering species densities but also by directly changing species effect traits. We first identified the response traits predicting the cell density of 18 marine benthic diatom strains along gradients of two chemical stressors (a pesticide and a metal, atrazine and copper). We then tested if response traits could predict stressor-induced changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> i. e. changes in the effect traits driving the diatoms’ potential contribution to primary production, sediment stabilization and energy content in intertidal systems. Finally, we examined if changes in density and changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> were correlated, to assess whether species capable of growing under stressful conditions could maintain their contribution to <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> The relationship between response traits and stressor-induced changes in density and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> was different depending on stressor type: a set of intercorrelated morphological traits predicted changes in both density and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under metal stress, with large cells being more stress resistant. Changes in density and changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> were positively related: diatoms whose density was least affected by the metal were also able to sustain functioning under metal exposure. In contrast, the capacity for mixotrophic growth predicted changes in density, but not changes in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under pesticide stress. Pesticide effects on density and on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> were negatively related for energy content and sediment stabilization, indicating a limited capacity of pesticide-tolerant diatoms to maintain their contribution to <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Synthesis. <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under stress can depend on whether the response traits driving changes in species densities also predict direct stress effects on the species’ contribution to functioning. Based on our results, we expect a disproportionate loss of functioning when traits driving species densities do not allow to maintain <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> under stress...|$|R

This study reviewed research on functional traits and framework of ecosystem services, relationship between functional diversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> and application of functional traits in ecosystem services. We proposed a framework of ecosystem services based on functional traits. First, abiotic factors and functional diversity indices that significantly affected <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> should be investigated.

40|$|Biodiversity is an {{essential}} determinant of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Numerous studies described positive effects of diversity on the functioning of communities arising from complementary resource use and facilitation. However, high biodiversity may also increase competitive interactions, fostering antagonism and negatively affecting community performance. Using experimental bacterial communities we differentiated diversity effects based on genotypic richness and dissimilarity. We show that these diversity characteristics have opposite effects on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Genotypic dissimilarity governed complementary resource use, improving <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> in complex resource environments. Contrastingly, genotypic richness drove allelopathic interactions, mostly reducing <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> The net biodiversity effect on community performance resulted from the interplay between the genetic structure {{of the community and}} resource complexity. These results demonstrate that increasing richness, without concomitantly increasing dissimilarity, can decrease <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> in simple environments due to antagonistic interactions, an effect insufficiently considered so far in mechanistic models of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity {{is rapidly}} declining worldwide, {{and this may}} lead to {{subsequent}} declines in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and stability. Here I consider whether: (i) stabilizing species interactions, such as niche partitioning and facilitation, promote biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and stability, and (ii) global ecosystem changes influence biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and stability by destabilizing species interactions. In Chapters 2 and 3, I report results from studies that used long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment to identify the mechanisms that promoted biodiversity, productivity, and the temporal stability of productivity. Stabilizing species interactions that favored rare species promoted productivity and temporal stability. Stabilizing species interactions that favored unproductive species promoted biodiversity and temporal stability. In Chapters 4 and 5, I report results from a new experiment that tested whether intense grazing influenced biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and stability by favoring common and productive species, especially in exotic species mixtures. Stabilizing species interactions maintained biodiversity and promoted <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> in ungrazed native species mixtures. However, species interactions were destabilized, and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> was decreased, in both exotic and intensely grazed mixtures. In conclusion, these results suggest that: (i) stabilizing species interactions that favor rare and unproductive species can simultaneously promote biodiversity, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> and temporal stability in grasslands; and (ii) changing from native grasslands to exotic grasslands or pastures can decrease ecosystem services by destabilizing species interactions...|$|R

Our unique long-term data set comprised data from two brown bear populations in northern Spain on historical presence, current presence, and reproduction.

We used the long-term average of the seasonal course of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) as a proxy for <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and investigated the relationship between habitat quality and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> with methods borrowed from statistical point-pattern analysis. We found that brown bears indeed selected habitat with specific <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> (i. e., the variance in all habitat classes was smaller than in the landscape overall) and the relationship between habitat quality and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> was ordered. First, the average distance in <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> between two habitat classes was larger if the difference in habitat quality was larger. Second, habitat for which there was the greatest need (i. e., breeding habitat) occupied the narrowest niche regarding <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and showed the most pronounced seasonality. Progressively poorer classes occupied wider niches that partly overlapped those of better classes. This indicated that nonbreeding animals are less selective. Our methodology provided new insight into the relationship between <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> and habitat quality and could be widely applied to animal species living in seasonal environments.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{studies conducted in}} disparate ecosystems have shown that greater species diversity has positive effects on ecosystem functioning; however, other studies have found neutral or sometimes negative results. It is still unclear why the relationship between biodiversity and functioning varies among studies, but perhaps, investigating this relationship across spatial and temporal scales will lead to further understanding. One theory predicts that local niche complementarity among species (the partitioning of species based upon niche differentiation) is predicted to positively affect local <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> at the local spatial scale. However, more recent theory predicts that greater local diversity may hinder local <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> when diversity is enhanced through regional processes. I suggest community assembly {{as a way to}} incorporate both the local and regional processes that determine biodiversity and its consequent effects on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> From this, I propose a hump-shaped relationship between diversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> at local spatial scales, but a linear increase of functioning with diversity at regional spatial scales. Thus, species diversity may have different effects on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> across different spatial scales. Species diversity may affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> differently across time as environmental conditions shift. Through integrating recent theoretical models in ecosystem ecology and empirical examples of food-webs in community ecology, the effects of herbivore diversity on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> (grazing of primary producers) were examined under unchanged (no nutrients added) and changed (nutrients added) environmental conditions.

40|$|<b>Ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> {{depends on}} {{multiple}} interactions between physical, {{chemical and biological}} determinants. Indeed, ecosystem processes (productivity and nutrient recycling) result directly from the diversity of functional traits in the biotic communities, which is in turn determined by the species composition and diversity.

40|$|Background With the {{recognition}} that environmental change resulting from anthropogenic activities is causing a global decline in biodiversity, much attention {{has been devoted to}} understanding how changes in biodiversity may alter levels of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> Although environmental complexity has long been recognised as a major driving force in evolutionary processes, it has only recently been incorporated into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning investigations. Environmental complexity is expected to strengthen the positive effect of species richness on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> mainly because it leads to stronger complementarity effects, such as resource partitioning and facilitative interactions among species when the number of available resource increases. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we implemented an experiment to test the combined effect of species richness and environmental complexity, more specifically, resource richness on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> over time. We show, using all possible combinations of species within a bacterial community consisting of six species, and all possible combinations of three substrates, that diversity-functioning (metabolic activity) relationships change over time from linear to saturated. This was probably caused by a combination of limited complementarity effects and negative interactions among competing species as the experiment progressed. Even though species richness and resource richness both enhanced <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning,</b> they did so independently from each other. Instead there were complex interactions between particular species and substrate combinations. Conclusions/Significance Our study shows clearly that both species richness and environmental complexity increase <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> The finding that there was no direct interaction between these two factors, but that instead rather complex interactions between combinations of certain species and resources underlie positive biodiversity <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> relationships, suggests that detailed knowledge of how individual species interact with complex natural environments will be required in order to make reliable predictions about how altered levels of biodiversity will most likely affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen a shift of {{emphasis}} in ecology; from {{a focus on the}} drivers of biodiversity change toward a consideration for its effects on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> is affected by individual species (i. e. species with functionally dominant biological traits), but can also be influenced by other factors, such as interspecific interactions. Current evidence suggests that biotic influence over marine <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> is largely underpinned by the effects of individual species. However, there are indications that this might not constitute a complete understanding of the link between marine biodiversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> (BEF). For this thesis, I applied our current understanding of marine BEF relationships (i. e. the causal link between particular biological traits and particular ecological functions) to long-term benthic community time series and investigated the causes of ecological change and its consequences for <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning.</b> A shift in the taxonomic composition of the species assemblage was explained by underlying variation in extrinsic drivers. However, the long-term conservation of trait composition suggests that functioning can be sustained in the face of environmental and ecological change. Experiments conducted to test BEF relationships in intertidal marine benthos reaffirmed the functional importance of the biological traits of species, but also showed that interactions among species can influence the delivery of ecological functions in various ways, including facilitation (i. e. function delivery is enhanced) and antagonism (i. e. function delivery is reduced). The results suggest that biotic influence over marine <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> is more complex than previously suggested, and that the impacts of biodiversity change (e. g. species extinctions or shifts in species densities) could be either exacerbated or mitigated depending on the composition of the affected assemblage and the ecological function considered. To produce more realistic results, future indirect assessments of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functioning</b> would benefit from incorporating interactions among species as well as their biological traits...|$|R
