40|$|The CMS {{detector}} {{is designed}} to observe electrons and muons {{in a wide range}} of energies. Therefore in a well populated event, several leptons could be reconstructed and their flavour identified. In the reconstruction of single-lepton ttbar events it is important to identify the leptons which are originating directly from the decay of the W boson and separate them from those which are produced in the fragmentation process of the partons. This note describes a likelihood ratio method which separates both categories for the lepton being either an electron or a muon. The likelihood ratio method is based on the observation that some variables can differentiate between both categories, namely the <b>isolation</b> <b>energy</b> or <b>isolation</b> transverse momentum, the isolation angle and the transverse momentum of the reconstructed lepton. Also reconstructed vertex information is used on the basis of the significance of the distance in the direction along the beam line between lepton and primary vertex. The efficiencies are compared with those obtained by the HLT lepton isolation criteria. The result for muons is found to be competitive, while for electrons a significant improvement is observed. The influence on the efficiency from pile-up has been studied and found to be marginal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the abstraction of energy reserves for sensor networks that virtualizes energy sources. It gives each of several applications sharing a platform {{the illusion of}} having its own private energy source. Energy virtualization is {{the next logical step}} in embedded systems after virtualizing communication links and CPU capacity. Energy virtualization has not been addressed in past sensor network literature because most current wireless sensor networks feature single-user applications. To amortize deployment costs, future sensor networks, deployed in remote or hardto-access areas, will likely be leveraged by scientists from different disciplines, each having their independent application for their individual research purposes. Platforms, planned for such deployment, will be fitted with the union of sensors needed, but independent applications will share the remaining resources such as in-field storage and communication bandwidth, calling for quotas and isolation mechanisms. The most expensive resource shared in sensor networks is energy. This paper provides an <b>energy</b> <b>isolation</b> mechanism, called the virtual battery, that logically divides energy among applications to provide each its private energy reserve. An application can manage its private energy independently as if it were running alone on the platform. The application is terminated when its reserve is depleted. We implement and evaluate this abstraction on MicaZ motes running LiteOS. Our results show that the virtual battery mechanism succeeds at exporting the private reserve abstraction accurately and at a low overhead. ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} promise {{an unprecedented}} potential for observing the physical world. Their battery life, however, {{is usually the}} bottleneck that limits application lifetime, a problem that is exacerbated by the disparity between the rapidly growing processing speed and the slowly improving battery capacity. We observed {{the importance of this}} problem in our first-hand experiences: during our involvement in two large-scale sensor network deployments, VigilNet, and EnviroMic, energy is the primary concern in the development and deployment of applications. Our experiences with these projects motivate us to consider the central role that energy plays in the design and implementation of software stacks for wireless sensor networks, including not only the design choices of protocols but also the overall system architecture. In this dissertation, we present an energy-centric software architecture, LiteArch, that addresses the following three problems. First, we address the problem of energy conservation, where we consider a stack of protocols that extends the lifetime of sensor networks through duty scheduling, and provide an analysis on the quantitative relationship between energy consumption and surveillance performance. Second, we address energy awareness, where we design energy-efficient communication protocols, whose performance usually dominates the overall energy efficiency of applications. Finally, we address <b>energy</b> <b>isolation,</b> where we implement an energy reserve abstraction that virtualizes energy sources, giving each application sharing the same platform an illusion of having its own guaranteed energy source. Because these three problems are closely related to the role played by energy, we call the overall LiteArch architecture energy-centric. The immediate implications of LiteArch is that it can improve the performance of the motivating projects, VigilNet and EnviroMic. In the long term, the impact of LiteArch will be manifested through our continuing development of LiteOS, an operating system on which we have implemented several representative protocols in LiteArch. Our solutions reflect the profound impact of energy on the design and implementation of the sensor network software stack, and shed light on the general principles that help design and implementation of future sensor network platforms...|$|E

It is made up of 35 inspection forms. The forms are designed to be used by rig workers to document the inspection of tools and equipment commonly found on rotary and workover rigs. Each inspection form includes instructions for assessing and recording the condition of the equipment. When applicable, relevant federal regulations and industry recommended practices are included. The Rig Check inspection forms are an excellent training tool for short service employees, who may not be familiar with the tools and equipment found on oil and gas rigs.

Many different technologies for combating wind and earthquake loads have been identified.

Energy dissipation of a structure removes energy and therefore movement from a structure by providing damping.

Problematic areas in energetic which are regulation, metering, control of waste minimalizations, expense and maximalization of earnings.

Systems used in practice have their own hierarchical structure, where every application requires specific access of selection of used components that suit to the application. First of all it is about acceptable device selection in single level of the system: metering and regulation, data acquisition out of the process and informative layer.

The recovery of blowdown pulse <b>energy</b> in <b>isolation</b> of displacement pulse energy allows the discharging (depressurization) of the exhaust system to reduce engine pumping work and improve engine fuel economy. This is a novel approach to air system optimization that has previously been studied for naturally aspirated engines.
