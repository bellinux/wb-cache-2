40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{adhesion}} of two epithelial sheets is {{a fundamental}} process that occurs throughout embryogenesis and during wound repair. Sealing of the dorsal epidermis along the midline of the Drosophila embryo provides a genetically tractable model to analyse the closure of such holes. Several studies indicate that the actin cytoskeleton plays {{a critical role in}} dorsal closure. Although many components of the signalling cascade directing this process have been identified, the precise cell-biological events upon which these signals act remain poorly described. Results: By confocal imaging of living fly embryos expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged actin, we found that dorsal closure relies on the activity of dynamic filopodia and lamellipodia that extend from front-row cells to actively zipper the epithelial sheets together. As these epithelial fronts approach one another, we observed long, thin filopodia, apparently ‘sampling’ cells on the opposing face. When the assembly of these actin-based protrusions was blocked (by interfering with the activities of Cdc 42 and Jun N-terminal kinase signalling), the adhesion and fusion of opposing epithelial cells was prevented and their ability to ‘sense’ correct partners was also blocked, leading to segment misalignment along the midline seam. Conclusions: Dynamic, actin-based protrusions (filopodia and lamellae) are critical, both in the mechanics of epithelial adhesion during dorsal closure and in the correct ‘matching’ of opposing cells along the <b>fusion</b> <b>seam...</b>|$|E

These tanks contain about 917 m of <b>fusion</b> weld <b>seam,</b> all of which is nondestructively inspected for flaws and all those found are repaired. The tanks are subsequently proof-tested to a pressure that is sufficiently severe to cause weld metal yielding in a few local regions of the weld seam. The work undertaken in the present project was to develop a capability to predict flaw growth from undetected surface flaws {{that are a}}ssumed to be located in the highly stressed regions. The technical challenge was to develop R-curve prediction capability for surface cracks in specimens that contain the flaws of unusual sizes and shapes deemed to be of interest. The test techniques developed and the elastic-plastic analysis concepts adopted are presented. The flaws of interest were quite small surface cracks that were narrow-deep ellipses that served to exacerbate the technical difficulties involved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. War-broken parts {{could be}} {{repaired}} quickly without power and {{gas in the}} field by using the thermit welding technology. In this paper, experimental and structural analysis on strength of thermit welding was made. According to orthogonal experiments, the pressure mode was found to influence tensile stress most, then the warm-up temperature and the welding line clearance. By quadratic general revolving combination design, the mathematics equation indicating the relation of welding tensile stress, warm-up temperature, pressing time and welding line clearance was obtained, and the optimized welding parameters to achieve the best tensile strength were decided as well. By further analysis on microstructures and fractures of welded <b>seam,</b> <b>fusion</b> zone and HAZ of thermit steel, conclusion was made that it was of vital significance to adopt welding-after-peening method for improving {{the strength of the}} welded seam...|$|R

Reinforced and non-reinforced PVC roof systems {{presence in}} the American low-slope roofing market spans {{the better part of}} three decades. This roof membrane brings particular unique features to owners of flat roofs [...] significant energy savings from reflective membranes, solid performance in ponded conditions, inherent flame resistance, integral <b>seam</b> <b>fusion,</b> and ease of inspection, leak detection, and repair. However, in the American market of the mid- 980 s, a rash of catastrophic membrane shattering to aged, non-reinforced, monomeric-plasticized PVC roofs occurred. The reputation of PVC roof systems suffered. In response, non-reinforced roof system manufacturers discontinued these specifications and products in favor of today's standard, thicker, fabric-reinforced PVC roof systems. Currently, the Single Ply Roofing Institute (SPRI) organization reveals PVC thermoplastic roofing is once again in a growth mode in the United States low-slope roofing market. However, the primary shattering characteristic, plasticizer migration, despite design improvements, remains a failure mode requiring definition and management. Hail...|$|R
40|$|Barrier to autointegration factor (BAF) binds {{double-stranded}} DNA, selected histones, transcription regulators, lamins, and LAP 2 –emerin–MAN 1 (LEM) domain proteins. During early Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis, BAF- 1 {{is required}} to organize chromatin, capture segregated chromosomes within the nascent nuclear envelope, and assemble lamin and LEM domain proteins in reforming nuclei. In this study, we used C. elegans with a homozygous deletion of the baf- 1 gene, which survives embryogenesis and larval stages, to report that BAF- 1 regulates maturation and survival of the germline, cell migration, vulva formation, and the timing of <b>seam</b> cell <b>fusion.</b> In the <b>seam</b> cells, BAF- 1 represses {{the expression of the}} EFF- 1 fusogen protein, but fusion still occurs in C. elegans lacking both baf- 1 and eff- 1. This suggests the existence of an eff- 1 –independent mechanism for cell fusion. BAF- 1 is also required to maintain the integrity of specific body wall muscles in adult animals, directly implicating BAF in the mechanism of human muscular dystrophies (laminopathies) caused by mutations in the BAF-binding proteins emerin and lamin A...|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the Engineering Doctorate (EngD) degree at Loughborough University. The EC Landfill Directive (1999), which is enforced in England and Wales through the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations (2002), has increased the technical challenge associated with the design and construction of landfill containment systems, in particular those on steep side slopes. Increased numbers of lining system components, varied configurations, and complex loading scenarios require advanced analysis tools to facilitate design. This project involved the development of advanced numerical modelling techniques, based on the FLAC finite difference modelling code. The analysis toolbox {{can be used to}} predict the behaviour of multilayered geosynthetic and soil lining systems, during and after staged construction. The model can include non-linear interface and geosynthetic axial properties, represent complex loading, including downdrag from the waste mass, whilst retaining the flexibility to represent varied geometries and include engineered support structures. Whilst numerical modelling is becoming increasingly commonplace in commercial design, there is little evidence of the validation of numerical models with field or experimental data. Validation of the analysis toolbox described in this document was conducted by back analysis of published data, modelling of landfill failure mechanisms, and comparisons to large scale laboratory testing. Design of field scale instrumentation has also been carried out as part of this project. The influence of interface shear strength variability has been assessed through the compilation of a comprehensive database, and the effect of this variability on lining system behaviour assessed through reliability based analyses. This has shown probability of failures may be higher than proposed limiting values when adopting traditional accepted factors of safety. A key area of interest identified during the project was the requirement for support, potentially through reinforcement, of the geological barrier. The inclusion of randomly reinforced fibres in bentonite enhanced soil has shown the potential for increased strength, without adverse effects on hydraulic barrier performance. ii Additionally, the influence of geomembrane seams on lining system integrity has been investigated, showing that <b>fusion</b> welded <b>seams</b> can result in stress concentration and extruded seams can cause significant stress concentration...|$|R
40|$|A STUDY OF THE CELL ADHESION MOLECULES, E-CADHERIN AND C-CAM AND THE INTERMEDIATE FILAMENT NESTIN IN CRANIOFACIAL AND TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. Catharina Terling The Department of Basic Oral Sciences, The Center of Oral Biology, Novum Research Park and The Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Nobel Institute, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden Cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) {{are involved}} in cell migration, morphogenesis, and cell differentiation within the embryo, {{and later in the}} maintenance of the multicellular organism. The aim of the present investigation was to analyze and compare the distribution of the CAMs, E-cadherin and C-CAM, during odontogenesis and palate formation, and furthermore, to analyze the expression of the intermediate filament (IF), nestin, in odontogenesis. Mice and rats of different ages (ranging from embryonic day 13, E 13, to adult) were used. The expression of the molecules was detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In general, E-cadherin was expressed by most epitehelia of the oral and nasal cavity. With terminal differentiation, the oral epithelium displayed a higher CAMs expression than the nasal epithelium. In the craniofacial complex E-cadherin was expressed already at E 14, while C-CAM was detected first at E 16. During palatal closure at E 15, the forming epithelial <b>fusion</b> zones (<b>seams</b> and triangles) showed, in the center, a high E-cadherin expression. The peripheral cells of the epithelial seam were less E-cadherin positive. This may indicate that E-cadherin is involved in the fusion of the epithelia and its expression has to be down-regulated in order for the epithelium to disintegrate and form mesenchymal continuity in the palate. There were no differences, with respect to CAM expression, between embryos with the retinoic acid (RA) induced cleft palate and normal embryos, indicating that RA does not affect the expression of CAMs. In odontogenesis, E-cadherin was present in the dental lamina, presecretory ameloblasts and cementoblasts. C-CAM was detected first in the reduced enamel epithelium prior to tooth eruption. Later, C-CAM was confined to the junctional epithelium (JE) of the gingival sulcus. Nestin was expressed in both mesenchymal and epithelial derived tissues during early tooth developmental stages and remained to be expressed exclusively in the odontoblasts. In conclusion, the findings indicate that both E-cadherin and C-CAM {{are involved in}} the formation of the epithelial structures of the craniofacial complex in a specific spatio-temporal pattern. E-cadherin may be involved in early tooth initiation, and differentiation and repolarization of ameloblasts, while C-CAM may be important for the formation and integrity of the JE. Nestin may be involved in early epithelial mesenchymal interactions during tooth development and later in the maintenance of the dynamic odontoblasts.

40|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathway {{is one of the}} key extracellular pathways involved in many developmental processes in vertebrates and invertebrates. In the nematode C. elegans, the two Wnt pathways named the Wnt/BAR- 1 canonical (WBC) pathway and the Wnt/&# 946;-catenin asymmetry (WBA) pathway function in cell fate specification, polarity and migration. We and others have shown that the WBC pathway functions in the specification of the vulval precursor cells (VPCs) that form the hermaphrodite vulva, and the WBA pathway functions in the specification of epithelial seam cells during their larval asymmetric stem cell-like divisions. My research project has focused on the identification of Wnt signaling targets functioning in the VPCs and seam cells using microarray analysis. The Wnt pathway was over-activated in worms using a heat shock inducible stable variant of BAR- 1 /&# 946;-catenin, and under-activated using a dominant negative variant of POP- 1 /TCF. The transcript pools from the VPCs and seam cells were enriched by the `mRNA tagging' method and I used microarray analysis to identify 240 putative Wnt pathway targets showing an average fold change of &# 8805; 1. 5 in the Wnt pathway over-activation samples compared to the under-activation samples. Of these, expression analysis and phenotypic characterization was conducted for 50 genes. I found 29 genes are expressed in the seam cells, hypodermis and/or vulval cells during larval development. RNA interference and mutant analysis revealed five genes with defects in terminal seam cell number. This work has also uncovered a previously unexplored role of Wnt signaling and of eight putative Wnt targets in influencing the lateral <b>fusion</b> of differentiated <b>seam</b> cells, and formation of the cuticular structure called alae. Additionally, 12 putative Wnt targets showed defects in vulval induction, differentiation and morphogenesis. I have also identified the GATA transcription factor encoding genes egl- 18 and elt- 6, which are known embryonic regulators of seam cell specification, as putative Wnt targets in larval seam cells. Genetic and epistasis analysis suggests that these factors act reiteratively downstream of the Wnt pathway in specifying seam cell fate during larval asymmetric seam cell divisions, unraveling a novel connection between two important regulators of seam cell fate specification. Finally, I have defined for the first time, the L 2 /L 3 larval transcriptome of the seam cells and VPCs. This work has filled a significant gap in our understanding of C. elegans Wnt targets functioning in seam cell and vulval development...|$|R
