40|$|In {{building}} acoustics, reliable prediction {{methods for}} sound transmission and sound radiation {{are required for}} parameter studies, material selection and optimization studies. Today {{there is a lack}} of calculation techniques which can be used in the entire frequency range of interest. Therefore a numerical prediction tool for building acoustical purposes has been developed in this work. It can be used in a broad frequency range to simulate direct sound transmission through finite-sized, composite walls and floors. The model is based on the wave based method for the acoustic domains and a modal approach to describe the structural response. To model multilayered structures consisting of elastic and poro-elastic layers, the wave based method is combined with the transfer matrix method in a new hybrid model. The full room-structure-room description allows reliable predictions in the low-frequency range. The enhanced computational efficiency of the wave based method compared to finite element models allows calculations at higher frequencies. The model is validated with airborne and structure-borne sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurements</b> and used to investigate the repeatability and reproducibility of sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurements</b> in the low- and mid-frequency range. Results focus on the influence of finite dimensions on sound transmission loss of composite structures and the relative importance of source and receiving room.

Wave based simulations show the importance of cavity absorption and the vibro-acoustic coupling between plate and cavity modes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{unavailability}} {{of theoretical}} models to predict direct transmission across {{all types of}} building element explains why laboratory measurements remain important at the design stage. However, sound insulation in-situ is determined by both direct and flanking transmission; hence prediction models are essential tools. To indicate the limitations of laboratory measurements, transient and steady-state SEA are used to illustrate how the transmission suite affects structural reverberation times of solid test elements and the inherent errors in structural coupling measurements on isolated junctions of walls/floors. In the field, the 'mid-frequency prediction problem' is considered in heavyweight buildings where structural coupling data from isolated junctions is incorporated in models.

In China, the life of many buildings is less than 50 years because of improper building heat preservation envelopes. It is found that irrational heat <b>insulation</b> <b>measurement</b> and heat preservation material position brings wall flaws and building life reduction. Comparisons of two building envelope heat insulation features are carried out by physical parameter measurements and calculation. The first is the internal heat preservation wall mode, which is mainly affected by indoor climate, and the temperature difference is generally less than 100 C in a year. Second, in the external heat preservation wall mode, the temperature difference varies from 500 C to 800 C annually in cold and humid climates. The investigation results indicates that the external heat preservation wall mode is better compared with the internal heat preservation wall mode, and the former can effectively extend building life and provide occupants a more comfortable indoor climate.

40|$|This thesis adresses the {{challenge}} of predicting sound insulation properties of cabin walls onboard a platform supply vessel. The sound reduction index is predicted using the softwares WinFLAG and Odeon, thus comparing theoretical results to on site measurements. In addition a method of measuring flanking paths between adjacent rooms is to be developed and tested. The sound reduction is calculated in WinFLAG, then used as input data in Odeon. Development of a method to measure flanking paths {{is based on a}} sound impact source. This impact source consists of a pendulum with a steel ball being released into the partition wall, causing vibrations in the structure that could be measured in a receiving room. A more complex wall type had been installed than originally thought, and the simulations done in Odeon were not applicable to the sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurements.</b> However, new calculations in WinFLAG were explored and compared to the measurements.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} aspects of a building?s acoustic behavior is the airborne sound insulation of the room façades, since this determines the protection of its inhabitants against environmental noise. For this reason, authorities in most countries have established in their acoustic regulations for buildings the minimum value of sound insulation that must be respected for façades. In order to verify compliance with legal requirements it is usual to perform acoustic measurements in the finished buildings and then compare the measurement results with the established limits. Since there is always a certain measurement uncertainty, this uncertainty must be calculated and taken into account in order to ensure compliance with specifications. The most commonly used method for measuring sound insulation on façades is the so-called Global Loudspeaker Method, specified in ISO 140 - 5 : 1998. This method uses a loudspeaker placed outside the building as a sound source. The loudspeaker directivity has a significant influence on the measurement results, and these results may change noticeably by choosing different loudspeakers, even though they all fulfill the directivity requirements of ISO 140 - 5. This work analyzes the influence of the loudspeaker directivity on the results of façade sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurement,</b> and determines its contribution to measurement uncertainty. The theoretical analysis is experimentally validated by means of an intermediate precision test according to ISO 5725 - 3 : 1994, which compares the values of sound insulation obtained for a façade using various loudspeakers with different directivities.

40|$|Poor {{acoustic}} insulation of building façades is often caused by poor mounting conditions and poor final set-up of openable windows. For the first, when wrong materials {{are used to}} obturate {{the gap between the}} window and the construction, the subsequent decrease in {{acoustic insulation}} can be observed in a wider range of frequencies. A poor final set-up of the window will usually lead to whistle noises inside the rooms, especially next to busy roads. Consequently, the aims of this investigation are to evaluate different methods to detect acoustical failures in openable windows, and to present an efficient approach to optimise the sound insulation of a façade. By means of experimental measurements in the acoustic laboratory on a standard openable window, two different and complimentary approaches are compared to evaluate its acoustical quality and failures. More specifically, the first is based on the standard sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurement</b> according to EN ISO 140 - 3, and the second consists of ultrasonic measurements. The experimental results demonstrate that the standard sound insulation measurements enables to evaluate the quantitative impact of different parameters governing acoustical failures, {{such as the use of}} the correct gasket, continuity and correct amount of pressure applied on the gasket. In addition, it was observed that the ultrasonic measurements enable a quick qualitative assessment that is very efficient to determine the exact position of the acoustic leaks in the façade. Finally, a combined use of standard and ultrasonic measurements is proposed to deliver an efficient approach to detect acoustical failures of a façade. The ultrasonic approach is a quick and cost-effective way to instantly track deficiencies of a window on site, whereas the standard measurement in the laboratory is more time consuming but needed to guarantee the performance of a building element. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustical}} environment in multi-family dwellings {{is an issue}} with a steadily increasing importance, and finding a balance between good acoustical privacy and cheap and effective construction methods {{is one of the}} biggest challenges for building designers today. The international standard regulates the sound insulation down to 100 Hz, but with the introduction of lightweight building materials as well as advanced home stereo equipment, low frequency sounds has become an increasingly important problem. This has led to an extension of the swedish sound insulation regulations down to 50 Hz. This master thesis aims to investigate if 50 Hz is a sufficiently low limit, or if it is neccessary to extend the limit further down to 20 Hz. This is done in three steps. First, it is investigated whether some objects commonly occuring in multifamily dwellings are able to excite low frequency sounds. Thereafter, the airborne and impact sound insulation in a lightweight construction are measured down to 20 Hz, in order to investigate how the sound insulation at low frequencies differs from the insulation in higher frequencies. Finally, the human perception of low frequency sounds are investigated by performing a listening test where the perceived annoyance level for different sounds commonly occuring in dwellings are analyzed. The investigation shows that there are many commonly occuring sound sources that are able to excite low frequency sounds. Most notably are doors that are being closed, subwoofers, and step sounds. The airborne and impact sound insulation were either the same or worse for frequencies below 50 Hz as the insulation at 50 Hz. The listening test showed that the annoyance level increases with increased sound pressure level. No difference in annoyance could be found between the different sound sources, and neither when comparing full frequency sounds with the same sound with frequencies below 50 Hz removed. Based on the results found in this thesis, and primary those from the listening test, it is not neccessary to extend the sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurement</b> limit below 50 Hz.

40|$|Measurement {{laboratories}} must {{be mindful}} of equipment limitations and increasing uncertainty as the extremes of operational range are approached. For thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>measurement,</b> the prominent issue with more highly-conductive materials is that of interface resistance. Equipment is generally based on the heat flow meter or the guarded hot apparatus, both of which measure the heat flow between flat parallel plates held at different temperatures with the test specimen located between them. Interface resistance occurs between the test specimen and the plates that it contacts. Standards prescribe lower limits of specimen thermal resistance, typically 0. 1 m 2. K/W. However whilst interface resistance may already be significant at this thermal resistance, measurement is often sought for more-conductive products. This dissertation considers a number of aspects of such measurements, in all cases proposing the use of flexible buffer materials at the interface between the test specimen and the apparatus plates {{in order to provide}} lower interface resistance. The use of this solution is seldom reported although it is described in some standards where it is also suggested that buffers of very low thermal resistance are required in order to minimize errors. However this would require them to be very thin and potentially ineffective. An alternative prospect has been explored, that of using thicker, softer interface materials to ensure good specimen contact. Separate measurement of the interface materials, in conjunction with an error analysis allows thermal resistance to be calculated as the difference between these measurements with known uncertainty. Chapter 2 describes a study using the difference approach to measure twelve highly-conducting specimens in conjunction with four foamed plastic buffer materials, based on PVC, silicone, EVA and nitrile. The specimens ranged from aluminium sheet to fluted plastic board. Compared with direct measurement, thermal resistance values via difference measurement were lower by between 0. 003 and 0. 01 m 2. K/W, depending on specimen and buffer choice. Silicone sponge gave the most uniform results. Compression tests showed that it also displayed the lowest deformation hysteresis. An analysis of the difference calculation is given, showing it to be numerically inexact since there are residual interface-resistance terms that are not present in both measurement cases. Chapter 3 describes a further study of the difference technique in conjunction with flexible buffer materials, extending the procedure to materials of higher thermal resistance and to thinner, harder buffers. An alternative difference calculation is proposed to eliminate residual resistance terms through comparing results for the unknown specimen and for a reference specimen with similar surface characteristics and known properties, measured using the same buffers. Specimens of expanded polystyrene board and cast acrylic sheet were measured in the heat flow meter apparatus using two alternative silicone-based buffer materials, one solid and the other a sponge. Analysis also includes earlier measurements of twelve more highly-conducting specimens, adjusting for the residual error terms. Across all of these, thermal resistance values obtained by the difference method were lower by between 0. 008 m 2. K/W and 0. 016 m 2. K/W, attributable to removing the contribution of interface resistance. In Chapter 4, a technique incorporating buffer materials is proposed for measuring the thermal conductivity of moist earthen and granular loose fill materials. Transient methods involving needle and other probes are also reviewed but it is concluded that a steady state approach offers reliable uncertainty estimation and a test method that is widely accepted in industry. Variations to the standard loose-fill method are proposed, including the use of a rigid holding frame with stiff base and silicone sponge buffer sheets, in conjunction with difference measurement to factor out the contributions from base, buffers and contact resistance. Using this approach, consistent results were obtained for loose-fill earths based on scoria, terracotta and furnace-ash at different moisture contents. Thermal resistance ranged from 0. 08 to 0. 4 m 2. K/W. Thermal conductivity fitted well to linear regression plots against moisture content. Further comparative measurements of a single specimen showed that direct measurement was less consistent than difference measurement, and that indicated thermal resistance was higher by 0. 023 m 2. K/W, this effectively being a measure of the interface resistance. Chapter 5 explores earlier evidence that high-conductance materials with rough surfaces, (such as many building boards), are measured to have higher thermal resistance and higher test thickness when measured with harder buffers. Results from an experimental study of nine materials and four buffer types are reported. Thermal resistance was higher by up to 0. 01 m 2. K/W and thickness by up to 0. 5 mm using the hardest buffer relative to the softest. An analytical model was developed, allowing measured roughness to be expressed as flat high and low areas of varying height and area fraction so that thermal resistance and height variations could be predicted as a function of roughness. Predictions were consistent with optical roughness measurements. The model further predicted that interface-resistance errors are proportional to surface roughness and are always present with harder buffers, typically reaching 010 m 2. K/W for a mean roughness amplitude () of 200 &mu;m. However with softer buffers these errors are absent below an onset level, typically at an value of 60 &mu;m. Chapter 6 describes heat flow meter measurements and transient thermal modelling using ANSYS of a webbed, hollow-cored panel with silicone sponge buffer materials chosen to provide boundary conditions comparable to standard surface coefficients. Surface temperatures were also measured at eight locations for an uninsulated configuration as well as with bulk insulation filling. Measured and modelled temperature-time plots agreed well after corrections for web and airspace thermal conductivity. Modelled spatial variation in heat flow exceeded 200 % for one insulated case but was only about 2 % for the uninsulated panel. Modelled values for heat flux and overall thermal resistance agreed well with standard analytical calculations. However heat flows indicated by the apparatus were consistently higher than the modelled and calculated values by up to 8 %, expected to be due at least partially to specimen non-homogeneity. Nevertheless results suggest a useful role for the apparatus in providing temperature measurement under controlled conditions and helping to validate thermal modelling...|$|E

We intend to compare the results of direct measure-ments of sound insulation {{with the results of}} the predictions of sound insulation, based on the vibration measurements, to verify the feasibility of using vibration measurements to determine the most suitable locations of sound propagation (floor, ceiling, side walls) to act in order to improve, where it is needed, sound insulation in buildings. The principles of sound propaga-tion considered in EN 12354 series standards are used, e. g., 5 major structural paths, depend-ing on the sound radiating element in the receiver compartment [1) partition wall, 2) ceiling, 3) floor, 4) wall left side, 5) wall right side] and 2 major airborne path [1) openings in the par-tition element, 2) openings in other elements].

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{investigated}} the accelerated ageing of seven different thin-film module types {{through the use of}} sequential damp heat (85 oC/ 85 % RH) tests. The module types [a-Si, tandem a-Si/a-Si micro-morph a-Si/µ-Si, triple junction a-Si, CIS (x 2) and CdTe] were selected to cover a range of thin-film devices, materials and construction types. Sequential damp heat tests for cumulative exposure times of 250, 1000, 2000 and 3000 h have been achieved to date, with the modules subjected to visual inspection, electrical <b>insulation</b> <b>measurements</b> and electrical performance measurements (IV curves). A wide range of performance losses (Pmax), from almost zero to - 70 %, were evident for the different technologies. Sequential damp heat exposure tests can be used to induce accelerated aging on thin-film modules. However, {{it is not possible to}} equate loss of power to a number of years of outdoor exposure due to the lack of knowledge of the acceleration factors for each PV module type. JRC. DG.

40|$|The sound {{insulation}} of buildings {{should be able}} to be forecasted by calculation early in the project stage. Therefore building elements are tested in acoustical transmission suites to determine their individual sound transmission. The manufactures are required to label the {{sound insulation}} values of their building products. Currently these values are recorded in a number of test institutes with different transmission suite design. As a basic requirement, the results of these measurements should be comparable. It is known, that the loss factor as a measure of vibrational damping has a significant influence on the sound insulation. This aspect has been often neglected in the past due to the problems when measuring the loss factor of building elements. An improved measuring method, developed within this thesis, now leads to more precise values. Furthermore the thesis reports on the results of an inter-comparison laboratory test, and the large differences between results of sound <b>insulation</b> <b>measurements</b> in different transmission suites. These differences can be explained and reduced by taking the loss factor into account, which has been measured by the improved measuring method...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{insulation}} {{of clothing}} {{is a basic}} determinant of body heat exchange and is of particular importance in cold environments as a behavioural means of protection against heat loss. Based on the concept developed by Beiding (1949) and Burton and Edholm (1955) a heat exchange model has been proposed to evaluate the thermal impact of cold environments {{in terms of a}} required insulation for maintained heat balance at acceptable Levels of physiological strain (Holmer, 1984). From information about the environmental factors (air temperature, mean radiant temperature; air velocity and humidity) and activity (metabolic rate) the equation calculates an overall insulation value (IREQ) for the clothing layers. IREQ {{is a measure of the}} environmental stress as a function of activity Ievel. IREQ provides a value that can be used as a guideline for the specification of protection requirements under different ambient conditions and for the selection of appropriate protection (in terms of insulation presented by clothing ensembles) for a given set of conditions. The increasing use of thermal manikins for <b>insulation</b> <b>measurements</b> is one important presumption for the application of IREQ...|$|R
