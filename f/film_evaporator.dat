50|$|A {{number of}} various {{evaporator}} designs {{have been developed}} using the fundamental principles of the rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> thermo-siphon. The available designs for the evaporators are mostly customized by private companies and industries depending on the required application in producing the desired products. This is essential {{in order to ensure}} that the optimal product is obtained while maximising the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the design.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} of the forced/natural circulation evaporators is the cost. Circulation evaporators have particularly high construction costs, whereas falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> have a low investment cost. Falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> has no rotating internal part, and hence experience no mechanical deterioration, whilst circulation evaporators have high maintenance costs.|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> have {{a number}} of {{potential}} advantages over their vertical counterparts in the petrochemical industry, such as the ability to use tubes with external enhancements. ( [...] Internally enhanced tubes are available for vertical falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators,</b> but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is that if a corrosive or fouling liquid is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on the shell side. This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.|$|R

50|$|Evaporators {{have the}} aim of concentrating a {{solution}} by vaporising the solvent. As such to assess the performance of a rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> the capacity and thermaleconomy of the evaporator is measured. Capacity is the amount of water vaporized per unit time while the steam economy is the amount of solvent vaporised. Hence, the main process attributes are the characteristics of the process that significantly affect these two areas.|$|E
50|$|A climbing/falling film plate {{evaporator}} is a specialized type of evaporator {{in which a}} thin film of liquid is passed over a rising and falling plate to allow the evaporation process to occur. It {{is an extension of}} the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> and has application in any field where the liquid to be evaporated cannot withstand extended exposure to high temperatures, such as the concentration of fruit juices.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to that, the Artisan Rising <b>Film</b> <b>Evaporator</b> {{is designed to}} eliminate {{the majority of the}} volatile components before stripping and is usually used as a flash evaporator or pre-heater. This design allows the operator to control the feed rate or steam rate in order to remove residues, to adjust to the product behaviour, and to maximise steam economy. This evaporator is appropriate for high temperature application and materials with high viscosity that has a propensity to foul the transfer surfaces.|$|E

The reaction mixture is separated in a falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> from volatile components. The liquid phase is distilled and butyraldehyde is removed as head product while the catalyst containing bottom product is recycled to the process. The process is carried out at about 1.8 MPa and 95-100 °C.|$|E
50|$|Semi Kestner, {{also known}} as Semi-Rising <b>Film</b> <b>Evaporator,</b> is widely used in sugar industries. This {{equipment}} provides Polly-baffle catcher to avoid juice entrapment {{and there would be}} more effective juice distribution by means of juice coil and Flushing of juice. This design has high brix of syrup and high vapour pressure is supplied as less steam quantity is required. With short retention time of liquor and good heat transfer design features, the juice flows back without any discharge by going through the heating surface only once.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is the low residence time of the liquid feed in the evaporator compared to other evaporator designs like plate-type evaporators. This is crucial because it allows the usage of the evaporator in higher operating temperatures and gives assurance of high product quality despite the product being heat sensitive. Additional advantage is {{the availability of the}} option to operate the evaporator as a continuous process which is overall more energy and time efficient than a batch process operation.|$|E
50|$|Limited product versatility:-Another major {{limitation}} of rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is {{the requirement for}} the products to be of low viscosity and have minimal fouling tendencies. Competitive process designs like plate-type evaporators can handle liquids that are more viscous with higher fouling tendencies because the inner parts are more easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.|$|R

30|$|Depending on the {{capabilities}} of the used concentrators and the allowable solid content in the mixture for further safe operation of dryers, the protein hydrolysate solution can be concentrated up to 50 % solids (Pasupuleti and Braun 2010).

50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|E
50|$|While {{the rising}} film {{evaporators}} are relatively efficient {{and have a}} several advantages, some literature suggests {{that they are not}} as efficient as the vertical or the horizontal tube falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> As such, in recent times falling film evaporators are usually chosen in place of rising film evaporators because they have similar advantages as rising film evaporators and have the additional benefits of better efficiency. Moreover, rising film evaporators requires a driving force to move the film against gravity and this causes a limitation because there is a requirement for a sufficient temperature difference between the heating surfaces to provide the driving force.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{evaporator}} {{is mainly}} used in processes dealing with heat-sensitive materials, the residence {{time should be}} kept as low as possible. Residence time is the time taken for the product to be in contact with heat. To improve the product quality, short heat contact period from single pass operation can minimize product deterioration. The climbing and falling film plate evaporator is capable of satisfying this requirement. Short residence time {{can be achieved by}} higher liquid flow rates down the tube in the falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporator.</b> The effect of gravitational force will increase the flow rate of the liquid resulting in the short residence time.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{intimate}} contact {{of the liquid}} with the heating surface, these evaporators are sensitive to fouling from precipitating solids; liquor velocity, typically low at liquor inlet (see above) is usually not sufficient to perform an effective self-cleaning of the tubes. Falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> are therefore used in clean, non-precipitating liquids. A typical application, in chemical industry, is for concentration of caustic soda.|$|R
50|$|Juice {{concentration}} and food processing:-The food industry requires handling of delicate {{products that are}} sensitive to high temperature {{for long periods of}} time. Rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> can operate quickly and efficiently enough to avoid having to expose the product to high temperatures which may damage or undermine its quality. Hence, they are suitable to use as concentrators for juices, milk and other dairy products which are products that require delicate handling in the food industry.|$|R
40|$|The {{complexities}} of two-phase flow and evaporation on a tube bundle present important {{problems in the}} design of heat exchangers and the understanding of the physical phenomena taking place. The development of structured surfaces to enhance boiling heat transfer and thus reduce the size of evaporators adds another level of complexity to the modeling of such heat exchangers. Horizontal falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> have the potential to be widely used in large refrigeration systems and heat pumps, in the petrochemical industry and for sea water desalination units, but {{there is a need to}} improve the understanding of falling film evaporation mechanisms to provide accurate thermal design methods. The characterization of the effect of enhanced surfaces on the boiling phenomena occurring in falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators</b> is thus expected to increase and optimize the performance of a tube bundle. In this work, the existing LTCM falling film facility was modified and instrumented to perform falling film evaporation measurements on single tube row and a small tube bundle. Four types of tubes were tested including: a plain tube, an enhanced condensing tube (Gewa-C+LW) and two enhanced boiling tubes (Turbo-EDE 2 and Gewa-B 4) to extend the existing database. The current investigation includes results for two refrigerants, R 134 a and R 236 fa, at a saturation temperature of Tsat = 5  °C, liquid film Reynolds numbers ranging from 0 to 3000, at heat fluxes between 20 and 60 kW/m 2 in pool boiling and falling film configurations. Measurements of the local heat transfer coefficient were obtained and utilized to improve the current prediction methods. Finally, the understanding of the physical phenomena governing the falling film evaporation of liquid refrigerants has been improved. Furthermore, a method for predicting the onset of dry patch formation has been developed and a local heat transfer prediction method for falling film evaporation based on a large experimental database has been proposed. These represent significant improvements for the design of falling <b>film</b> <b>evaporators...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{determination}} {{of the size of}} a rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> is generally a sensitive task because it involves obtaining a good understanding of the process requirements and behaviour of the materials involved. In terms of cost efficiency, it is generally accepted that long and thin tubes are relatively cheaper because the thicker shell sizes for shell and tube heat exchangers are usually more expensive. Nonetheless, while weighing in the cost of the construction against the requirement, the size can be always adjusted and customized depending on the required application in producing the desired products. Generally the size of the length ranges between 4 and 8 m and 25 mm to 50 mm in diameter.|$|E
50|$|For {{a rising}} <b>film</b> <b>evaporator,</b> the main paths of heat {{transfer}} are conduction and convection. These occur as the steam {{in the shell}} side heats up the tube and as the tube heats up the liquid and vapour within. The design of the long vertical tubes in rising tube evaporators promote {{the formation of the}} long, thin and continual film of liquid formed by the pressure exerted by the vapour which occupies the centre part of the tube and rises up. This ascending motion of film and vapour in the centre promotes great turbulence which then allows for higher heat transfer coefficients leading to a better efficiency heat transfer. Another significant factor that affects the value of the heat transfer coefficients is the design of the evaporator.|$|E
5000|$|The Rising Thin Film Vacuum Evaporator {{design is}} {{modification}} {{on the original}} rising <b>film</b> <b>evaporator</b> which has the main difference of allowing the liquid evaporates at lower temperature. This is possible because it operates under vacuum conditions which also avoid undesired formation in the liquid. This design is created to re-concentrate a diluted solution to its desired concentration by evaporation while also allowing evaporated water to condense simultaneously and be recovered for either recirculation or other purposes. There are {{many different types of}} Rising Thin Film Vacuum Evaporator models operating with different capacity, concentration control, types of condenser design to obtain the product at optimal condition.

Thermal spray metal coating is a heat transfer enhancement technique which is done by spraying molten metal on any heat transfer surface. Vertical plate with sinusoidal corrugation is a surface enhancement technique which can be cheaper, compact and lighter for falling film evaporation compared to shell and tube configuration. This paper presents a two dimensional CFD study of water falling film evaporation on a thermal spray metal coated vertical corrugated conduits. Two-phase flow simulation is done by using a finite volume method based commercial software, with turbulence modeling which is done by k-Â two equations with shear stress transport (SST). Sinusoidal corrugations with different porosity have been selected for the study. Evaporation and heat transfer during falling film evaporation are included through user defined functions (UDFs). Effect of Reynolds number (Re), wall superheat and surface roughness on heat transfer coefficient is presented. Surface roughness is varied from 0. 33 to 4. 73.
