50|$|From 1957 to 1961, Chevrolet also {{produced}} the Turboglide, a triple turbine {{continuously variable automatic transmission}} with concurrent ratios whose design {{was similar to}} that of Buick's <b>Flight</b> <b>Pitch</b> Dynaflow, subsequently called Triple Turbine (full technical description). The Turboglide, only offered with V8 engines, was more expensive (by about $50) than the Powerglide and did not have wide acceptance, in part due to failures in 1957-58 models, which were addressed by a significantly upgraded version for 1959.|$|E
5000|$|The 18A is a metal {{semi-monocoque}} construction with a tube frame {{supporting the}} transmission and engine. It has an enclosed cockpit with two tandem seats and a fixed tricycle landing gear. A 180 hp (134 kW) Lycoming O-360-A1D horizontally opposed carbureted engine is fitted behind the cockpit driving {{a two or}} three-bladed Hartzell pusher propeller. A three-bladed fully articulated rotor is mounted above and behind the cockpit. A hydraulically actuated clutch and a transmission are provided to permit the engine to drive the rotor briefly while {{on the ground to}} obtain the rotor speed necessary for takeoff. The clutch is released immediately prior to takeoff, and the rotor is not engine-driven in flight. The rotor can be pre-spun up to 370 rpm on the ground with the blades in flat pitch to store energy for take-off (flight rpm typically being in the low 200s). When the blades are released to <b>flight</b> <b>pitch</b> the aircraft can perform a [...] "jump" [...] or zero-roll take-off (aircraft load and density altitude permitting) using the excess energy in the blades.|$|E
50|$|Chevrolet Turboglide {{was modeled}} {{along the lines}} of the Buick <b>Flight</b> <b>Pitch</b> Dynaflow transmission, and {{operated}} very similarly to the Buick transmission. Using a five element torque converter, (pump, individual turbines for low, intermediate and direct ranges, and a switch pitch stator) the Turboglide offered the smoothest operation of any automatic in the industry, as no shift occurred between ranges and hence there was no potential to create a disruption in the perfectly smooth flow of power. For extra getaway power at any road speed, the converter stator vanes could be directed to a steeper angle which raised the stall speed of the torque converter and increased torque multiplication, as well as directing the oil flow at the turbine for the next lowest range. Turboglides selector quadrant was Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Hill Retarder (early 1957 only) P R N D Hr or Grade Retarder (late 1957-1961) P R N D Gr. Some owners of the early 1957 models with the Turboglide transmission marked with HR Retarder mistook the HR to mean High Range so the marking was changed early in the model year to Gr Retarder.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Giants {{entered the}} World Series {{with a top}} <b>flight</b> <b>{{pitching}}</b> staff as well, with Johnny Antonelli (21-7, 2.30 ERA), Rubén Gómez (17-9, 2.88), and 37-year-old Sal [...] "The Barber" [...] Maglie (14-6, 3.26). The Giants relied more heavily on relief pitching with Hoyt Wilhelm (12-7, 2.10, 7 saves) and Marv Grissom (10-7, 2.35, 19 saves) rounding out a staff that led the NL in team ERA at 3.09 and shutouts with 17. Manager Leo Durocher used a solid, consistent lineup with all his starters, except for the catching position, playing in at least 135 games. Willie Mays (.345, 41 HRs 110 RBIs) led an offense that also featured Don Meuller (.342 avg), Al Dark (.293, 98 runs), Hank Thompson (26 HRs, 86 RBIs) and pinch-hitter extraordinaire Dusty Rhodes (.341 avg).|$|R
5000|$|Sources {{differ on}} the P.7s engine; it is {{described}} {{both as an}} Isotta-Fraschini Special V6 rated at [...] and as an Isotta-Fraschini AS-5 of [...] The engine was connected both to a two-bladed automatic variable-pitch tractor propeller by a long metal shaft and by another shaft to a smaller marine propeller, {{similar to those used}} on motorboats, mounted beneath the aircraft's tail. To take off, the pilot would start the engine with the flight propeller feathered and the normal carburettor air intake closed and use a clutch to engage the tail propeller and get the aircraft moving through the water. The two hydrofoils, mounted beneath the fuselage on struts just forward of the wings similar {{to the way in which}} floats were mounted on floatplanes, would cause the P.7 to rise out of the water almost immediately. After the aircraft had risen on its hydrofoils and the flight propeller had cleared the water, the pilot would open the carburettor air intake, again employing the clutch to disengage the marine propeller, and use another clutch to engage the flight propeller, which automatically would switch from feathered to <b>flight</b> <b>pitch.</b> Driven by its flight propeller, the aircraft then would engage in a conventional takeoff, riding on its submerged hydrofoils until it reached takeoff speed.|$|E
5000|$|The design {{featured}} a belt clutch and a transmission {{which could be}} engaged to spin the rotor blades to high speed before take-off to produce short takeoff runs. A lever on the rear cockpit wall would select the drive position for the transmission. A single [...] "spin-up lever" [...] on the cockpit left side would then be pressed downward, operating as a collective pitch control to put the blades into flat pitch while simultaneously tensioning the belt clutch. The rotor could be spun to over 500 rpm before takeoff, well above the normal flight range (typically 425 rpm). Release of the spin-up lever would disengage both the clutch and the transmission, while placing the blades into <b>flight</b> <b>pitch.</b> After a very brief takeoff run (typically 25 to 200 feet, depending upon load and winds) adequate flight airspeed would be attained, while the rotor speed decayed to the normal flight range. The rotor was not engine-driven in flight. A strong spring resisted accidental depressing of the spin-up lever while airborne. Dual controls were provided for all functions except the spin-up lever, which was accessible only from the left seat. The aircraft enjoyed nimble handling with light control forces, but suffered from a shallow climb gradient.Early versions were equipped with a two-bladed wooden Sensenich propeller. A later [...] "Super J-2" [...] variant employed a three-bladed Hartzell controllable-pitch propeller, accompanied {{by an increase in}} allowable gross weight. Baggage of up to 95 pounds, to the extent permitted by gross weight considerations, could be carried in a large bay under the seat. Fuel was carried in tanks in the stub wings. A total of 24 U.S. gallons could be carried, 12 on each side, but only 20 were usable through normal flight attitudes. At a typical fuel burn rate of about eight gallons per hour and economy cruise at about 85 mph, with a need for a safety reserve, this limited the aircraft's range.|$|E
40|$|A {{supersonic}} rolling missile {{with two}} synchronous canard control surfaces is analyzed using an automated, inviscid, Cartesian method. Sequential-static and time-dependent dynamic simulations {{of the complete}} motion are computed for canard dither schedules for level <b>flight,</b> <b>pitch,</b> and yaw maneuver. The dynamic simulations are compared directly against both high-resolution viscous simulations and relevant experimental data, and are also utilized to compute dynamic stability derivatives. The results show that both the body roll rate and canard dither motion influence the roll-averaged forces and moments on the body. At the relatively, low roll rates analyzed in the current work these dynamic effects are modest, however the dynamic computations are effective in predicting the dynamic stability derivatives which can be significant for highly-maneuverable missiles...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 An {{adaptive}} {{pitch axis}} autopilot design procedure is presented. The design procedure is applicable to both stable and unstable pitch axis models {{and to those}} having nonminimum phase. The design approach assumes the adaptive autopilot is activated after achieving level flight. It is shown a rate-feedback compensator can be designed to ensure stable level <b>flight</b> <b>pitch</b> axis operation for the entire desired flight regime. The adaptive control loop design utilizes a pole-placement algorithm. The closed-loop characteristic polynomial is designed to have dominant poles of that of an ideal second order system to obtain the desired transient response. The identification of the system uses a modified least-squares algorithm with a variable forgetting factor. The nonlinear pitch axis model is used in simulations to evaluate the design. Command response tests include the step response and the ramp command response. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} adaptive pitch axis autopilot is capable of tracking altitude commands after activation. The closed-loop system response is close to that of the ideal second order system having the dominant poles...|$|E
40|$|Small Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) are {{versatile}} tools {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} applications. Fixed wing UAVs require forward airspeed to remain airborne, usually resulting in constant energy expenditure to loiter over targets. A UAV capable of perching could reduce energy expenditure by settling on a site near the target, thus increasing mission duration. Avian perching techniques were observed to build a hypothesis for the biological control techniques employed during the landing maneuver. Variation of wing sweep for pitch control {{was identified as a}} contributing control method, and selected for study. A biologically-inspired aircraft was designed with variable wing sweep, and modeled using a combination of MATLAB and Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL) to predict pitching response due to wing sweep. A small remote controlled prototype was built with variable wing sweep in addition to standard flight control surfaces. An onboard microcontroller and inertia measurement unit (IMU) were used to record pitch and wing sweep data during <b>flight.</b> <b>Pitch</b> response to wing sweep was observed, and a proportional integral derivative (PID) control system was designed to successfully use wing sweep for closed loop pitch contro...|$|E
50|$|A {{cruciform}} empennage at {{the rear}} of the fuselage comprised four tailplanes, fitted with moving ailerons that would also have functioned as combined rudders and elevators.

5000|$|Another major {{departure}} from the previous armors is expansion of repulsor technology. The [...] "repulsor flight system" [...] provides lift (something like anti-gravity) and positive <b>flight</b> control (<b>pitch,</b> roll and yaw), while the usual rocket boots provide the armor with thrust.

40|$|A model, predictor, or error {{estimator}} {{is often}} used by a feedback controller to control a plant. Creating such a model is difficult when the plant exhibits nonlinear behavior. In this paper, a novel online learning control framework is proposed that does not require explicit knowledge about the plant. This framework uses two learning modules, one for creating an inverse model, {{and the other for}} actually controlling the plant. Except for their inputs, they are identical. The inverse model learns by the exploration performed by the not yet fully trained controller, while the actual controller is based on the currently learned model. The proposed framework allows fast online learning of an accurate controller. The controller can be applied on a broad range of tasks with different dynamic characteristics. We validate this claim by applying our control framework on several control tasks: 1) the heating tank problem (slow nonlinear dynamics); 2) <b>flight</b> <b>pitch</b> control (slow linear dynamics); and 3) the balancing problem of a double inverted pendulum (fast linear and nonlinear dynamics). The results of these experiments show that fast learning and accurate control can be achieved. Furthermore, a comparison is made with some classical control approaches, and observations concerning convergence and stability are made...|$|E

5000|$|Over the {{distance}} from the pitcher's mound to home plate, the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can [...] "flutter," [...] "dance," [...] "jiggle," [...] or curve in two different directions during its <b>flight.</b> A <b>pitch</b> thrown completely without spin is less desirable, however, than one with only a very slight spin (so that the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter). This will cause the position of the stitches to change as the ball travels, which changes the drag that gives the ball its motion, thus making its flight even more erratic.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the <b>flight</b> dynamic, <b>pitch</b> <b>flight</b> control and flying qualities assessment for the reference BWB aircraft. It aims to develop the longitudinal control laws which could satisfy the flying and handing qualities over the whole flight envelope with added consideration of centre of gravity (CG) variation. In order to achieve this goal, both the longitudinal stability augmentation system (SAS) and autopilot control laws are studied in this thesis. Using the pole placement method, two sets of local Linear-Time-Invariant (LTI) SAS controllers are designed from the viewpoints of flying and handing qualities assessment and wind disturbance checking. The global gain schedule is developed with the scheduling variable of dynamic pressure to transfer gains smoothly between these two trim points. In addition, the poles movement of short period mode with the varying CG position are analysed, and some approaches of control system design {{to address the problem of}} reduced stability induced by CG variation are discussed as well. To achieve the command control for the aircraft, outer loop autopilot both pitch attitude hold and altitude hold are implemented by using the root locus method. By the existing criteria in MIL-F- 8785 C specifications being employed to assess the augmented aircraft response, the SAS linear controller with automatic changing gains effectively improve the stability characteristic for the reference BWB aircraft over the whole envelope. Hence, the augmented aircraft equals to a good characteristic controlled object for the outer loop or command path design, which guarantee the satisfactory performance of command control for the BWB aircraft. The flight control law for the longitudinal was completed with the SAS controller and autopilot design. In particular, the SAS was achieved with Level 1 flying and handing qualities, meanwhile the autopilot system was applied to obtain a satisfactory pitch attitude and altitude tracking performance...|$|R
