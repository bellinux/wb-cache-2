5|$|Marasmius funalis {{is known}} only from Kawasaki, Kanagawa and Machida, Tokyo, Japan. Mushrooms grow in groups on dead plant matter, {{and have been}} {{recorded}} on <b>Japanese</b> <b>cedar</b> (Cryptomeria japonica) wood and leaf litter in woodland mostly made up of Chonowski's hornbeam (Carpinus tschonoskii) and bamboo-leaf oak (Quercus myrsinifolia). The mushrooms can be encountered from May to July.|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with <b>Japanese</b> <b>cedar</b> (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E

5|$|The host {{spectrum}} of the Amylostereaceae comprises several, partially very different genera of Coniferae. A.chailletii usually infests Pinaceae such as firs (Abies) and spruces (Picea), but also cedars (Cedrus) and Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga). A.areolatum has a similar host spectrum, which uses mainly firs, <b>Japanese</b> <b>cedars</b> (Cryptomeria), larches (Larix), spruces, pines (Pinus) and Douglas firs as hosts. While spruces dominate as hosts in the native habitat, this species {{is more common in}} pines on other locations. The host {{spectrum of}} A.laevigatum comprises Cupressaceae such as junipers (Juniperus) or cypresses (Cupressus) and the English yew (Taxus baccata).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{radiocarbon}} {{content of}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>cedars</b> {{was measured by}} accelerator mass spectrometry for decadal tree-ring samples from the period of 240 BC to AD 900. Conventional gas counting was also used {{for part of the}} samples. The data were compared with the INTCAL 98 calibration curve (Stuiver et al. 1998). The results indicate that the difference in atmo-spheric 14 C between Japan and North America or Europe is negligible at this period, less than 18 14 C yr using an average of 50 yr. However, in the period of about AD 100 to about AD 200, we cannot exclude the possibility of a deviation of the order of 30 to 40 14 C yr to the older ages...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEstimations of radiocesium {{input and}} output {{concerning}} the forest floor within a mountain forest region have been conducted {{in the north and}} central part of the Abukuma Mountains of Fukushima, northeast Japan, after a 2 – 3 year period following the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident. The radiocesium {{input and output}} associated with surface washoff, throughfall, stemflow, and litterfall processes at experimental plots installed on the forest floor of evergreen <b>Japanese</b> <b>cedars</b> and deciduous Konara oaks have been monitored. Despite the high output potential in the mountainous forest of Fukushima, the results at both monitoring locations show the radiocesium input to be 4 – 50 times higher than the output during the summer monsoon in Fukushima. These results indicate that the radiocesium tends to be preserved in the forest ecosystem due to extremely low output ratios (0. 05 %– 0. 19 %). Thus, the associated fluxes throughout the circulation process are key issues for the projecting the environmental fate of the radiocesium levels, along with the subsequent reconstruction of life emphasized within the setting...|$|R

30|$|Compared {{with these}} {{acoustic}} techniques, X-rays have higher resolution when {{used to evaluate}} the inner state of wood. Moreover, X-rays can provide density information. To verify wood density, research on X-ray attenuation in wood has been conducted for several decades. Olson et al. [5] calculated the change of mass attenuation coefficient according to tube voltage for conifer wood. The ideal X-ray energy between 5.13 and 5.69  keV for 1  mm thick wood samples provided the maximum attenuation difference between earlywood and latewood. Nakada et al. [6, 7] used soft X-ray imaging to study the MC distribution in clear <b>Japanese</b> <b>cedars</b> according to direction. In addition to density distribution, X-rays can provide the size/location of a defect when computed tomography (CT) is used in conjunction. The X-ray CT image can be reconstructed using numerous radiographs obtained with a rotating X-ray apparatus. Macedo et al. [8] reported that CT image quantification in terms of dry bulk density could be obtained for three different X- and gamma-ray energies (28.3, 59.5 and 662.0  keV). Lindgren et al. [9] reconstructed a density CT image of clear wood to determine the physical properties in three directions (radial, tangential and longitudinal direction). Moberg [10] and Oja and Temnerud [11] analyzed CT images to locate internal knots and resin pockets, which can be used to increase the production yield of lumber.|$|R
