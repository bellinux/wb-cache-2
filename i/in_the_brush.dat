According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E

25|$|The {{engineers}} waited {{the whole}} month of July for Wise to arrive on scene. By 19 July 1861, McDowell started {{calling for a}} balloon {{to be brought to}} the front at First Bull Run (Centreville). As Wise was not to be found, Whipple sent Lowe out to inflate his balloon and prepare to set out for Falls Church. Mary Hoehling tells of the sudden appearance of John Wise who demanded that Lowe stop his inflating of the Enterprise and let him inflate his balloon instead. Wise had legal papers upholding his purported authority. Although Wise's arrival on the scene was tardy, he did inflate his balloon and proceeded toward the battlefield. On the way the balloon became caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> and was permanently disabled. This ended Wise's bid for the position, and Lowe was at last unencumbered from taking up the task.|$|E
25|$|Grant’s gazelles are {{generally}} mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats {{seems to be}} the determinant of their diets. The Grant's gazelle's diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the browsed plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, gazelles move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat red oats and small, tough plants, which are avoided by the other ungulates. This allows the gazelles to survive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> during the dry season. Grant’s gazelles eat mainly dicotyledons during the dry season and grass in the wet season.|$|E

25|$|The band at {{the sugar}} camp was {{notified}} of the settlers' {{return to the}} cabins by a young warrior who had observed them arriving. While the settlers ate dinner, a group from the sugar camp quietly concealed themselves in the underbrush and approached Ament's cabin undetected. There were Potawatomi among the band, {{one of whom was}} a son to Chief Meommuse. The group has been named responsible for the May 21 Indian Creek massacre and the murder of a minister, Adam Payne, on the road to Ottawa. This particular group of Potawatomi was under the leadership of Mike Girty.

25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E

He revives her using water from the Holy Spring, but she will only speak the word [...] "serve" [...] ("Dienen"). Gurnemanz wonders if there is any significance to her reappearance on this special day. Looking into the forest, he sees a figure approaching, armed and in full armour. The stranger wears a helmet and the hermit cannot see who it is. Gurnemanz queries him and chides him for being armed on sanctified ground and on a holy day, but gets no response. Finally, the apparition removes the helmet and Gurnemanz recognizes the lad who shot the swan, and joyfully sees that he bears the Holy Spear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{describe}} a structured approach for user behavior recognition in an automatic prompting sys-tem that assists users with cognitive disabilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> task of <b>brushing</b> their teeth.

We classify subtasks using a Bayesian Network (BN) classifier and a Bayesian Filtering approach. We compare three variants of the BN using different observation models (IU, NaiveBayes and Holistic) with a maximum-margin classifier (multi-class SVM).

2500|$|Just before 11 on {{the night}} of August 8, 1898, Lt. Atwater thought he saw moving figures in white, {{on the edge of the}} woods 250 yards from the lighthouse.

40|$|A 3 -D, dynamic, {{non-linear}} Finite Element Model (FEM) involving {{contact is}} used to determine apparent coefficients of friction, mu, for {{the interaction between the}} bristles of a flicking brush for street sweeping and concrete.

40|$|Starter motors are {{sensitive}} for overheating. By estimating {{the temperature and}} preventing cranking in time, there is an option to avoid the dangerous temperatures. The truck manufacturer Scania CV AB proposed a master thesis that should evaluate the need of an overheating protection for the starter motor. The aim is to evaluate any positive effects of implementing an algorithm that can estimate <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> temperature instead of using the available time constrain, which allows 35 seconds of cranking with a following 2 seconds delay, allowing the crank shaft to stop before a new start attempt is allowed. To achieve high load on the starter motor and high temperature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes,</b> tests were performed under − 20 o Celsius. Initial testing on truck, under normal temperatures, showed that the batteries could not run the starter motor long enough to reach high temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes.</b> This {{is believed to be}} caused by the voltage drop between the batteries and the starter motor, causing the starter motor to run in an operating area it is not optimized for. There are several other problems which gives a higher load on the engine, for example oil viscosity, resulting in higher currents, but those are not mentioned in this report. Three different models are compared, Two State Model, Single State Model and a Time Constrained Model. Tests and verifications show that the Two State Model is superior when it comes to protecting the starter motor from overheating {{and at the same time}} maximizing the cranking time. The major difference between the Two State Model and the Single State Model are <b>the</b> cooling characteristics. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Single State Model <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> temperature drops quickly to the outside temperature while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Two State Model <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> temperature drops to a second state  temperature instead of the outside temperature. With the currently implemented time constrain it is possible to overheat the starter motor. The algorithms are optimized under cold conditions, due to problems in reaching high temperatures under warmer conditions...|$|R

Such a [...] "converging columns" [...] approach was ironically used by the British themselves in fighting the Ashanti, and is a tactic that appeared on the battlefields of Europe under Napoleon, as 'march divided, fight together' was the original raison d'etre of the division. These standardized tactics had often yielded the Ashanti victory. Scouts screened the army as it marched in its columns, then withdrew as the enemy became close. Upon the beginning of combat, the advance guard moved up in 2 or 3 lines, discharged its muskets and paused to reload. The second line would then advance to fire and reload, A third rear line would then repeat the advance – fire-reload cycle.
