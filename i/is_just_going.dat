The {{use of the word}} to indicate an underwear phenomenon has shown up in serious mainstream news media, sometimes in reference to the pop stars who made the fashion trend popular. Wayne Glowka, member of the Georgia College and State University faculty and head of the New Word Committee of the Dialect Society, said about the happening, [...] "Language <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> on its merry way, creating many new words. It's time for men to win something." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to be the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end." [...] "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spain's Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that [...] "From my point of view, Israel is wrong. [...] One thing is self defense, and the other is to launch a counter offensive consisting on a general attack in Lebanon and Gaza that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to further escalate violence in the area" [...] The Spanish Government asked also Israel to act with moderation and in proportion to these events given the need to avoid a spreading of violence, which would put the stability of the region in danger and would have as its principal victim, once again, the civilian population. Spain also called on Hezbollah to release the two Israeli soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} in musical style and composition in Love Is Dead compared to Kerli's second album's material is significant. Love Is Dead being alternative rock {{and the new}} material being {{along the lines of}} synthpop. Kerli describes herself as being very depressed during the production of Love Is Dead and that she felt [...] "scattered" [...] and describes the transition to the new sound as an attempt to [...] "make it really radio friendly without losing what people already love about [...]" [...] In response to criticism concerning her sound compared to her older sound, Kerli said she was [...] "not the same person anymore", stating [...] "Maybe I will be [...] my third album. Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. I have no idea where I'm going to go. All I know is that I'm just always going to try to grow and do my best. And whatever comes out of me <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to be a reflection of who I am at that moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005's Infinite Crisis miniseries, it was {{revealed}} that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she {{is the only one who}} still believes that the new universe <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in Infinite Crisis #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of Infinite Crisis #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words [...] "It's... not... going..." [...] as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El's, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.|$|E
