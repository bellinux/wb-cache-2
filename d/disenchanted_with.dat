Sadler rejected some Adventist teachings, such as White's status as a prophetess and the importance of Saturday as Sabbath. He retained a positive view of White and rejected allegations that she was a charlatan.|$|E

5|$|James Whale (22 July 1889– 29 May 1957) was an English film {{director}}, theater {{director and}} actor. He is best remembered for his four classic horror films: Frankenstein (1931), The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Whale also directed films in other genres, including {{what is considered}} the definitive film version of the musical Show Boat (1936).

5|$|Mill {{workers in}} England became {{increasingly}} <b>disenchanted</b> <b>with</b> improper practices by factory owners, long working hours and unsatisfactory conditions. During the early 1850s workers {{throughout the country}} began to campaign for higher wages and strikes were held in several towns and cities; brickmakers in Manchester struck in January while woollen mill operatives in the West Riding of Yorkshire went on strike two months later. Grimshaw himself {{was involved in a}} strike in Stockport, where workers were demanding a ten percent wage increase, in March 1853.|$|E

He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} interrelationships among wage dispersion, player turnover, and {{organizational}} performance using {{a sample of}} National Football League teams. We find that pay dispersion and player turnover are both negatively related to team performance, and that dispersion is positively related to turnover. We investigate whether dispersion's impact on performance is mediated by turnover and find only partial mediation; dispersion’s negative impact on performance is not solely via turnover. Pay dispersion thus has both indirect and direct effects on overall organizational performance, consistent with good collaborative employees leaving their firms and <b>disenchanted</b> employees staying <b>with,</b> and adversely affecting, their firms. 1 1...|$|R

5|$|Alcibiades, however, did {{not succeed}} in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be {{speaking}} for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. <b>Disenchanted</b> <b>with</b> Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.|$|E
5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the European Economic Community. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally <b>disenchanted</b> <b>with</b> both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In A Secular Age, Taylor {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} porous subjectivity by way of elucidating the mode of being typical of the enchanted pre-modern world, and juxtaposes it to the buffered self typical of the disenchanted modern world. The framing {{of the problem in}} this way, with the argument so clearly ori-ented as an attack on the latter position, risks a polarization that defaults to the former as the preferred option. These, though, are not our only choices. There is much to recommend Taylor’s notion of porous subjectivity as distinct from the buffered self of atomistic individualism. But Taylor associates the emergence of the <b>disenchanted</b> world <b>with</b> disengaged reason, and the existence of an en-chanted world with a deeper mode of engagement in the world. If we instead focus upon modes of engagement with the world separate from the question of enchantment, we can perhaps further our understanding of human subjectivity and relations with others.

50|$|Wilson {{published}} 15 books, {{including the}} bestsellers The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955) and A Summer Place (1958), {{both of which}} were adapted into feature movies. A later novel, A Sense of Values, in which protagonist Nathan Bond is a <b>disenchanted</b> cartoonist involved <b>with</b> adultery and alcoholism, was not well received. In Georgie Winthrop, a 45-year-old college vice president begins a relationship with the 17-year-old daughter of his childhood love. The novel The Ice Brothers is loosely based on Wilson's experiences in Greenland while serving with the US Coast Guard. The memoir What Shall We Wear to This Party? recalls his experiences in the Coast Guard during World War II and the changes to his life after the bestseller Gray Flannel was published.|$|R

It was the editing of the unusual documentary cult film, SICK: The Life & Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist and Memento which brought Dody Dorn's picture editing {{to the attention of the}} rest of the world. She has since continued to work with director Christopher Nolan on several films and has repeatedly worked with noted film director, Ridley Scott.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mitchell joined a {{community}} theater group in Ellsworth, Maine, the Ellsworth Players; he eventually became its president. He was purely a behind-the-scenes {{participant in the}} group's stage productions until 1971, when director Bill Raiten persuaded {{him to take the}} role of Tevye in a production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. His portrayal won praise, including a favorable review by playwright Samuel A. Taylor. A New York City producer who saw the show offered Mitchell a chance to play the same role in an off-Broadway production of the musical in Brooklyn. Mitchell, as the father of four children, felt committed to his financial career and declined the offer. However, he continued to act in local productions in the following years, became <b>disenchanted</b> <b>with</b> his job, and decided to pursue acting as a profession.|$|E
5|$|Jereboam Beauchamp {{was born}} in Barren County, Kentucky, in 1802. Educated {{in the school of}} Dr. Benjamin Thurston, he {{resolved}} to study law at age eighteen. While observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and Bowling Green, Beauchamp was particularly impressed with the abilities of Solomon P. Sharp. Sharp had twice been elected to the state legislature and had served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Beauchamp became <b>disenchanted</b> <b>with</b> Sharp when, in 1820, a planter's daughter named Anna Cooke claimed Sharp was the father of her child, who was stillborn. Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. The disgraced Cooke became a recluse at her mother's plantation outside Bowling Green.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel {{and placed}} in a {{floating}} drydock. It seemed she might well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler had become so <b>disenchanted</b> <b>with</b> the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.|$|E
50|$|Even {{with all}} of these successes, Carter failed to {{implement}} a national health plan or to reform the tax system, as he had promised in his campaign. Inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan later that year further <b>disenchanted</b> some Americans <b>with</b> Carter. In 1980, Carter defeated Senator Ted Kennedy to gain renomination, but lost to Ronald Reagan in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats, {{and for the first time}} since 1954, the Republicans controlled the Senate. The House, however, remained in Democratic hands. After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran. They were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.|$|R
40|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} the focus within political theory in recent decades on abstraction rather than 'reality' has left it with has nothing to say to political actors. On these grounds, some have even expressed concern regarding the disciplineâs future. As a reply to these concerns, I introduce in this thesis the scholarship and political career of the Italian philosopher Massimo Cacciari. Cacciari shares many goals with Anglophone political theorists, but neither his scholarship nor his practice have engaged in the kind of intellectual abstraction which they now find so troubling. Drawing from Cacciari's philosophy, political career, and interventions as a public intellectual, I show how his understanding of real-world conflicts and contradictions begins with a commitment to what I call his 'geophilosophy of the archipelago', which regards the foundations of human knowledge to be irreducibly plural. A commitment to irreducibly plural foundations means that philosophers and political actors must discard what Cacciari views as 'enchantment' with the possibility of ultimate or absolute resolution of all political discord. In return, however, he argues that hopeful political engagement is still possible, because political actors remain able to cope in material and semiotic terms with the complex realities they face. I suggest that serious consideration of Cacciari's example of recognising irreducible plurality, coupled <b>with</b> a <b>disenchanted</b> engagement <b>with</b> both the material and the semiotic dimensions of political life, offers a compelling alternative orientation to the world that may suggest new ways forward in political theory. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the mediated construction of citizens during an electoral campaign, a political period in which citizens are normatively expected to play a fundamental role. From a social constructionist, discursive approach, this article qualitatively explores the representation of citizens in the press in {{the coverage of the}} main Spanish newspapers (El País, El Mundo, and Abc) during the campaign for the Spanish General Election of 2008. It is understood that the media's portrayal of citizens contributes to spreading and legitimising certain discourses about citizens, about citizens' political behaviour, and also about the reasons behind citizens' political attitudes and motivations. On occasions, these discourses are based on pre-electoral polls or previous research, although many rest only on inferences about the public. The newspapers put forward a reductionistic set of ambivalent discourses naturalising uninformed voting and legitimising the vote for major parties, while sympathising, at the same time, <b>with</b> <b>disenchanted</b> voters, justifying citizens' distrust in politicians...|$|R
