5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular {{with many of the}} barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E
5|$|Many battles were fought from January to July 1499, {{and in all}} but a few minor skirmishes, the {{experienced}} Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> that even the Swabian counts considered to be more {{in the interests of the}} powerful Habsburgs than in the interest of the Holy Roman Empire proved fatal handicaps. When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, king Maximilian I had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499 in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the Eidgenossenschaft officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus de facto acknowledged it as a separate political entity.|$|E

25|$|Having left Germany and Romania {{during the}} Great War, the artists found {{themselves}} in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction {{to fight against the}} social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> against itself than challenge the status quo.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the mujahideen}} funnelled arms and {{money into the}} country which Bosnia direly needed due to a United Nations-sanctioned arms embargo restricting the import of weapons into all of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, many of the mujahideen were {{extremely}} devout Muslims of the strict Salafi sect, which contrasted sharply with the widely renowned secular society and liberal attitude Bosnian Muslims harbored. This led to friction between the mujahideen and the Bosnians. Furthermore, some mujahideen wanted to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of extermination, or use Bosnian territory {{as a base for}} terrorist operations elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The old anti-suffragist {{argument}} that only men could <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> and therefore only men deserve {{the right to}} vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation {{of tens of thousands}} of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.|$|E

Determined to defeat the forces of Light who vanquished his master, Balor, and conquer the free cities of the world, Soulblighter resurrects the Myrkridia, a race of flesh eating monsters not seen in over a thousand years. Standing against Soulblighter is Alric, the main protagonist in the first game, and now King of The Province, who must rally humanity to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> they never expected.

25|$|The {{draft of}} the L-program was in essence an update of the data {{collected}} for the Commander-in-Chief a year earlier. The S-program, that emerged {{now for the first}} time, was described as a program to develop the knowledge about nuclear weapons which required the creation of Swedish defensive doctrine without nuclear weapons, which would be adopted to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in which a nuclear strike could occur. Despite a completely different description of the purpose, the S-program included similar activities as the L-program, except it was stripped-down to around 75% of the cost. The S-program fit both the Chief's goal to acquire nuclear weapons and the Social Democratic Government's ambivalence, which the FOA under its new chief director, Martin Fehrm, had apparently realized. Thus, with such a proposition, the Government could fund almost all research activities necessary to pursue the Swedish nuclear weapons program, yet it asserted not to do so.|$|E

Relations with his sister deteriorated as the Corps tried to put her teammate Fantomex on trial for murdering a child Apocalypse, arguing that {{it was still a}} crime to kill a child for what they may become. Ironically, in the end it turned out the Goat was a future version of Jamie who had been turned evil and Betsy, who had been forced to sacrifice her emotions to win in battle, stopped the villain by killing the contemporary Jamie; she then berated Brian for leaving the choice to her. He was left bitter by the loss and estranged from his sister.|$|E

25|$|As war {{approached}} in 1939, the Fascist regime stepped up an aggressive press campaign against France claiming that Italian people were suffering in France. This {{was important to}} the alliance as both regimes mutually had claims on France, Germany on German-populated Alsace-Lorraine and Italy on Italian-populated Corsica, Nizza and Savoia. In May 1939, a formal alliance was organized. The alliance {{was known as the}} Pact of Steel, which obliged Italy to fight alongside Germany if war broke out against Germany. Mussolini felt obliged to sign the pact in spite of his own concerns that Italy could not <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in the near future. This obligation grew from his promises to Italians that he would build an empire for them and from his personal desire to not allow Hitler to become the dominant leader in Europe. Mussolini was repulsed by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact agreement where Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to partition the Second Polish Republic into German and Soviet zones for an impending invasion. The Fascist government saw this as a betrayal of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but decided to remain officially silent.|$|E
25|$|Within the army, {{organisation}} {{and theory}} had no obvious link with war planning and responsibilities overlapped. The General Staff devised deployment plans and its chief became de facto Commander-in-Chief if war began but in peace, command was vested in the commanders of the twenty army corps districts. These commanders were {{independent of the}} General Staff Chief and trained soldiers {{according to their own}} devices. The German system of government was federal and the ministries of war of the constituent states controlled the forming and equipping of units, command and promotions. The system was inherently competitive and became more so after the Waldersee period, when the possibility increased of another Volkskrieg, a war of the nation in arms, rather than the few European wars fought by small professional armies, that had occurred after 1815. Schlieffen concentrated on matters he could influence and pressed for increases {{in the size of the}} army and the adoption of new weapons. A big army would create more choices about how to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> and better weapons would make the army more formidable. Mobile heavy artillery could help make up for numerical inferiority against a Franco-Russian coalition and smash fortifications. Schlieffen tried to make the army more operationally capable so that it was better than its potential enemies and rapidly could win a decisive victory.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, {{following}} {{the shooting of}} Yvonne Fletcher, film director Michael Winner founded the Police Memorial Trust. Initially the Trust concentrated on erecting smaller monuments at the points where officers had died on duty.

Winner stated that [...] "Memorials to soldiers, sailors and airmen are commonplace, but the police <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> with no beginning and no end".|$|E

500|$|In 1876 {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not to <b>fight</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile Commandant-General refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which {{he was determined to}} do. [...] "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, [...] "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." [...] Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of [...] "volunteers" [...] under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.|$|E
