40|$|We {{can call}} any reductive account <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{that appeals to}} both safety and ability {{conditions}} a mixed account <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Examples <b>of</b> mixed accounts <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> include Pritchard’s (2012) Anti-Luck Virtue Epistemology, Kelp’s (2013) Safe-Apt account <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and Turri’s (2011) Ample belief account <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Mixed accounts <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> are motivated by well-known counterexamples to pure safety and pure ability accounts <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> It is thought that by combining both safety and ability conditions we can give an extensionally adequate reductive account <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In this paper I argue that the putative counterexamples to pure safety and pure ability accounts <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> fail to motivate mixed accounts <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> In particular, I argue that if the putative counterexamples are problematic for safety accounts they are problematic for ability accounts and vice-versa. The reason for this, I argue, is that the safety condition and ability condition should be understood as alternative expressions of the same intuition — that knowledge must come from a reliable source...|$|R

30|$|According to {{the matrix}} that is {{depicted}} in Table 1, if the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> the domain concept C 3 is increased, then the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> the domain concepts C 1, C 2 and C 4 will be increased also, {{but not in the}} same degree. According to the transformation function of the FCM the following will be happened: KL 1 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 1 (t)[*]+[*] 0.39 *p 3 *KL 1 (t)/ 100,[*]KL 2 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 2 (t)[*]+[*] 0.5 *p 3 *KL 2 (t)/ 100, and KL 4 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 4 (t)[*]+[*] 0.27 * p 3 *KL 4 (t)/ 100. In particular, if the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 is increased 100 %, then the increase <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 1, C 2 and C 4 will be 39 %, 50 % and 27 % correspondingly. While, if it is increased 50 %, then the increase <b>of</b> the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 1, C 2 and C 4 will be 19.5 %, 25 %, and 13.5 % correspondingly. Likewise, if the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> the domain concept C 4 is decreased, then the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> the domain concept C 3 will be decreased also. According to the transformation function the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 will be decreased as KL 3 (t[*]+[*] 1)[*]=[*]KL 3 (t)- 0.67 *p 4 *KL 3 (t). Specifically, if the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 4 is decreased 30 %, then the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 will be decreased 20.1 %. It is remarkable to refer that the decrease on the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> C 3 will cause decrease on the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> its related domain concepts C 1 and C 2 (C 4 will not be decreased again because this is the domain concept that causes all the changes on the <b>knowledge</b> level <b>of</b> the remains domain concepts).|$|R

40|$|Complexity and fungeability are two {{specific}} aspects <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> indivisibility.
